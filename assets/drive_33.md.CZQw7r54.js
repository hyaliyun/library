The term is also used for numerous media relations offices that are created by the U.S. military for more specific limited purposes. Public affairs offices are staffed by a combination of officers, enlisted personnel, civilian officials and contract professionals. Public Affairs offices play a key role in contingency and deployed operations. The typical Public Affairs office is led by an officer who is in charge of planning, budgeting for, executing and evaluating the effectiveness of public affairs programs, and provides public affairs advice, counsel and support for commanders and senior staff members. Duties and responsibilities The Public Affairs Officer (PAO) is responsible for developing a working relationship with reporters and other media representatives, maintaining a robust community relations program, keeping contact with other government agencies, and keeping internal and external publics informed on issues that may affect them. Known as \\"PAO's\\" for short, they are expected to coordinate with the appropriate agencies prior to contacting and releasing information to the media on conditions that might result in favorable or unfavorable public reaction, including releases and public statements involving local, regional and national news. PAOs are responsible for preparing information relative to unit participation in military operations, world events, and environmental matters through news releases, special activities, photographs, radio and television, and other informational material. They also review materials such as speeches, news articles, and radio and television shows for security policy review and integration with the objectives of the military, and determine appropriate topics. PAOs oversee the production of base newspapers, magazines, and internal information produced by enlisted Public Affairs specialists that include coordinating media visits (if possible) and writing stories to share with fellow deployed personnel as well as audiences back home, both military and civilian. They also produce speeches and act as ghost writers for commanders, often completely developing a commander's public persona. Additionally, PAOs act as a liaison with Hollywood, actively courting Film Studios through Entertainment Liaison Offices based in Los Angeles (as an example, Navy Office of Information West). This ensures the accurate representation of the United States Armed Forces through PAOs trained in understanding the needs and requirements of Film Production, as well as the complex military culture to find an acceptable arrangement that allows the production to get the necessary footage while protecting the taxpayers investment in the Armed Forces. Tyrese Gibson's character in Michael Bay's Transformers series was a perfect example of the positive results through cooperation between the United States Department of Defense and Hollywood. Bay gained access to USAF bases and assets for the film, while the Air Force was not only able to showcase sophisticated USAF aircraft in the movie, they also helped develop one of the main characters - a combat controller (1C2X1). In the United States =Training= The Public Affairs community of the United States Armed Forces consists of active duty and reserve officers, enlisted personnel, civilians and consultants to provide support for managing the flow of news and information for the military. Public Affairs Officers (PAO) and enlisted members often attend the Defense Information School (DINFOS) at Ft. Meade, Maryland prior to their first duty station and for online and instructor-led professional development coursework and advanced training throughout their careers. =Army= The United States Army's public affairs community is led by the Chief of Public Affairs. As of April 2019, the Chief of Public Affairs is U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Amy E. Hannah.http://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs/chief/ On October 1, 2018, the United States Army merged the enlisted Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) 46Q Public Affairs Specialist and 46R Public Affairs Broadcast Specialist into a single MOS, 46S Public Affairs Mass Communications Specialist. All Army enlisted public affairs Soldiers in the ranks of Private to Staff Sergeant fall under this new MOS, while those in the ranks of Sergeant First Class to Sergeant Major will remain in MOS 46Z Chief Public Affairs NCO. Army officers from the 18 primary officer branches are able to apply to join the Public Affairs Functional Area (FA46) upon being selected for promotion to 1st Lieutenant. If selected by the Voluntary Transfer Incentive Program (VTIP), officers are given the officer Functional Area code 46A. They will then serve as Public Affairs Officers at the Brigade level and higher. =Marine Corps Communication Strategy and Operations (formerly Marine Corps public affairs)= The United States Marine Corps made significant changes to the organization and naming conventions of its public affairs occupational field in 2017 and 2018. The overall goal of the changes was to enhance situational awareness and command and control for the rest of the Marine Corps while improving the Marine Corps‚Äô overall ability to exploit opportunities and maneuver in the modern information environment. In October 2017, the 43XX public affairs and 46XX combat camera occupational fields merged into a single 45XX occupational field and was designated Communication Strategy and Operations (CommStrat). In September 2018, the Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication was renamed Communication Directorate (CD). The name change was purely administrative and the mission, tasks, and organization of the office was unchanged. The Director of the CD remained a brigadier general. During this re-organization, the Communication Strategy and Operations Company became a single entity as part of the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) Information Group (MIG). The mission of the CommStrat Company is to plan and execute inform operations, to include public engagement and the acquisition, production, and dissemination of communication and other information products.https://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/wtbn/MCCMOS/FINAL%20MAGTF%20IE%20OPS%20CoE%202017-07-06.pdf?ver=2017-11-16-090225-057 Marines within the Communication Strategy and Operations community are identified by Military Occupational Specialties (MOS): Enlisted *4531 (Combat Mass Communicator) *4512 (Combat Graphics Specialist) *4541 (Combat Photographer) *4571 (Combat Videographer) *4591 (Communication Strategy and Operations Chief) *4511 (Recruiting Station Marketing and Communication Marine; this is an alternate MOS) Officer *4502 (Communication Strategy and Operations Officer) *4503 (Visual Information Officer) *4505 (Communication Strategy and Operations Planner) =Navy= The United States Navy public affairs community is led by the Chief of Naval Information (CHINFO) within the U.S. Navy Office of Information.

The sole customer was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, which ordered ten early that year for delivery in July and August. By that date, no North American locomotive builder cataloged a dedicated passenger-locomotive design; instead, all that was available were steam- generator equipped versions of freight roadswitcher designs. The railroad's F units, the backbone of its passenger fleet, were old and increasingly troublesome, and the Santa Fe needed to get some replacements in short order. GE's waiting list was shorter, and GE offered better trade-in deals for old Alcos the road wanted to get rid of. The ten units were delivered in Santa Fe's trademark Warbonnet silver and red paint scheme, but not identical in all details to previous applications. The yellow and black separation lines between the red and silver were absent, and the bodyside 'Santa Fe' lettering was large, billboard-style, in a Cooper Black typeface, instead of the smaller black serif all-caps version previously used. (That style would later be resurrected in 1989). Instead of silver trucks, frame and tanks, they were black from the factory ‚Äî and were repainted silver later. The locomotives were numbered in the 3-digit passenger series, with road numbers 350‚Äì359. Since the GE \\"U-boat\\" design had provision for a train-heating steam generator between the cab and the engine compartment, the U28CG's dimensions were identical to the U28C. There was a bulge in the hood on the left-hand side to accommodate the steam generator, which was a Vapor-Clarkson unit, skid-mounted for easy repair and replacement. An air vent and exhaust protruded from the roof, and the tanks under the locomotive were split between fuel and water with an internal division and two refilling spouts. Further Santa Fe passenger locomotives were custom-ordered cowl units from both GE (the U30CG) and GM-EMD (the FP45). After the derailment of a U30CG on February 9, 1969, however, both GE designs were suspect; after a series of tests, the Santa Fe withdrew them from passenger service and reassigned them to freight duties. Shortly afterward, the units were renumbered into the freight series as 7900‚Äì7909 and assigned to the road's Argentine shops in Kansas. The ten locomotives were repainted into freight colors over time, the early repaints into Santa Fe's old blue and yellow freight scheme, the later repaints into blue and yellow Warbonnet. With a split water and fuel underbody tank, the U28CGs had a short range, and were used on secondary trains until the tanks were modified to carry fuel only. The steam generators were removed, and on some units the openings in the roof were closed up. Gearing was changed from 77:26 passenger gearing to 74:18 for freight service, which was the same as Santa Fe's U33Cs and U36Cs. During the 1970s, the U28CGs and U30CGs were commonly seen on Colorado freight service and other secondary assignments. They were withdrawn on September 22, 1980 and traded in to GE for new B36-7 locomotives. None survive. References External links * Sarberenyi, Robert.

History Grace-St. Paul's parish is the realization of parishioners from two congregations, Grace in East Trenton and St. Paul's in South Trenton. Both congregations began as missions of St. Michael's Church which provided financial support and the properties on which each congregation built its church. St. Paul's was organized in 1847 and became a parish in 1901. Grace began as a mission in 1875 and in 1896 became a parish. Suburban expansion provided the impetus for Grace to create new possibilities for ministry by deciding to relocate to Mercerville in 1946. During the transition period (October 1946 to November 1947) worship was held jointly with St. Paul's. From August 1947 to November 1949 worship was held at the Mercerville Firehouse. The church and parish hall were completed in November 1949. The parish hall was dedicated November 17 of that year to the memory of the first rector of Grace, the Rev. Milton A. Craft, whose devotion and leadership (1893 to 1935) forged a spiritual direction for many years and also made possible the establishment of two mission churches: St. Andrew's (1895) near Lawrence Township and St. Luke's (1913) in Ewing Township. In The rectory was built in 1952. The congregations of both St. Paul's and Grace agreed to merge in 1955, and the present church was built. A 1600-pound bell in the tower of St. Paul's was removed and placed in the inner courtyard of the church complex.

It is considered that Tennyson wrote it in elegy; the narrator uses an extended metaphor to compare death with crossing the \\"sandbar\\" between the river of life, with its outgoing \\"flood\\", and the ocean that lies beyond [death], the \\"boundless deep\\", to which we return. Overview Tennyson is believed to have written the poem (after suffering a serious illness) while on the sea, crossing the Solent from Aldworth to Farringford on the Isle of Wight. Separately, it has been suggested he may have written it on a yacht anchored in Salcombe, where there is a moaning sandbar. \\"The words\\", he said, \\"came in a moment\\".Hill, Robert W., Jr., ed. (1971). Tennyson's poetry; authoritative texts, juvenilia and early responses, criticism. New York:W. W. Norton & Company. . Shortly before he died, Tennyson told his son Hallam to \\"put 'Crossing the Bar' at the end of all editions of my poems\\". The poem contains four stanzas that generally alternate between long and short lines. Tennyson employs a traditional ABAB rhyme scheme. Scholars have noted that the form of the poem follows the content: the wavelike quality of the long-then-short lines parallels the narrative thread of the poem. The extended metaphor of \\"crossing the bar\\" represents travelling serenely and securely from life through death. The Pilot is a metaphor for God, whom the speaker hopes to meet face to face. Tennyson explained, \\"The Pilot has been on board all the while, but in the dark I have not seen him‚Ä¶[He is] that Divine and Unseen Who is always guiding us.\\" The words were set to music in April 1890 as a song for high voice and piano by Charles_Villiers_Stanford and as a hymn, 'Freshwater', for four-part chorus by Sir Hubert Parry (publ. 1893). Other settings include those by Sir Joseph Barnby, Geoffrey Shaw, Dr. George Hewson (organist at St Patrick's Cathedral Dublin), Charles Ives,Music of Charles Ives - Compositions - VI Works for Choral Ensembles A: Sacred Works. Charles Ives Society. Gwyneth Van Anden Walker, and John Philip Sousa, popularly known as the USA's \\"March King\\". In 2014, Ian Assersohn wrote a new setting of the words for male voices. Assersohn's piece \\"Crossing the Bar\\" won the Composers' Competition at the Cornwall International Male Voice Choir Festival, from a field of 40 entries. Assersohn is the Musical Director of Epsom Male Voice Choir, and the choir sang the world premi√®re of \\"Crossing the Bar\\" in Truro Cathedral at the Festival Opening International Gala Concert on Thursday 30 April 2015. In August 2018, the writer V. S. Naipaul died after reading \\"Crossing the Bar\\" on his deathbed in London; his family and friends citing the poem as having always held a great resonance to him. Text Sunset and evening star, And one clear call for me! And may there be no moaning of the bar, When I put out to sea, But such a tide as moving seems asleep, Too full for sound and foam, When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell, And after that the dark! And may there be no sadness of farewell, When I embark; For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far, I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar.

Jain architecture is essentially restricted to temples and monasteries, and secular Jain buildings generally reflect the prevailing style of the place and time they were built. Jain temple architecture is generally close to Hindu temple architecture, and in ancient times Buddhist architecture. Normally the same builders and carvers worked for all religions, and regional and period styles are generally similar. For over 1,000 years the basic layout of a Hindu or most Jain temples has consisted of a small garbhagriha or sanctuary for the main murti or cult images, over which the high superstructure rises, then one or more larger mandapa halls. MƒÅru- Gurjara architecture or the \\"Solanki style\\" is, a particular temple style from Gujarat and Rajasthan (both regions with a strong Jain presence) that originated in both Hindu and Jain temples around 1000, but became enduringly popular with Jain patrons. It has remained in use, in somewhat modified form, to the present day, indeed also becoming popular again for some Hindu temples in the last century. The style is seen in the groups of pilgrimage temples at Dilwara on Mount Abu, Taranga, Girnar and Palitana.Hegewald Terms Derasar is a word used for a Jain temple in Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. Basadi is a Jain shrine or temple in Karnataka. The word is generally used in South India. Its historical use in North India is preserved in the names of the Vimala Vasahi and Luna Vasahi temples of Mount Abu. The Sanskrit word is vasati, it implies an institution including residences of scholars attached to the shrine. Temples may be divided into Shikar-bandhi Jain temples, public dedicated temple buildings, normally with a high superstructure, typically a north Indian shikhara tower above the shrine) and the Ghar Jain temple, a private Jain house shrine. A Jain temple which is known as a pilgrimage centre is often termed a Tirtha. The main image of a Jain temple is known as a mula nayak.Jaina Iconography, Volume 1 of Jaina-r≈´pa-ma·πá·∏çana, Umakant Premanand Shah, Abhinav Publications, 1987, p. 149 A Manastambha (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. It has four 'Moortis' i.e. stone figures of the main god of that temple. One facing each direction: North, East, South and West.http://www.pluralism.org/religion/jainism/introduction/tirthankaras Architecture Jain Tirtha, Shravanabelagola, with the colossal Gommateshwara statue. Jain temples are built with various architectural designs.Jain temples in India and around the world, Laxmi Mall Singhvi, Tarun Chopra, Himalayan Books, 2002 The earliest survivals of Jain architecture are part of the Indian rock-cut architecture tradition, initially shared with Buddhism, and by the end of the classical period with Hinduism. Very often numbers of rock-cut Jain temples and monasteries share a site with those of the other religions, as at Udayagiri, Bava Pyara, Ellora, Aihole, Badami, and Kalugumalai. The Ellora Caves are a late site, which contains temples of all three religions, as the earlier Buddhist ones give way to later Hindu excavations. There is considerable similarity between the styles of the different religions, but often the Jains placed large figures of one or more of the 24 tirthankaras in the open air rather than inside the shrine. These statues later began to be very large, normally standing nude figures in the kayotsarga meditation position (which is similar to standing at attention). Examples include the Gopachal rock cut Jain monuments and the Siddhachal Caves, with groups of statues, and a number of single figures including the 12th-century Gommateshwara statue, and the modern Statue of Vasupujya and, largest of all at 108 feet (32.9 meters) tall, the Statue of Ahimsa. In recent times, the use of murti images has become controversial within Jainism, and some smaller sects reject them entirely, while others are selective in terms of which figures they allow images of. In sects which largely disapprove of images, the religious buildings are far more simple. Following the regional styles in Hindu temples, Jain temples in North India generally use the north Indian nagara style, while those in South India use the dravida style, although the north Indian MƒÅru-Gurjara style or Solanki style has made some inroads in the south over the last century or so. For example, the Mel Sithamur Jain Math in Tamil Nadu has a large gopuram tower, similar to those of local Hindu temples. Temple interior, Dilwara Characteristics of the original MƒÅru-Gurjara style are \\"the external walls of the temples have been structured by increasing numbers of projections and recesses, accommodating sharply carved statues in niches. These are normally positioned in superimposed registers, above the lower bands of mouldings. The latter display continuous lines of horse riders, elephants, and kƒ´rttimukhas. Hardly any segment of the surface is left unadorned.\\" The main shikhara tower usually has many urushringa subsidiary spirelets on it, and two smaller side-entrances with porches are common in larger temples.Hegewald Later, with Dilwara in the lead, surrounding the main temple with a curtain of devakulikƒÅ shrines, each with a small spire became a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India, still employed in some modern temples. These are fairly plain on the outer walls, and often raised on a very high platform, so that the outside of larger temples can resemble a fortress with high walls.Harle, 228 However the entrance(s), often up high, wide steps, are not designed for actual defence, even though medieval Muslim armies and others destroyed many Jain temples in the past, often permanently. Inside the temple, the MƒÅru-Gurjara style features extremely lavish carving, especially on columns, large and intricately carved rosettes on the ceilings of mandapas, and a characteristic form of \\"flying arch\\" between columns, which has no structural role, and is purely decorative. Most early temples in the style are in various local shades of pink, buff or brown sandstone, but the Dilwara temples are in a very pure white marble which lightens the style and has become considered very desirable. While, before British India, large Buddhist or Hindu temples (and indeed Muslim mosques) have very often been built with funds from a ruler, this was infrequently the case with Jain temples. Instead they were typically funded by wealthy Jain individuals or families. For this reason, and often the smaller numbers of Jains in the population, Jain temples tend to be at the small or middle end of the range of sizes, but at pilgrimage sites they may cluster in large groups - there are altogether several hundred at Palitana, tightly packed within several high-walled compounds called \\"tuks\\" or \\"tonks\\".\\"Temple-cities\\"; see also Mitchell (1990) by sites Temple charitable trusts, such as the very large Anandji Kalyanji Trust, founded in the 17th century and now maintaining 1,200 temples, play a very important role in funding temple building and maintenance. Etiquette There are some guidelines to follow when one is visiting a Jain temple:CultureShock! India: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette, Gitanjali Kolanad, Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008 p. 45 *Before entering the temple, one should bathe and wear fresh washed clothes or some special puja (worship) clothes ‚Äì while wearing these one must neither have eaten anything nor visited the washroom. However, drinking of water is permitted. *One should not take any footwear (including socks) inside the temple. Leather items like a belt, purse etc. are not allowed inside the temple premises. *One should not be chewing any edibles (food, gum, mints, etc.), and no edibles should be stuck in the mouth. * One should try to keep as silent as possible inside temple. * Mobile phones should not be used in the temple. One should keep them switched off. Prevailing traditional customs should be followed regarding worshipping at the temple and touching an idol. They can vary depending on the region and the specific sect.

The GOP is a collection of successive pictures within a coded video stream. Each coded video stream consists of successive GOPs, from which the visible frames are generated. Encountering a new GOP in a compressed video stream means that the decoder doesn't need any previous frames in order to decode the next ones, and allows fast seeking through the video.  Description  A GOP can contain the following picture types: * I picture or I frame (intra coded picture, also called keyframe or i-framehttps://blog.video.ibm.com/streaming-video- tips/keyframes-interframe-video-compression/#keyframe) ‚Äì a picture that is coded independently of all other pictures. Each GOP begins (in decoding order) with this type of picture. * P picture or P frame (predictive coded picture) ‚Äì contains motion-compensated difference information relative to previously decoded pictures. In older designs such as MPEG-1, H.262/MPEG-2 and H.263, each P picture can only reference one picture, and that picture must precede the P picture in display order as well as in decoding order and must be an I or P picture. These constraints do not apply in the newer standards H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC. * B picture or B frame (bipredictive coded picture) ‚Äì contains motion-compensated difference information relative to previously decoded pictures. In older designs such as MPEG-1 and H.262/MPEG-2, each B picture can only reference two pictures, the one which precedes the B picture in display order and the one which follows, and all referenced pictures must be I or P pictures. These constraints do not apply in newer standards H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC. * D picture or D frame (DC direct coded picture) ‚Äì serves as a fast-access representation of a picture for loss robustness or fast-forward. D pictures are only used in MPEG-1 video. An I frame indicates the beginning of a GOP. Afterwards several P and B frames follow. In older designs, the allowed ordering and referencing structure is relatively constrained.http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/Multimedia/node258.html The I frames contain the full image and do not require any additional information to reconstruct them. Typically, encoders use GOP structures that cause each I frame to be a \\"clean random access point,\\" such that decoding can start cleanly on an I frame and any errors within the GOP structure are corrected after processing a correct I frame. In the newer designs found in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and HEVC, encoders have much more flexibility about referencing structures. They can use the same referencing structures as were previously used in older designs, or they can use more pictures as references and they can use more flexible ordering of the coding order relative to the display order. They are also allowed to use B pictures as references when coding other (B or P) pictures. This extra flexibility can improve compression efficiency, but it can cause propagation of errors if some data becomes lost or corrupted. One popular structure for use with the newer designs is the use of a hierarchy of B pictures. Hierarchical B pictures can provide very good compression efficiency and can also limit the propagation of errors, since the hierarchy can ensure that the number of pictures affected by any data corruption problem is strictly limited. Generally, the more I frames the video stream has, the more editable it is. However, having more I frames substantially increases bit rate needed to code the video.  GOP Structure  The GOP structure is often referred by two numbers, for example, M=3, N=12. The first number tells the distance between two anchor frames (I or P). The second one tells the distance between two full images (I-frames): it is the GOP size.https://help.apple.com/compressor/mac/4.0/en/compressor/usermanual/#chapter=18%26section=5 For the example M=3, N=12, the GOP structure is IBBPBBPBBPBBI. Instead of the M parameter the maximal count of B-frames between two consecutive anchor frames can be used.

He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in February 2001 for war crimes committed against the Bosniak population during the 1992‚Äì94 Bosniak- Croat war, and was released in June 2014 after having served two thirds of his sentence. Early life Kordiƒá was born on 14 December 1960 in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia). He studied political science at the University of Sarajevo and then went into journalism working for the Vatrostalac factory newspaper in Busovaƒça. Although born in Sarajevo, he lived mostly in Busovaƒça. He has three children, a son and two daughters. Bosnian War On 12 November 1991, Mate Boban and Kordiƒá held the Joint Meeting of the Crisis Staffs of Herzegovina and Travnik Regional Communities. The two communities decided that Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina should institute a policy to bring about \\"our age-old dream, a common Croatian State\\" and should call for a proclamation of a Croatian banovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the \\"initial phase leading towards the final solution of the Croatian question and the creation of sovereign Croatia within its ethnic and historical borders\\". On 27 December 1991 there was a meeting in Zagreb, chaired by President Franjo Tuƒëman, of the leadership of the Croatian HDZ and of the HDZ- BiH. The purpose was, first, to discuss the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the differences of opinion on this topic in the HDZ-BiH party; secondly, to formulate an overall Croatian political strategy. Stjepan Kljuiƒá set out his position in favour of the Croats remaining within Bosnia and Herzegovina but Boban said that, should Bosnia and Herzegovina disintegrate, the HZ H-B would be proclaimed as independent Croatian territory ‚Äúwhich will accede to the State of Croatia but only at such time as the Croatian leadership [...] should decide‚Äù. Kordiƒá said the Croatian spirit in the HZ H-B had grown stronger in the 40 days since the declaration of the HZ H-B, the Croatian people of the Travnik region were ready to accede to the Croatian state \\"at all costs [...] any other option would be considered treason, save the clear demarcation of Croatian soil in the territory of Herceg Bosna\\". On 16 January 1992 a rally was held in the municipal hall in Busovaƒça to celebrate Croatian independence, a video recording of which was shown to the Trial Chamber. Kordiƒá was seen speaking to a cheering, flag-waving crowd. He said that the rally was proof that the Croatian people in Busovaƒça are part of the united Croatian nation and that the HZ H-B, including Busovaƒça, is \\"Croatian land and that is how it will be\\". Secretary of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia Ignac Ko≈°troman spoke and said: ‚Äúwe will be an integral part of our dear State of Croatia by hook or by crook‚Äù. The speeches were met with yells of \\"Dario, Dario\\". The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) was one of the principal political parties in Croatia. One of its main aims was to ensure an ‚Äúentire Croatian Nation to within its historical and natural boundaries‚Äù. The Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ-BiH) was one of the principal political parties of the Bosnian Croatians in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and amongst the avowed aims of the HDZ-BiH figured the statement on the right of the Croats to defend themselves and to secede. The Croatian Republic of Herzeg- Bosnia (HZ H-B/HR H-B) proclaimed its existence in November 1991, defining itself as a separate or distinct entity within the territory of Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) became the executive, administrative and supreme military organ of the HZ H-B/HR H-B after its creation in April 1992. Although he was not at the top of the political hierarchy, and was a civilian unused to the official command structure of the HVO, Kordiƒá made many political and strategic decisions; he negotiated cease fire agreements and, he issued orders of direct and indirect military significance. Kordiƒá played a key role in the planning, organisation, promotion and implementation of a politico-military campaign of persecution and ‚Äúethnic cleansing‚Äù against the Bosnian Muslims, especially in the La≈°va Valley (attack and massacres in Ahmiƒái and other villages in the valley in April 1993), as well as in Zenica.Profile , trial-ch.org; accessed 15 January 2016. War crimes Kordiƒá, like many of the Herzeg-Bosnia leadership and military commanders, was accused of war crimes committed on the Bosniak population. On 6 October 1997, he voluntarily surrendered to the tribunal and on 8 October, pleaded not guilty. He was accused by the Hague for his role in the La≈°va Valley massacre, including Ahmiƒái, where HVO forces committed crimes against the local Bosniak population under his command. There were also reports that HVO soldiers, under his command, committed atrocities in and around Zenica. On 26 February 2001, Kordiƒá was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Based on his individual criminal responsibility (Art. 7 ¬ß 1 ICTY Statute) he was indicted on the following counts: * Serious violations of the Geneva Conventions (Art. 2 ICTY Statute: willful murder; inhumane treatment, illegal detention of civilians); * Violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute: unlawful attack on civilians, the unlawful attack against civilian targets; destruction without justifiable military cause; deliberate destruction or damage to buildings dedicated to religion or education); * Crimes against humanity (Art. 5 ICTY Statute: persecutions for political or religious reasons; murder; inhumane acts; imprisonment). In June 2006, he was transferred to a prison in Austria to serve the remainder of his sentence there. In May 2010, his application for early release after having served half of his sentence was denied on grounds of the seriousness of the crimes committed and three disciplinary breaches while in prison. However, on 21 May 2014, Kordiƒá was granted early release, effective 6 June 2014. ƒåerkez had been sentenced to six years imprisonment, and, having served more than that amount of time in detention, was released for time served.

His works show particular influence from the musics of South and Southeast Asia, particularly the gamelan music of Java. He was among the second generation of American composers to create and promote new compositions for gamelan. Education McDermott was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He received a B.F.A. in music composition from the University of Pennsylvania (1959), an M.A. in music history from the University of California, Berkeley (1961), and a Ph.D. in music history, theory, and composition from the University of Pennsylvania (1966). His composition instructors included Constant Vauclain, George Rochberg, Darius Milhaud, and Karlheinz Stockhausen . In 1980, McDermott became friends with Lou Harrison, the godfather of American gamelan. It was Harrison who encouraged McDermott to start composing for gamelan. McDermott first encountered gamelan circa 1965 in Amsterdam. He later studied Javanese gamelan in Indonesia at the Akademi Seni Karawitan Indonesia (now Sekolah Tinggi Seni Indonesia Surakarta) in Central Java (1971, 1978, and 1984). He studied or worked in Surakarta with Sumarsam and Rahayu Supanggah, and later, in the United States, with Pak Cokro and Midiyanto. In the 1970s he made an intensive study of Hindustani classical music, studying with sitarist Ira Das Gupta, and with renowned tabla player Zakir Hussain. He died in Sumatra, Indonesia, on February 10, 2016. Compositions Many of McDermott's works are for standard Western ensembles (e.g. chamber, orchestral, choral, solo, and electronic). In 1969 he began to incorporate sounds and ideas from North Indian music. In 1980 Lou Harrison encouraged McDermott to begin composing for gamelan. He then composed a number of works for gamelan (some in combination with Western instruments), and presented gamelan workshops in several Asian nations (including Malaysia and Japan), focusing primarily on encouraging new compositions for gamelan. He received several Fulbright grants and National Endowment for the Arts commissions and a \\"Master's Award\\" from the Oregon Arts Commission. McDermott's compositions have been performed in North America, Europe, and Asia. From the earliest period he was drawn to cross-cultural works, multimedia, and theatrical music. Two of his operas, The King of Bali and Mata Hari, juxtapose gamelan and Western ensembles. Both were written and performed in the U.S. with English texts in the 1990s, and in this century were translated into Indonesian and performed in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. McDermott's musical style varied. His generation witnessed the onset of a wealth of new styles, and in his early days he tried his hand at many of them. By and by he eschewed the poles of abstract atonality and indeterminacy that were much in favor in the 1960s and 1970s, turning instead to modality, melody, and counterpoint. His compositional goals are expressivity, depth, and spirituality, yet often with a light heart. In Asia, he advised young composers to borrow from Western traditions, saying it will help them speak to international audiences, but he insisted that the soul of their music as well as many of its techniques must come from their own soil. Teaching McDermott taught at the Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Virginia (1966‚Äì67) and at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he served for a time as dean and director (1967‚Äì1977). In 1977 he began teaching at Lewis & Clark College in Oregon; he retired in December 1997. While there he began the college's world music program and in 1980 founded its first gamelan, Venerable Showers of Beauty, which was purchased in Java with the help of Rahayu Supanggah and Nyonya Nora along with an American patron, Loraine Fenwick. He directed the gamelan and later invited Javanese musicians to teach (including Midiyanto, Supardi, and Darsono). He also instituted classes in Indian and African music performance with Nisha Joshi and Obo Addy. He later helped to establish gamelan programs at the College of William and Mary and the University of Puget Sound. Among his composition students at Lewis and Clark College were Greg Bowers, Erika Foin, Hoe Yeong KIm, Duncan Nielson, Myrna Schloss, and Sophia Serghi. After retirement, McDermott was a Visiting Professor at The College of William and Mary (2002); Indonesian Institute of the Arts (2002‚Äì03); University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur (2006); Osaka City University (2005); and University of Technology (MARA), Shah Alam, Malaysia (2009). The last four placements were assisted by Fulbright programs. During his last years, McDermott divided his time between the United States and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. In Yogyakarta, he directed an ensemble called Musica Teatrica Nova.

Born in Long Beach, California, her dream as a little girl was to be an actress. An acting coach advised her taking ballet classes, seeing as she was incredibly dramatic (and clumsy). So she started dancing at the age of 10, to \\"develop poise\\". She came to New York at the age of 13 on a Ford Foundation summer scholarship to attend the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet. She moved permanently to New York at age 15, again on a Ford Foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Watts joined the New York City Ballet in 1970 and was promoted to principal dancer by company founder George Balanchine in 1979. Balanchine took Watts into his companies \\"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\\" During Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Balanchine gave Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including Agon, Concerto Barocco, Apollo, Symphony in C, Theme and Variations and Serenade. Watts performed around the world and starred in numerous Dance in America television programs, and she performed opposite frequent partner Mikhail Baryshnikov at the White House in a national televised performance of Balanchine's Rubies for President and Mrs. Carter. Watts retired from the stage in a gala performance at Lincoln Center in 1995. She married fellow New York City Ballet Principal Damian Woetzel in 1999. In addition to her dancing career, Watts was director of the New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs from 1982 to 1994, where she administered a ballet school for gifted children. Watts has directed many national and international dance touring companies, including a tour entitled \\"Homage a Balanchine\\" of 108 cities for Columbia Artists, and she has rehearsed and staged ballets around the world. She has also designed costumes for new ballets at the New York City Ballet, as well as for Off-Broadway productions.

WS-1  SCAIC began to develop an unguided large-calibre multiple launch rocket system for the PLA ground forces in the late 1980s. The resulting Weishi-1 (WS-1) 302 mm, 4-tube multiple rocket system was first tested in 1990. However, the weapon system failed to impress the PLA, and no production order was received. The ground equipment of the WS-1 comprises: a rocket launch truck, a transport and loading truck and a firing command truck. A WS-1 rocket battalion is equipped with: *DZ-88B firing command truck (4 men): 1; *MF-4 rocket launch truck (3 men): 6~9; *QY-88 transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9; *High-altitude meteorological radar (3 men): 1; *Rockets per launch truck: 40~60 ; Khaibar-1 could be based on Weishi Rockets. = WS-1B = SCAIC continued the WS-1 development in the 1990s and introduced the improved WS-1B in the late 1990s. The WS-1B mainly targeted foreign customers and was actively marketed by Beijing-based China National Precision Machinery Corporation (CPMIEC). Compared to the WS-1, the WS-1B features an increased range of 180 km. A WS-1B rocket battalion is equipped with: *DZ-4B firing command truck (5 men): 1; *HF-4B rocket launch truck (3 men): 6~9; *QY-4B transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9; *Type 702 high-altitude meteorological radar (3 men): 1; *Rockets per launch truck: 40~60; = WS-1E = The WS-1E is the 122 mm multiple rocket system developed by SCAIC as a successor to the PLA's current Type 81 122 mm rocket system. It is similar to the Type 90 122 mm rocket system and did not enter production. A WS-1E rocket battalion is equipped with: *DZ-88B firing command truck (5 men): 1; *MF-40 rocket launch truck (3 men): 6; *Rockets per launch truck: 120~160; = WS-1F = Little is known except that range reaches . = T-300 Kasƒ±rga = 300 mm rocket for T-300 Turkish T-300 Kasƒ±rga. The Turkish missile system, T-300 Kasirga MBRL (also called TRG-300) is based on Chinese WS-1B (Wei Shi; Guardian), with some modifications on the design with launcher very similar to the WS-1B's launcher. In Turkish land forces service, the 302 mm T-300 Kasirga MBRL system provides long range fire support The T-300 Kasirga MBRLS consists of two key parts: The launcher system (T-300) and the rocket, TR-300. The T-300 MBRL is based on the German MAN (6√ó6) 26.372 10t cross-country truck chassis. Combat weight, complete with four rockets, is 23t. This MAN (6√ó6) also serves as T-122 launch platform for Turkish land forces command. F-302T, the launcher vehicle's cabin windows are provided with shutters which are lowered before the rockets are launched. *TR300S:Unguided, range: 36‚Äì65 km *TR300E:Unguided, range: 65‚Äì100 km *TR300K: Guided, range: 30‚Äì120 km  WS-2  During the 2004 Zhuhai Air Show, SCAIC revealed its latest WS-2 multiple launch rocket system. The weapon is fitted with 6 box- shape launchers and fires 400 mm rockets to a maximum range of 200 km, however some sources claim that it might be up to 350 km. This enables the PLA to strike the west coast of Taiwan, including the capital Taipei. It is speculated that WS-2 is going to be a cheaper alternative to the expensive short range ballistic missiles in Chinese inventory. The WS-2 is fitted with a simple cascade inertial terminal guidance to compensate for the degraded accuracy caused by the long distance flight of the rocket. In 2008, it was revealed that sub-munitions are developed for WS-2, including a specialized anti-radar version, which is a rocket containing three UAVs. Once the rocket is fired to the target area, the UAVs are released the same way like other sub-munitions. The seekers would seek out target radar signals as UAVs began to cruise, and once locked on to the radar, UAV would home in and attack. Some domestic Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed such technology was based on the principle of Israeli Harpy anti-radar UAVs, but this could not be confirmed by independent sources outside China. A WS-1E and WS-2 rocket battalion shared the same equipment and is armed with: *Firing command truck (5 men): 1; *Rocket launch truck (3 men): 6; *Transport and loading truck (3 men): 6~9; *Rockets per launch truck: 30~48; *Preparation time (from traveling to firing) < 12 minutes *Firing density: better than 1/600 m *Accuracy: better than 0.3% = WS-2B = Upgraded version with 200 km range. = WS-2C = Upgraded version with GPS guidance and 350 km range. It also features passive homing guidance. = WS-2D = Upgraded version with GPS guidance and 400 km range and ability to launch lethal unmanned aerial vehicles.https://www.armyrecognition.com/china_artillery_vehicles_and_weapon_systems_uk/ws-2_guided_mlrs_mglrs_multiple_launch_rocket_system_data_sheet_specifications_pictures_video.html  WS-3  Built by China Aerospace Long-March International Trade (Alit) ‚Äì a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) ‚Äì the WS-3 features 6 rectangular missile containers for 406 mm rockets, it has simple cascade inertial terminal guidance and has a range of 70-200 km. = WS-3A = Also built by ALIT, the WS-3A is an upgraded version of the WS-3 with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance updated by civilian GPS/GLONASS, but can be upgraded to military GPS/GLONASS upon customer's request. = WS-3 ASW missile = WS-3 ASW Rocket is a modified WS-3A carrying rocket assisted anti-submarine (ASW) torpedo, which is developed by Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of China Poly Group Corporation. Payload of the rocket is a light-weight ASW torpedo and the range is up to 100 km. Target info obtained by other ASW platforms including satellite, aircraft, surface ships, submarines, coastal and sea floor sonar stations, and is passed to the launch/storage/command/control vehicle, which in turn, fires the missile in the latest contact point. As the torpedo is separated from the rocket and enters water, it seeks out and destroys target.  WS-6  Lighter version of unguided 122 mm PR50 MLS, with number of tubes reduced by 60% to 40 from the original 100 of PR50 MLS. This is a more compact version of PR50 with reduction of weight for rapid deployment.  WS-15  WS-15 MRL is a shorter range version with 40 km range, equipped with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance.  WS-22  Weishi WS-22 of Bangladesh Army WS-22 is a guided version of 122 mm PR50 MLS with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance, with standard range of 45 km.  WS-32  Features two containers of five 300 mm tubes each on a 8X8 truck. Missile is 7.5 m and can carry a 170 kg warhead over 150 km with 30 m CEP accuracy.  WS-33  Missile seems to be an adaptation of a Chinese anti-ship missile for ground attack roles. It is 3.3 m long, 200 kg and 200 mm caliber, can hit targets 70 km away.  WS-35  Development of WS-1 series of 150 km range with civilian GPS/GLONASS satellite guidance update, but can be upgrade to military GPS/GLONASS upon customer's request.  WS-43  The WS-43 cruise missile, also called loitering munition, has 200 mm caliber, 60 km range, 10 m CEP accuracy, with 30 minutes loitering time and uses a 20 kg warhead.  WS-63  Surface to surface missile, 7.4 m long and 300 mm caliber, capable of hitting targets 260 km away with different types of 150 kg warheads. Inertial/satellite guidance plus radar terminal guidance.  WS-64  WS-64 is an anti-ship missile, in different versions, with a ranges from 120 to 280 km, likely based on the HQ-16, launched by the Weishi MLRS system. CEP is 30 m when using satnav, 10 when using active radar guidance. It was revealed at the 2014 Zhuhai Air Show by CASC  WS-400  Anti-submarine missile.  WS-600L  New short-range ballistic missile developed by CASC, with a range of 290 km and a CEP of less than 10 meters.  A100  Development of WS-1 series with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance. Using standard munitions, the range is 40 ‚Äì 80 km, and when using extended range rounds, the range is increased to 60 ‚Äì 120 km. The 10-tube launchers contained 2 5-round launching boxes arranged in 2 rows, 2 on top, and 3 at the bottom.  A200  Development of A100 with simple cascade inertial terminal guidance updated by GPS. The arrangement of A200 is different from A100 in that each launching box consists of three rows of launching tubes, three on the top and bottom respectively, and two in the middle. A200 rockets also have additional forward control surfaces that were not present on A100 rockets.  A300  Development of A200, 2 pods with four 300-mm rockets each, with a range of 290 km and integrated GNSS/INS guidance. 30 to 45 m circular error probable (CEP).  SR-5  SR-5 MRL is a self- propelled MLS by Norinco which first made its public debut in 2012 Eurosatory, similar to the HIMARS. SR-5 is a fully computerized and digitized system with modular design concept to enable both the 122 mm rocket series and 220 mm rocket series to be adopted on a single chassis, using the same fire control and support systems, hence greatly reduces the operational cost.SR-5 Retrieved 2017-11-29. Can fire satellite guided rockets with ranges of up to 70 km, the King Dragon 300 ballistic missile, and also C-705 cruise missiles. The SR-5 has been exported to Algeria, Bahrain, Venezuela and Thailand. = SR-7 = The SR-7 is a scaled-down variant, with either one pod of twenty 122 mm rockets or six 220 mm rockets. The maximum range is 50 km for the 122 mm rocket and 70 km for the 220 mm rocket.  SY-300  SY-300 is a development of WS-2/3, with SY standing for Shen Ying (Á•ûÈπ∞ meaning Divine Eagle), designed after the 4th Academy and the 9th Academy of CASC were merged to form a new 4th Academy. The main difference between the SY300 and its WS-2/3 predecessor is that for WS-2/3, the control section of the forward control surfaces and the warhead are integrated into a single unit, but they are separated in SY-300. This design difference enables the guidance system of SY300 to be rapidly changed in the field by soldiers, by simply replacing the guidance system with a dummy weight, when SY-300 needs to be used as an unguided rocket. Each vehicle can carry either six or twelve SY300 rockets.  SY-400  SY-400 is a further development of SY-300, that can carry either two short- range ballistic missiles BP-12A with range of 400 km or twelve 300 mm PHL-03 rockets. As a low cost alternative to more expensive ballistic missiles, the accuracy of SY400 is increased by adding GPS to correct the cascade inertial navigational guidance, and according to the developer, the accuracy can be further improved if military grade GPS signals are used to replacing the existing civilian GPS signal. Another feature of SY-400 is that it shares the same launching vehicle and fire control system of BP-12A ballistic missile, thus simplifying logistics. As in 2020 Myanmar bought undisclosed number of SY-400 system In 2017 Qatar bought SY-400. = CM-400AKG = The CM-400AKG is an air-launched derivative of the SY-400 tactical ballistic missile developed by the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation. The CM-400AKG is advertised as having a 5.1 m. length, a 400 mm. diameter, a mass of 910 kg., a range of 100‚Äì240 km., and capable of carrying either a 150 kg. blast warhead or 200 kg. penetration warhead. It has a high cruise altitude and a steep terminal dive, with a maximum terminal speed of Mach 4.5-5. Seeker options include \\"INS + GNSS + Passive Radar Seeker,\\" potentially for anti-ship with a circular error probable (CEP) of 5 m., and \\"INS-GNSS+IR/TV Seeker\\", with a CEP of 5‚Äì10 m. Pakistani air force officials described the missile as \\"an aircraft carrier killer.\\" The CM-400AKG was unveiled at the 2012 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, where it was claimed to have entered service on Pakistan Air Force CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunders. At the 2013 Dubai Airshow, a Pakistani military source claimed the missile was in Chinese service, and that an anti-ship version was in development. In 2014, a PAF JF-17 was spotted carrying two ‚Äì possibly mock-up ‚Äì CM-400AKGs, suggesting the missile was still in development. At the 2013 Paris Air Show, F√°brica Argentina de Aviones officials revealed the missile's performance was a major reason for their interest in co-producing the JF-17.  Armament  The free rocket used by the WS-1 and WS-1B consists of the warhead and fuse, an FG-42/43 rocket motor and the tail section. The FG-42/43 rocket motor is a single chamber, solid rocket motor with an advanced hydroxy-terminated polybutadine (HTPB) composition rocket propellant. The rocket of the WS-2 system features four control surfaces in the middle section of the rocket for terminal guidance. The rocket can be fitted with various types of warheads including anti-armour/personnel submunition, blasting, fuel air explosive (FAE), and high-explosive (HE). The ZDB-2 blasting warhead is loaded with steel balls and prefabricated fragments. The SZB-1 submunition warhead is designed to destroy large area targets such as armour formation and infantry troops. When the SZB-1 submunition warhead detonates, around 500 bullets are expelled under high pressure.  Launch truck  The launch truck is available in a number of variants. The MF-4 launch truck is based on a Chinese indigenous 6X6 truck chassis. The HF-4 launch truck is based on the more capable Tiema XC2200 6X6 truck. The WS-2 uses a heavier 8X8 Taian TA580/TAS5380 truck chassis. The launch tubes have an elevation range of 0¬∞ to 60¬∞ and azimuth range of -30¬∞ to +30¬∞. The truck is equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch.

Batov fought in World War I, where he was awarded the Cross of St. George twice. After being wounded in 1917, he was sent to a school in Petrograd and joined the Bolsheviks. He fought in the Russian Civil War and became an adviser with the XII International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. During World War II, Batov commanded the 51st Army in the Crimea. In 1942, he became the commander of the 3rd Army and then the 4th Tank Army, which was renamed the 65th Army. Postwar, Batov commanded the Carpathian Military District.. Batov is considered to be one of the most brilliant generals of Soviet army history, and some of his methods are still taught today in military academies. Early military career Born in Filisovo in 1897, Batov began his military career during World War I. In 1915, he enlisted in a student command and then served as a scout in the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Life Guards. During this service, he displayed considerable bravery and was awarded with two Crosses of St. George and two lesser medals. After being wounded in action in 1917, he was assigned to an NCO school in Petrograd where political agitator A. Savkov brought him into the Bolshevik movement.Glantz, p 35 Pavel Batov in 1916Batov served for four years in the Red Army during the civil war, initially as a machine gunner, and also as assistant military chief of the Rybinsk Military Committee, his first staff work. He was given command of a company in 1926, and was chosen to attend the Vystrel Officer's School the same year, where he met many future senior officers of the wartime Red Army. He joined the Communist Party in 1929.Glantz, p 36 In 1927, Batov was promoted to command a battalion of the prestigious 1st Moscow Proletarian Rifle Division. He would serve in this unit for the next nine years, rising to command of the 3rd Regiment. His divisional commander in 1936 wrote: Batov soon received the \\"Sign of Honour\\" medal, and completed the Frunze Academy by correspondence course.Glantz, p 36 Spanish Civil War Batov was selected to \\"volunteer\\" for service in the Spanish Civil War, under the nom de guerre Fritz Pablo. He first served as military adviser to the Hungarian communist M√°t√© Zalka, who commanded the XII International Brigade defending the approaches to Madrid. He fought on the Teruel Front and was wounded twice and won his first Orders of Lenin and of the Red Banner as a result. After recovering, he fought at Jarama, alongside A.I Rodimtsev, at the Guadalajara and on the Aragon front, where he was wounded again.Glantz, pp 36-37 Occupation of Poland and the Winter War Returning to the Soviet Union in December 1937, Batov successively commanded the 10th Rifle Corps and 3rd Rifle Corps, the latter of which he led in the Soviet occupation of eastern Poland in September 1939. The corps later transferred to the Finnish front, and fought in the second phase (February ‚Äì March 1940) of the Russian- Finnish War in the Karelian sector under 13th Army. For his services in Finland, Batov was awarded a second Order of Lenin, promoted to divisional commander (Komdiv) and, in June, to lieutenant general. He was then appointed deputy commander of the Transcaucasus Military District. The outbreak of war with Germany would find him deep in the south of the USSR.Glantz, p 37 Great Patriotic War In June 1941, Batov was in command of the 9th Separate Rifle Corps, which comprised the 106th and 156th Rifle Divisions and the 32nd Cavalry Division, with a total strength of about 35,000 men. This corps was the only major Red Army formation in the Crimea at the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa, and Batov had arrived at its headquarters in Simferopol just two days earlier.Robert Forczyk, Where The Iron Crosses Grow, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2014, p 34Glantz, p 37 Later in 1941, he was made deputy commander of the 51st Army, and following the evacuation of that army from the Kerch Peninsula he rose again to full command. Although the Crimea had been lost, Batov was exonerated by Stalin.Glantz, p 38 In January 1942, he joined the Bryansk Front as commander of the 3rd Army, and later as deputy commander for training of the Front, under Lt. Gen. K. K. Rokossovski. Rokossovski noted that Batov preferred active command to \\"sit[ing] in the headquarters\\", and that his current role was \\"a burden\\" to him.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, trans. and edited by Stuart Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p 187 Batov and Rokossovski formed a professional and personal bond that would last beyond the latter's death in 1968, and Batov would continue to serve under Rokossovski's command until the end of the war.Glantz, pp 38 - 39 On October 22, 1942, Batov was moved to command of the 4th Tank Army on the approaches to Stalingrad, replacing Mjr. Gen. V.D. Kryuchenkin. This army, soon renamed the 65th Army, formed part of Rokossovski's Don Front. Batov remained in command of 65th Army for the duration. He helped to plan the Soviet counteroffensive, Operation Uranus, providing key intelligence to Gen. Zhukov regarding the boundaries between German and Romanian forces. His army formed a key strike force in this offensive, and the subsequent Operation Ring, which reduced and defeated the encircled Axis forces. Rokossovski later wrote: Following this victory 65th Army was moved to the northwest, rejoining Rokossovski as part of his new Central Front. Exploiting success, the Front was pushing hard against the weak German Second Army west of Kursk, when it was brought to a halt by the spring rasputitsa and German successes around Kharkov, to the south. In July 1943, Batov's army formed part of Rokossovski's Front during the giant Battle of Kursk, on a secondary sector, and in the exploitation operations that followed the German defeat. From August through October, the 65th Army forced crossings of the rivers Sev, Desna, Sozh, and finally the Dnieper, earning Batov and his army a formidable reputation in river-crossing operations.Glantz, p 40 Rokossovski's command was first renamed as Belorussian Front, and later as 1st Belorussian Front. In June 1944, Batov's army took part in major strategic operations in Belorussia. In a well-known confrontation at the planning stage, Rokossovski convinced Stalin that, given the terrain, it was better to strike two strong blows against the German forces than just one.Earl F. Ziemke, The Soviet Juggernaut, Time-Life Books, Chicago, 1980, pp 127 - 29 He was counting on Batov's ability to lead his army across swampy regions south of Bobruisk, using corduroy roads, swamp shoes, and other means. The 65th Army did not disappoint, and within a few days the German Ninth Army was encircled and mostly destroyed. For his performance, Batov was promoted to Colonel General.Glantz, p 41 The 65th Army crossed the Bug River on July 22, and pushed on to cross the Narev River, north of Warsaw, by September 4. Operation Bagration had run out of steam, but Batov's army held off strong German counterattacks against the Narev bridgehead for more than two months.Glantz, p 41 Following this, Rokossovski's command was renamed 2nd Belorussian Front, and forces were built up in the bridgehead for an offensive to be launched in January. During the new offensive, 65th Army forced a crossing of the Vistula River in early February. Rokossovski later noted: The winter offensive propelled Batov's army into eastern Germany, finally to the Oder River, near Stettin-an-Oder, where it once again forced a difficult river crossing in April 1945. Officials of the city surrendered to Batov's 193rd Rifle Division on April 26.Nikolai Litvin, 800 Days on the Eastern Front, University Press of Kansas, 2007, p 104 Following the War After the war, Batov held various senior commands. In the summer of 1945, he was appointed to command the 7th Mechanized Army in Poland, and as force levels decreased, the 11th Guards Army, headquartered in Kaliningrad, in 1947. In 1949, he became First Deputy Commander of the Group of Soviet Forces, Germany, for a brief period before attending the Voroshilov General Staff Academy. During this time he also became a prolific writer on military theory. His treatise on river-crossing operations is still consulted to this day.Glantz, p 41, 42 Batov became the commander of the Carpathian Military District from 1955 to 1958. In this period, he participated in the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Revolt. He was transferred to command the Baltic Military District (1958-1959), the Southern Group of Forces (1960-1962), and finally Deputy Chief of Staff of Warsaw Pact Forces (1962-1965), replacing the deceased General A. I. Antonov. Batov resigned as an active Soviet Army officer in 1965, but continued to work in the Defense Ministry Inspectorate, and from 1970 to 1981 as Chief of the Soviet Veterans Committee. He wrote his memoirs during this time.Glantz, p 42 He remained a close personal friend of Rokossovski until the latter's death in 1968, and was entrusted with the task of editing and publishing his former commander's memoirs.Richard Woff, \\"Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky\\", in Stalin's Generals, (Harold Shukman, Ed.), Phoenix Press, 2001, p 196 Although mostly unknown to the general public, Batov had a well-deserved reputation of competence and takes place among the myriad of the talented generals who, after surviving the first part of the Soviet-Nazi war, greatly contributed to the final victory over the Nazis. He was fond of saying, \\"One must beat the enemy artfully, and that means with little blood.\\" A post-war Western intelligence assessment summed him up as follows: Batov died on April 19, 1985, in Moscow and was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.

It currently occupies 7,213 square kilometers and forms the core of the World Heritage Site Virgin Komi Forests. Topography The nature reserve is located in the south-eastern corner of the Komi Republic (Troitsko-Pechorsky District), on the western slopes of the Ural Mountains and the adjacent foothills and lowlands. The area is drained by the upper course of the Pechora River and its tributary the Ilych, from whose names the name of the reserve is derived. History The idea of the creation of a nature reserve in the upper Pechora, as a sable zakaznik (sanctuary), was proposed in 1915 by S. T. Nat, the Chief Forester of Vologda Guberniya, in his article in Lesnoy Zhurnal (Forest Journal). The nature reserve was created on May 4, 1930, originally occupying 11,350 square kilometers. The borders of the reserve were set on July 30, 1931. Originally, the reserve's main office was built in the village of Ust-Ilych, at the fall of the Ilych into the Pechora. Access to that location being extremely difficult, the main office was moved in 1935 to the village of Yaksha, further upstream on the Pechora, but closer to the Kama River basin, via which the area communicated with the outside world in those days. In 1951 the reserve was greatly reduced in size, to a mere 930 km2; its area became non-contiguous, with a small lowland section near Yaksha being separated from the highland part. In 1959 the area of the reserve was increased to its current size (7,213 km2), but it still remains non-contiguous. To better protect the reserve, in 1973 a buffer area of 324 km2 (similar in status to a national forest in the United States) was created outside of the reserve; the size of the buffer area size was increased in 1984 by additional 330 km2. Since 1986 reserve has been listed by UNESCO as one of the biosphere reserves of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. In 1995 the forest area including the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve and its northern neighbor, the Yugyd Va National Park, were recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, under the name Virgin Komi Forests. Ecoregion and climate Pechora-Ilych is in the Urals montane tundra and taiga ecoregion, a region that covers the main ridge of the Ural Mountains (both sides) - a 2,000 km (north-south) by 300 km (west-east) region. The region is on the divide between European and Asian ecoregions, and also the meeting point of tundra and taiga. The climate of Pechora-Ilych is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate(Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). Landscape and vegetation Russian geographer A.A. Korchagin divided the area of the reserve into five natural regions: *The Pechora lowlands: pine forests, pine forested swamps, and moss swamps. There are few spruce forests in that area. This region includes the Gusinoe Bolota (Goose Swamp), a peat bog that occupies around 3 km2, with the peat deposits some 5‚Äì6 meters deep. *The piedmont (foothills) region, dominated by forests of shade-loving species: Siberian spruce, Siberian pine, and Siberian fir. There are abundant forested swamps there, but hardly any moss swamps. *The Upper Ilych lowland: this region is surrounded by the Urals highlands and mountains and has particularly severe climate. The slow-growing forest there is classified as boreal taiga. Upper Pechora River and Bear Stone Mountain; Pechora-Ilych Reserve *The Ural Mountains, the area that is the least studied but has the greatest variety of landscapes. It includes the piedmont forest belt (fir and spruce), up to 300‚Äì350 meters in elevation. Above it, up to 600 m elevation, is the subalpine forest belt, where firs and spruces are gradually replaced with birch forests and subalpine meadows. The tree line is at 550‚Äì650 m elevation, although there are occasional firs at the elevations as high as 800 m or even higher. Above the tree line, alpine meadows and then tundra are found. *The valleys of the Pechora, Ilych, and their tributaries. Wildlife Moose, beavers, squirrels, pine martens are abundant in the reserve. Sables are known to live in the piedmont forest region of the reserve. The wild reindeer have almost disappeared after the loss of the pine forest section of the reserve in 1951, and consequent habitat destruction. The large predators include brown bears, wolves, and wolverines. Ten mustelid species make the reserve their home, from the largest, the wolverine, to the least weasel, as well as the ermine, the American and European mink, the pine marten, the sable, and the Siberian weasel. Moose kept as pack animals, Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve, December 1952 Research work Over the years, scientific research in many areas of biology and ecology was conducted in the reserve. Topics of research ranged from ants to squirrels to fish. The moose was a particularly important topic of research in the reserve. Moose domestication experiments The moose (Alces alces) has long been an object of research at the Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve. In the late 1940s, the management of the reserve encountered the problem of unsustainable growth of the moose population. By the early 1950s, pastures in the reserve started to be exhausted. To handle the problem, in 1956 a moose hunting enterprise () was instituted. The enterprise was affiliated with the reserve, but located outside of its territory. It has been economically successful. Between 1956 and 1968, 1000 moose were taken, providing 200 tons of meat. At the same time, hunting operations allowed the collection of valuable statistics on the biology of the Pechora moose population. Besides moose hunting, in 1949 the reserve staff created the facility they referred to as a \\"moose farm\\" (, loseferma) to study the feasibility of moose domestication. The first director of this project was Yevgeny Knorre. After he moved to the Volga-Kama Nature Reserve in 1962, his student M. V. Kozhukhov became the director. The main objectives of the farm were to learn more about moose biology and to use this knowledge to develop suitable food rations for the moose and techniques for caring for them; to study the feasibility of raising a farm-bred population; and to explore the possibilities of the use of the moose in the national economy. Three moose in the corral, March 2012 Over the first 40-plus years of the project, six generations of moose were raised on the farm, with some 30‚Äì35 animals at the farm in any given year. About 15 moose calves were raised at the farm in a good spring. The total number of the animals raised over the year is said to have exceeded 500. The farm's adult moose would spend most of the time browsing in the forest; however, a pregnant moose cow would always come back to the farm to give birth. Then, during the lactation period of three to five months, the moose cow would come to the farm several times a day, at the same hours, to be milked. The milk production of a moose is small compared to a dairy cow: over the lactation season, a total of 300‚Äì500 liters (75‚Äì125 gallons) of milk is obtained from a moose. However, the milk has a high (12‚Äì14%) fat content, and is rich in vitamins and micronutrient elements; it is said to have medicinal properties. A farm-raised moose can live as long as 18 years, although few reached that age because of the depredations of wolves, bears, and poachers on the free-ranging population. Among the potential productive uses of the moose, the milk production was found the most promising. However, riding a moose and using it to pull a sleigh were tried at the farm as well. Over the years, a number of research articles dealing with the physiology, ethology, and ecology of the moose were published by the biologists from the reserve, as well as from the research institutes in Syktyvkar and Moscow (e.g. Aleksandr V. Chalyshev, \\"Nutrient composition of milk from domesticated taiga moose during the lactation period\\", Alces, 01-JAN-2002 Nelly A. Moyseenko, \\"Components of red blood in young moose\\", Alces Supplement 2: pp. 93-97 (2002) T.I. Kochan, \\"Seasonal Adaptation of Metabolism and Energy in the Pechora Taiga Moose Alces alces\\" [Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology], Volume 37, Number 3 / May, 2001 ) Knorre's and his associates' moose domestication work at Pechora Ilych, as well as somewhat similar Muskox Domestication Project at the University of Alaska's Institute of Northern Agricultural Research, also provided valuable insights in the general theory of animal domestication.Paul F.

According to a recent trip report, the moose farm operations have been greatly reduced; the remaining buildings are in a poor conditions, and only a few animals remain. A Moscow teacher visiting in 2003 reported that there were only five left.

Funtime publishes the Funtime Comics Anthology, and a variety of other comics, many of which are collaborative efforts, featuring stories and artwork from local and international comics artists. History Funtime Comics was formed in 1990 by a group of comic artists and enthusiasts from the University of Canterbury. Originally conceived by Jason Brice, President of the University of Canterbury's ComicSoc, the first anthology was published the following year under the editorship of Brice (also founder of Comics Bulletin), Bean McGregor, and Nigel Campbell, with the name Funtime coming from a competition for the title and cover banner won by Debra Boyask. The cover of the first issue features a collaboration between Brice and artist Jared Lane, and carried the humourous warning that the comic was not safe in the hands of children, referring to New Zealand's then current legislation around indecent publications. Edward Dewe assumed the editorship for the next three issues in 1992-1993. Issue 2 was the first published under the series title Funtime Comics Presents, the name by which it was known until Issue 22. Issue 5 came out in November 1993 under the editorship of Darren Schroeder. He remained editor up until the publication of Issue 21 in 2005. It was during Darren's long-standing editorship that the Funtime anthology extended its range to include contributions from other parts of New Zealand and overseas. He also established the tradition of monthly Funtime Workshops at which members draw comics and drink tea and eat animal biscuits. His efforts also extended to the promotion of New Zealand comics through the creation of the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on New Zealand Comics, the website New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz. Current editor Isaac Freeman has produced four issues of the regular anthology since mid-2007. In 2011 a special issue of Funtime Comics Anthology was released in response to the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011 in Funtime's home town of Christchurch, New Zealand. Contributors from all around the world sent work for the special issue and all proceeds from the sale of the comic went to the Red Cross. Achievements Isaac Freeman and Funtime Comics published issue 23 (January 2009) under the new series name Funtime Comics Anthology. With the publication of this issue it is now believed to be New Zealand's longest- running title, in years and number of issues. In 2006 Issue #20 of Funtime Comics Presents, Unau Prolepsis, won Best Anthology of 2004-2005 in the Black River Digital 'Eric' Awards. In 2006 the Funtime Comics hosted website New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz received the following two awards: * The 2006 Black River Digital 'Eric' Award for Best Website in New Zealand Comics * Gibson Comic Awards 2006 Award for Favourite New Zealand Web Related Material A Funtime Comics workshop is featured in the Shirley Horrocks documentary The Comics Show, alongside individual interviews with Funtimers Jared Lane, Isaac Freeman and Darren Schroeder.

The game was released for the FM-7, MSX, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-6001, and later to the Famicom in Japan. It was the first third-party video game to be released on a Nintendo console. Gameplay Both versions of Nuts & Milk involve the player moving through various levels while collecting an assortment of fruit scattered throughout each one. By gathering all the fruit on a particular screen, the player will gain access to a previously unopened house door containing Milk's fianc√©e, Yogurt. When the player makes contact with the female blob, they are advanced to the next level to start the process anew. Movement through these levels is accomplished by using the directional pad or keyboard to move Milk across the stage while avoiding pitfalls and other obstacles, most notably the character's rival, Nuts. If contact is made at any time during game play with Nuts or other harmful objects such as miniature blimps, the player will lose a life and have to restart the current level, with all fruit reset back to their initial positions. Once all three of Milk's lives are lost in this fashion, the game ends. In the Famicom version, Milk can jump a short distance vertically or horizontally, allowing him transverse pits or quickly gain access to an adjacent platform. If the player falls from too great a distance, Milk will become momentarily dazed and unable to move until the player joggles him awake with the jump button. Rope bridges are suspended in mid-air on most levels, and by using the directional pad, the player can climb them up or down as well as walk across them once they reach the top. In all, 50 individual levels exist on the Famicom version, and each one can be skipped freely by pressing the select button. Once a player has cycled through all fifty of them, he will return to the first level and restart the sequence until all of Milk's lives are lost. The Famicom and MSX version also contain a level editor mode where the player can freely edit the first stage of the game by placing objects or enemies on the screen for Milk to interact with. This stage then takes the place of the first level in normal game play until the console is reset. Plot Set in a fantasy world, Nuts & Milk follows the story of a pink male blob named Milk, who must find his fianc√©e, Yogurt, a similar pink blob with a red hair bow, and rescue her from Nuts, a teal blob who also vies for her affection. The journey will take Milk through several levels where the process of finding and saving his love will repeat itself several times as Nuts mounts an ever-present resistance against his quest for romance.Nuts & Milk NES Instruction Manual 1984. Development Originally developed by Japanese software company Hudson Soft for several home computers in Japan, Nuts & Milk became the company's first Famicom video game. The game itself borrows elements from Lode Runner, an earlier Hudson project, and other arcade-styled platformers such as Donkey Kong, and even emulates the title screen of Nintendo's early 1980s releases. While the game retains stylistic similarities to other games published at the time, it is unique in being an arcade-styled game that was never released on an actual arcade system. Two different versions of the game were created: one for home computers, and one for the Famicom. =Version differences= The MSX (top) and Famicom versions Nuts & Milk was released for the home computers and Nintendo's Famicom at roughly the same time, and although both versions are very similar, there are a few differences in presentation. The Famicom version is played from a sideways angle typical of 2D sidescrollers with the player walking and jumping from one area to another horizontally. Conversely, the computer version is presented in a top-down fashion with all platforming elements removed, with the player instead moving in four directions. This version also contains a slight degradation in both sound and graphics, due to the comparatively less powerful personal computer hardware at the time. Though the Famicom version makes use of its standard 2-button controller, the computer releases instead rely on a keyboard. The Famicom version can optionally save user-generated content to cassette tape with the Famicom Data Recorder. =Music= The music for both versions of Nuts & Milk was composed internally by Hudson Soft and is made up entirely of synth-based chiptunes, a common audio medium for early video games. Though an exclusive soundtrack for either game was never released, the music from both versions can be found on the 1987 compilation album Hudson Game Music (catalog number 28XA-87) released in Japan by Alfa and GMO Records.\\"Hudson Game Music\\" Game Music Revolution.

The Sheik is credited with setting off a major and hugely popular revival of the \\"desert romance\\" genre of romantic fiction.Teo, Hsu-Ming. ‚ÄúHistoricizing The Sheik: Comparisons of the British Novel and the American Film‚Äù. Journal of Popular Romance Studies. Hull followed The Sheik with several other novels with desert settings, such as The Shadow of the East, The Desert Healer, and The Sons of the Sheik. Personal life Born Edith Maud Henderson on 16 August 1880 in the Borough of Hampstead, London, England, she was the daughter of Katie Thorne, of New Brunswick, Canada and James Henderson, a Liverpool shipowner originally from New York City. As a child she travelled widely with her parents, even visiting Algeria‚Äîthe setting of her novels. In 1899, she married Percy Winstanley Hull (b. 1869), a civil engineer and later a prize-winning pig farmer.Sergeant, Amy. \\"E M Hull Homepage\\". Women in Silent British Cinema website. The couple moved to the Hull family estate in Derbyshire in the early 1900s. They had a daughter, Cecil Winstanley Hull. Hull was somewhat reclusive and did not seek the spotlight. She died at age 66, on 11 February 1947 in Hazelwood, in the parish of Duffield, Derbyshire. Writing career Hull wrote fiction while her husband was away serving in World War I. The Sheik, her first effort, was published in England in 1919 and to her surprise quickly became an international blockbuster, placing among Publishers Weekly's top ten best sellers in America for both of the years 1921 and 1922.Teo, Hsu-Ming. Desert Passions: Orientalism and Romance Novels Hull's volume quickly sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide. Sales further increased when Paramount released a film version of The Sheik in 1921, which launched Rudolph Valentino into cinema immortality as the greatest \\"lover\\" of the silent screen. By 1923, the novel had gone through over a hundred editions, and sales had surpassed all other best-sellers combined. Melman, Billie. Women and the Popular Imagination in the Twenties: Flappers and Nymphs. (New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1988). Hull's novel was not the first desert romance‚Äîthe genre had been pioneered by writers like Robert Smythe Hichens and Kathlyn Rhodes‚Äîbut it was by far the most popular and influential on later romance writers. Hull continued to write into the 1930s, and her 1925 novel The Sons of the Sheik was also a tremendous success, as was the film version Son of the Sheik, which again starred Valentino in what was to be his last film. In later life, Hull expressed regret that she had sold the film rights for her novels for too little money. In the 1940s, Canadian science fiction writer Edna Mayne Hull initially published her work as \\"E.M. Hull\\", before switching to the credited name E. Mayne Hull to avoid confusion.

Mainline Contractors Pty Ltd was established from this base and in 1969, became Mainline Corporation of New Zealand, a publicly listed New Zealand company, adopting the name Mainzeal Corporation Ltd in 1975. The Richina holding company was created when Mainzeal acquired a New Zealand leather business (since sold) and in 1996 it changed its name to Richina Pacific (retaining the Mainzeal name for its construction unit) and started investing in China, where its owners saw major business opportunities. Richina Pacific delisted from NZX in January 2009. In 2006 Mainzeal experienced some financial setbacks, posting large losses associated mainly with the 'Scene One', 'Scene Two' and 'Scene Three' apartment developments in the Auckland CBD and the close-by 12,200-seat Vector Arena in Quay Park. However, the losses on these projects were recovered, with Mainzeal's pre-tax earnings reaching US$1.6 million surplus compared to US$2.8 million loss in the previous year.

It broadcasts a bilingual Hispanic rhythmic format, simulcasting KJFA 840 AM Belen, New Mexico. History =KENC - Enchantment FM 102.9= 102.9 FM signed on in August 2002 as KENC \\"Enchantment FM 102.9\\" under Meadows Media, programmed by Jim Duncan, which aired an eclectic music format made up of jazz (without much Smooth Jazz), Classical, World Music, Blues, folk, and Bluegrass as well as Adult Album Alternative. Jim Duncan's goal was to create a radio station which featured music not heard on most commercial radio stations.R&R; \\\\- Radio & Records, Inc The signal was very poor throughout its coverage area; it suffered interference from KRGN in Amarillo, Texas and KAZX in Kirtland, New Mexico. Many adjustments and minor modifications were made to the transmitter site, however the signal never improved satisfactorily. A 2,400 watt booster was added in May 2003 on a cellsite about 1 mile northwest of Santa Fe. Will Sims, the managing partner of KENC began searching for a buyer for 102.9 FM. Ken Christensen, chief operating officer of Blu Ventures based in Fort Myers, Florida, was looking to buy a Santa Fe radio station. Blu Ventures owns a chain of three sushi bars in Florida named Blu Sushi which are known for their Chill inspired atmosphere. Blu Ventures also owns radioio.com, an internet radio site. Santa Fe was the chosen market because of its eclectic mix of people and its \\"unique creative energy that radiates outwardly across the US\\". In November 2003, KENC and the office on Cordova Road were sold to Blu Ventures. =KLBU - Blu 102.9= Logo as \\"Blu 102.9\\" Enchantment FM came to an end at midnight on November 19, and the new format as Blu 102.9 was launched. Karen Sanchez became KLBU's general manager. The call letters were changed to KLBU and the format still contained Jazz and World Music but was adjusted to include Chill, Lounge, Acid Jazz, Trip hop, House, and softer Dance Hits, as well as Smooth Jazz and Bossa Nova, nearly all of the Classical, Blues, Folk, and Bluegrass was removed from the playlist. Chill, of course, was the most dominant genre in Blu 102.9's format. The music played on Blu 102.9 had a bit more energy than music played on a traditional smooth jazz radio station. Many of the songs played were instrumental but some tracks contained vocals as well. Other songs featured vocal sound samples. Blu 102.9 was given the slogan Santa Fe's Choice for Chill\\". Blu also aired a replay of BBC Radio 1's \\"Gilles Peterson Worldwide\\" on Sunday and Wednesday nights, hosted by British DJ Gilles Peterson. Blu also began to broadcast live from a local nightclub, the program was called \\"The Blu Room\\", which featured local and international mix DJ's who spun live on the air on Friday nights. Blu also had several daytime personalities, including Joann Orner a.k.a. \\"The Lunch Lady\\". In July 2005, General Manager, Karen Sanchez, was fired. Just before summer of 2007, Blu 102.9 began operating under Hutton Broadcasting via LMA while still under ownership of Blu Ventures. After the LMA began, Blu 102.9 discontinued airing any programming and began running on automation full-time. As it was running on automation, the format slowly began changing, including more Jazz and Rhythmic, and less Electronica. At this point, it was known that KLBU would be sold to Hutton Broadcasting. In September, Blu 102.9 stopped streaming online and song titles were no longer displayed on the website. In October 2007, Blu 102.9 was sold to Hutton Broadcasting. Management stated that no big changes are planned but the format would \\"evolve\\" to include other genres.\\"Radio Group Agrees to Buy KLBU\\", Albuquerque Journal Hutton Broadcasting also purchased KWRP-FM (formerly \\"Indie 101.5\\", now KVSF-FM) and KBAC (98.1 FM). Blu 102.9 moved out from its original location on Cordova Road to Hutton Broadcasting's building on Camino Estrada. In September 2010, the format changed to playing various rhythmic sounds including pop, urban, dance, rhythmic alternative, and rhythmic hits from the 80's through today. It had also begun streaming its live broadcast on the internet again. The new slogan was \\"The Beat of Santa Fe\\". =Juan 102.9/Radio Lobo/La Jefa= On June 1, 2013, the station changed formats to Spanish-language adult hits branding as \\"Juan 102.9\\" featuring hits from the 1970s-2000's.

It adopted an earlier tramroad, the Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway. The Llynvi and Ogmore Railway was opened in 1865, and the two companies amalgamated to form the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway in 1866. At first Porthcawl harbour was an important destination for onward transport, but this soon declined. The area covered by the two lines combined developed considerably serving collieries and the iron and zinc smelting industries, and the L&OR; system was extremely busy in conveying minerals up until 1914. A number of extensions to the system were made, even after takeover by the Great Western Railway in 1873 for management purposes and in 1883 as full amalgamation. Passengers were carried on parts of the network, but were never dominant except at Porthcawl, which declined as a harbour and arose as a holiday and residential location. As the mineral industries declined after 1945 the railway network followed, but in 1992 the line from Bridgend to Maesteg was reopened to passenger trains, and that is the principal remaining railway activity on the old L&OR; network. Industry before the railway The Llynfi Valley runs north to south, from the high mountains north of Maesteg down to Tondu where it joins the River Ogmore, which itself continues through Bridgend to the Bristol Channel at Ogmore-by-Sea. In the first half of the eighteenth century the area was entirely rural, but coal outcropped in the ground and was used by farmers, and some was taken away for sale by pack animal. Charcoal had been used for smelting iron but in the second half of the 18th century, coke began to be used instead; limestone was available locally and was used in the process. Cefn Cribwr had been the site of a blast furnace established by John Bedford in 1780, though that declined after Bedford's death in 1791. William Bryant took over the works in about 1825. Elsewhere though, the industry had been on a small scale. It was in 1826 that the Maesteg Iron Company was founded: the first furnace was blown in 1828 and by 1831 the population of the local hamlet had tripled (Cwmdu, from 968 to 2,880). The Maesteg Iron Company later became known as the Old Works and its foundation started the large scale industrialisation of the process locally. This was followed in 1831 by the establishment by James Allen of the Spelter Works near what is now Caerau. Spelter is an ore of zinc; it was mined in Cornwall and brought to the area for smelting. The locality of the works became known as Spelter, and the name appears on present-day maps. In 1839 Allen and his partners established another iron company, the Cambrian Iron Works (later known as the Llynvi Iron Works), in Maesteg.Paul Reynolds, The Ironmasters' Bags: The Postal Service in the South Wales Valleys, c. 1760 to c. 1860, Lulu.com, 2010, Philip Riden, John Bedford and the Ironworks at Cefn Cribwr, self published by Philip Riden, 1992, These industries needed transport away to market, and this was chiefly by sea from wharves on the Bristol Channel. Transport from the works and the collieries to the coast was expensive and slow, generally taking place on the backs of pack animals. The ordinary road network was quite inadequate for industrial development.Clive Smith, Railways of the Llynfi Valley, Alun Books, Port Talbot, 1985, Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway Even the earlier, small-scale iron and coal industries around Maesteg, and further south along the Cefn Cribwr ridge, created a demand for ship-borne transport to market. The Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway was promoted by local people, including the Earl of Dunraven, Sir John Nicholl and Sir Digby Mackworth. They obtained an Act on 10 June 1825 to make a horse-drawn toll railway from Duffryn Llynvi to Pwll Cawl (or Porthcawl, or Pwll-y-Cawl), and to improve the harbour there by the erection of a jetty, and charge harbour dues and wharfage. The engineer was John Hodgkinson.Alun Morgan, Porthcawl, Newton and Nottage: A Concise Illustrated History, D Brown and Sons Limited, Cowbridge, 1987, , pages 40 to 47D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, , pages 178 to 184D S Barrie, The Porthcawl Branch in the Railway Magazine, March 1954Clive Smith, Bygone Railways of the Afan, Alun Books, Port Talbot, 1982, As well as conveying mineral products down to Porthcawl for shipping transport away, it was to bring limestone (used for fluxing in iron making) up from Cornelly, and also to a certain extent timber for mine use. The line was to use stone-block sleepers and cast iron fish- bellied edge rails,Bertram Baxter, Stone Blocks and Iron Rails (Tramroads), David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966, pages 220 and 221 and the track gauge was to be and its length would be .Dendy Marshall says on page 93 that this and the Bridgend Railway were plate railways, opened in 1834, \\"rather a late date for a plate-railway\\". Smith says the gauge was , as do Barrie and Baughan. Chapman, in Ely Valley says the gauge was . Barrie in The Porthcawl Branch says the line was \\"reputedly constructed to the unusual gauge of 4 ft 7 in, although that may have been a discrepancy in point of measurement.\\"C F Dendy Marshall, A History of British Railways Down to the Year 1830, Oxford University Press, 1938 reprinted 1971, Colin Chapman, The Ely Valley Railway: Llantrisant ‚Äì Penygraig, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2000, , page 26 and 27 Capital was ¬£40,000 and this was all subscribed before the Act was passed, but obtaining a mortgage loan proved much more difficult, and a further Act of 14 May 1829 was required to elevate the priority of the mortgage payments in order to secure the loans. Construction of the line only began in 1826, and the line from the Maesteg ironworks at Duffryn Llynvi to Porthcawl was opened on 22 June 1828. Duffryn Llynvi was the name of the ironworks in Maesteg‚Äîthe district was also known as Garnlwyd. Many other works and collieries were served intermediately by the new line. Duffryn Llynvi was reached in 1828 when the line opened; the line was extended to Allen's spelter works in 1831. The line was soon extended further to the Blaenllynfi Colliery, in present-day Caerau; the colliery was alongside what is now Caerau Road (and Railway Terrace). There were already a number of tramroad connections to works in the Tondu and Maesteg area, and the opening of the line, giving easy access to the dock at Porthcawl, encouraged the establishment of further metal foundries and collieries, in many cases served by private tramroads in connection with the DL&PR; and in other cases purely internal and private. In 1839 a new ironworks, known as the Cambrian Ironworks, was established by Allen and his partners established another iron company, the Cambrian Iron Works (later named the Llynvi Iron Works), and in 1846 the Forge was added to these works. The journey time from Duffryn Llynvi to Porthcawl was just over six hours; the return journey, uphill, took eight hours. A regular time table was operated on the line, and the passing places were designated. Each train was pulled by a team of three horses. As a toll railway the line was open to private carriers who paid tolls for the use of the line; the company did not operate trains nor own wagons of their own. However it was becoming apparent that the harbour improvements at Porthcawl were inadequate, not doing enough to shelter vessels there from the prevailing winds, and it tended to be used in summer only. In 1840 a further Act was obtained, enabling money to be raised for the provision of coal chutes, and the construction of a new wet dock. This considerably improved business, and the DL&PR; was able to pay dividends of 8% later. Route of the DL&PR; Running south from Blaenllynfi Colliery the line proceeded along the east bank of the River Llynfi to Tywith (or Ty-chwyth) and through Nantyffyllon by Heol Tywith. From there it crossed the river and followed along Bangor Terrace, behind High Street, crossing the road near the Traveller's Rest Hotel, through the Llynvi Iron Works to Llynfi Road. It then continued through Commercial Street to Bethania Street and along Llwydarth Road to the Cerdin (Cross Inn); thence to the Llwyndurys weighing house at Pontrhydycyff (Llangynwyd), after which it ran across the main road, and continued behind the modern Maesteg Comprehensive School to the old Gadlys Woollen Mill, where its embankment can be traced across Nant-y-Gadlys. The tramway then continued to Cefn Ydfa and to Tondu, where it turned west to Cefn Cwsc, Kenfig Hill, Pyle, Cornelly and finally to the harbour at Porthcawl. The route of the tramway from Commercial Street to the Cross Inn later became the main road from the Maesteg town centre. Its unusual width is explained by the development of the railways and a road alongside it before the housing was built up. The line was in length and there was a fall of , making an average gradient of 1 in 180 down to Porthcawl.D S Barrie, Railways of the Bridgend District, in the Railway Magazine, July 1955 Bridgend Railway The Bridgend RailwayBaxter refers to this as the Bridgend Railroad Company. was authorised on 19 June 1828 to build a line from Bridgend to join the DL&PR; at Park Slip, a little west of Tondu, to Bridgend. The capital was ¬£6,000. The distance was ; it was sponsored by the same promoters as the DL&PR;, and like the DL&PR; it was a gauge edge railway, using cast iron fish-bellied rails on stone block sleepers.Robin G Simmonds, Port Talbot Railway & Docks Company and the South Wales Mineral Railway Company: Volume 1: 1853-1907, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2012, , page 27 The line entered Bridgend along Quarella Road and terminated at The Green; very little of this line was used for the later Tondu branch line railway. The line opened on 22 October 1830.The Hereford Journal edition of 3 December 1830 refers to the line opening on the \\"22d inst.\\" At that time newspapers often syndicated minor news items from other periodicals without troubling to edit or update them. The same report with similar wording but starting \\"On Friday, October 22, the Bridgend Railway was opened to the public...\\" is quoted from The Cambrian newspaper by Smith in Railways of the Llynfi Valley, page 11. Dendy Marshall muddies the water considerably by reporting the line as a plateway opening in 1834, \\"rather a late date for a new plateway\\". Awdry agrees 1830 (page 17) but Barrie and Baughan say 1834 (page 179). Llynvi Valley Railway The Duffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway and the Bridgend Railway were simply horse-operated tramroads using primitive stone-block sleepers and cast iron rails, and as the volume of mineral activity increased, they were overwhelmed by the business offered. By the mid 1840s railway technology had advanced considerably; the South Wales Railway had been projected for some years and obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1845, so that soon the area would be connected by a trunk railway to the British network. Local businesspeople decided to promote a new railway to modernise the DL&PR; and Bridgend Railway networks. In 1845 the Llynvi Valley and South Wales Junction Railway was promoted. It would run directly down the Llynfi valley to Tondu, and then run west past Pyle to join the proposed South Wales Railway at Margam. The name of the company was changed during the Parliamentary hearings and it was the Llynvi Valley Railway that was incorporated on 7 August 1846, From Simmonds; also Barrie and Baughan, and also Jones, page 76; Carter says 26 August 1846 (page 139). with authorised capital of ¬£200,000.Carter, pages 139 and 140Simmons, pages 29 and 30Stephen K Jones, Brunel in South Wales: volume II: Communications and Coal, Tempus Publishing, Stroud, 2007, , pages 76 and 219 It was to acquire the DL&PR; and convert it to modern railway standards, and to introduce locomotive operation. As the South Wales Railway was being built on the broad gauge and was to be the only main line railway in the vicinity, the Llynvi Valley Railway was to adopt the broad gauge as well. The LVR acquired the DL&PR; in 1847, ratified by Act of 22 July. DL&PR; shareholders got a total of ¬£50,000 in new LVR shares. Already on 2 July 1847 the LVR had obtained authorisation to deviate from its earlier intended route. The South Wales Railway had originally intended to follow a route much closer to the coast between Pencoed and Margam, but now it revised its route to pass Pyle. The LVR abandoned its line to Margam, instead running south from Tondu to a triangular junction with the SWR at Bridgend, independently of the Bridgend Railway.Simmonds, page 49 The LVR got a further Act in 1851 authorising a short north to east connection to the SWR at Stormy, east of Pyle.Simmonds refers to this as a south-to-east connection, but this is wrong; see Cooke and the remains of the alignment on 1876 Ordnance Survey mapping. Steam power was prohibited from being used on it. The broad gauge connection, known as the South Wales Junction Branch Railway, was constructed almost immediately, and may originally have been intended as a transhipment siding. The Cefn Cwsc colliery and Ford's Works were located a short distance from the junction of the Junction Branch Railway on LVR territory, and extensions of the broad gauge were laid in to them. This resulted in a short length of mixed gauge and broad gauge track. However, no progress was made in the construction of the steam railway or the conversion of the DL&PR; for some years, and it was not until 18 June 1855 that an Act was obtained authorising the LVR's intentions. These included a new line from Tywith down to Ffos Toll House west of Tondu, and in addition a new line long from Tondu to a junction with the SWR near Bridgend station, all to the broad gauge. The Act authorised the re-incorporation of the company with a capital of ¬£200,000, with powers to purchase the Bridgend Railway for ¬£3,000, and to enter into working arrangements with the SWR.Simmonds, pages 32 and 33S K Jones, pages 219 to 223 In fact the first sod was cut on 15 July 1858. Brunel was the supervising engineer of the LVR construction work; he appointed Captain McNair to the post of resident engineer. The new LVR line opened to mineral traffic on 10 August 1861. Passenger services between Bridgend and Maesteg commenced on 25 February 1864. The short South Wales Junction Branch Railway at Stormy was removed after the opening of the LVR, the only connection with the SWR then being at Bridgend. (The plateway known as the Bridgend Railway was entirely separate at this stage.) At first the LVR made its only connection with the South Wales Railway at Stormy, east of Pyle; at the time this was a very remote location. The LVR alignment at Pyle was parallel to the South Wales Railway, but distanced from it by , to the south. In running towards Tondu it curved round to the north and crossed the South Wales Railway main line by a flat crossing, but there was no inter-running connection there. The line was worked by the GWR until two engines were delivered on 4 April 1862, enabling the company to work its own traffic. The LVR terminus was first placed at the site of the later goods yard in Coity Road. Then in 1866, it crossed the bridge and ran into Bridgend Station, where it had its own platform and booking office. This station was approached by a lane behind the Coity Castle Hotel. On 1 August 1865 the LVR started operating a passenger service to Porthcawl, in addition to the Bridgend to Maesteg service. The LVR had its own station at Pyle. The LVR line and the South Wales Railway (now GWR following amalgamation) route were not immediately adjacent and there was no connection between them, and the stations were not close together. The Bridgend Railway route fell into disuse and later became used as a roadway; this was also the fate of parts of the DL&PR; in the upper Llynfi valley.Barrie says (in Railways of the Bridgend District) that the Bridgend Railway was converted into a broad gauge railway. In fact only small parts, if any, of the Bridgend Railway system were retained and the later Bridgend‚ÄìTondu line was on an entirely different alignment. The Ogmore Valley Railway Industrialists in the Ogmore Valley wanted a railway connection, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 13 July 1863 to construct a railway from Tondu (on the LVR) through Brynmenyn and Blackmill to Nantymoel. The railway, known as the Ogmore Valley Railway, was in length.Carter, page 347 Capital was to be ¬£90,000.Simmonds, pages 33 and 34 A significant decision was taken to construct it on the narrow (standard) gauge, and there were powers to lay a third rail (to make mixed gauge) between Tondu and Porthcawl over the LVR. The Ogmore Valley Railway opened on 1 August 1865 from Nantymoel to Tondu for mineral traffic through to Porthcawl. it had sold a locomotive to the LVR, probably to work OVR passenger trains over the LVR to Porthcawl. and connected with the LVR at Tondu Junction. Porthcawl dock further improved Mining output and the ironfounding businesses in the Llynfi and Ogmore valleys continued to grow, and indeed it was obviously outstripping the limited capacity of Porthcawl harbour to handle it. Although the Llynvi Valley Railway was partly mixed gauge, the Ogmore Valley Railway was narrow (standard) gauge and the two railways were operated in close collaboration. The South Wales Railway had become part of the Great Western Railway in 1863. Use of that line to convey the mineral output away was of limited use because it was broad gauge only. The dominant partners in mining and iron operations in the Maesteg and Tondu area were the Brogden family, brothers who together controlled the majority of the iron foundries and collieries in the district. In addition they were the principal forces in both the Llynvi Valley Railway and the Ogmore Valley Railway. This enabled a close collaboration between the two companies, and they procured an Act of Parliament in June 1864 to construct the New Porthcawl Dock. Much larger and better protected from prevailing winds, it cost ¬£250,000 to build, and was engineered by R. P. Brereton, sometime the principal assistant of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The new dock was opened on 22 July 1867.Barrie and Baughan, pages 180 and 181 Ely Valley Extension Railway The Ely Valley Extension Railway had been authorised on 28 July 1863 to build of broad gauge railway from the Ely Valley Railway at Gellyrhaid (near Hendreforgan) to a colliery at Gilfach Goch. The Ogmore Valley Railway company sought an eastward outlet for the mineral products it carried, and in 1865 it acquired the company. The EVER opened for mineral traffic on 16 October 1865, but it was physically detached from the OVR and was in any case a broad gauge line. It was worked by the Great Western Railway as part of the Ely Valley Railway, which they also worked. It had a basic passenger service from 9 May 1881; the trains ran from Blackmill, reversing at Hendreforgan.Vic Mitcehll and Keith Smith, Maesteg and Tondu Lines, Middelton Press, Midhurst, 2011, Formation of the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway The time seemed right for the LVR and the OVR to amalgamate, and the necessary Parliamentary powers were secured in an Act of 28 June 1866: the new company would be called the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway. Under the 1866 Act the OVR Company was dissolved and amalgamated with the LVR Company to create the L&OR; Company with a capital of ¬£402,000 and borrowing powers of ¬£133,900.Simmonds, pages 39 and 41 By 1868 the third rail had been laid throughout the system, and the L&OR; became effectively a narrow (standard) gauge railway, although broad gauge traffic to and from the Great Western Railway system was carried on the broad gauge rails, which remained in situ for the time being. Tondu Junction became the headquarters of the L&OR.; A locomotive shed and workshops were erected there and Mr. J. Routledge was appointed the Locomotive Superintendent. The GWR converted its South Wales system to the standard gauge in 1872, although in the meantime there was increasing hostility among mineral traffic customers against the constraints of the broad gauge, such that the L&OR; projected a long line from Brynmenin to Nantgarw on the Rhymney Railway in 1871. The project would have been extremely expensive, although the London and North Western Railway encouraged it and would no doubt have contributed to the cost in order to get the access. However the GWR was motivated by now to convert its South Wales system to the standard gauge, which it did in 1872, and nothing more was heard of the scheme to reach Nantgarw. As the broad gauge system was no longer in use in South Wales, the L&OR; removed the third rail that had been provided for broad gauge vehicles. Managed by the Great Western Railway On 16 May 1873 the L&OR; agreed with the GWR that the latter would take over the working of their line, which by now extended to , reaching 26 collieries. The L&OR; was so successful by now that the GWR guaranteed 6% to its shareholders as its part of the agreement. This was ratified by Act of Parliament of 1 July 1873. The GWR absorbed the L&OR; ten years later on 1 July 1883. Meanwhile, the Porthcawl dock facilities had been improved by the (former) Llynvi Valley Railway and Ogmore Valley Railways, working together. Now capable of handling vessels of 2,000 tons, it had become an important gateway for mineral products and incoming necessities, including timber for the mines, and a shipbuilding business had been established. Extending to the Afan Valley The northern extent of the L&OR; above Maesteg had been the Blaenllynfi Colliery at Caerau, near the head of the Llynfi Valley. Cymmer Afan stood a little over a mile (2 km) away, in the Afan Valley. Considerable mineral resources existed in that valley, which at the time was served by the South Wales Mineral Railwayc, which led by an operationally difficult route to Briton Ferry. The intervening mountain rose to . Caerau itself stood at about . The Great Western Railway took the decision to extend the line, starting from a junction with the Caerau line at Nantyffyllon, and driving a tunnel through the mountain to Cymmer, making a junction there with the South Wales Mineral Railway. The necessary authorising Act was obtained on 1 July 1873, to build from Nantyfyllon to Abergwynfi. The construction involved driving a tunnel in length, and making a large single span bridge crossing the River Afan at Cymmer. The tunnel cost ¬£47,422. The line opened on 1 July 1878 for mineral traffic; passenger services started on 16 July 1880. The line was continued to Abergwynfi where there were important mineral deposits, and the passenger service was extended there from Cymmer on 22 March 1886. Pyle improvements When the South Wales Railway had constructed its main line through Pyle, it had made a level crossing with the DL&PR; where it intersected it a short distance east of Pyle. There was a connecting line at Stormy, a few miles to the east, from 1851, removed in 1864, but there was otherwise no railway connection between the two railways at Pyle stations, and in fact they ran a hundred yards or so (100 m) apart. In 1876 the Great Western Railway made some improvements there. The L&OR; line was altered so as to pass under the South Wales main line by a bridge. The new route opened on 13 November 1876.Mitchell and Smith erroneously indicate the earlier route of the main line of the L&OR; as running due north from the west end of Pyle GWR station \\"between 1861 and 1876 when the flyunder was completed\\". This is shown by them in map XXI, and they credit the Railway Magazine. The map is taken from the Railway Magazine of March 1954, page 150, and the map is identical except for the connecting line, quite properly not shown on the Railway Magazine map. Before the diveunder of 1876 the L&OR; looped round to the east of Pyle station in a broad sweep. Cobb also incorrectly shows the location of the line.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Cardiff to Swansea, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2009, In 1882 the alignment of the L&OR; line was altered to bring it alongside the South Wales main line and connecting tracks were installed. The South Wales Railway station was relocated to be alongside the L&OR; station on 1 July 1886, and the combined station was sometimes known as Pyle Junction at this period. The 1882 connection between the L&OR; lines and the GWR main line was basic, and in July 1900 new enhanced connections were installed, and in 1912 further improvements linking the passenger accommodation were installed. From before 1876 there had been a connection at the west end of Pyle GWR station, heading north to the Bryn-du coke works and colliery, and the Cefn Cibwr colliery. This was a tramway only. In 1898 this was upgraded to railway status as part of the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company Ogmore Valleys Extension Railway scheme. Porthcawl Under the original powers, the DL&PR; provided a breakwater and small tidal harbour at Porthcawl. In the 1860s the LVR and OVR companies worked together to construct an inner wet dock of , capable of handling vessels up to 2,000 tons; the new dock was equipped with coal tips and other appliances. For some decades the little harbour enjoyed considerable success, but the increasing size of sea- going shipping and the difficult seaward access eventually militated against it in competition with larger and better equipped ports elsewhere. This was brought home forcefully in 1892 when large and efficient docks were opened at Port Talbot and Barry. Porthcawl docks went into a terminal decline, and the GWR closed the dock in 1898, although some sporadic use was made until 1906. In 1913 the docks were transferred to Porthcawl Urban District Council. The original station at Porthcawl was north of the main road level crossing. On 6 March 1916 it was superseded by a new station nearer the sea, on the site of the old dock sidings, which were now no longer operational. In the 1920s the dock itself was filled in. Ely Valley Extension Railway In 1865 the Ogmore Valley Railway had acquired the Ely Valley Extension Railway Company, which opened for mineral traffic on 16 October 1865. It served a colliery at Gilfach Goch, but at the time was separated from the OVR network, and it was worked by the GWR; the line was broad gauge. In 1873 the GWR and all the broad gauge railways in South Wales converted to the narrow (standard) gauge. This prompted the L&OR; (as successors to the OVR) to build the missing link, a new line from Blackmill (at the foot of the Ogmore Valley) to Hendreforgan, on the EVER. It opened on 1 September 1875. Cardiff and Ogmore Valley Railway Now that the South Wales Main Line was standard gauge, the possibility opened up of taking Ogmore Valley minerals to Cardiff, or Penarth, where better shipping facilities existed. The Cardiff and Ogmore Railway was incorporated on 21 July 1873 to build a line from C&O; Junction on the Ogmore Valley line north of Blackmill, to Llanharan on the South Wales Main Line. On the line of route it made a connection with several collieries. It opened on 2 October 1876. Sponsored by the L&OR; from the outset, it was amalgamated with it in 1876, and worked by the GWR like its parent company. In 1877 a further line was built by the L&OR; from a junction between Tondu and Brynmenyn and the Llanharan line of the C&OR; (Bryncethin Junction to Ynysawdre Junction); it opened on 1 May 1877. These lines were for mineral traffic only and never carried passenger trains. From 1889 the Barry Railway opened its connection from Peterston to Drope Junction and Barry, giving a useful connection to the docks there. Blaengarw The Great Western Railway promoted a further branch line to serve the central valley at Blaengarw. It was long from Brynmenin Junction, a short distance west of Tondu. There were gradients of 1 in 34 in the passenger section, and 1 in 18 in the minerals-only upper part. The passing of the Ogmore Valley Railway's Act of 28 June 1866 had sanctioned the company to construct a branch line to the Garw Valley. However, as a result of a general depression in trade, the scheme was long delayed, and it was not until 25 October 1876 that a branch line was finally opened to Blaengarw at the head of the Garw Valley. Amalgamation with the Great Western Railway The Llynvi and Ogmore Railway had been worked by the Great Western Railway since 1873. This left an ambiguity over financial responsibility for major improvements to the system, and formal amalgamation was a logical step. The L&OR; was absorbed by the GWR, from 1 July 1883. After the amalgamation the Great Western Railway made considerable alterations to the old system on the Llynfi Valley line. In 1898 Maesteg station was relocated a short distance northwards from the original location, and double track was installed. Tywith station had been opened about 1875, initially with only one platform. In 1898 a second platform was opened, and both were constructed to a longer length. Tywith Station was renamed Nantyfyllon on 1 January 1903. A new GWR station was opened at Llangonoyd in 1899; the new station was renamed Llangynwyd in March 1935. Meanwhile, Troedyrhiw Garth Station was built in the 1870s during the time when the GWR was working and managing the L&OR;, but the platform was lengthened in 1910, and shortened again in 1938. Caerau Station, at the head of the line in the Llynfi Valley, was the last station to be opened, on 1 April 1901, following the development of the Caerau district at the turn of the nineteenth century. Also in 1901 the main section of the line from Tondu to Bridgend was doubled. Finally, with the opening of Blaengarw Station on 26 May 1902, a full passenger service was provided for the three valleys‚ÄîLlynfi, Garw and Ogmore‚Äîconverging at Tondu. The poor approach to Porthcawl Dock, together with its inadequate facilities, once more made it impossible for the site to compete economically with other South Wales ports, especially as larger steamships were coming into use. Hence at the turn of the century the dock virtually ceased to function as a port, and it was closed by the GWR in 1906. Porthcawl town developed as a seaside resort with a new railway station built on the site of the old dock lines in March 1916, and during the years of the Second World War the dock was filled in. When the Vale of Glamorgan Railway was being constructed, ready for its opening in 1897, it had sought running powers to Tondu, but these were refused, and exchange sidings had to be built at Coity Junction.Peter Dale, Glamorgan's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd, 2014, Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway The mineral wealth of the Rhondda Valley proved immensely lucrative to the Taff Vale Railway, and later others, in conveying coal to Bristol Channel ports for shipment. At the end of the 1870s, the Swansea harbour authorities were expanding their dock facilities, and wished to bring more business in their direction. The Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway was authorised on 10 August 1882. Construction involved a tunnel from the head of the Afan valley to Blaenrhondda, and the rock was exceptionally hard, making the construction supremely difficult. The Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway opened from Aberavon to Cymmer was opened on 2 November 1885, and the R&SBR; opened a station there alongside the L&OR; (GWR) station. Opening of the tunnel was much delayed: the line was opened from Cymmer to Blaengwynfi, short of the tunnel, on 2 June 1890, and through the tunnel to Blaenrhondda on 2 July 1890.Alfred W Arthurton, The Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, in the Railway Magazine, March 1914 Port Talbot Railway and Dock On 31 August 1897 the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company opened its mineral line through Maesteg, on a sinuous west to east alignment crossing over the L&OR; route. At first this terminated at Lletty Brongu, but on 17 January 1898 the line was extended further, to Pontyrhyll, where it made a junction with the Garw branch. Running powers up the Garw line had been sought but refused, so Pontyrhyll was an exchange point. These incursions were followed on 19 December 1898 by a line‚Äîthe \\"Ogmore Valleys Extension\\" of the PTR&D;‚Äîfrom Port Talbot along the coast, turning east over the South Wales main line to a junction with the L&OR; line at Cefn Junction, giving access towards Tondu. At the same time a spur to Pyle, entering from the north west, was opened. This followed the course of a tramway that had existed since before 1876. The Grouping of the Railways in 1922 Following the difficult operating conditions during World War I the Government decided to restructure most of the railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, a process called the \\"Grouping\\", by the Railways Act 1921. The South Wales railway companies became part of a new Great Western Railway. The L&OR; group of lines had been part of the Great Western Railway since 1883, but the process did away with the competition with other South Wales companies. The first of the amalgamations took effect on 1 January 1922 and contributed to a passenger connecting service with the former L&OR; and the former R&SBR; at Cymmer, the result of which provided a through service from the Llynfi Valley to the Rhondda via the tunnel at the head of the Afan Valley. From 1923 The passenger service between Blackmill, Hendreforgan and Gilfach Goch was withdrawn on 5 March 1928, but local protests succeeded in getting the service restored; however this was now from the east instead of from Blackmill, and established travel patterns were not catered for. Final closure followed on 22 September 1930. The mineral line of the Cardiff and Ogmore Railway between C&O; Junction and Bryncethin Junction was closed completely on 28 July 1938. Pyle west Loop was laid out before the second world war but only commissioned on 15 September 1946. As a south to west curve, it was used by limestone traffic between Cornelly Sidings and the Abbey steelworks, and by morning and evening residential passenger trains between Swansea and Porthcawl. From 1948 Following World War II the Government again imposed a restructuring process on the railways of Great Britain: they were taken into national ownership under British Railways. At the same time the mineral industries were declining, and the population also was diminishing as workers moved to other parts of the country for work. The rise of efficient road-based public transport hit the viability of the passenger train services. The Blaengarw branch passenger service was discontinued from 9 February 1953, and the Ogmore Vale Branch lost the Nantymoel service on 5 May 1958. =1960s closures= The R&SBR; line and the GWR (L&OR;) line ran parallel and adjacent from Cymmer to Blaengwynfi. In 1960 expensive repairs to Gelli Tunnel and Groeserw Viaduct on the R&SBR; line became necessary, and instead a connection between the two routes was made, enabling trains on the R&SBR; route to use of the GWR line, by-passing the defective section, which was closed. The L&OR; line was connected into the R&SBR; station, and east of the station a slue was made back into it. A new junction was made some distance west of Blaengwynfi, where the two routes separated once again. The new arrangement was commissioned on 13 June 1960. On the same day however Abergwynfi Station, at the head of the former L&OR; Extension line in the Afan Valley, was closed to passenger traffic. The service from Bridgend via Cymmer Afan was transferred to Blaengwynfi station. Goods traffic continued to use the Abergwynfi Station until 27 May 1963. On 3 December 1962 the Treherbert to Swansea passenger service on the former R&SBR; was withdrawn, and replaced by a new diesel rail car service between Treherbert and Bridgend over the rearranged lines at Cymmer. From 18 April 1964 nearly all the L&OR; network was diesel hauled, following re-organisation of Tondu locomotive depot. On 5 June 1961 the section from Gellyrhaidd Junction to Gilfach Goch was closed completely. The Porthcawl branch and the Pyle to Tondu service was closed to passengers on 9 September 1963, and the entire Porthcawl branch closed to all traffic on 1 February 1965. Llanharan Junction was severed on 3 December 1962 and remaining C&O; served pits around Wern Tarw reached from Bryncethin Junction and the Pencoed branch. Known afterwards as the Raglan branch, the Ogmore Junction to Wern Tarw section continued in operation but it was later closed in September 1983. The R&SB; line in the Afan Valley was closed from Duffryn Rhondda down to Aberavon and Briton Ferry in 1964. From that time coal from Duffryn Rhondda Colliery was hauled up the valley to Cymmer, and after reversal, taken down the L&OR; route to Bridgend via Maesteg. However Duffryn Rhondda colliery closed in October 1966. Freight operation in the Garw and Ogmore branches ceased on 22 March 1965, but coal traffic continued until final closure in 1980.Barrie and Baughan, pages 184 to 186 =1970s closures= The passenger service between Bridgend and Treherbert continued longer than some of the others, because of the mountainous terrain and the difficulty of securing reliable replacement bus services. It closed down on 22 June 1970, although school trains continued between Cymmer and Llangynwyd until 14 July 1970. The section between Nantyffyllon and Caerau closed for freight traffic on 7 September 1976 and was formally closed on 7 March 1977. Traffic from Caerau Colliery continued to travel via the Coegnant inlet to the Maesteg Colliery until the closure of Caerau Colliery on 27 August 1977. Traffic lower down the line was also lost in 1977 with the closure of the Llynfi Power Station which had been opened in 1943. Further traffic was lost in 1981 when the Bridgend Paper Mills traffic transferred to road transport; the small mines and coal yard traffic at Maesteg station ended when Coegnant Colliery ceased production in 1981. 1992 reopening to passengers On 26 October 1992 the line between Bridgend and Maesteg was reopened by British Rail and Mid Glamorgan County Council for passenger trains. New stations were provided at Wildmill and Sarn, just south of the site of the former Aberkenfig station, Garth, a little north of the former Troedyrhiew Garth station, Maesteg Ewenny Road, and Maesteg, a little south of the original Maesteg station. L&OR; locomotives =Broad gauge 0-6-0ST= * Ada (1862-1868) * Una (1862-1868) The railway owned two 0-6-0STs for goods traffic. Built by Slaughter, Grunning and Company, they were similar to the South Devon Railway Dido class built at around the same time. In 1868 they were exchanged for standard gauge locomotives from the West Cornwall Railway, which had recently been rebuilt to allow broad gauge trains to run through from the Great Western Railway to Penzance. In 1876 Ada and Una became GWR 2146 and 2147 respectively. They were withdrawn in 1884 and 1886. =Broad gauge 4-4-0ST= * Rosa (1863-1868) The railway owned a single 4-4-0ST passenger tank locomotive.

Summary  Don't ever let them know you're here. 'Our religion is for every day we live, every living moment. You mustn't ever raise your voice or call out... people outside might hear you... Frances had a good life until her aunt marries Mr Tyrell. Frances is pushed into a sinister mansion enclosed by unclimbable walls. At first she trustingly accepts her aunt's new life, and tries to be a 'worthy member of the temple'. But as she uncovers its sinister secrets she realises she has to escape .....  Characters  Frances, the main character, is a 12-year-old girl. She constantly moves from one apartment to another with Aunt Loris, always hoping the new one will be better than the last. Frances is obedient, yet curiosity overpowers her morality at times. Mr. Tyrell, whose full name is Finley Tyrell, is the father of Rosgrana, Claire and Helen. He is intimidating in his ways due to his firm belief of an upcoming war that ends the world. Quite suppressing, Mr. Tyrell abides the laws of the temple so fiercely that he is quite an ominous person to Frances. Aunt Loris, Frances's aunt and guardian, has trouble maintaining her work and has to move constantly, taking Frances with her. Unsurprisingly, she cannot find herself a suitable husband until she meet Mr Tyrell. Her love for him is so strong that she pursues Mr. Tyrell's temple's religion with the hope of acceptance. Rosgrana, Helen and Claire are Mr. Tyrell's girls who have been brought up in the ways of the temple. Rosgrana, the eldest, is extremely faithful and studious. She is often left in charge of the house when Mr Tyrell has to go and run errands 'outside' and makes utilitarian clothes for herself and the other family members, which Frances despises because they are drab and old-fashioned. Claire, the youngest daughter is very devoted to the temple and its beliefs and despises Frances because she feels that Frances is bringing evil 'outsider' ways into the house. Claire often acts as an antagonist to Frances and seems to take pleasure in telling her father when Frances breaks the rules of the house. Helen is the middle daughter and although she holds a strong tie to the beliefs of her family and the temple, an incident with another temple member, Paul, makes her start questioning the temple and its ways. Helen's doubt allows her to feel sorry for Frances and Helen ends up becoming an ally for Frances in the house which is carried on until the end of the novel.

Geography The ecoregion covers an area of , extending across portions of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, Russia, and Turkey. The main Caucasus chain, known as the Greater Caucasus, run from northwest to southeast, extending from north of the Black Sea eastwards to the Caspian Sea. The Caucasus forms the traditional border between Europe and Asia. The highest point in the Caucasus is Mount Elbrus (5,642 m). The ecoregion also includes the Lesser Caucasus or Anti-Caucasus range, which lies south of the Caucasus, as well as the eastern end of the Pontic Mountains, which extends along the southern shore of the Black Sea. Climate The climate is temperate, and varies with elevation. Average annual rainfall is generally higher in the western portion of the ecoregion, ranging from 1500 to 2000 mm in the western ranges along the Black Sea, to 600 to 1000 mm at the eastern and southern portions of the range. Flora The ecoregion's plant communities vary with elevation. Temperate mixed forests extend from 400 to 2200 meters elevation, covering about 70% of the ecoregion's area. Broadleaf trees are predominant at lower elevations, transitioning to conifer-dominated forests at higher elevations. Between 400 and 1000 meters elevation, Georgian oak (Quercus iberica) and European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) are the dominant trees, along with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) in the more humid western mountains. Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis) is dominant between 1000 and 1500 meters elevation, with Caucasian oak (Quercus macranthera) dominant in drier areas. Conifers become dominant above 1500 meters elevation, including Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana), Caucasian spruce (Picea orientalis), and Caucasian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. hamata). Dwarf forests occur near the treeline at 1800 to 2000 meters elevation, mostly of birches (Betula pubescens var. litwinowii and Betula raddeana) in more humid areas, and oriental oak and Caucasian pine in drier areas. Subalpine grasslands occur from 1800 to 2500 meters elevation, and alpine meadows from 2500 to 3000 meters, interspersed with thickets of Rhododendron caucasicum between 2000 and 2800 meters, and areas of rock scree. Sub-nival plants and lichens grow from 3000 to 4000 meters elevation. Fauna Large hoofed mammals include the East Caucasian tur (Capra cylindricornis), West Caucasian tur (Capra caucasica), Caucasian chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra caucasica), mouflon (Ovis orientalis gmelini), Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral), and wild goat (Capra aegagrus). The East Caucasian Tur and West Caucasian Tur are endemic to the eastern and western portions of the Caucasus Mountains, respectively. Large mammal predators include the Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), and Caucasus leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana). The ecoregion is home to the raptors golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus). Other resident birds include the Caucasian grouse (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi), Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus), great rosefinch (Carpodacus rubicilla), and G√ºldenst√§dt's redstart (Phoenicurus erythrogaster). Native water birds include the gadwall (Mareca strepera), whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus), common pochard (Aythya ferina), greater scaup (Aythya marila), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and Dalmatian pelican (Pelicanus crispus). Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 30,540 km¬≤, or 18%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include the Lagodekhi Protected Areas, Borjomi-Kharagauli and Tusheti National Parks, Zagatala State Reserve, and Caucasus Biosphere Reserve.

Microtransactions are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers. While microtransactions are a staple of the mobile app market, they are also seen on PC software such as Valve's Steam digital distribution platform, as well as console gaming. Free-to-play games that include a microtransaction model are sometimes referred to as \\"freemium\\". Another term, \\"pay-to-win\\", is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to games where buying items in-game can give a player a disproportionate advantage over other players, particularly if the items cannot be obtained through free means. The objective with a free-to- play microtransaction model is to involve more players in the game by providing desirable items or features that players can purchase if they lack the skill or available time to earn these through regular game play. Also, presumably the game developer's marketing strategy is that in the long term, the revenue from a micro transaction system will outweigh the revenue from a one-time-purchase game. Loot boxes are another form of microtransactions. Through purchasing a loot box, the player acquires a seemingly random assortment of items. Loot boxes are mostly used on PC and console games. The concept behind loot boxes is that, despite gaining more items for a given price, the player may not want those items, and can end up buying the same item multiple times. Instead of a one-time purchase for the desired item, users may have to buy multiple boxes. This method has also been called a form of underage gambling. Items and features available by microtransaction can range from cosmetic (such as decorative character attire) to functional (such as weapons and items). Some games allow players to purchase items that can be acquired through normal means, but some games include items that can only be obtained through microtransaction. Some developersAn example of a game like this is Path of Exile ensure that only cosmetic items are available this way to keep gameplay fair and balanced. The reasons why people, especially children, continue to pay for microtransactions are embedded in human psychology. There has been considerable discussion over microtransactions and their effects on children. Microtransactions are most commonly provided through a custom store interface placed inside the app for which the items are being sold. Apple provides a framework dubbed \\"in-app purchases\\" for initiating and processing transactions. Google's framework for the same use is referred to as \\"in-app billing\\", named more from the developer's point of view. Apple and Google both take 30 percent of all revenue generated by microtransactions sold through in-app purchases in their respective app stores.Apple's App Store: An economy for 1 percent of developers. CNET. Retrieved July 9, 2014. Steam offers support for microtransactions in games on its platform through the Steamworks SDK.  History  Initially, microtransactions in games took the form of exchanging real-life money for the virtual currency used in the game that the user was playing. Notable examples of games that used this model in the early 2000s include the social networking site Habbo Hotel (2001), developed by the Finnish company Sulake, and Linden Lab's 2003 virtual world game Second Life. Both free games allow users to customize the clothing and style of their characters, buy and collect furniture, and purchase special, 'flashy' animations to show off to others using some type of virtual currency. Habbo Hotel uses 3 different kinds of currency: Credits (or coins), Duckets (which are earned through accomplishing specific achievements during gameplay), and Diamonds. Diamonds are only obtained through buying Credits with real-life money. In Second Life, the Linden Dollar (L$) is the virtual currency used to power the game's internal economy. L$ can be bought with real money through a marketplace developed by Linden Lab themselves, LindeX. Second Life in particular have generated massive amounts of economic activity and profits for both Linden Lab and Second Lifes users. In September 2005, $3,596,674 worth of transactions were processed on the platform. Both games are still active today. The arcade game Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone (1990) was infamous for its use of microtransactions to purchase items in the game. It had shops where players insert coins into arcade machines to purchase upgrades, power-ups, health, weapons, special moves and player characters. The microtransaction revenue model gained popularity in South Korea with the success of Nexon's online free-to-play games, starting with QuizQuiz (1999), following by titles such as MapleStory (2003), Mabinogi (2004) and Dungeon Fighter Online (2004). In June 2008 Electronic Arts introduced an online Store for The Sims 2. It allowed players to purchase points that can be spent on in-game items. The Store has also been a part of The Sims 3 since the game's release. In The Sims 4 Electronic Arts removed the ability to buy single items, instead downloadable content is provided exclusively via expansion packs. In the early 2010s, Valve popularised the notion of microtransactions in Team Fortress 2 . Through the usage of the in-game Mann Co Store, players are able to purchase currency in 'Supply Crate Keys' to open uncrated items for form or functional use in the game. Valve followed this system with announcing Team Fortress 2 as a free to play game, dropping its $USD 20 Price Tag in 2011. The continued success of such functions has followed in other AAA Titles, such as Overwatch, Call of Duty, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Fortnite. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, games like Facebook's FarmVille (2009), Electronic Arts's The Simpsons: Tapped Out (2012) and Supercell's Clash of Clans (2012) pioneered a new approach to implanting microtransactions into games. In conjunction with having virtual currency be used to purchase items, tools, furniture, and animals, These mobile games made it so users can purchase currency and then use that currency to reduce or eliminate the wait times attached to certain actions, like planting and growing carrots or collecting taxes from the townspeople. From around 2017, another major transition in how microtransactions are implemented in games occurred. \\"Live-service\\" games, like Epic Games's Fortnite, with constantly changing and updating content, became more prevalent in the video game market. These types of games heavily employ the use of the loot box microtransaction type. According to the September 2019 report by the UK Parliament's House of Commons and the Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee, they define loot boxes as ‚Äú... items in video games that may be bought for real-world money, but which provide players with a randomised reward of uncertain value. The widespread usage of loot boxes by game developers and publishers have garnered a great amount of criticism from gamers in the past decade. Game developing corporations, like Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard, make billions of dollars through the purchase of their microtransactions. In FY2017, EA raked in around $1.68 billion and Activision Blizzard earned over $4 billion respectively. Impact Mobile web analytics company Flurry reported on July 7, 2011, that based on its research, the revenue from free-to-play games had overtaken revenue from premium games that earn revenue through traditional means in Apple's App Store, for the top 100 grossing games when comparing the results for the months of January and June 2011. It used data that it analyzed through 90,000 apps that installed the company's software in order to roughly determine the amount of revenue generated by other popular apps. They discovered that free games represented 39% of the total revenue from January, and that the number jumped to 65% by June, helped in part by the fact that over 75% of the 100 top grossing apps are games. This makes free-to-play the single most dominant business model in the mobile apps industry. They also learned that the number of people that spend money on in-game items in free- to-play games ranges from 0.5% to 6%, depending on a game's quality and mechanics. Even though this means that a large number of people will never spend money in a game, it also means that the people that do spend money could amount to a sizeable number because the game was given away for free. A later study found that over 92% of revenue generated on Android and iOS in 2013 came from free-to-play games such as Candy Crush Saga. Electronic Arts Corporate Vice-President Peter Moore speculated in June 2012 that within 5 to 10 years, all games will have transitioned to the microtransaction model. Tommy Palm of King (Candy Crush Saga) expressed in 2014 his belief that all games will eventually be free-to-play. According to Ex-BioWare developer Manveer Heir in a 2017 interview, microtransactions have become a factor in what types of games are planned for production. October 23, 2017 Free-to- play/microtransaction may be used as a response to piracy; the developers of the mobile game Dead Trigger switched the game to the free-to-play model due to a high rate of piracy.How high is 'unbelievably high' piracy? Dead Trigger dev's not saying Android Central. July 23, 2012 While microtransactions are considered a more robust and difficult to circumnavigate than digital rights management, in some cases they can be circumvented: a Russian developer created a server to fake authentication for iOS in-app purchases, allowing users to obtain microtransaction features for free. Many consumers have referred to video game micro-transactions as a means of 'milking' their product for more profit. \\"Companies take content they've already developed for their games and put it behind a paywall, asking for $20‚Äì$30 to access the 'season pass'.\\" Consumer organizations have criticized that some video games do not describe adequately that these purchases are made with real money rather than virtual currency. Also, some platforms do not require passwords to use a credit card to complete microtransactions. This has resulted in customers getting unexpectedly high bills (known as bill shocks).Selling candy to babies ‚Äì Richard Stanton, April 3, 2014  Criticism and regulation  In the mid and late 2010s, people became increasingly aware of how microtransactions operate in games, and they have become much more critical of their usage. The commonly cited issues of microtransactions from gamers are: * Loot box rewards are determined by random chance and percentages, plus they can directly influence gameplay via the items they bestow. * They sometimes cost too much money for what they are worth. For example, a bundle of 50 loot boxes in Blizzard's first-person shooter game Overwatch costs $39.99. * They may facilitate gambling behaviors in people already suffering from gambling issues. Plus, they can make people overspend money on the game, whether or not they are able to do so. * Games with loot boxes, like FIFA, can become \\"pay- to-win\\" (in order to advance past certain points, or to become the best in the game, it is virtually required to pay real money to receive in-game currency to purchase items or to pay for bigger and better items directly). * Microtransactions in games mean that gamers are paying more money after already paying $60 for the game to experience and play the full game. = Legislative efforts to regulate microtransactions = The implementation of microtransactions and the subsequent backlash from gamers and the gaming media have caused governments from all around the world to look into these games and their microtransaction mechanics. In April 2018, the Netherlands and Belgium banned the sale of microtransactions in games sold in their countries. The specific games Belgium looked closer at were EA's Star Wars Battlefront II (2017) and FIFA 18, Overwatch, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive developed by Valve. All of those game's microtransactions, except for Star Wars Battlefront II which removed their gameplay-altering microtransactions in March 2018 (but kept cosmetic microtransactions) due to players calculating that it would take over 48 hours of playing to obtain Luke Skywalker and then complaining about this extreme threshold to unlock popular characters to EA, have been determined to be \\"games of chance\\" by the Belgian government. As such, they are highly regulated by the Belgian government under their gambling laws. Games would have to remove their microtransactions in order for it to be sold in their country. If the game companies don't comply, then Belgium's government said that it will enact \\"a prison sentence of up to 5 years and a fine of up to 800,000 euros\\". While most game publishers agreed to modify their games' loot boxes in accordance with governmental laws, or otherwise as a result of negative reactions, others, such as Electronic Arts, have contested that they do not constitute as gambling. However, EA eventually complied with the Belgian government's declaration and made it so players in Belgium can not purchase FIFA Points, the premium (obtained by buying it with real money) in-game currency used in FIFAs \\"Ultimate Team\\" game mode. Professional FIFA players in Belgium were a disappointed because not being able to buy FIFA Points makes it harder for them to compete and succeed in the FIFA Global Series and the EA-sponsored e-sports competition for FIFA games, showing just how \\"pay-to-win\\" they feel FIFA Ultimate Team is. In the United States, there have been some calls to introduce legislation to regulate microtransactions in video games, whether on mobile, consoles, or PC, and numerous attempts have been made recently to pass such legislation. In November 2017, Hawaii representatives Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan, during a news conference, explained how loot boxes and microtransactions prey on children and that they are working to introduce bills into their state's house and senate. A few months later, in February 2018, they successfully put four bills onto the floor of Hawaii State Legislature. Two of those bills would make it so games containing loot boxes can not be sold to people under the age of 21, and the other two would force game publishers to put labels on the case of their games that have loot boxes in them, as well as make them be transparent about the item drop rates for the rewards in their game's loot boxes. However, all four bills failed to pass through the Hawaii State Legislature in March 2018. In May 2019, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill named \\"The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act\\" to ban loot boxes and pay-to-win microtransactions in games played by minors, using similar conditions previously outlined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. The bill received some bi-partisan support in the form of two co-sponsors from Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The United Kingdom has also been closely observing microtransactions, especially loot boxes, and their effects on children. A major report by the UK Parliament's House of Commons and the Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee, released in September 2019, called for the banning or regulation of microtransactions and loot boxes to children as well as having the games industry to take up more responsibility with regards to protecting players from the harms of microtransactions that simulate gambling. Specifically, the committee's conclusion is that microtransactions should be classified as gambling in the UK and therefore subject to current gambling and age-restriction laws. In October 2019, the Children's Commissioner for England, which promotes and protects children's rights, released a report describing the experiences, thoughts, and effects, positive and negative, of gaming on children ages 10‚Äì16. Within the report, some of the children directly stated to the interviewers that the microtransactions and loot boxes that they encounter and subsequently buy, are just like gambling. The report concludes that showing the odds and percentages of certain microtransactions to players does not go far enough and does not actually solve the problem. Instead, they suggest that certain new features to protect children should be implemented in all games featuring microtransactions, like showing the all- time spending on a child's in-game account and having limits on the amount someone can spend daily. Additionally, they push for game developers and publishers to stop pressuring children to spend money on microtransactions in their games in order to progress through the game and for Parliament to change their current gambling laws to declare loot boxes as gambling and subject to gambling laws.  Psychology and ethics  Alongside questioning the legality of the extensive use of microtransactions, some gamers have also questioned the morality and ethics of selling microtransactions, especially to children. Researchers have studied the natural psychology behind both the selling and purchase of microtransactions. = Psychology = According to a post made by Gabe Duverge on the Touro University Worldwide (TUW) website, impulse buying is a significant part of the psychology behind people buying microtransactions. Essentially, many games, especially in the realm of mobile games and the \\"free-to-play\\" market, force a decision from the player to keep playing or not via a limited time pop-up on the screen that tells them that if they pay a certain amount of money (usually about 99 cents or a dollar), they can keep playing where they left off. This is another type of microtransaction and it has become increasingly common in the mobile games sphere as of late. Another psychological aspect that is used to get players to continue playing and buying microtransactions is called loss aversion. When a player continues to lose over and over again, they begin to crave the dopamine-filled, positive feelings that they feel when they win. As such, they become more inclined to spend money for items that will help them achieve that elusive win. Then when they do win, the player attributes their win with the item that they just bought, making it more likely that they will spend money whenever the player gets on a losing streak, and so the cycle continues on. = Ethics of selling microtransactions to children = During the past two decades, gaming has emerged as one of the top options children go to as a means of alleviating boredom. In an August 2019 report conducted by Parent Zone in the UK, they studied and gathered data directly from children between the ages of 10‚Äì16 years old about their experiences with online gaming and the microtransactions that the games that they play hold, as well as ask about how the microtransactions in these games have affected them (and/or their parents) socially and financially.  Statistics  According to the Parent Zone study, in the United Kingdom, 97% of boys and 90% of girls ages 10‚Äì16 years old play video games. About 93% of the entire 10‚Äì16 years old age group in the U.K. play video games, and many of them like to play games through online play. Numerous common online games that children tend to play, like Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite, contain and push some sort of microtransaction for the children, or their parents, to buy. The primary items bought by children in these games are largely cosmetic items, specifically \\"skins\\", which are simply costumes for their in-game avatar. In the case of Fortnite, many of the skins are locked behind a \\"battle pass\\" that the player must pay for. A \\"battle pass\\" is a tiered system where the player buys the pass. By completing challenges and missions, they earn in-game items like weapons, skins, experience, emotes (special animations used to taunt opponents, celebrate victories, dance, and show-off), and more. It is about $9.50 (or 950 of Fortnites in-game virtual currency, V-Bucks), but the player can pay about $28 (or 2,800 V-Bucks) instead to unlock the battle pass and they automatically complete the first 25 tiers (out of 100 tiers) of it. A majority of the children surveyed feel that these kinds of microtransaction systems in their online games are complete rip-offs. 76% of them also believe that these online games purposely try to squeeze as much money as possible from them when they play the game. About half of the children expressed that they need to spend money on the game in order for it to be fun to them; this is due to many of these games' features, which are modes that the children want to play and experience, being locked behind microtransaction paywalls. As such, there is a large gap between the gaming experiences that non-paying players have and the experiences that paying players have. Some other statistics and thoughts regarding loot boxes specifically were also collected from the children. Out of the 60% of children that know about loot boxes, a majority (91%) stated that the online games they play contain loot boxes in them, 59% of them would rather pay for in-game content individually and directly instead of through a collective and randomized loot box, and 44% believe that if loot boxes were eliminated from their online games the games would actually be a lot better. Plus, 40% of the children who played a game with loot boxes in them paid for one, too. Overall, the report stated that of the children who were generally unhappy with the games they paid for or were gifted, 18% felt that way because certain features had to be bought after paying for the game already, effectively making is so they had to pay more than the normal, full-price of the game in order to play the full game. The game was simply just not worth paying for to 35% of the unsatisfied children and 18% of them also felt that in-game microtransactions were not worth paying for either. Ultimately, children feel that spending money on microtransactions has become the norm and an expectation when playing modern video games. = Social = For many children, the excitement that they feel when they open loot boxes, packs, and obtain items through microtransactions is very addictive to them. Opening these random boxes without knowing what is inside, to them, is the same as opening a present. The excitement and suspense is amplified when the experience is felt alongside friends. In the UK Children's Commissioner's report, the children who played FIFA feel that opening player packs are a game within the game. To them, opening packs creates variety because they can play some football games in the Ultimate Team game mode and then open some packs when they get bored of playing normal football matches. Children might want to fit-in by paying for microtransactions and loot boxes and obtaining very rare items in front of their friends, creating a lot of hype and excitement among them. This makes paying for microtransactions a very positive experience for them. However, when children buy items in front of their friends, peer pressure often set in. Friends pressuring the player to continue buying packs hoping that they will be able to see them get a rare item can cause the player to spend more than they may actually be able to. The pressure to spend money on in-game content also stems from children seeing their friends have these special, rare items, and them wanting to have it themselves. Essentially, when everyone around them has it, they will want it too in order to feel like a part of the group. Peer pressure is not the only way children's social gaming experiences are altered. As noted in both the Parent Zone report and the Children's Commissioner's assessment, children who play Fortnite, explained that classism, as in discrimination against people of different economic and social classes, exists among the players of the game. Some children fear that if they have the free 'default' skin in Fortnite, no one, friends nor random strangers, will want to play with them as the default skin is seen as a symbol of a player being bad at the game. The default skin is used as judgement and an insult against the player who's in-game avatar wears it, too. Players wearing default skins are considered 'financially poor' and very 'uncool' by their peers and the game's community, so children spend money on microtransactions in order to avoid having that 'tag' or target on them. The media that children consume outside of the game can also affect their social interactions and in-game spending. A popular mode of entertainment for children is watching YouTube videos of other people playing their favorite games. In the case of FIFA, children watch their favorite and most popular YouTubers constantly open player packs in the Ultimate Team game mode. Unlike the children however, the YouTubers have a lot more money to spend on packs as creating entertaining YouTube videos are their jobs and major source of income. The children watch in anticipation, wondering what rare players the pack may produce. Then, they see the jubilant, over-the-top screaming and reactions from the YouTuber, which makes the children happy, too, despite them not actually getting the player themselves. As a result, they go into the game and spend a lot of money buying player packs hoping to get a rare player just like the YouTuber that they just watched. = Financial = The amount of money that children spend on microtransactions has continued to grow because the design of these online games, as well as other outside influences, have made spending money for in-game content an essential aspect of the game itself. In the UK, different cases of children unknowingly spending money from their parents and their own in order to get what they want or need to progress through the game have surfaced. In one instance, the father of a family with four children all under 10 years old, bought an ‚Ç§8 FIFA Ultimate Team player pack for them. In the span of three weeks, the children kept spending money on packs, eventually spending ‚Ç§550 ($709.91) altogether, completely emptying their parents' bank account, but never receiving one of the best players in the game as well as the children's favorite player: Lionel Messi. The children apologized to their parents and explained that at the time they did not understand how much they were impacting the family's financial situation. There have been other situations where UK children spent ‚Ç§700 ($903.53), ‚Ç§1,000 ($1290.75), ‚Ç§2,000 ($2581.50), and even ‚Ç§3,160 ($4078.77) on microtransactions in various mobile games, usually as a result of them getting tricked by the game to pay for something in-game or just not understanding that real money was being taken out of their, or their parents', bank accounts when they bought items in-game. Spending such large amounts of money on microtransactions have devastated some families financially, including some who had to pay a bill full of microtransaction payments with college savings and even money in life savings accounts. In the Children's Commissioner's study, children reported spending more and more money with each coming year, despite also feeling that because they are rewarded completely unknown items, they feel like they may be wasting money, too. One of the children that played FIFA in the study said that they spend anywhere from ‚Ç§10 ($12.91) a day to upwards of ‚Ç§300 ($387.23) in one year, sometimes even buying multiple player packs at one time. Some children have also stated that they have seen friends, their siblings, and acquaintances who have mental disorders spend all of their birthday money on in-game microtransactions, all while feeling like spending that money has not been a waste despite them not receiving any valuable items.  Data  Microtransactions have become increasingly common in many types of video games. Smartphone, console, and PC games all have conformed to the use of microtransactions due to its high profitability. Many companies and games, especially smartphone games, have taken on a business model that offer their games for free and then relying purely on the success of microtransactions to turn a profit. = Ethics = The collection of this data on consumers, although technically legal in the United States, or outside the EU, can be considered unethical. Companies can sell data about consumers, involving their spending, bank information, and preferences, to understand the consumer better overall, making business models for gaming companies safer and more profitable. With microtransactions under a negative spotlight from the gaming community, there may be displeasure from those who are aware that their data is being shared to make microtransactions possible. = Revenue = Data from a variety of sources show that microtransactions can vastly increase a companies' profits. Three free-to-play mobile games that made heavy use of the practice, Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, and Game of War, were all in the top five most profitable mobile games of 2016. Microtransactions are also used in larger budget games as well, such as Grand Theft Auto V (2013) generating more revenue through them than retail sales by the end of 2017. This trend was consistent with many other popular games at the time, leading to the practice being widespread in the 2010s.

Its name comes from its characteristic small berry size and tight clusters. It is known under a variety of local names such as Moscato bianco, Muscat blanc, Muscat Canelli, Muscat de Frontignan, Muscat de Lunel, Muscat d'Alsace, Muskateller, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Moscatel ros√© and S√°rgamuskot√°ly. While technically a white grape, there are strains of Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains vines that produce berries that are pink or reddish brown. The same vine could potentially produce berries of one color one year and a different color the next.Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes, p. 146 Webster International Publishers These strains are more prevalent in Australia, where the grape is also known as Frontignac and Brown Muscat. South Africa's Muskadel strain tends to show the same darker characteristics.J. Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines, p. 183 Mitchell Beazley 1986 . Variants where the differing grape colour is stable are typically classified as separate grape varieties Muscat Rouge √† Petit Grains for red skin colour and Muscat Rose √† Petit Grains for pink skin colour. Uses A Moscato d'Asti wine from Piedmont, Italy In Greece, the grape is found on the island of Samos and near Patras in the Peloponnese. On Samos, it produces a Vin Doux Naturelle, aromatic dry white wines and a Liastos or straw wine. The high quality wines come from vineyards between 500 and 1000 metres above sea level. Near Patras it is used to produce a Vin Doux Naturelle. In Italy, the grape is the most widely planted member of the Muscat family and is most commonly known as Moscato Bianco. It is the oldest known variety grown in Piedmont and is the primary component of the Asti and Moscato d'Asti wines, as well as for the aromatized and fortified vermouths. It is also commonly used for fortified dessert wines as well as the semi-sparkling Frizzante. In France, the grape is used as a blending grape with Grenache blanc and Muscat of Alexandria in vins doux naturels wines from the Frontignan area such as Banyuls, C√¥tes d'Agly, Grand Roussillon, Rivesaltes and St-Jean de Minervois. It is the primary grape in the Rh√¥ne wine Muscat de Beaumes-de- Venise and a blending grape with Clairette blanc in the recherch√© sparkling wine Clairette de Die (brand label Tradition). In Alsace, it is known for the highly aromatic and dry wines that it produce.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible, p. 285 Workman Publishing 2001 . In the H√©rault region it is the primary grape for Muscat de Mireval. In Spain, the grape is primarily called Moscatel de Grano Menudo, and it is the second most planted Muscat for wine. It is found across Spain, with the majority of the plantings in Castilla-La Mancha. Spain grew of Moscatel de Grano Menudo in 2015. Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains growing in Weinsberg under the synonym Gelber Muskateller Viticulture Its viticultural characteristics makes it prone to producing low yields and a susceptibility to mildew and the grape berry moth.J. Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines, p. 185 Mitchell Beazley 1986 It also tends to fall victim to leaf roll, odium and grey rot and requires a long growing season as it tends to bud early and ripen late.Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes, p. 148 Webster International Publishers . It ripens early in Australia for production of low alcohol moscato style wines. Picking can commence in early February. Picking for fortified production can take place in mid-March; this would be regarded as mid-season, not late. Muscat blanc √† petits grains is one of the first harvests in France, starting as early as mid August, in Mireval and other areas of the mediterranean basin, in hot dry years like 2009. The grapes used to produce the fruity sec are picked about seven to ten days earlier than the grapes used to produce the Vin Doux Naturel. Vendange tardive (late harvest) of the grapes is also made to exploit the high sugar and flavour concentrations. History Ampelographers have identified the grape with the Anathelicon moschaton grape used by the Ancient Greeks and the Apiane vines planted by the Romans (so named because of the fondness that insects, such as bees (Latin apis), have for devouring the flesh of the grapes). It was probably first introduced to France by the Greeks through their trading port at Marseille and later spread to the Narbonne region by Romans in their conquest of Gaul. It was a chief export of Frontignan by the time of Charlemagne and plantings were recorded in Germany by the 12th century. It became a popular planting in Alsace by the 16th century.Oz Clarke & M. Rand Encyclopedia of Grapes, p. 147 Webster International Publishers . It was introduced to South Africa in the 18th century and became the mainstay of the famous Vin de Constance. It is believed that the grapes were sourced in Frontignan.The Oxford Companion to Wine. \\"Constantia\\". Synonyms Muscat Blanc √† Petits Grains is known under a large number of synonyms, the more popular of which include Muscat Canelli, various combinations with the word Frontignan, and in North Macedonia and Serbia is known as Tamjanika. In Austria (and Germany) it is known as Gelber Muskateller. In Spain it is called Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Moscatel Castellano, Moscatel Commun, Moscatel de Frontignan, Moscatel de Grano Peque√±o, Moscatel Fino, Moscatel Morisco, and Moscatell Gra Menut in Catalan. This grape is often confused with the distinct and separate grape varieties Muscat of Alexandria (aka Zibibbo in Sicily; aka Hanepoot in South Africa) and Muscat Ottonel, most common in Austria and Alsace but originally bred in Loire Valley in 1852.

Such algorithms are technically exponential functions of their input size and are therefore not considered polynomial. For example, the NP-hard knapsack problem can be solved by a dynamic programming algorithm requiring a number of steps polynomial in the size of the knapsack and the number of items (assuming that all data are scaled to be integers); however, the runtime of this algorithm is exponential time since the input sizes of the objects and knapsack are logarithmic in their magnitudes.

It was a passenger variant of GE's U30C design purchased by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. ATSF had purchased ten U28CG locomotives in 1966, but while these locomotives were satisfactory operationally, they looked like freight locomotives, not passenger locomotives. Desiring smooth-sided passenger power, the railroad ordered the first cowl units from both GE and GM-EMD. GE produced the U30CG to meet this requirement. It was identical to a U30C except that the bodywork was replaced with a full-width long hood with fluted stainless-steel panels, and a full- width rounded nose and slanted cab front were fitted. GE's original design had the rounded nose flush with the pilot front, but the Santa Fe rejected this, and the locomotives were fitted with a front walkway. The locomotives were painted in the Santa Fe's famous Warbonnet colors, in exactly the same style as the railroad's F units ‚Äî unlike the modified scheme used on the U28CGs. The six production locomotives were delivered to the ATSF (road numbers 400-405) in November 1967, a month before EMD's competing FP45s. The locomotives' initial primary assignment was to the Grand Canyon Limited between Chicago and Los Angeles, but they were also seen on the Super Chief as well as secondary trains such as the Texas Chief and the San Diegan. All this came to an end on February 9, 1969 when a U30CG derailed hauling the Grand Canyon Limited on Edelstein Hill near Chillicothe, Illinois. The U30CG design was suspected, and both classes of GE passenger locomotives were placed on freight assignments, and never were reinstated to passenger service. Shortly, the U30CGs were renumbered to #8000‚Äì8005 and over time were repainted into blue and yellow (either the old freight scheme or Warbonnet), had their steam generators removed, the openings covered, and the shared fuel/water underbody tanks converted to fuel only for greater range. They were used mainly in Colorado freight service and other secondary assignments until September 22, 1980, when they were traded in to GE for new GE B36-7 locomotives.

He is also the author of bestselling books on Eminem, AC/DC and Artie Lange. Since 2005 he has co- authored numerous autobiographies of artists including Slash, INXS, and Tommy Lee. Career Bozza started his career as an intern in 1995 at Rolling Stone, fact-checking, coffee-fetching and doing research for other writers before they hired him full-time in the music department. He answered phones, edited columns and did the odd story, but his big break came after a friend turned him on to an unsigned white rapper from Detroit named Eminem. That tape of a live Eminem freestyle was unlike anything he‚Äôd ever heard. He began talking the rapper up to his editors, who told him that if Eminem ever got signed they would let Anthony write a short blurb about him. A year later, Bozza wrote the first national cover story on Eminem. Bozza wrote six more cover stories, numerous features, and countless other articles during his seven-year tenure at Rolling Stone. He wrote and edited the ‚ÄúRandom Notes‚Äù section for two years, joining the ranks of ‚ÄúRandom Notes‚Äù alumni like Cameron Crowe and MTV's Kurt Loder. In 2002 he left the magazine to write Whatever You Say I Am: The Life and Times of Eminem, which was born of the unparalleled access and hours he had spent with Eminem while working on his Rolling Stone features and beyond. Janet Maslin, culture critic at the New York Times, wrote that it was a ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù investigation of the ‚ÄúShadyfication of America.‚Äù The book was a New York Times bestseller and an international bestseller, topping lists in England, Germany, France and South America. Bozza followed this up by co-writing memoirs with various musicians and other celebrities. His first such book was with M√∂tley Cr√ºe drummer Tommy Lee, the New York Times Bestseller Tommyland. A biography of Australian legends INXS followed. Then came what Rolling Stone ranked one of the top 5 rock autobiographies of all time, the New York Times Bestseller Slash, co-written with the notoriously taciturn Guns N' Roses guitarist. Bozza moved into the comedy world next, with the autobiography of stand-up veteran and Howard Stern co-host Artie Lange, Too Fat to Fish. The book debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and remained there for twenty-two weeks. Bozza returned to music analysis with his next book, the critically acclaimed Why AC/DC Matters, which inspired a series of \\"Why _ Matters\\" books in AC/DC‚Äôs native Australia, Bozza‚Äôs tome being Volume 1.

Anthony Bozza has also written for magazines and newspapers worldwide, including Spin, Maxim, The New York Times, The Guardian/Observer (UK), Q, Mojo, Paper, Nylon, Blender, Radar and Playboy. In 2010, along with writer Neil Strauss, he embarked on a three-year experiment in publishing and launched Igniter Literary Group, an imprint of Harper Collins‚Äô It Books. Bozza and Artie Lange co-wrote another book, Crash and Burn, in 2013, which recounts Lange‚Äôs lifelong struggle with drug addiction and depression and his near suicide. In 2015, Bozza co-wrote Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood's memoir, Play On: Now, Then, and Fleetwood Mac. Bozza worked with Courtney Love to co-write her memoir, tentatively titled Girl with the Most Cake, but the experience ended in acrimony. Bozza submitted Love a manuscript in 2014 that he was quite pleased with, later calling it \\"possibly the greatest thing I‚Äôll ever do with anybody\\". Love, however, disliked it, and said in an interview that the text made her sound like she was \\"jacked on coffee and sugar in a really bad mood\\". Love refused to pay Bozza for the work he had done, and he sued her in 2015 for lack of payment.

The wine is sweet and low in alcohol, and is considered a dessert wine. A related wine, Asti, is produced in the same area from the same grape. Grown in the hilltop town of Asti in Montferrat, Piedmont, Moscato d‚ÄôAsti is made by small producers in small batches. Moscato is named such because of its earthy musky aroma. The ancient Romans called it the apiana. In the Medieval ages, it was popular, and documents that attest to its presence in Piedmont date as far back as the 14th century.Wine Pass Italy Piedmont winemakers traditionally make this low alcohol wine with Muscat √† Petits Grains, also known as Moscato bianco. This petite berry varietal ripens early and produces a wide range of wine styles: light and dry, slightly sweet and sparkling or a rich, honey-like dessert wine. History Cultivated for hundreds of years in the Piedmont DOCG in Italy, Moscato bianco is considered one of the oldest grapes grown in that area. Although Moscato has been cultivated and made in the area, modern production of Moscato d‚ÄôAsti as it is known now began in the 1870s. Made in the frizzante style, Moscato d'Asti was the wine that winemakers made for themselves. This low-alcohol wine could be drunk at noontime meals and would not slow down the winemaker or his workers. After the workday was done, the Piemontese tradition of long, multicourse evening meals gave Moscato d'Asti the purpose of a digestif that cleansed the palate and stimulated the palate for dessert. Winemaking A pink Moscato d'Asti made in the ros√© style. The cooler region in which Moscato bianco is grown and produced has an optimal blend of limestone and sandstone soil that allows for adequate hydration and brings out the flavor of the grapes. The grapes are harvested when the brix is optimal and then crushed. The must is chilled almost to the point of freezing to halt the fermentation process. By law, Moscato D‚ÄôAsti can only contain 5.5% abv so the fermentation process is halted leaving much of the natural sugars remaining in the wine. Unlike Champagne, there is no secondary fermentation allowed in the bottle. Right before bottling, the Moscato d‚ÄôAsti goes through a filtration process that leaves the wine with a translucent golden color. In popular culture From 2011 to 2014, Moscato d‚ÄôAsti sales in the U.S. increased 73% and sales have risen around 10-15% per year among consumers under the age of 45. Such rise has been attributed to the affordability of the wine (most range from $10‚Äì20) and its popularity in hip-hop culture: Trey Songz and with Drake referenced Moscato in a verse of the 2009 song \\"I Invented Sex\\", which contributed to the popularity of the wine.

It makes use of this thermal gradient, or the dissipative structure of convection in this gradient, to drive a microscopic heat engine that performs condensation reactions. Thus negative entropy is generated. The components of the biological thermosynthesis machinery concern progenitors of today's ATP synthase, which functions according to the binding change mechanism, driven by chemiosmosis. Resembling primitive free energy generating physico-chemical processes based on temperature-dependent adsorption to inorganic materials such as clay, this simple type of energy conversion is proposed to have sustained the origin of life, including the emergence of the RNA World. For this RNA World it gives a model that describes the stepwise acquisition of the set of transfer RNAs that sustains the Genetic code. The phylogenetic tree of extant transfer RNAs is consistent with the idea. Thermosynthesis may still occur in some terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. However, no organisms are known at present that use thermosynthesis as a source of energy, although it is possible that it might occur in extraterrestrial environments where no light is available, such as on the subsurface ocean that may exist on the moon Europa. Thermosynthesis also permits a simple model for the origin of photosynthesis. It has moreover been used to explain the origin of animals by symbiogenesis of benthic sessile thermosynthesizers at hydrothermal vents during the Snowball Earths of the Precambrian. Preliminary experiments have started to attempt to isolate thermosynthetic organisms. Muller's Biothermosynthesis A Dutch biochemist and physicist Anthonie Muller[1] wrote many papers on thermosynthesis since 1983. He defined thermosynthesis as: \\"Biological heat engines working on thermal cycling.\\" also as: \\"Theoretical biological mechanism for free energy gain from thermal cycling, tentatively stated as the energy source for origin of life.\\" The thermosynthesis concept, biological free energy gain from thermal cycling, is combined with the concept of the RNA World. The resulting overall origin of life model suggests new explanations for the emergence of the genetic code and the ribosome. It is proposed that the first protein named pF(1) obtained the energy to support the RNA World by a thermal variation of F(1) ATP synthase's binding change mechanism. It is further proposed that this pF(1) was the single translation product during the emergence of the genetic machinery. During thermal cycling pF(1) condensed many substrates with broad specificity, yielding NTPs and randomly constituted protein and RNA libraries that contained self-replicating RNA. The smallness of pF(1) permitted the emergence of the genetic machinery by selection of RNA that increased the fraction of pF(1)s in the protein library: (1) an amino acids concatenating progenitor of rRNA bound to (2) a chain of 'positional tRNAs' linked by mutual recognition, and yielded a pF(1) (or its main motif); this positional tRNA set gradually evolved to a set of regular tRNAs functioning according to the genetic code, with concomitant emergence of (3) an mRNA coding for pF(1).

It is part of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, created in 2000, which includes the greater Durban area. The name means \\"place of reeds\\" in the Zulu language, and the correct pronunciation of \\"hl\\" in Umhlanga is similar to the Welsh \\"ll\\". It is bordered by Durban North to the south and Mt Edgecombe to the west. It is well known for the Gateway Theatre of Shopping which is the largest shopping mall in the southern hemisphere. It also has the second tallest skyscraper in South Africa named Pearl Sky which stands 183 meters high. There are two beaches: Bronze Beach and Main Beach, both of which are patrolled by lifeguards throughout the day. Umhlanga is one of the fastest-growing cities in South Africa ‚Äì the population increased 57.5% from 15,387 in the 2001 census to 24,238 in the 2011 census. In the same way that Sandton, Gauteng is becoming the financial centre of Johannesburg, Umhlanga is becoming the main economic hub of Durban.  History  Umhlanga derives its name from the Zulu language and means \\"place of reeds\\", referring to the beds of reeds growing along the Ohlanga River north of Umhlanga Rocks. The Oyster Box, a luxury hotel since the 1950s, was originally built as a beach cottage in 1869, before the town had even been founded. In 1895, Sir Marshall Campbell founded Umhlanga. The town's first hotel was established in 1920, followed by a shop, a lighthouse, the Natal Anti Shark Measures Board (today called the KwaZulu- Natal Sharks Board) and further hotel developments.http://eprints.qut.edu.au/2238/1/2238_1.pdf The Borough of Umhlanga was formed on 1 August 1972 through the amalgamation of Umhlanga Rocks, a seaside resort town, and the suburb of La Lucia. Mr Rodney Rindel, former chairman of the La Lucia town board, was elected to mayor of the newly formed Borough of Umhlanga. Mr Rindel said that the people of La Lucia had made no secret that they were opposed to the amalgamation and were not happy with the name, but now that this had come about they would make the best of it. Rodney Rindel - Mayor of Umhlanga 1972 In the 1980s, development expanded inland growing from a small village east of the M4 highway to a large town occupying most of the area east of N2 highway and south of the Hawaan Forest. The city is seeing expansion into areas near the Hawaan forest to the north which is the natural habitat of many creatures such as the vervet monkey. The monkeys often venture into the city in search of food from residents and unsuspecting tourists. Current developments Umhlanga, specifically the former sugarcane fields of Umhlanga Ridge, has become the focus of development in the greater Durban area with many businesses relocating offices from central Durban (similarly to Sandton forming the new centre of Johannesburg), a move that has been criticized for \\"fragmenting the urban fabric\\" and furthering \\"the new apartheid\\" in Durban. In 2010, Durban International Airport was moved to La Mercy, near Umhlanga, and reopened as King Shaka International Airport. Due to the economic boom in the Umhlanga area as well as the new airport located nearby, various developments are under way which will substantially increase the population over the next two decades. About up the coast will be the luxury Aerotropolis known as the Sibaya Coastal Precinct inland to Umdloti It is estimated that it will cost R25-50 billion to develop and will. It will include around 9000 houses as well as numerous social and public facilities. The new town centre around gateway has seen major expansion with many apartment complexes and businesses being built. The estimated R25 billion Cornubia development is being built across the N2 from the new town centre and will include 24000 low and middle income houses. In late 2017 the R1,8 billion Cornubia Mall opened to the public. In the Umhlanga village, Pearl Sky was completed in 2017 and includes a shopping mall. There is also the Oceans Umhlanga development which will include 3 large buildings, 2 of which are 28 story apartment complexes and the third a 5 star Radisson Blu hotel. There will be 100 shops on the lower floors and it is expected to be completed in 2018. At a price of R3,1 billion this is the largest private sector investment in South African history narrowly beating the Pearls of Umhlanga at R3,0 billion. It is being built inland and adjacent from the recently constructed Pearls of Umhlanga.  Umhlanga Rocks  Lighthouse at Umhlanga Rocks Umhlanga Rocks has many luxury hotels and apartments right on the beach, including the Cabana Beach Hotel, the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Oyster Box Hotel, the Umhlanga Sands Hotel and Pearls of Umhlanga apartments. Many of these have views of the landmark lighthouse. It has a large increase in population during the summer months.  Umhlanga Ridge  Umhlanga Ridge is a new retail, office and residential node situated on a hill overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was largely developed on sugarcane land by property development company, Moreland Estates, owned by the Tongaat Hulett sugar group. Located on the ridge are Gateway Theatre of Shopping and other shopping centres, motor dealerships, a private hospital and many offices. Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre is connected by a series of pedestrian-friendly roads, parks and public spaces. The Town Centre is easily accessed by a network of major roads, including the N2. The Umhlanga Ridge New Town Centre has been under construction for almost a decade. Vela VKE consulted on the structural input for the design of the grade separation bridge and two parking court structures. Civil infrastructure costs amount to R200 million to date. Aerial view of Umhlanga Ridge (foreground) and Umhlanga Rocks (on ocean beyond)  Tourism  Together, Umhlanga and Umdloti form the Sugar Coast of KwaZulu- Natal. Umhlanga is one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Africa. There were 1.2 million visitors in 2015 which generated a GDP of R20-billion. In 2016, the tourism chairman Peter Rose said ‚ÄúI can confidently say that within the next five years you will not recognise uMhlanga,‚Äù Residents of Umhlanga have mixed feelings about the changes such as that it is losing its village appeal while they appreciate the new infrastructure and increased property values. Other places of interest in Umhlanga are the Umhlanga Country Club and The Mount Edgecombe Country Club in nearby Mount Edgecombe. Crime Umhlanga is one of the safest areas in the Durban area. The Durban North precinct which includes a small slice along the coast of Durban North, all of Umhlanga and Umdloti maintained a murder rate of around 7 per 100,000 from 2016‚Äì2019, about 1/5 of the national average of 35.9 in 2017. Between March 2018 ‚Äì 2019, police recorded 3 murders, 136 robberies and 318 residential burglaries. The number of residential burglaries halved between 2014 and 2019 possibly linked to the proliferation of highly visible private security in the area. Certain areas in Umhlanga are very safe, one being Somerset park, a short distance from the Gateway mall.  Demographics  Umhlanga is very diverse with people from various racial backgrounds and ethnic groups. 78.9% speak English as their first language, 9.0% Zulu and 6.12% Afrikaans. There is also a sizable Portuguese population. The number of people from each racial group increased between 2001 and 2011. The number of white people increased from 11,523 to 12,925 while the percentage dropped from 74.9% to 53.3%. The number of black people increased from 1,770 to 4,147. The number of 'Indians or Asians' increased from 1,953 to 6,353. The number of coloureds increased from 141 to 297. As of the 2011 census, the most black area is the new town centre area which is 24.1% black. The most white area is the northern coastal area including the Umhlanga village which is 66.9% white. The most Indian area is the woodlands which is 46.0% Indian. The expensive new developments tend to have higher Indian populations than the average for Umhlanga while the lower cost developments tend to have higher Indian and black populations than the average. The older parts of Umhlanga tend to have higher white populations than the average.

It is an improvement over: :\\\\frac{q}{A} = h_o(T_o - T_s) Where: * q = rate of heat transfer [W] * A = heat transfer surface area [m¬≤] * h_o = heat transfer coefficient for radiation (long wave) and convection [W/m¬≤K] * T_o = outdoor surroundings' temperature [¬∞C] * T_s = outside surface temperature [¬∞C] The above equation only takes into account the temperature differences and ignores two important parameters, being 1) solar radiative flux; and 2) infrared exchanges from the sky. The concept of Tsol-air was thus introduced to enable these parameters to be included within an improved calculation. The following formula results: T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air} = T_o + \\\\frac{ (a \\\\cdot I - \\\\Delta Q_{ir})}{h_o} Where: * a = solar radiation absorptivity (surface solar absorptance or the inverse of the solar reflectance of a material) [-] * I = global solar irradiance (i.e. total solar radiation incident on the surface) [W/m¬≤] * \\\\Delta Q_{ir} = extra infrared radiation due to difference between the external air temperature and the apparent sky temperature. This can be written as \\\\Delta Q_{ir} = F_r * h_r * \\\\Delta T_{o-sky} [W/m¬≤] The product T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air} just found can now be used to calculate the amount of heat transfer per unit area, as below: \\\\frac{q}{A} = h_o(T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air} - T_s) An equivalent, and more useful equation for the net heat loss across the whole construction is: \\\\frac{q}{A} = U_c(T_i - T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air}) Where: * U_c = construction U-value, according to ISO 6946 [W/m¬≤K]. * T_i = indoor temperature [¬∞C] * \\\\Delta T_{o-sky} = difference between outside dry-bulb air temperature and sky mean radiant temperature [¬∞C] * F_r = Form factor between the element and the sky [-] ** F_r = 1 for an unshaded horizontal roof ** F_r = 0,5 for an unshaded vertical wall * h_r = external radiative heat transfer coefficient [W/m¬≤K] By expanding the above equation through substituting T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air} the following heat loss equation is derived: \\\\frac{q}{A} = U_c(T_i - T_o) - \\\\frac{U_c}{h_o} {[a \\\\cdot I - F_r \\\\cdot h_r \\\\cdot \\\\Delta T_{o-sky}]} The above equation is used for opaque facades in,ISO 13790, Energy performance of buildings ‚Äî Calculation of energy use for space heating and cooling and renders intermediate calculation of T_\\\\mathrm{sol-air} unnecessary. The main advantage of this latter approach is that it avoids the need for a different outdoor temperature node for each facade. Thus, the solution scheme is kept simple, and the solar and sky radiation terms from all facades can be aggregated and distributed to internal temperature nodes as gains/losses.

The penis may be an allograft from a human donor, or it may be grown artificially, though the latter has not yet been transplanted onto a human. 2006 allotransplant procedure The first such procedure was performed in September 2006 at a military hospital in Guangzhou, China. The patient, a 44-year-old male, had sustained the loss of most of his penis in an accident. The transplanted penis came from a brain-dead 22-year- old male. Although a surgical success, the patient and his wife suffered psychological trauma as a result of the procedure, and had the surgery reversed 15 days later. Following this, Jean-Michel Dubernard, who performed the world's first face transplant, wrote that the case \\"raises many questions and has some critics\\". He alluded to a double standard, writing: > I cannot imagine what would have been the reactions of the medical > profession, ethics specialists, and the media if a European surgical team > had performed the same operation. An example of a critic is Piet Hoebeke, a reconstructive urologist in Belgium, who wrote a letter that raised the question of whether or not ethics committees were involved, and criticized the group for the follow-up time of only 15 days. Hoebeke asserted that successful voiding at two weeks is not predictive of long-term outcomes, and even that inadequate arterial anastomoses might not manifest themselves in this time. The hospital that performed the first transplantation later issued a set of guidelines which, among other considerations, \\"recommended that the procedure be restricted to individuals with severe injuries who are unwilling to undergo traditional reconstructive surgery\\", according to a mini-review of the ethical issues surrounding penis transplantation published in the Asian Journal of Andrology. Laboratory-grown penis In 2009, Anthony Atala and colleagues at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina transplanted bioengineered penises onto 12 rabbits. All of them mated and four produced offspring. It was a test for a concept he had been working on since 1992, with the aim of making human penises for transplant. He has produced test versions of bioengineered human penises, and there have been multiple successful transplants. 2014 procedure in South Africa The first successful penis transplant was performed at Stellenbosch University in South Africa (medical campus pictured) In December 2014, the first successful penis transplant was performed on a 21-year-old man by specialists led by urologist Andr√© van der Merwe from the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa. The surgical team consisted of urologist Andre van der Merwe and plastic surgeon Frank Graewe. The immunosuppression was conducted by Rafique Moosa. The nine-hour procedure used microsurgery to connect blood vessels and nerves. The patient had lost his penis as a result of a botched circumcision procedure he underwent aged 18. As of 13 March 2015, the recipient was reported to have recovered function in the organ, including urination, erection, orgasm and ejaculation, but sensation is expected to take two years to return fully. The doctors who performed the transplant were surprised by this, as they had not expected the patient to recover fully until about December 2016. Given that circumcisions are performed frequently in parts of South Africa to mark a boy's transition to adulthood, and these are often unsanitary procedures, frequently carried out by uncertified amateurs, doctors have said that South Africa has some of the greatest need for penis transplantations in the world. In 2015, the recipient announced that he had successfully conceived a child. 2016 Massachusetts General Hospital procedure In May 2016 surgeons, co-led by Curtis L. Cetrulo Jr. and Dicken S. C. Ko at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School performed a transplant on a 64-year-old man from Halifax, Massachusetts. The surgeons demonstrated that it was possible to perform penile transplantation using a new technique of genitourinary vascularized composite allografts (GUVCA) to replace lost tissue under conventional immunosuppressive medication. The clinical results of this pioneering procedure in reconstructive transplantation in the United States was published in Annals of Surgery, May 2017. 2017 procedure in South Africa A surgical team from Stellenbosch University and the Tygerberg Academic Hospital performed a second penis transplant on 21 April 2017. In a nine and a half hour procedure, Andr√© van der Merwe and his team successfully transplanted a penis onto a 40 year old male who had lost his penis 17 years prior, in a botched traditional circumcision. The patient is set to receive medical skin darkening tattoos in order to correct skin tone differences, as the donor was white and the recipient black. Stellenbosch University is the only medical center in the world to have successfully completed two penile transplants. Johns Hopkins program In December 2015, The New York Times reported that surgeons from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore would soon be performing experimental penis transplantation surgeries on injured veterans, and were optimistic that such surgeries could result in sexual and reproductive function. In April 2018, The New York Times reported that surgeons from Johns Hopkins, led by W. P. Andrew Lee, had performed the first penis transplant performed on a combat victim and the third successful penis transplant so far. This transplant also included the scrotum, but not the testicles, for ethical reasons. The patient's identity was not disclosed.

History Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an Italian Egyptian born in Alexandria and founder of the international Futurism movement The last Queen of ancient Egypt (the Greek Cleopatra) married the Roman Mark Antony bringing her country as \\"dowry\\", and since then Egypt was part of the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire for centuries. Many people from the Italian peninsula moved to live in Egypt during those centuries: the tombs of Christian Alexandria shows how deep that presence was. Since then there has been a continuous presence of people (born in the Italian peninsula) and their descendants in Egypt. =Origins of actual community= During the Middle Ages Italian communities from the \\"Maritime Republics\\" of Italy (mainly Pisa, Genova and Amalfi) were present in Egypt as merchants. Since the Renaissance the Republic of Venice has always been present in the history and commerce of Egypt: there was even a Venetian Quarter in Cairo. From the time of Napoleon I, the Italian community in Alexandria and Egypt started to grow in a huge way: the size of the community had reached around 55,000 just before World War II, forming the second largest immigrant community in Egypt. =World War II= The expansion of the colonial Italian Empire after World War I was directed toward Egypt by Benito Mussolini, in order to control the Suez Canal.Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European Empire p.243 The Italian \\"Duce\\" created in the 1930s some sections of the National Fascist Party in Alexandria and Cairo, and many hundreds of Italian Egyptians become members of it. Even some intellectuals, like Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (founder of the Futurism) and the poet Giuseppe Ungaretti, were supporters of the Italian nationalism in their native Alexandria. As a consequence, during World War II the British authorities interned in concentration camps nearly 8,000 Italian Egyptians with sympathy for Italian Fascism, in order to prevent sabotage when the Italian Army attacked western Egypt in summer 1940.Internment of the Italian Egyptians (in Italian) The areas of Egypt temporarily conquered by the Kingdom of Italy in the war (like Sallum and Sidi Barrani) were administered by the military. Indeed, the nationalist organization Misr Al-Fatah (Young Egypt) was deeply influenced by the fascism ideals against the British Empire. The Young Egypt Party was ready to do a revolt in Cairo in summer 1942 if Rommel had conquered Alexandria after a victory at the El Alamein battle. Nasser and Sadat, 1942 revolt (in Italian) However, like many other foreign communities in Egypt, migration back to Italy and the West reduced the size of the community greatly due to wartime internment and the rise of Nasserist nationalism against Westerners. After the war many members of the Italian community related to the defeated Italian expansion in Egypt were forced to move away, starting a process of reduction and disappearance of the Italian Egyptians. After 1952 the Italian Egyptians were reduced ‚Äì from the nearly 60,000 of 1940 ‚Äì to just a few thousands. Most Italian Egyptians returned to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s, although a few Italians continue to live in Alexandria and Cairo. Officially the Italians in Egypt at the end of 2007 were 3,374 (1,980 families). In 2007 there were nearly 4,000 Italians in Egypt, mostly technicians and managers working (for a few years) in the 500 Italian companies with contracts with the Egyptian government: just a few hundreds of retired \\"real\\" Italian Egyptians remain, mainly in Alexandria and Cairo. Egyptian‚ÄìItalian relations Italy's preeminence in its economic relations with Egypt was reflected in the size of its expatriate community. Some of the first educational missions that Egypt sent to Europe under Mohamed Ali were headed to Italy to learn the art of printing. Mohamed Ali also engaged a number of Italian experts to assist in the various tasks of building the modern state: in the exploration of antiquities, the exploration of minerals, in the conquest of Sudan, designing the city of Khartoum and drawing the first survey map of the Nile Delta. In addition, Italians featured prominently in the royal court under Ismail, which is perhaps why Italian architects were chosen to design most of Khedive Ismail's palaces, new suburbs of the capital and public buildings. The most famous building related to the Italian community was the Royal Opera House, which was to be inaugurated in 1871 with the Aida by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. The Khedivial Opera House or \\"Cairo Royal Opera House\\" was the original Opera House in Cairo. It was inaugurated in November 1869 and burned down in October 1971. The opera house was built on the orders of the Khedive Ismail to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal. The Italian Egyptian architects Pietro Avoscani and Mario Rossi designed the building. Pietro Avoscani, before his 1891 death in Alexandria, created even the famous Corniche of Alexandria.Photo of the Alexandria Corniche The fondness of Egyptian monarchs towards Italy appeared in the number of Italians employed in their courts. Italian-Egyptian relations were so strong and deemed so important that when the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in 1946 after Italy's defeat in World War II, Egyptian King Faruk invited Victor Emmanuel III to live in Alexandria. Victor Emmanuel III died in Alexandria in December 1947 and was buried there, behind the altar of St Catherine's Cathedral. Areas of origin and residence Before 1952, Italians formed the second largest expatriate community in Egypt, after the Greeks. The 1882 census of Egypt recorded 18,665 Italians in the country. By 1897 the figure rose to 24,454 and 30 years later to 52,462. Thus, the Italian community increased by 122 per cent in those years. Writing in Al-Ahram of 19 February 1933, under the headline, \\"The Italians in Egypt\\", the Italian historian Angelo San Marco wrote, \\"The Venetians and the people from Trieste, Dalmatia, Genoa, Pisa, Livorno, Naples and Sicily continued to reside in Egypt long after their native cities fell into decay and lost their status as maritime centres with the decline of the Mediterranean as a major thoroughfare for world trade.\\" Elsewhere in the article, San Marco writes that the Italian community in Egypt held monopolies on the goods that were still popular in the East, which included many imports. The majority of the Italian community lived in either Cairo or Alexandria, with 18,575 in the former and 24,280 in the latter, according to the 1928 census.Marta Petricioli. L'Egitto degli italiani (1917-1947). Milano, Bruno Mondadori, 2007 The Museum of Antiquities of Cairo (the most important museum of ancient Egypt in the world) was built in 1901 by the Garozzo-Zaffarani, an Italian construction company Italians tended to live in exclusively Italian neighbourhoods or in neighbourhoods with other foreigners. Perhaps the most famous of these districts in Cairo was known as the \\"Venetian Quarter\\". Nevertheless, San Marco notes that, in order to avoid harassment, the Italians tended to wear Egyptian dress and follow, as much as possible, Egyptian customs. Community organisations The Italian community in Egypt consisted primarily of a large array of merchants, artisans, professionals and an increasing number of workers. This was because Italy had remained for a long period of time politically and economically weak, which rendered it incapable of competing with the major industries and capitalist investment coming to Egypt from France. During the fascist period there were eight public and six Italian parochial schools. The government schools were supervised by an official committee chaired by the Italian consul and they had a total student enrollment of approximately 1,500. Other schools had student bodies numbering in the hundreds. Italians in Alexandria also had 22 philanthropic societies, among which were the \\"National Opera Society\\", the \\"Society for Disabled War Veterans\\", the \\"Society of Collectors of Military Insignia\\", the \\"Italian Club\\", the \\"Italian Federation for Labour Cooperation\\", the \\"War Orphans Relief Society\\", the \\"Mussolini Italian Hospital\\" and the \\"Dante Alighieri Italian Language Association\\". In addition, many Italian-language newspapers were published in Alexandria, the most famous of which was L'Oriente and Il Messaggero Egiziano.Lamb, Richard. Mussolini as Diplomat. Fromm International Ed. London, 1999 Indeed, the hundreds of Italian words that have been incorporated into the Egyptian dialect is perhaps the best testimony to the fact that of all the foreign communities residing in Egypt, Italians were the most closely connected to Egyptian society. San Marco ventures that the reason for this was that \\"our people are noted for their spirit of tolerance, their lack of religious or nationalist chauvinism and, unlike other peoples, their aversion to appearing superior.\\" Issue No. 670, 25‚Äì31 December 2003 Language and religion All remaining Italian Egyptians speak Italian, while speaking Arabic and English as second language, and are Catholics.

Smith played his junior hockey for the Ottawa 67's and scored an impressive 52 goals in the 1972‚Äì1973 campaign. He backed up the performance with a 47-goal season the next year and this was enough to garner the attention of the Buffalo Sabres who drafted him in the 10th round of the 1974 NHL draft. He spent three seasons with the Hershey Bears of the AHL including a heroic playoff effort in 1975 where he scored seven goals in just eleven games. Smith also scored nearly a point a game for the Bears in 1976‚Äì1977. This is also the year when he got his first taste of NHL regular season action, playing in 5 games for the Sabres. In 1977, he became an NHL regular appearing in 36 regular season games and an additional eight playoff games. Smith broke out in the 1979‚Äì1980 season when he recorded career high 24 goals to go with 39 assists. He once again proved to be a playoff hero when he notched 12 points in just 13 games. He was a 20-goal scorer yet again the next season. Smith also set a career high with 43 helpers in only 69 games.

It serves grades 9 through 12, and is accredited through the California Department of Education to grant High School Diplomas to students who successfully complete the requisite amount and type of units as well as pass the California High School Exit Exam. Its enrollment for 2006-2007 was 2066 students. Mission \\"Tradition. Innovation. Excellence\\" The Lemoore Union High school district is dedicated to providing education to all students. (They) develop competent and responsible students and challenge students to solve complex problems, communicate ideas, and work together in preparation for careers of the 1st century. History Lemoore High School was originally opened in 1900 to 35 students assembled as freshmen in the old Heinlen Hall in downtown Lemoore and began classes. Students in that first year were offered Latin, ancient History, Algebra and English. In 1902, the high school moved after Lemoore voters approved a school bond to build a new facility on the corner of Fox and B Streets. Lemoore High Schools first graduating class (1904) consisted of three persons: Margaret Hayes and Arthur and Ed Blank. In 1909, the first football team was formed from the 18 boys enrolled. The first school bus, a 20-passenger, 15 mile per hour average speed vehicle, made its debut in 1916. The current school, located at 101 East Bush Street was opened February 1, 1924. Ellen Truckell was the 1929 Student Body President, the first female president to serve at Lemoore High School. In 1940, the \\"music building\\" (the small building west of the main gym) was added to provide a band and choir room, ceramics studio, and 2 classrooms; and the auto shop was added to the existing shop building (that is now the maintenance department). In 1941, a swimming pool was added; in 1953, the Ag building; in 1958, the J.F. Graham Memorial Gymnasium; in 1960, the business building, followed by the science wing and administration building in 1962. The home economics building was completed in 1963, and followed in turn by the library and tennis courts in 1964. The football stadium and bus garage were finished in 1965. The metal shop (now the auto shop, T-1) was erected in 1969, along with the industrial drawing and electronics classrooms. In 1970, the \\"girls\\" gym was remodeled, and the exercise room added. In 1973, a $2.75 million bond was supported by the taxpayers to erect the 10 classrooms in the S-Wing, the cafeteria, wood shop, and an addition to the boys' locker room. In 1978, the main building was renovated. In 1991 a new swimming pool was completed, and the old pool buildings converted to classrooms. In 1993, the Gundacker Center was established to house the alternative education programs, such as Continuation, Adult Ed, Independent Study, Pregnant Minors (Cyesis), and Child Care programs. The Gundacker Center was dedicated to Gertrude Gundacker, a longtime faculty member. The Continuation School is dedicated to Don Jamison, the first continuation principal and a track coach. 2001 Centennial Celebration In 2001, Lemoore High School celebrated 100 years of excellence in education with a Centennial Celebration.

Murray, England and by Melville, who believed that the specimens at Kew bearing the name 'Serpentina' were U. glabra \\"introgressed by U. carpinifolia\\" [: U. minor] and were similar to but \\"distinct from 'Camperdownii'\\". Koch had listed an U. serpentina in 1872,Koch, Dendrologie, 2, pt.1, p.417 and an U. montana serpentina was marketed in the late 19th century by the Baudriller nursery of Angers, the Sp√§th nursery of Berlin,Sp√§th, L., Catalogue 79 (1890-91; Berlin), p.114Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh accessions list of 1902. and the Ulrich nursery of Warsaw.Ulrich, C. (1894), Katalog Drzew i Krezewow, C. Ulrich, Rok 1893-94, Warszawa In Sp√§th catalogues between c.1890 and 1920, however, though 'Serpentina' appears, 'Camperdownii' is absent; by 1930 'Camperdownii' appears but 'Serpentina' is absent. This suggests that 'Serpentina' may have been a continental name for 'Camperdownii', and that Sp√§th dropped the name 'Serpentina' c.1930 in favour of 'Camperdownii'. Elwes and Henry's failure to mention the serpentining branches of 'Camperdownii' may have contributed to the impression of two different trees. In this omission they were followed by Bean (1925),Bean, W. J.(1925) Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 4th edition, Murray, London Green (1964), Hillier (1972‚Äì 2002),Harold Hillier, The Hillier Manual of Trees and Shrubs (1972; revised to 2002) Kr√ºssmann(1976),Kr√ºssman, Gerd, Manual of Cultivated Broad-Leaved Trees & Shrubs (1976, trans 1984 vol. 3) and White (2003),J.

The ultimate form of 'Camperdownii' depends on such factors as latitude and location, on what part of the parent tree the cuttings come from, on the 'stock' on which it is grafted, and on possible continuing mutation. Specimens may therefore vary in form,Information from RBGE. which might account for Henry and Melville's \\"hybrid\\" 'Serpentina'. Henry, quoting Koch, said that 'Serpentina' was sold in nurseries as the Parasol Elm, which was distinguished from Ulmus campestris pendula by having larger leaves. Both 'Serpentina' and the Scampston Elm were sometimes referred to as U. americana pendula. (Other European elms described as 'American' by various nurseries include 'Vegeta',Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, 3: 1398, 1404 'Lutescens', and 'Nana'.) Description Baudriller (1880) described Ulmus montana serpentina as \\"a curious variety which, top-grafted, forms by the entanglement of its vigorous branches a superb parasol\\", and Henry (1913) as \\"a small tree with curved and twisted pendulous branches, a dense pyramidal or globose crown, and leaves and branchlets similar to those of U. √ó hollandica 'Major' \\".Hilliers' Manual of Trees & Shrubs. (1977). David & Charles, Newton Abbot, UK. An U. serpentina was described in the journal Nature in 1918: \\"The branches are curiously contorted and reflexed, while all the shoots from one to three years old are pendulous rods,which, with the beautiful foliage, form an exterior covering reaching to the ground\\". Kr√ºssman, who listed a 'Serpentina' under U. glabra, described it (1984) as a weeping elm with \\"twisted corkscrew-like branches\\" and leaves \\"like those of U. 'Camperdownii'\\". Like Henry, he makes no mention of contorted branching in his description of 'Camperdowni'.Kr√ºssman, Gerd, Manual of Cultivated Broad-Leaved Trees & Shrubs (1984 vol. 3) Pests and diseases No cultivars labelled 'Serpentina' are known to have any resistance to Dutch elm disease. Cultivation The journal Nature reported in July 1918 \\"a remarkable elm of the variety known as Ulmus serpentina, apparently about sixty years old, vigorously growing in a Croydon garden\\". \\"Sixty years old\\" would pre-date the first known reference to a 'Serpentina', but would tally with an early 'Camperdownii' planting. Sp√§th's U. montana serpentina was planted at Kew in 1896. Henry, though he describes Kew's 'Serpentina', calling it \\"U. major var. serpentina Henry\\", makes, unusually, no mention of a Kew 'Camperdownii'. Sp√§th's U. montana serpentina was planted in 1897 at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada, which, though it contained some eighty elm cultivars by the turn of the century, had no specimen labelled 'Camperdownii'. Three specimens supplied by the Sp√§th nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. montana serpentina (see 'External links' below) are now assumed by the Garden to have been 'Camperdownii',Clouston, B., & Stansfield, K., eds.

Gabrieli Vasquez e Societate lesu,.Sacri supremi Senatus Inquisitionis Hispaniae Censori. Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a. Gabriel Vasquez (Belmonte, Cuenca, 1549 or 1551 ‚Äì Alcal√° de Henares, 23 September 1604) was a Spanish Jesuit theologian. Life He made his primary and grammar studies at Belmonte, and went to Alcal√° for philosophy, where he entered the Society of Jesus on 9 April 1569. Having completed his novitiate he continued his theological studies there, closing with a public defense of his thesis. At the Fifth Provincial Congregation at Toledo he also defended a thesis. Between these events he lectured to the Jesuit students on the De Anima, and returned to Alcal√° to study Hebrew. Following this he taught moral theology two years at the college of Oca√±a. two more at Madrid, and for some time at Alcal√°. From there, although not yet thirty years of age, he was called to Rome to fill the same post at the Roman College. Before his departure he made his profession at Belmonte. He remained six years in Rome then returned to Alcal√°, where he taught theology until his death. In him, according to the 19th-century German Redemptorist writer Michael Haringer, virtue competed with doctrine, obedience with genius, and piety with learning. The Duke of Lerma, favourite of Philip III of Spain, frequently consulted him in the most important matters, and Benedict XIV called him the luminary of theology. He was noted for his exact knowledge of the opinions and theories of the different Schools and authors, and commendable for clearness of expression and a strict philosophical method. He made a complete study of the writings of St. Augustine, for whom he professed great devotion, as well as those of the other Fathers of the Church and St. Thomas. In matters of opinion he sometimes differed from the mainstream scholastic views, defending private opinions, among which the following deserve to be mentioned: #The natural law consists in rational nature considered in itself and in the recognition that certain actions are necessarily in accord with it and others are repugnant to it. Nevertheless, he does not deny that the natural law might also have cognizance of what the Divine law enjoins, and that it might, therefore, be the principle of a Divine obligation. In this he is in opposition to Kant, who holds that all the binding force of the moral law should come from man and from man alone. #The Divine ideas are not the essence of God, insofar as that essence or nature is known as imitable or to be imitated, but only as they are the knowledge, the word, the species expressa of possible and future creatures. These ideas thereby concur remotely in the creation of beings; their proximate principle being the Divine active potency by which God actually and effectually creates. #In the section dedicated to the discussion of the existence of God he cites the ontological proof of St. Anselm, the legitimateness and demonstrative value of which he appears to accept absolutely. Eternity is, according to him, duratio permanens, uniformis, sine principio et fine, mensura carens, a definition that differs somewhat from that adopted by Boethius and followed in the Schools. #Grace is necessary for performing all good actions and overcoming temptation. By grace he understands all good impulses which efficaciously urge to right action. It may proceed from natural causes, but as these are regulated by Divine Providence, if they are so regulated as to produce efficacious good impulses, it is grace, because man does not himself merit it, and to many it is denied. It is to be considered as a gift from God, since it is granted through the merits of Christ and for a supernatural end. Hence it is called grace. #Predestination, he maintains, is post praevisa merita, but children who die without its being in any way whatsoever possible for them to receive baptism were not, after original sin was foreseen, included in the salvific will of God. #In Christology he held the following opinions: that the Adoptionists are not Nestorians; that Christ cannot be called the servant of God; that Christ was under a command to die, but that He was free to choose the circumstances of his death; that the regular or formal dignity of the priesthood of Christ will last forever, because Christ is a priest according to His substance, and this remains immutable. #The ratio formalis of the Sacrifice of the Mass lies in the mystic separation of the Body and Blood of Christ effected by the words of consecration. #It is probable that in the new birth of baptism the guilt of sin is not pardoned ex opere operatio, but only the punishment. Since the death of Christ, baptism is for children the only means of salvation; for them martyrdom has the virtue of justification instar baptism; but in adults it justifies only on account of the act of charity. #Episcopal consecration does not imprint a new character, nor does it in reality extend or increase the sacerdotal character; a new and distinct power is thereby conferred, which is nothing else than the Divine appointment to a new ministry. #In the Sacrament of Matrimony the bodies of the contracting parties constitute the matter, and their consent, expressed verbally or by signs, the form. #In treating the existence of God he notes the number of atheists who lived in his time, and attributes it to the influence of Protestantism. He also mentions the political atheists who consider God and religion only as governmental expedients to hold the people in check. Vasquez was a rival of Francisco Su√°rez, whom he sometimes designates as one of the moderns. He established a School, and the disputes between his disciples and those of the Dominican John of St. Thomas concerning the Divine knowledge and the Divine idea were, according to Men√©ndez y Pelayo, curious. Luis de Torres and Diego de Alarcon were the most notable disciples of the School, and, although it was short-lived, modern theologians frequently quote him.

Some of his manuscripts are preserved in the National Library of Madrid. His first volume on the first part of St. Thomas was held back two years by the censors of the Society. Among the questions he discussed are: \\"An Deus extra coelum, vel in vacuo intra coelum esse possit, aut ante mundi creationem alicubi fuerit\\".

It is located in the north-west of Dehradun district, along the border with the state of Himachal Pradesh. Ethnically, Jaunsar-Bawar comprises two regions, inhabited by the two predominant groups: Jaunsar, the lower half, while the snow-clad upper region is called Bawar, which includes, the 'Kharamba peak' (). Geographically adjacent, they are not very different from each other. The Bawar lies in the upper regions of the area. They are a unique community because they have remained cut off from the external world for centuries, leading to the retention of their unique culture and traditions, which have attracted historians, anthropologist and studies in ethnopharmacology to this region for over a century. There is a significant cultural shift from other people of Garhwal, living close by.  Jaunsar-Bawar region  The Jaunsar- Bawar region, is a valley, spread over 1002 km¬≤ and 398 villages(villages near Sahiya market Alsi, Sakani, Kanbua and Kakadi) in villages Sakani there are living 27 family(Benan, Thanaw, Mirjan, Negan and Baliyan),Maroj The Tribune, 15 January 2005. between 77.45' and 78.7'20\\" East to 30.31' and 31.3'3\\" North. It is defined in the east, by the river Yamuna and by river Tons in the west, the northern part comprises Uttarkashi district, and some parts of Himachal Pradesh, the Dehradun tehsil forms its southern periphery. Modes of livelihood in this region are agriculture and animal husbandry, which in the upper region is mostly for self-sustenance, as merely 10 percent of cultivated area is irrigated. Milk, wool and meat are an integral part of the local economy. History Jaunsar- Bawar was Part of sirmaur Kingdom at one point of time, which is now sirmaur district in Himachal pradesh. It is the border area of Garhwal. Later, It was captured by garhwal rulers. Garhwal King Mahipat or Mahipati Shah sent Army General Lodi Rikhola to stop looting in Dehradun valley. The looters from Sirmaur region (Himachal Pradesh) were disturbing subjects of Doon valley. Capable administrator Lodi Rikhola repressed the looters of Sirmaur those used to loot Doon valley regularly. Lodi Rikhola captured the forts of Kalsi Garh, Jaunsar (old capital of Sirmaur), Kani Garh, Bairat Garh and other nearby forts. After that, Sirmaur King Mat Prakash or Mandhata Prakash could never free those forts from Garhwal Kingdom. According to Bhakt Darshan, Lodi Rikhola dispatched looters of Sirmaur from Garhwal region with brave and also cruel methods. Lodi Rikhola entered into Sirmaur region and killed the looters and their bosses. Lodi Rikhola spread the terror in Sirmaur that the king promised to stop looters going to Garhwal. According to Bhakt Darshan, the terror of Lodi Rikhola in Sirmoor, Sirmmour or Srimor was so terrible that the people took vow that till they don‚Äôt produce a Bhad as brave and strong Lodi Rikhola for taking revenge from Garhwal, their women would not have Nada in their Petikot and they would not have ‚ÄòGhur‚Äô on the house roof. This folk story is just a self praising story common in Garhwal. In 1829, Jaunsar-Bawar was incorporated in Chakrata tehsil, prior to which it had been a part of Punjab state of Sirmur, till the British conquered it along with Dehradun after the 1814 war with the Gurkhas.Dehra Dun District The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 11, p. 213-214. Before the establishment of British Indian Army cantonment in 1866, the entire area was known as Jaunsar-Bawar, and the name continued to be in popular use for the region, till the early 20th century.Chakrata Tahsil & Town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 10, p. 125. While western Hindi is popular in most of the neighbouring hill areas, Jaunsari, a language of the Central Pahari group, is spoken by most of the people of the region.Agriculture The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 11, p. 215. Geography Traditionally, Jaunsar-Bawar region is known for its rich reserves of forested areas, in the high hills region, with trees of Deodar, Pine, and spruce, made for it becoming an important destination for the timber even during the British period, when the logs were rolled down the slopes and floated on Yamuna river to Delhi.Forests The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 24, p. 196. Gate system, time table based traffic diversion on one way hilly roads, which was there since the time of British, is now removed. Culture The Jaunsari population mainly consists of Khasha, KOLI, Dhaki, Luhar and Dooms. Khashas and KOLI are prominently large in number than the other counterparts. Dooms are considered untouchables. The Luhars are the artisans working as ironsmiths as well as the goldsmith. The Dhaki offers drum music at all the religious, social and cultural functions. Upper castes of Jaunsari population mainly consists of Thakurs and Brahmins. The culture of the local Jaunsari people is distinct from other hill people in Garhwal, Kumaon and Himachal Pradesh,Jaunsaries www.garhwalhimalayas.com. its culture matches with the Sirmaur and Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Jaunsari-Bawar paragana was basically part of sirmaur hill kingdom of Himachal Pradesh, In 1814 when Gorkha were moving ahead in capturing all hill kingdom forts, while capturing from Kumaun, some parts of Garhwal at the time of famine and massive earthquake in Garhwal, they laid seize to several parts of Himachal including shimla, Kangra. Hill Raja of Himachal decided to seek the help of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The Kangra Raja offered the Sikhs the Fort for the long term if they could make the Gurkhas leave. Some of the Forts that the Gurkhas built still exist in Himachal Pradesh like the Dhar Mountain Fort, the Malaon Fort, Bansar Fort, Subathu Fort and Parwanoo Fort. Ludwig Stiller writes in his epic book ‚ÄúThe Rise of the House of Gorkha‚Äù that Maharaja Ranjit Singh sent a letter to General Amar Singh Thapa in August 1809 asking him to peacefully give up the Kangra Fort and vacate the whole area to the Sikhs and in return he offered Gurkhas military help, whenever they came into conflict with the British, which was clearly inevitable, but Amar Singh Thapa refused. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had no other option except the Military one now as a conflict with the Gurkhas could not be avoided. The Gurkhas lost in the end and as a result of which the Gurkhas were evicted from the Kangra Fort and all the territories there of. Maharaja Ranjit Singh now sat firmly in command of the Kangra Fort and surrounding Hill States braced up for the Gurkha retaliation. Jaunsari language shares it's vocabulary with Garhwali language. However, it's accent and grammar is some sort of similar to people of those of Shimla and Sirmaur region i.e. area lying in western side of Giri river, comprises Rajgarh, Paonta, Renuka, Nahan, pacchad and Shillai tehsils. These people are also known as Hatti, and has similar culture like Jaunsari people. A fact demonstrated by the presence of polygamy and polyandry in the local traditions, with richer practising polygamy, while their poor counterparts, choose to share a wife (polyandry), though the husbands should be brothers,United Provinces The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 24, p. 168. a fact which is often connected to, the five Pandava brothers in the Mahabharata, marrying Draupadi, from whom Jaunsaries trace their ethnic origin.JaunsarisAnthropology Pahari Polyandry: A Comparison American Anthropologist by Gerald D.

ENVIS Bulletin vol 7 no. 1., G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development, Almora. An important aspect of their culture are festive sports and dances like the folk dance named 'Barada Nati'/Harul/Raso/ during all festive occasions,Barada Nati like 'Magh Mela' which is the most important festival of the Jaunsaries. It is marked by an animal sacrifice ritual, which celebrates the killing of 'Maroj', an ogre, which according to local legends, stalked the valleys for years. According to local village lore, the Pandavas and Kauravas figure in the anthropology of the Tons valley and some families claim to be direct descendants of the two clans. The Jaunsaris claim to be descendants of the Pandavas, while the Bawaris are from the Kauravas or Duryodhana's clan. The two cultures usually do not mix, and it is a rare occurrence to see the two cultures mix in terms of marriage or social custom. The people of this region are said to be direct descendants of Aryan race. One unique custom which is followed here is the concept of bride price. The custom owes its origin to some strong logic. The parents spend a substantial amount on raising, educating and making the life of the girl as good as they can make it. In return the girl is an asset to the family as she cooks, cleans, and works on the farms. When a boy wants to marry the girl, he is taking away an asset of the family and must pay the fair price of the asset known as the bride price. But over the year this practice is followed by a few masses. Divorce is not a taboo in this culture, and divorced women are not ostracised from society. However, if the woman comes back to the parents' home after a divorce, the family must pay back the bride price to the man's family. If the woman divorces her husband to marry another man, the second man must pay bride price to the first man's family.. But over the years this practice is followed by a few masses. During festivals, people wear the Thalka or Lohiya, which is a long coat. Architecture Jaunsar Bawar follows the Vernacular architecture components. Houses are usually built in stone and timber and roofed with slate tiles. It is usually a two or three storey structure with a linear arrangement of one to four rooms on each floor and is typically sited on a terraced piece of land along the contours of the hill. In many villages in Uttarakhand, due to low temperature range, the housing and other buildings of socio-cultural values are generally shaped like pagodas or have sloping roofs. The common building material used under construction includes wood (generally deodar, due to its abundance and durability), plain stones and other locally available materials like mud and stone slates. One of the important aspects of architecture in the area is the wooden carvings and the slate laden gabled roofs. As temple architecture commonly develops from the form of folk houses, the figure of a small temple is not so different from that of a folk house. Therefore, the oldest and simplest temple type in this region is a single storied structure covered with a gabled roof. Since the local deity is Lord Mahasu, most of the temples are dedicated to him. Famous temples include Mahasu Devta Temple at Hanol, Mahasu Temple at Thaina, Mahasu Temple at Lakhwar, Mahasu Temple at Lakhsiyar and newly constructed Mahasu Temples in Bisoi and Lohari. Medicine The Jaunsari people of the region has been using over 100 plants for the treatment of various ailments, which have remained a subject for many Ethnobotanical and Ethnopharamcological studies. In Media Raaste Band Hain Sab, a film based on the work of Dr. Jayoti Gupta, Dept. of Sociology, Delhi University, on Jaunsar-Bawar, and made by Manjira Dutta, won the National Film Award for Best Anthropological/Ethnographic Film in 1988.Department of Sociology, DElhi School of Economics Delhi University. \\"Dance With GODS\\", the First chapter of the documentary Jaunsar Bawar : An Alternate Life highlights the centuries-old deity rituals and sacred ceremonies.

It tells the story of Vidyadharan (Mammootty), a clocksmith, and his inability to deal with the harsh realities of his life. This was Lohithadas's first movie as a director and was critically acclaimed. Lohithadas won the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director at the National Film Awards. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film in 1997. Mammootty won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.  Synopsis  The movie opens with Vidyadharan serving time in a prison. During a flashback it is revealed that Vidyadharan, a small village clocksmith and a widower, lived with his only daughter. His wife died from a snake bite years ago. However, his childhood friend and love interest Sarojini lives next to his house. Sarojini's husband left her after spending just a single night with her, leaving her with a teenage daughter. Vidyadharan is phobic of snakes possibly due to his wife's death. He carries a flashlight through the village lanes even in broad daylight. Although Vidyadharan's extended family disapproves of his on-off relationship with Sarojini, his daughter and Sarojini's daughter are like sisters. We are introduced to a host of supporting characters in the sleepy Palakkadan hamlet like Vidyadaran's sister, his friend near watch repairing shop, the drunkard who carries a rifle, etc. Their simple world in the sleepy hamlet is turned upside down one day when Sarojini's teenage daughter goes missing. After much investigation, her body is found inside a cave on a hilltop. It is revealed that she was gang raped. There is no evidence pointing to anyone: yet another case of sexual offence against girls in the area. Vidyadharan feels that it is a drunk hunter who is behind the crime. The police in the meanwhile investigate and declare the hunter to be innocent. Vidyadharan confronts the hunter and a battle of words ensue between them. During the confrontation, Vidyadharan accidentally kills the hunter and is sent to prison. He leads a calm life inside the prison campus and is a pet of the jail warden. While Sarojini visits Vidyadharan frequently, his daughter had been taken away by her mother's family. During one of her visits, Sarojini tells him that she met Vidyadharan's daughter and that she has grown up. He wishes to meet her but is informed that her mother's family will not give her permission to do so. During the visit, Sarojini also apprises Vidyadharan about the increasing number of rapes and molestations and recounts the fate of her daughter. Vidyadharan is visibly disturbed by this social scenario, more so as his daughter is growing up in such a society. He starts developing the anxiousness and insecurity of a father of an adolescent girl. Vidyadharan's release date comes nearer. During one of Sarojini's visit, he tells her that, upon release, he would go to a land far away with Sarojini and his daughter and will live happily. He entrusts Sarojini the job of bringing his daughter from her maternal home after convincing her. Sarojini agrees. As the day of his release nears, Vidyadharan is happy and roams around the jail. During his regular afternoon strolls, to his surprise, Vidyadharan find a hole in the thick jail wall. Vidyadharan tactfully clears the hole and uses his magnifying lens to check if he is able to view something. To his luck, he finds that the eyesize hole is dug through the entire thickness and he is able to see the hilltop just outside the jail. Vidyadharan is amused but is careful not to let the inmates and constables know about it, especially with his release date being so close. During his free time, Vidyadharan sees the small family of blind singers living on the hilltop and their beautiful daughter. He sees their small-time existence and how beautifully they sing. He finds that one of the jail constables is intervening in their life, telling them to move out of the place. When Vidyadharan meets this constable inside the jail, he is unable to express his anger. He recollects the misbehaviour of the same man once Sarojini visited him. Vidyadharan concludes that the constable is not a good man. Another day Vidyadharan witnesses a celebration in the small hut of blind singers. It is revealed that the beautiful daughter has become adolescent. Vidyadharan is very happy as his own daughter would be of the same age. As he looks on another day, while the beautiful teenage girl is alone in the hut, he sees the cruel policeman going inside. This is followed by the girl's shrieks and violent cry for help. As she comes running outside, Vidyadharan sees the police constable chasing her like a mad dog. Vidyadharan tries to seek help, but his voice is not heard. Stranded within the campus, Vidyadharan is totally helpless. The blind singers come back home to find the shocking news. They are shattered and, in the heat of loss they suffered, they decide to punish themselves by setting fire to the house and themselves. Vidyadharan watches as the silent spectator. The next morning the constable comes in front of the inmates for checking. Vidyadharan has lost all control by now and he attacks the constable accusing him of the life of the three innocent people. The inmates and the jail warden run in. Vidyadharan shows the hole and describes the entire episode to the jailer. The jailer hears in disbelief and orders both Vidyadharan and the constable to be taken for medical aid. The jailer inspects the hole and feels sorry for Vidyadharan. As he leaves, the camera zooms in towards the hole and reveals nothing but brick. The hole and the entire episode was an imagination of Vidyadharan's turbulent state of mind. As Sarojini comes to the jail with Vidyadharan's daughter, he has a blank face, turns towards them and asks \\"Aara?\\" [Who are you?]. The movie concludes with the aerial shot of a train departing from the station.

The battle was between the forces of the Byzantine Empire, led by Constantine VI, and those of Bulgaria under Kardam. The Byzantines were routed and forced to retreat to Constantinople. Prelude In the last quarter of the 8th century Bulgaria overcame the internal political crisis after the end of the rule of the Dulo. The khans Telerig and Kardam managed to consolidate the central authority and put an end of the quarrels among the nobility.Zlatarski, I/1: pp. 320‚Äì321 The Bulgarians finally had the opportunity to intensify their campaigns in Slavic-populated Macedonia. In 789 they penetrated deep into the valley of the Struma river and heavily defeated the Byzantines, killing the strategos of Thrace Filites. In order to distract the Bulgarian attention from Macedonia, the Byzantine emperor Constantine VI started a campaign in northern Thrace in April 791. The armies met near the fortress of Provat (20 km east of Odrin) and the Byzantines were forced to retreat but their defeat was not decisive and in the following year the campaign was renewed.Zlatarski, I/1: pp. 315‚Äì316 Battle In the summer of the next year Constantine VI led his army north and on 20 July was confronted by the Bulgarians under Kardam near the border castle Marcellae. The Bulgarians had built ramparts blocking the roads to the Rish Pass and the capital Pliska. For several days the emperor did not dare to attack but by the end of July he was convinced by \\"false astrologists\\" (according to the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor) that the stars boded victory and attacked.Zlatarski, I/1: p. 316GIBI, III: p. 277 Before the beginning of the battle, while awaiting the Byzantine assault, the Bulgarian ruler secretly placed part of his cavalry behind the hills surrounding the battlefield.Shikanov, p. 48 Due to the rugged terrain the advancing Byzantine army broke its order. Taking advantage of that mistake, Kardam ordered a counterattack which brought the Bulgarians a great success.Zhekov, Zh. The Military Tactics of the Bulgarians 7th-9th centuries The Bulgarian cavalry went round the Byzantines and cut their way back to their fortified camp and the fortress of Marcellae. The Bulgarians took the supplies, the treasury and the tent of the emperor. They chased Constantine VI to Constantinople, killing a great number of soldiers. Many Byzantine commanders and officers perished in the battle.Zlatarski, I/1: p. 317 A weapon called arkani was used by the Bulgarians in this battle: the arkani consisted of a long pole with an attachment similar to a lasso at one end. It was an excellent weapon against cavalry as the rider could easily be pulled out of the saddle by a skilled warrior, armed with the arkani. Aftermath After the defeat, Constantine VI had to conclude peace with Kardam and had to pay tribute. Four years later the emperor stopped the payment, leading to a new war in Thrace which ended without a decisive battle.Zlatarski, I/1: pp. 317‚Äì320 The hostilities between Bulgaria and Byzantium continued under Kardam's successor Krum. The victory had great political significance. The decades of crisis were finally overcome, the Byzantines were forced once again to pay tribute to the Khans. Bulgaria entered the 9th century consolidated, stronger and united which was an important factor for the string of victories scored by Krum against the Byzantines.

The following year his mother also died. Perceval was educated at Westminster School, London, and at Magdalen College, Oxford. However, he left university without taking a degree. Career In 1703, he was elected to the Irish House of Commons for County Cork, and in 1704 he was admitted to the Irish Privy Council. Perceval was again elected for County Cork in 1713. He sat until 1715, when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Perceval, of Burton in the County of Cork, with remainder to the heirs male of his father. In 1722, he was created Viscount Perceval, of Kanturk in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his heirs male. Lord Perceval was elected to the British House of Commons for Harwich in 1727, which constituency he continued to represent until 1734, and was also a Recorder of Harwich from 1728 to 1734. In 1733, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Egmont in the Peerage of Ireland. However, he rejected the offer of a British peerage three times. Apart from his political career, he was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1728 he became a member of the committee of Parliament investigating prison conditions. He soon became a close associate of James Oglethorpe, who chaired the committee. In 1730, the two men were among those who formed an association that later became the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America. George II approved a charter for the colony in 1732, making Egmont president of the Georgia Trustees. He and Oglethorpe, working with several other close associates, devised an elaborate plan for settlement of the colony now famously known as the Oglethorpe Plan. He actively superintended the colonisation of Georgia, withholding ‚Äòneither money, time, nor influence in his ceaseless efforts to advance what he conceived to be the best interests of the province,‚Äô and keeping with his own hand ‚ÄòA Journal of the Transactions of the Trustees,‚Äô &c.;, the second and third volumes of which have been printed.

Casey Jones was produced in the United States by the Group Theater. It was the first of two Robert Ardrey plays that were produced by the Group, the second being the more-famous Thunder Rock. The play had a very short run. it opened at the Fulton Theatre on February 19, 1938, and closed on March 1 after 25 performances. The director was Elia Kazan, the scenic design was by Mordecai Gorelik, and the title role was played by Charles Bickford. Synopsis Casey Jones is the story of a modernized version of the eponymous hero of folklore. In the play, Casey is dedicated to his locomotive. He uses his dedication to the engine as an escape from a world that he doesn't understand. Aboard his engine he feels like a king. However, Casey neglects his family and personal life to conduct the engine. Furthermore, he learns he is going blind. He insists on running his engine even as his vision fades. Casey is forced into retirement by the Railroad Company, but remains loyal to them. He refuses his pension, saying \\"The company owes me nothing.\\" Then Casey moves into a cramped boarding house where he struggles to move around the steep steps and the furniture. In the script, the boarding house is conceptualized as Casey's tomb. Just before the closing curtain Casey collapses, realizing that he has been a slave to the railroad company for his entire life. Themes According to Christine White, \\"The message of Casey Jones [is] that men become dependent on the self-meaning they get from their work in life, therefore, men are captured by the modern machines they work with.\\"White, Christine A. Directors & Designers Bristol, UK: Intellect books. 2009. pp. 198-201 It was also Ardrey's intention to write about the working class and capture their dialect in dialogue. Again, according to White: \\"Ardrey had a genuine affection for ordinary human beings, whose language he loved and captured beautifully in his dialogue. He wanted to write about them because they were the essence of America, and he had his own ideas about the proper way to do it.\\" Ardrey, later remarking on the play in an interview in The Times, underscored the idea that he wanted to write about the working class characters as they were: > It has never been an American tradition to speak truly of the people. Always > we have thought of them wishfully, according to our own ends. A social > evangelist, in a far-away temple, shouts loudly of the people and class > solidarity. Are these Americans class conscious? I can only show them to you > and say, judge for yourselves. ... It would seem to me that an unschooled > man who is aware and puzzled is frequently more intelligent than a man with > an educated mind, convinced and closed. But that's merely my judgment, so > don't accept it. Accept only my people and judge for yourself.\\"Quoted in > White 2009, p. 330-1 Reception Casey Jones was met with mostly positive reviews. The praise, in general, focused on the strength of the writing, the accomplishment of the acting, and the impressiveness of the stage design. Among notable positive reviewers were Burns Mantle, Richard Watts, Jr., and Brooks Atkinson.1938 playbill from the Group Theater production at the Fulton Theater. Atkinson, writing for The New York Times, said \\"Robert Ardrey has extraordinary Flair. He has chosen a fresh subject and populated it with pungent characters; he has also worked at it with drollery and excitement. Casey Jones is written with humorous insight into the character of odd and muscular men; the dialogue is spontaneously original; the scenes are comic and sympathetic.\\"Atkinson, Brooks.

These international treaties include the International Plant Protection Convention (1951),The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other matter (1972); The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) PNG Joined by Accession on 12/12/1975, Entry into force 11/03/1976, CITES Secretariat, List of Contracting Parties, https://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php; The RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1992); Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. PNG is also in partnership with other nations in the Oceania region and is a signatory to several regional conventions including, the Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (APIA Convention) and the Waigani Convention (Convention to Ban the importation into Forum Island Countries of Hazardous and Radioactive Wastes and to Control the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous wastes within the South Pacific Region). =Institutions and organisations= The Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA) which was formerly Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) until 2014 is the government agency responsible for biodiversity conservation. Its objectives, powers and authority are set out in the establishing Act, the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority Act 2014. The Act is expressed to bind the State of PNG (s.3). The PNG government‚Äôs effort to conserve biodiversity is supported by international environment conservation Non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The major government research organizations include the Forestry Research Institute (FRI), and the National Agriculture Research Institute (NARI). The government owned universities: the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) and the University of Technology (UNITECH) also contribute to novel researches into the PNG biodiversity. The government research organizations tend to place emphasis on species with economical value to PNG. The NGOs, on the other hand are the driving force for biodiversity conservation for the sake of conservation. The major international NGO's assisting in biodiversity conservation include: Conservation International (CI),Conservation International , The Binatang Research Centre (BRC),The Binatang Research Centre Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), World Wildlife Fund (WWF)World Wildlife Fund and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). Some indigenous PNG NGO's remain active, including Partners with Melanesians (PwM), (notably in Managalas in Oro Province and Karimui), Research and Conservation Foundation of PNG (RCF) (operating primarily in Crater Mountain WMA and on environmental education), Tenkile Conservation Alliance(in Sandaun Province), and PNG Institute of Biological Research, but others which had active conservation programmes (Conservation Melanesia, Melanesian Environment Foundation, Village Development Trust, Pacific Heritage Foundation), have largely faded from the scene, leaving conservation today mostly to the PNG offices of the large international conservation organisations; blame for the demise of the homegrown organisations has, in at least one instance, been placed partly on the afore-mentioned international conservation organisations.  Status of biodiversity protection  Lake Kutubu WMA, a wetland of international importance with 12 endemic fish species The effort by the PNG government to protect biodiversity has resulted in 44 existing terrestrial protected areas using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) categories. These protected areas account for 1.6% of the total land area. A study of biodiversity identified a further 398 areas as candidates for conservation.Nix, H.A., D.P. Faith, M.F. Hutchinson, C.R. Margules, J. West, A. Allison, J.L. Kesteven, G. Natera, W. Slater, J.L. Stein, and P. Walker, 2000. ‚ÄòThe BioRap Toolbox: A National Study of Biodiversity Assessment and Planning for Papua New Guinea.‚Äô Canberra: CSIRO Press. This would increase the total protected areas to 16.8% of the total country area. Included in the PNG protected area list, but not formally recognized by IUCN is the terrestrial Wildlife Management Area (WMA). WMA is an Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICAD),West, P. 2006. Environmental conservation and mining: Between experience and expectations in the Eastern highlands province. The Contemporary Pacific 18:295-313. which seeks to conserve biological diversity by involving landowners. The idea behind the project is that income generating activities, from the biological diversity would encourage people living in these areas to conserve, because such projects would link the value of these resources to living standard and also access to markets. The progress of WMA‚Äôs is yet to be evaluated. Papua New Guinea's first conservation area, the YUS Conservation Area, was established in 2009 on the Huon Peninsula, Morobe Province.Conservation International: YUS, retrieved 19 May 2010 Apart from local conservation efforts, PNG is also a signatory to international conventions and treaties. These international treaties include \\".Convention on Biodiversity The International Plant protection Convention (1951),The Convention on the prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other matter (1972); The convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES); The RAMSAR Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1992); Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. PNG is also in partnership with other nations in the Oceania region and is a signatory to the regional convention, The Convention on Conservation of Nature in the South Pacific (APIA Convention). PNG has two listed RAMSAR sites: Lake Kutubu and Tonda Wildlife Management Area.  Challenges to the conservation efforts  Despite the provision for conservation in the legal framework, as well as interest shown by the international organizations, it is still a challenge to carry out conservation in PNG. =Land ownership issues= The land tenure, wherein the communities own 97% of the land makes it difficult for the government or any conservation organisation to procure land for conservation. The land is believed to be an inheritance from some mystical ancestor and therefore, cannot be sold to foreigners. Therefore, involving communities in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) was identified as being compatible with the PNG land tenure system. The PNG constitution recognised this and empowered the landowners to be involved with conservation on their own land. However, the progress of WMA‚Äôs is yet to be evaluated. The national government can acquire land and land leaseholds are gaining acceptance in PNG. =Economic drivers= PNG raises most of its revenue from the extraction of natural resources; as such environmental destructive developmental projects have always taken precedence over environmental protection. =Forestry= The logging industry in PNG has been identified as the main source of widespread overexploitation of forest as well as species dependent on the forests. About 23% of the 50,000-60,000 ha cleared permanently is done by industrial logging. The forest that took millions of years to evolve is deforested at an average rate of 1% per year. The reluctance of government support for conservation can be seen in government documents containing recommendations which are very general with no defined goal for the future of conservation. =Population growth rate= The increase in human population (3.2% children per child bearing female) has increased the per capita consumption of the biological resources. For instance, the pressure to hunt big game for food has increased with the growth of population,Dwyer, P.D., n.d. Etolo Hunting Performance and Energetics this situation is exacerbated by the fact that when these animals become rarer, their value will resulting in added pressure to acquire them. The rate and efficiency of harvesting has also increased, aided by modern and efficient harvesting implements. Furthermore, is the misconception by the populace that natural resource is infinite. For instance, some coastal communities practice ‚Äúdynamite fishing‚Äù, without knowing that this practice not only kills fish and other marine organisms indiscriminately, it also destroys the coral reefs. Most coastal communities have little understanding how fish stocks are recruited and maintained in the oceans.Foale, S and Manele B 2004, Social and political barriers to the use of Marine protected Areas for conservation and fishery management in Melanesia. Asia Pacific Viewpoint, Vol 45, # 3 pp373-386 On the side of forests, =Criticism of international NGOs= There has been strong debate about whether conservation driven by international NGOs is truly sustainable in PNG; certain large integrated conservation-development projects operated by the local offices of these international NGOs has come under fire, and broader complaints have surfaced.http://forests.org/archived_site/today/recent/2003/pngnewc2.htm The criticism is that international conservation NGOs have become corporate entities in a way that no longer mirrors the way indigenous conservation initiative has naturally evolved in countries prior to their existence. =Climate change= The effects of climate change and the introduction of exotic species add another dimension onto the challenge of conservation. The potential impacts from climate change (changes in geographical range, morphology, physiology and phenology) on terrestrial species are shown to be happening elsewhere; however no formal studies have been conducted on PNG terrestrial species as yet. However, the effects of climate change are definitely showing on the coastlines. Rise in sea level is starting to displace people in low-lying islands. Furthermore, coral bleaching, an effect of high temperatures and increased carbon dioxide in oceans was observed from the PNG waters in 1996.Davies, J.M, Dunne R.P, Brown, E.B, 1997, Coral bleaching and elevated sea-water temperature in Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea, 1996, Mar. Freshwater Res., 1997, 48, 513‚Äì6 =Invasive species= In the case of the introduced species, since the 1950s, 26 species of fresh water fish were introduced into PNG, out of which 11 species are now established in the fresh water systems and competes for resources with the 214 native fresh water species. The Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromomis mossambica) was introduced in 1954, as a protein supplement.Coates, D 1989. Review of Aquaculture and Freshwater Fisheries in Papua New Guinea. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Rome Currently, the tilapia is very widespread and important as food for some communities. However, it has a negative effect on indigenous fauna in lakes and rivers because of its prolific breeding and bottom feeding habit. Furthermore, studies have shown that the over the years that there has been a decrease in the native fish catch and an increase in the introduced tilapia.Dudgeon, D 1994.

It was the last episode to be produced and transmitted by BBC Television. This episode is also known as \\"World War 2\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot It is the Second World War, and Tim, Bill and Graeme are only two years old. However, they are much bigger in size than the usual two-year-old children -- even bigger than the four-year-old, six-year-old, and eight-year-old children who are attending the same school for gifted children as they are. Graeme and Bill are dressed in school uniforms and are both very intelligent two-year-old children. Tim, however, arrives at the school in a pram wearing a bib and bonnet, so it would appear that his inclusion in a school for gifted children is a mistake -- or too soon. There is some implication that Tim's rich parents have paid vast sums of money so that he can attend the school, despite his average intelligence. When a live bomb crashes into the room that Tim, Bill and Graeme are in, they are given the task to disarm it. Graeme and Bill set about disarming the bomb, but find the going difficult when Tim tries to put square objects into round holes and round objects into square holes, and tries banging the objects in, in his frustration to do so. However, Bill and Graeme are successful in what they are doing and the bomb is disarmed. Then they are given their next assignment -- they are to enter Germany and bring a cigar back for Winston Churchill. It is thought that, as children, they might find it easier to enter and leave Germany than an adult would. Tim, Bill and Graeme parachute into Germany, and Graeme and Bill successfully land. However, Bill misses catching Tim, who is all broken up as a result. Graeme puts all of Tim's 'spare parts' into a pram, and then asks Bill for Tim's head (which is still in its bonnet) -- however, Bill accidentally brings back a cabbage, much to Graeme's disgust. After further searching, Tim's head is found and Graeme then 'operates' on him -- giving Tim a clock for a heart, and a toy voicebox and a wind-up key to make Tim move, thereby turning Tim into the \\"Six Million Dollar Baby\\". Back in England following their successful trip to Germany, the two-year-old Goodies are asked to impersonate Winston Churchill in public (as the \\"real\\" Churchill looks like Adolf Hitler). Tim is given the job of acting the part, but the Goodies run into unexpected problems.

It is the sequel to Forward's Rocheworld (also known as The Flight of the Dragonfly), a novel about the first manned interstellar mission to a unique double planet orbiting Barnard's Star. It features a return journey to that planet by the crew of the lightsail powered Starship Prometheus. Several new characters are introduced, including Reiki LeRoux, who makes only a brief appearance in this novel but is the main protagonist in a sequel novel, Marooned on Eden. The Flouwen are also featured more extensively, and Flouwen culture is explored. A new species, the Gummies, is also introduced, living on the Roche lobe of the strange double planet. The story picks up where the Rocheworld left off, but before the final chapter set years later. Major General Virginia \\"Jinjur\\" Jones leads a return journey to Rocheworld, where they set up a communication station for the flouwen to use. Having discovered that the Roche lobe of the planet is subject to periodic flooding, the explorers return there along with several Flouwen, (including one youngling who wants to be like the humans) to find that Roche also harbors not only life, but intelligence as well. They find a species which they come to call the Gummies, after their resemblance to the texture of gummi candy. These beings are related to the Flouwen of the water-covered Eau lobe, but have evolved in a completely different direction. Built to survive harsh conditions, extremes of temperature, long droughts, and competing for scarce food supplies, these elephant-sized multi-tentacled creatures are far more physical and aggressive than their aquatic ancestors.

History In 1976, Sir Michael Sobell and the friends of Sobell House (now the Sobell House Hospice Charity) donated the funds to help build the original hospice. The charity has since raised ¬£3.7 million to build a new twenty bed hospice which was opened in 2003. For thirty years Sobell House has been providing care and support to thousands, of residents throughout Oxfordshire, affected by life limiting illness. The focus is on the needs of the individual and on those that love them. Multi-disciplinary teams strive to offer dignity, peace, support and freedom from pain. The care is dedicated to the whole person, aiming to meet all their needs - physical, emotional, social and spiritual. The service is free to those who need it regardless of their beliefs, race or age. The work of Sir Michael Sobell House is recognised as a World Health Organisation (WHO) collaborating Centre for Palliative Care, and this unique establishment contributes to education and research relating to palliative care on an international level. The work of the hospice currently costs in the region of ¬£3 million a year to run and continues in large part thanks to the work of the Sobell House Hospice Charity and the support shown by individuals and organisations throughout the county. Sobell House Hospice Charity Sobell House Hospice Charity has operated since 1974 when Dr. Alstair Laing established the committee the Friends of Sir Michael Sobell House. The committee swiftly developed to become the Friends of Sobell House with Sir Michael Sobell as patron and the Duchess of Marlborough as president. By 1975 the membership of the Friends of Sobell House totalled 60 and Lord Trend (Rector of Lincoln College and formerly Secretary of the Cabinet) was Chairman. Later in 1975 the Charity Commission accorded the Friends of Sobell House charity status. Thanks to generous donations from Sir Michael Sobell, the NSCR (currently Macmillan Cancer Support) and the people of Oxfordshire, the Friends of Sobell House had raised ¬£300,000.00 by 1979 allowing the first hospice to be built and handed over to the public. The current hospice is very different from the building handed over in 1979, the light airy space was built following a ¬£3,000,000.00 fundraising drive by the Charity. Funds were raised with donations from the people and business of Oxfordshire, and The Sobell Foundation. The Charity current operates as Sobell House Hospice Charity Ltd and although it has been through many constitutional changes its aims remain the same as the original friends: # To ensure that links to the community are established and nurtured to support patients and encourage volunteering. # To raise funds to benefit Sobell House. # To engage with other bodies for the benefit of Sobell House. Today the Charity and NHS work together to ensure that good quality specialist palliative care and end of life support is provided by the Hospice. Sobell House Hospice is an NHS hospice, with additional funds provided by the Charity. The funds provided by the Charity are used for the day-to-day running of the hospice, to help the hospice staff focus on developing care, and to allow the hospice to reach out and provide care in the community and other hospitals. The Charity is based in an office within the current hospice building, the day-to-day running of the Charity is responsibility of Diane Gardner the Chief Executive. The Charity's trustees take overall responsibility for the Charity and may be seen at fundraising events. =Current Fundraising= The Charity's fundraising team are based in the Charity's head office and engage with corporate sponsors and individuals, as well as running numerous events. Individuals raise funds for the hospice by taking part in a range of activities from coffee mornings to marathon running to sky diving. The Charity and the hospice also engage a large volunteer work force from the local community who donate their time to reduce the overheads of running the Charity. The Charity also manages and gains funds from numerous legacies. As well as raising funds from individuals the Charity has strong relationships with local businesses. Companies are encouraged to engage with the Charity in a variety of ways ranging from donations through to donations of time. To help the Charity celebrate its fortieth birthday the 40 Club was formed which is a group of 40 companies each pledging to raise ¬£10,000.00 over the next four years to support the work of the hospice. The main activities of the fundraising team is organising and hosting events. The Charity's annual headline event is the Moonlight Stroll where walkers are sponsored to complete a late night walk around the beautiful Oxford city centre. The stroll start in 2006 and goes from strength to strength each year the target of the 2015 was to raise ¬£100,000.00 in just one evening. The Charity holds numerous other events throughout the year culminating with, the Christmas Gift Fair and the Lights of Love. =Sobell House Charity Shops= The main public face of the Charity is its eleven shops located across Oxfordshire. The shops sell a variety of donated items from large pieces of furniture through to small ornaments and clothing. The trading company also sells a mix of new goods including branded calendars, Christmas cards and diaries. The shops are run from the Trading Office a separate administrative unit from the Charity office. All the profits from the sale of donated and new goods are donated to the Charity each year. Currently the Charity's shops raise approximately the same amount as the fundraising team.

A native of the Swiss canton of Uri (he was probably born in Klingnau), Zwyer initially pursued a military career. From 1612 to 1617, he served in a mercenary regiment in the service of Spain and Milan; from 1619 to 1642 he was in service for the Habsburg emperors, first for Ferdinand II and then Ferdinand III. Zwyer fought in several battles of the Thirty Years' War. He participated in the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, fought at Gl√ºckstadt in 1624, at Mantua in 1630, and at N√∂rdlingen in 1634. In 1635 he was promoted to the rank of Major-General and made a member of the emperor's staff, where he was responsible for reforming the armies following the Swedish example. From 1638 to 1641 he again fought in northern Italy, commanding his own regiment of Swiss mercenaries. He abandoned his military career in 1642 at the rank of Lieutenant Field Marshal (equivalent to a lieutenant general). In 1642 he returned to Uri and became active in local politics. 1643 the emperor named Zwyer his official envoy in the Confederacy. From 1644 to 1659, he filled the top positions in Uri: he was one of the two representatives of Uri at the Tagsatzung, the federal council of the Old Swiss Confederacy, and from 1647 on also the Landammann (head of state) of the canton. In 1648, the Tagsatzung designated him and Johann Rudolf Wettstein, the mayor of Basel, the official negotiators of the Confederacy at the Treaty of Westphalia with the task to ensure the formal exemption of the Confederacy from the Holy Roman Empire. During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, Zwyer commanded the joint troops of the city of Lucerne and Uri, putting down the revolt in the Entlebuch valley in the canton of Lucerne. Three years later, he again commanded Catholic troops in the First war of Villmergen, when he led the defence of Rapperswil against attack from Zurich troops but refused to take direct offensive action himself.

Charleston, the keeper, > has taken a job there to flee from a detestable world. Opposing Charleston's > pessimism, Streeter, his friend, says he is giving up his job to become an > active member of society again.

Believing > that \\"Mankind's got one future‚Äîin the past,\\" Charleston breathes life into > these creatures of his imagination. They live again on the stage. As he > talks to them we see passengers as they really were, each seeking sanctuary > from a disturbed Europe, running away from life, yet needing the same hope > and strength as Charleston himself. Charleston's sincerity convinces these > creatures that he really has the courage to lead his fellow men into a > better world, and in this faith they are content to die again. Inspired by > their confidence, the lighthouse-keeper returns to useful work, determined > to create a new order out of the chaos of the old.Thunder Rock at Dramatists > Play Service Conception The initial inspiration for Thunder Rock came in 1938 while the playwright, Robert Ardrey, then on an extended honeymoon on Nantucket, was working on a different play.Ardrey, Robert. Plays of Three Decades, Introduction. New York: Atheneum. 1968. Print He writes in his autobiography of being taken by the image of the lighthouse at Siansconset and by the drama of the frequent nor'easters.Ardrey, Robert; Ardrey, Daniel (ed.). \\"The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography\\" (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center) At the same time, the conflict in Europe was escalating, and Ardrey took the signing of the Munich Agreement to be a certain harbinger of war. Ardrey did not have the idea for the play, however, until he returned to New York. He writes in his autobiography of the moment of inspiration during a performance of Swan Lake: > That afternoon, eyes closed, enjoying the music with moderation, I descended > into a world between the Tigris and the Styx. And within the course of the > performance I had beheld Thunder Rock. I had the play from beginning to end, > complete with the first, second, and third act curtains. I never had the > experience again, and I must wonder how many authors have gone through a > similar spell. Ardrey moved with his wife, Helen, to New Orleans, where he wrote the first draft. New York Production Having finished the first draft Ardrey showed it to his agent, Harold Freedman, and to his friend, the influential Broadway director and producer Elia Kazan, who had directed Casey Jones. Kazan engaged Harold Clurman to direct members of the theater collective The Group Theater, including Lee J. Cobb, Morris Carnovsky, and Frances Farmer. The production was mounted at the Mansfield Theater (now the Brooks Atkinson Theater). Rehearsals were begun amidst growing tension in Europe, and the company, convinced that war would break out within weeks, resolved to open as quickly as they could. However, after the Invasion of Poland there was a period of relative quiet in Europe, leading to a belief in America that the threat had been overblown. Senator William Borah during this period famously dubbed the conflict \\"The Phoney War.\\"\\"Defiant Peace Bid Hurled By Hitler\\". The Pittsburgh Press. September 19, 1939. The play, which called for American involvement in a crisis in Europe, debuted to an increasingly isolationist audience amid a growing conception that there would be no war. =Reception= The negative criticism of Thunder Rock largely focused on its call to intervention. John Anderson wrote, \\"The Group is playing spook-a-boo at the Mansfield theater.\\"Anderson, John. Quoted in Ardrey, Robert. Plays of Three Decades, Introduction. New York: Atheneum. 1968. p. 24. Print Brooks Atkinson, writing for The New York Times, wrote that \\"Thunder Rock exudes so much thunder, and contains so little rock.\\"Atkinson, Brooks. Quoted in \\"The Education of Robert Ardrey: An Autobiography\\" (unpublished manuscript ca. 1980, available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center) p. 65. The play ended up closing after 23 performances.\\"Footnotes on Headliners\\" Undated review. Available in the Robert Ardrey Papers. Special Collections Research Library: University of Chicago. Box 11, Folder 2 Thunder Rock also won acclaim. In 1940, in recognition of the play, Ardrey was awarded the first ever Sidney Howard Memorial Award for young playwrights.Anderson, Maxwell. Dramatist in America: Letters of Maxwell Anderson, 1912-1958. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Books, 2001. Print It inspired many subsequent productions. London Productions During the winter of 1939 Ardrey's Broadway agent Harold Freedman sold the British rights of Thunder Rock to the London theater director Herbert Marshall. Marshall sent the script to then rising star Michael Redgrave, who later wrote, \\"I thought it one of the most exciting plays I had ever read.\\"Redgrave, Michael. In My Mind's Eye: An Autobiography. Sevenoaks: Coronet. Print Redgrave agreed to star, and they launched a production at the Neighbourhood Theatre in London. The company included Bernard Miles, Fredda Brilliant, and Frederick Valk.Marshall, Herbert. \\"'Thunder Rock' London, June 1940. From The Writings of Herbert Marshall After the Battle of Dunkirk most London Theaters voluntarily closed, and when Thunder Rock went up, two nights after the Fall of France, it was one of only two productions in London. The first London production of Thunder Rock was a huge and unqualified success.‚ÄúThunder Rock - An Appreciation,‚Äù London Times Literary Supplement, Aug. 10, 1940‚ÄúTheater Boom in London‚Äù New York Times Aug. 23, 1940 The eminent British theater critic Harold Hobson wrote that the opening night was \\"One of the greatest evenings ‚Ä¶ in the entire history of the theatre.\\"Hobson, Harold. Theatre in Britain: A Personal View. Oxford: Phaidon, 1984. pp. 122-3. Print. When Winston Churchill read of the play, he sent his Minister of Information, Duff Cooper; his scientific advisor, Lord Lindeman; and his wife, Clementine.Marshall, Herbert. ‚ÄúObituary: Robert Ardrey (1907-1980).‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôBulletin of the Center for Soviet & East European Studies‚Äô‚Äô Spring 1980. pp. 4-6. Print Duff Cooper reported back to Churchill, who is said to have told his cabinet that \\"This play is the greatest contribution to British Morale there has yet been.\\" He had Cooper arrange to have the treasury department fund it. Cooper coordinated with Michael Redgrave to launch a major production at the Globe Theatre in London's West End. The role of the government in funding the arrangement was kept secret until after the war. The BBC also broadcast a live radio production with the theater cast on July 15, 1940, at 10:15 PM.BBC Genome Project. http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2b7a2614481348ef92324ad4d6a18b70 The production at the Globe ran during the worsening Blitz. During air-raids the play would be paused and Michael Redgrave would lead the audience in songs. Again the production was a massive critical and popular success.Various Authors. Archival reviews of British productions of Thunder Rock. 1940. Box 11, Folder 2. The Robert Ardrey Papers 1928-1974. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL. It ran at the Globe until September when the neighboring Queen's Theater was hit by a German bomb. A production was launched at another West End institution, the St Martin's Theatre on West St., Shaftesbury Avenue. The playbill carried the following warning: > You will be notified from the Stage if an Air Raid Warning has been sounded > during the performance‚Äîbut that does not necessarily mean an air raid will > take place. > > If you wish to leave for home or an official Air Raid Shelter you are at > liberty to do so. All we ask is that‚Äîif you feel you must go‚Äîyou will depart > quietly and without excitement.Thunder Rock Playbill. St Martin's Theatre, > West st., Shaftesbury Avenue, W.C.2. Shortly thereafter Thunder Rock was taken on the road. =Reception= Both the initial run at the Neighborhood Theater and the government-funded run at the Globe were major critical and popular successes. James Agate wrote that Thunder Rock was \\"a play infinitely superior in craftsmanship, intellectual interest, pure theater and entertainment value to anything the commercial theater can offer in these heartsearching days.\\"Quoted in the introduction by E.R. Wood to Robert Ardrey, Thunder Rock. London, 1966, p. 16. The News and Chronicle described it as \\"A tonic to the mind, and a bath to the spirit.\\"Quoted in Redgrave, 1983, p. 133. The reviewer for The London Times Literary Supplement wrote ‚ÄúWhen Thunder Rock was produced for the first time in this country ... there ensued a chorus of praise that sounded almost suspicious. Can this play be as good as all that? one asked oneself, or is it merely that the gentlemen of the press, starved of something to genuinely appreciate, have leaped with an indiscriminating gusto upon the first good thing that comes their way? A visit to the theatre, however, and a subsequent reading of the play set these doubts at rest.\\" Eminent theater critic Harold Hobson later reflected on the significance of Thunder Rock: > \\"The theatre‚Ä¶ did a great deal to keep the morale of the British people > high. One intellectual play had an enormous effect in keeping alight a > spirit of hope at a time when it was nearer to extinction than it had ever > been, either before or after. This was Thunder Rock, by Robert Ardrey. What > he accomplished for the British people at a moment of supreme despair‚Ä¶ > merits their lasting gratitude. ‚Ä¶ He, more quietly but equally effectively > as Churchill, urged us never to surrender.\\"Hobson, Harold. Theatre in > Britain: A Personal View. Oxford: Phaidon, 1984. pp. 117-8. Print Subsequent Productions and Legacy When the London production closed, Thunder Rock was taken on the road. The cast was the same except that Alec Guinness took over for Michael Redgrave. It played in British cities including Manchester and Birmingham. Within six weeks after V-E day a production of Thunder Rock had been launched in Vienna. By the fall of 1945 the play was up in Budapest and Prague. Thunder Rock was the first play to go up in Allied- occupied Germany (except for a failed Russian production of Our Town) when the American forces staged a production in the American-occupied zone of Berlin.Aldgate, Anthony et. al. Britain Can Take It: The British Cinema in the Second World War 2nd ed. London: I.B. Tauris, 2007. pp. 178. Print. The American production starred Ernst Busch, a German singer and actor who had fled Germany in 1933, joined the International Brigades to fight against the Nationalists, risen to fame for his Spanish war songs, been taken prisoner in Belgium, and who had just been liberated from a P.O.W. camp at the end of the war.Ernst Busch ‚Äì ein Jahrhundertleben. ernst-busch.net. General J. L. Whitelaw, then Deputy Chief of Staff of the U.S. Headquarters in Berlin, gave a speech on the night before the opening, to mark the occasion of the presentation of the first theater license in the American zone of occupied Berlin. He said that \\"perhaps the historians will hold this year, 1945, as the beginning of a resistant freedom of expression.\\"Whitelaw, General J. L., \\"√úberspretzung der Ansprache des General J. L. Whitelaw, Deputy Chief of Staff, U.S. Headquarters, Berlin.\\" Printed in the Playbill for the Hebbel Theatre production. General Whiteclaw also went on to say \\"Thunder Rock, is the work of a young American poet, Robert Ardrey. We were touched by this drama in America, in 1939, and its inclusion in London in the following year was just as strong. The meaning and the message of this piece is deep responsibility toward our fellow human beings. We believe in that. May it find a great success in your theater too.\\" The play has since been produced in over forty German cities. 1942 saw a film adaptation of Thunder Rock, directed by the Boulting Brothers and starring Michael Redgrave. In 1946 the BBC produced a version adapted for television by Peter Sims, starring Robert Sansom.BBC Genome Project. http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e6f5920c71594a48ae4d497a117afece http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e6f5920c71594a48ae4d497a117afece The play has subsequently been produced all over the world, including in Harare (formerly Salisbury), Zimbabwe, and Nairobi, Kenya. It was translated into French as La Tour d'ivoire (\\"The Ivory Tower\\") and produced in Paris in 1958 at the Th√©√¢tre des Bouffes-Parisiens.:fr:Robert Ardrey It was also translated into a very well-received Arabic version. It continues to be popular among University theater departments. In 2012 Dennis Delaney included it in his list of \\"100 Plays You Should Have Read but Probably Haven't.\\"Dennis Delaney's 100 Plays Thunder Rock is one of the two Robert Ardrey plays still made available for production by the Dramatists Play Service.Thunder Rock at the Dramatists Play Service. The other is his 1954 play about the treatment of accused communists in post-Cold War America, Sing Me No Lullaby.Sing Me No Lullaby at the Dramatists Play Service. Later commentators have remarked upon the prescient nature of Thunder Rock. As a call to American intervention in the crisis in Europe it presaged the collapse of American isolationism. It was also one of the few pieces of art to focus not only on the European, but also the Asian threat. Albert Wertheim remarked, \\"Ardrey's play is remarkable in another way as well. It is one of the only‚Äîperhaps the only‚Äîplay of the period to see the conflicts and dangers across the Pacific. All other pre-Pearl Harbor plays of note look exclusively across the Atlantic to Hitler, Mussolini, and Europe.\\"Wertheim, Albert. Staging the War: American Drama and World War II. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. 2005. Pp. 352. Print. Elia Kazan, director of the original Broadway production, reflected fondly on the play later in his career. He wrote \\"This is a deeply democratic and deeply optimistic play, written at a time when there was a good deal of pessimism about democracy.\\"Kazan, Elia. in Bentley, Eric (compiler) et. al.

Founded by the Parkdale Canoe Club, which was established in August 1905, the team was nicknamed the Paddlers. It was also known as the Green and White, after the team colours. The team lost to the University of Toronto Varsity Blues in the first Grey Cup. The Parkdale Canoe Club also operated an amateur hockey team in the early 20th century. Billy Burch was on its roster in the 1919‚Äì20 season.  Early years (1909‚Äì1914)  The Paddlers joined the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) in 1909. In that inaugural season in the league, they finished in a first-place tie in the standings with the defending champion Toronto Amateur Athletic Club team, whom they defeated 9‚Äì3 in the resulting playoff, securing the ORFU title in their first season of play. As league champions they qualified to compete for the Dominion championship along with the champions of the Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union and the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union. After the Intercollegiate champion University of Toronto Varsity Blues defeated the Interprovincial champion Ottawa Rough Riders in the Dominion semifinal, the Paddlers faced the heavily-favoured Blues in the final. They lost 26‚Äì6 at Rosedale Field in Toronto, having trailed 6‚Äì5 at half-time. For the first time that season, the Dominion champions were presented with the Grey Cup, giving Parkdale a place in Canadian football history as one of the first two teams to challenge for the trophy. After a winless 1910 season the Paddlers dropped out of the ORFU, making their return to the league in 1912. In the meantime, the Parkdale Canoe Club had iced an Ontario Hockey Association junior team. In 1913 the Paddlers finished in first place with a record of 3‚Äì1 and defeated the Toronto Rowing and Athletic Association team 8‚Äì5 in a playoff to capture their second ORFU championship. When the Intercollegiate champions, McGill University, declined to participate in the Dominion championship, Parkdale advanced to their second Grey Cup berth, losing to the favourite Hamilton Tigers in Hamilton by a score of 44‚Äì2.  Later years (1914‚Äì1923)  With the outbreak of war in 1914, the Paddlers again dropped out of the ORFU and did not return to league competition until 1920. In 1921 they won their third ORFU championship and advanced to what, in previous seasons, would have been the Grey Cup final against the Toronto Argonauts. However, in 1921 a new layer of competition was introduced to the Dominion championship pitting the Eastern Canada champions against the Western Canada champions for the Grey Cup. Playing in the first-ever Eastern Final, Parkdale was beaten 16‚Äì8 by the undefeated Argonauts, who went on to win the first-ever East-versus-West Dominion title. In 1922 the Paddlers repeated as ORFU champions with a 6‚Äì0 record, only to fall again to the Argos in the Eastern Final by a score of 20‚Äì1. After finishing in second place in 1923, Parkdale dropped out of the ORFU for the third and final time. The football club would fold, but the Parkdale Canoe Club continued to thrive as a social and athletic club. In 1935 the club changed its name to the Boulevard Club. It continues to operate under that name today.  References   Further reading  * A monumental history of early Canadian football by Frank Cosentino, a player and scholar of the game.

He built Manoir Rouville-Campbell, and was a prominent member of the Montreal Hunt. Early life He was born at Bedford Square, London, January 4, 1809. He grew up in an affluent family, the fifth of the six children born to Duncan Campbell (d.1815), who had made a fortune in the West Indies, and Harriet (d.1817), daughter of Robert Young of Auchenshcoch. He was the grandson of Alexander Campbell (1710-1760), 11th Laird of Inverawe, Argyll, descended from Archibald Campbell of Inverawe. His brother, Colonel James Campbell, built New Inverawe, today known as Ardanaiseig Hotel. He was a brother-in-law of Sir Alexander Spearman 1st Bt., of Hanwell, and his sister-in-law was a niece of Lt.-General Sir James Campbell, 1st Bt., of Inverneill. In 1832, he graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was appointed Captain of the Royal Scots and aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Campbell. He transferred to the 1st The Royal Dragoons and then joined the 7th Queen's Own Hussars, serving in the Near East. Canada The Montreal Hunt in front of Campbell's home, Manoir Rouville, Quebec He came to Lower Canada during the Lower Canada Rebellion and he led a group of Mohawks against the Patriote forces at Ch√¢teauguay. He stopped pillaging by other loyalist forces afterwards and arrested the ringleaders who had instigated it. He became Governor Charles Edward Poulett Thomson's military secretary and aide-de-camp in 1838. As such, he helped structure the first election held in the Province of Canada in 1841 to aid candidates favoured by the Governor. In 1841, he married Henriette-Julie, the daughter of seigneur Michel-Louis Juchereau Duchesnay and his wife, daughter of Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine d'Irumberry de Salaberry. Through his wife, Campbell inherited the seigneury of Rouville in 1844. Their youngest son married one of the daughters of Sir Hugh Allan, of Montreal. Campbell settled at Saint-Hilaire in 1846 and set up a model farm there. A year later, he became civil secretary for the new governor, Lord Elgin and superintendent- general of Indian affairs. He resigned this post when the capital was moved to Toronto in 1849. In 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Rouville and generally voted with the Conservatives. After he was defeated in 1861, Campbell retired from politics. He was a director of the Bank of Montreal and the Grand Trunk Railway. He was a member of a commission set up in 1862 with the aim of improving civil defence in the province. Campbell continued to supervise the operation of the seigneury of Rouville until his death in 1872. Unlike many seigneur of English origin, Campbell conducted the business of the seigneury in French.

After serving briefly as a soldier in 1900, Dowlan began his decade-long stage career.In the cited federal census of 1900, Dowlan identifies his then-current occupation as \\"Soldier\\", although later, in the census of 1930, he lists himself as a non- veteran. The trade magazine Motion Picture News describes his stage experience in a short \\"authorized\\" biography of Dowlan published in 1916: Film In 1912 Dowlan refocused his acting career, turning from the stage to the rapidly expanding entertainment medium of motion pictures. That year he relocated to California and began performing in lead roles as a contract player with the new Universal Film Manufacturing Company, which had just merged with the Nestor Film Company. In fact, Dowlan's initial acting assignments in 1912 were in shorts produced under Universal‚Äôs Nestor logo or \\"brand\\". Later, after several years of performing before the camera, Dowlan became interested in directing as well, often serving as both actor and director in the same production. The first in a series of films in which he performed those dual roles was the 1915 one-reeler short Her Mysterious Escort. The next year he retired from acting after performing in and directing Drugged Waters, which was released in March 1916. The screenplay for that film, like most of Dowlan's productions in this period, was written by his wife Leonora Ainsworth. Soon after the release of Drugged Waters, both Dowlan and Ainsworth left Universal. He then joined the American Film Company to direct Youth's Endearing Charm, starring Mary Miles Minter and Harry von Meter. Following the completion of that film in the summer of 1916, he continued to direct for other studios for several more years, until he retired from the film industry in the early 1920s.  Post-film work Dowlan's wife Leonora had stopped working as a screenwriter even before William quit directing films. The couple did, though, continue to live in Los Angeles and work together in an entirely new business, that of merchandising women's apparel.

Founded outside the city walls, it was built in coal sandstone, starting in the late 11th century (the chancel) and lasting until the late 12th century (the massive westwork, with its twin towers which were reconstructed in 1876). It underwent, like most ancient religious buildings, modifications through the centuries. Nevertheless, the Meuse Romanesque‚ÄîOttonian architecture character of its architecture remained deeply rooted. The 18th century saw the addition of two more aisles, the opening of a neoclassical portal in the walls of the westwork, and the French Baroque redecoration of the interior. The interior of the western section has recently been restored back to the original style. The Collegiate Church of St. Bartholomew was one of the original seven collegiate churches of Li√®ge, which also included the Churches of St. Peter, St. Paul, St. John, St. Denis, St. Martin, and the Holy Cross, and until the Li√®ge Revolution of 1789 collectively comprised the \\"secondary clergy\\" in the First Estate of the Prince-bishopric of Li√®ge. In 2006, the church emerged from heavy restoration work lasting seven years and involving 10,000 replaced stones and the restoration of the polychromy of the walls). Font of Renier de Huy: The baptism of Christ  Art collections  The church contains numerous works of art, among which may be mentioned The Glorification of the Holy Cross, a tableau of the local painter Bertholet Flemalle (1614-1675); The Crucifixion, from another local artist, Englebert Fisen (1655-1733); and a statue of St. Roch by Renier Panhay de Rendeux. Font of Renier de Huy: The baptism of the catechumens St. Bartholomew is the site of one of the most known examples of ecclesiastical Mosan art, a baptismal font attributed to the goldsmith Renier de Huy. It was commissioned at the beginning of the 12th century (1107-1108) by the Abbot Hellin for the Church of Notre-Dame-aux-Fonts, now destroyed, where local baptisms traditionally were administered. The font was installed in St. Bartholomew Church in 1804, after having been spared from the occupying forces of the French Revolutionary Army. This work heralds a resurgence of Greek influences on Western art. The brass tank, resting on ten (originally twelve) ox figures, presents five scenes: the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, the preaching of St. John the Baptist, the baptism of the catechumens, the baptism of the Centurion Cornelius, and the baptism of the philosopher Craton.

It is in the civil parish of Barley-with-Wheatley Booth. The village lies between Black Moss Reservoirs and Ogden Reservoirs, and is within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The hamlet of Barley Green is immediately southwest of the village. The village is close to Pendle Hill, and is a popular starting point for walkers of this hill. The circular Pendle Way long-distance trail passes through here. There is a children's playground by the stream. There is also a substantial 1920s public house, The Pendle Inn, and a restaurant, The Barley Mow. It has won the small village category in 1996 and the hamlet category of the Lancashire Best Kept Village competition in 2008 and 09.  History  The Pendle Inn in Barley After a cow farm was established around 1266, Barley earned its livelihood from agriculture. This continued up until the 18th century. During the 18th century textiles began to be manufactured as an extra source of income. The brooks around Barley offered an effective source of waterpower which led to the building of several cotton factories. Two small cotton mills were built at Narrowgates and Barley Green. At its height, Barley Green Mill had 200 looms, until floods destroyed the building in 1880. The cotton twist mill at Narrowgates, which was built by William Hartley to spin cotton warp thread, and the adjacent weavers cottages survive and are now private houses. In December 2011, United Utilities engineers were \\"stunned\\" to unearth a 17th-century cottage, complete with a cat skeleton, during a construction project in the village, near Lower Black Moss reservoir. There has been some speculation that the well-preserved cottage could have belonged to one of the Pendle witches, although there is no evidence to suggest that it did. Simon Entwistle, an expert on the witches, said: \\"In terms of significance, it's like discovering Tutankhamen's tomb\\". Frank Giecco, from NP Archaeology, who unearthed the building, said: \\"It's like discovering your own little Pompeii. We rarely get the opportunity to work with something so well preserved.\\" Many artefacts from the building's latter years, such as Victorian crockery, a tin bath and a bedstead, were discovered around the site.\\"'Witch's cottage' unearthed near Pendle Hill, Lancashire\\"; bbc.co.uk  References  External links *forestofbowland.com - Aitken Wood and Pendle Sculpture Trail Walk Category:Towns and villages in the Borough of Pendle Category:Forest of Bowland ","title":"Barley, Lancashire"},{"id":"8048664","text":"In wide area network computing, Link Access Procedure for Frame Relay (or LAPF) is part of the network's communications protocol which ensures that frames are error free and executed in the right sequence.

The phrase, which was used in a 1949 conference speech at the Sydney Trades Hall by then Prime Minister Ben Chifley, has Biblical origins. 'City upon a Hill' is a metaphor from the Salt and Light section of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. The speech, delivered near the end of Chifley's term as Prime Minister, pays tribute to the people who make up Australia's labour movement.

Biography MacDonald was born in Mulgrave, Nova Scotia, Canada, and attended school in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He started as a messenger boy with the Dominion Steel Company in Sydney, Nova Scotia. He later worked up to teller with the Royal Bank branch in Sydney before the bank transferred him to Vancouver, British Columbia. From there, he moved to California, where he acted on the stage before making inroads into Hollywood. MacDonald handing Norma Talmadge a bouquet in The Lady, 1925 MacDonald started as an actor in films in 1914 and starred in almost 120 motion pictures between then and 1932. He had notable roles in such films as Youth's Endearing Charm in 1916 working with Mary Miles Minter and Harry von Meter. Late in World War I, he returned briefly to Nova Scotia to enlist in the 10th Canadian Siege Battery where he assisted in recruiting for the Canadian Army. With the advent of sound, MacDonald's acting career diminished, and most of his roles between 1927 and 1932 went uncredited. He retired from acting in 1932 to concentrate on script writing. However, by 1937 he had recognized the potential of film production. It is in his role of producer that MacDonald is now probably best remembered. He produced well over 100 films between 1937 and 1959. MacDonald married actress Doris May in 1921, and they remained wed until his death. He died in 1978 in Santa Barbara, California. McDonald is sometimes mistaken as a brother of actor Francis McDonald. Though they bear a physical resemblance and were born in 1891, they were born three months apart and spelled their surnames differently.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a small village in east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is twinned with Plouguerneau in Brittany, France. Its name derives from its location on the River Tiddy, literally meaning \\"Ford on the River Tiddy\\". Tideford is not listed in the Domesday Book but the earliest settlement is thought to have been around 1100AD. The bridge over the River Tiddy at the bottom of Bridge Road dates from the 14th century and this is the earliest surviving structure. Westbound view of Tideford Tideford grew in the eighteenth century as the nearby Port Eliot country estate built a number of houses in the village. Many of these have now been sold, but of note is 'Bridge House', located at the bottom of Bridge Road, which remains a gatehouse onto the estate. The village is on the busy A38 between Saltash and Liskeard, one of two main road routes into Cornwall (the other being the A30 which runs into north Cornwall). Tideford does not have a railway station, the nearest being at St Germans, some two miles south. The village has a butchers' shop, a Post Office, a branch of the Royal British Legion, a Montessori nursery, an abattoir and a small public house. Churches The Victorian church of St Luke was designed by renowned architect George Wightwick. The building was originally erected as a chapel-of-ease in St Germans parish and was consecrated on 31 July 1845, consisting of a chancel, nave and gable-cote containing two bells. The church is fitted with oak seats and contains a pulpit. The registers date from 1845. Tideford is now part of the united parishes of St Germans, Hessenford, Downderry and Tideford. The small Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1838 and there was also a Reformed Methodist chapel. There was also once a Society of Friends' (Quakers') Meeting house and attached Burial Ground in Tideford.David M Butler's Quaker Meeting Houses of Britain (1999) Volume 1 Page 72  Twinning  * Plougerne, Brittany, France  Cricket  Although there is a cricket team called Tideford Cricket Club, the club has not played in the village for over 50 years and now plays on the outskirts of the neighbouring village of St Germans just 2 miles away along the B3249. In the late 19th Century the Earl of St Germans had a cricket ground purposely built about a mile West of St Germans along the B3249. The sloping land was excavated and tree trunks were laid as a base before being covered with top soil to give a flat playing surfaces thus making it one of the first purpose built, if not the first, cricket grounds in the County. St Germans Cricket Club played on the ground until folding in the early 1970s. From 1975 the ground has been the home ground of Tideford Cricket Club who re-located from a site they had been using near Trerulefoot. The club made the press in the late 70s when they were able to put out a full 11 players from the Snowdon Family. The views from the ground stretch out to the East as far as Maker Church (7 miles away) and several miles to the South across the valley to the Plymouth - Penzance railway line. To the North the ground is bordered by woods. Whilst the ground is very picturesque the facilities are basic with no mains electricity available (quoted ¬£15K for installation in the 1990s).

The words of one of the French missioners, Jean Richard, testify to his great authority among his contemporaries, \\"I believe him to be the father of all Georgia.\\" Sulkhan Saba Orbeliani was born on 4 November 1658, in Village Tandzia near Bolnisi in the Kvemo Kartli. He spent his childhood and adolescence there. He was brought up at the court of King Giorgi XI and acquired his encyclopedic knowledge in the Great Palace Library. When he was 20‚Äì25 years old he wrote a collection of fables and tales Sibrdzne Sitsruisa (A Book of Wisdom and Lies, Georgian ·É°·Éò·Éë·É†·É´·Éú·Éî ·É°·Éò·É™·É†·É£·Éò·É°·Éê), containing the observations he had made about life. The reader feels how ably, deliberately and naturally the author weaves together his ideas about the lives of both humans and animals. Orbeliani understands both the light and the dark side of human nature and human experience. He describes many aspects of life, answers many questions, and encourages the reader towards greater kindness and compassion. His next important work was The Georgian Dictionary, which combines both a lexicon and an encyclopedia, one of the first works of its kind in history.\\"The world does not know the encyclopedia yet. Collection of these words is a great treasure. The first volume was published in 1754; The French Academy published the French language dictionary only in 1685.‚Äù A. Jikia Orbeliani was the creator of a new literary Georgian language. His dictionary for the language is still essential for those who wish to learn Georgian today. His immortal genius is mostly shown in his works, which became the most popular monuments of the Georgian literature ‚Äì together with ‚ÄúThe Knight in the Panther's Skin\\" (the poem of the 12th century of the greatest Georgian poet and philosopher Shota Rustaveli). Sulkhan Saba Orbeliani was an educator of the King of Kartli Vakhtang VI. Remarkable poet and scientist Vakhtang VI was the leader of the great movement initiated for an intellectual renaissance in Georgia. In 1709 the first printing-house was established, where for the first time the Gospel and ‚ÄúThe Knight in the Panther's Skin\\" were printed. During this period the Georgian chronicles were collected, the basis of the Georgian historiography. Sulkhan Saba Orbeliani was in the center of the political and social life of the country together with Vakhtang VI. Sulkhan was searching methods of freeing the country from the Osmans. In 1698 Sulkhan became a monk at the Monastery of David Gareji, from thence called Sulkhan-Saba. Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani appealed to the West for assistance. The growth of his state authority was crowned by his diplomatic missions. He travelled via Constantinople, Marseilles, Paris, Rome, and other cities of Italy and finally back to Georgia through Constantinople and Turkey. In Paris Sulkhan-Saba appeared before Ludwig XIV and in Italy before the Pope Clement XI, who treated him as the Father of all Georgia. The French said of him: ‚ÄùIt is happiness that we have had the advantage of seeing the Wisdom of Solomon and divine grace with our own eyes in the person of Your Greatness‚Äù. France promised assistance to Georgia, but soon Louis XIV died. The ruling circles in France changed and relations with countries of the Near East became aggravated. Concrete historical circumstance made the travel of Sulkhan-Saba unsuccessful, his attempts to bring Georgia and the states of Western Europe together turned out to be all in vain.  Religion  Before becoming a monk of David-Garedja Monastery in 1698 under the name Saba, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church (1692). He originally practiced his new religion in secret. After 1703 he made spreading the Catholic faith in Georgia a major policy of King Vakhtang VI, who had been his pupil. In 1713‚Äì1714 he made a journey to the Holy See and to France. He visited Pope Clement XI and King Louis XIV and requested aid from them for King Vakhtang and the Catholic Faith in Kartli (East-Georgian Kingdom). After his return to Kartli he actively began trying to spread Catholicism in Georgia, for which the Georgian Orthodox Church persecuted him. In 1724 he fled with King Vakhtang to the Russian Empire.

She was a member of the 1960s experimental music collective Theatre of Eternal Music, and is known for her collaborative work with her husband, the minimalist composer La Monte Young. MELA Marian Zazeela Life and work Born to Russian-Jewish parents and raised in the Bronx, Marian Zazeela was educated at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts and at Bennington College where she studied with Paul Feeley, Eugene C. Goossen and Tony Smith. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in painting in 1960. Shortly after graduation, she relocated to New York City where she provided stage design for LeRoi Jones / Amiri Baraka's The System of Dante's Hell and acted and modeled for Jack Smith (appearing in his film Flaming Creatures and photography book The Beautiful Book), before being introduced in 1962 to composer La Monte Young, with whom she has been associated ever since.LaBelle, Brandon. Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art (2006) New York and London: Continuum International Publishing, pp. 71 & 73-74 During a period of rapid growth in the early 60s, Zazeela not only joined Young's musical group Theatre of Eternal Music as vocalist (which also included, at various times photographer Billy Name, minimalist musician Terry Riley, musician John Cale, video artist and musician Tony Conrad, and poet and musician Angus MacLise), but also produced for them light shows (among the earliest in the form) which may have inspired Andy Warhol and were contemporaneous to the early work of better-known light-artist Dan Flavin. This work derived from her earlier - more expressionistic - calligraphic canvases and drawings, now taking on a psychedelic aspect by mostly using slides of still images and colored gels blended in exceedingly slow dissolves from one to the next creating optical effects associated with Op Art. In 1965, she titled this body of work the Ornamental Lightyears Tracery, and it was subsequently presented at the Museum of Modern Art, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Fondation Maeght, Moderna Museet, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Documenta 5, Haus der Kunst, MELA Foundation, and Dia Art Foundation; among other galleries and museum venues. Over the next 30 years, Zazeela elaborated this work into increasingly environmental and sculptural forms, often incorporating the use of colored-light and colored- shadow, which she titled Dusk Adaptation Environment (installation), Still Light (sculpture), Magenta Day / Magenta Night (installation/sculpture), and, more generally, Light. Obsessed with duration and color saturation, by the late 60s, Zazeela began presenting light-work in collaboration with Young's minimal music in what were envisioned as long-term installations titled Dream Houses.LaBelle, Brandon. Background Noise: Perspectives on Sound Art (2006) New York and London: Continuum International Publishing, pp. 73-74 One of them, at 275 Church Street, above the couple's loft, has run since the early 1990s, and is open to the public four days a week. In 1970, Zazeela began studies in the Kirana school of Hindustani classical music with Pandit Pran Nath, of whom she has been a devoted disciple ever since. (Pandit Pran Nath died in 1996.) Her \\"Selected Writings\\" were published with Young in 1969 and a book on the two of them, with writing on Zazeela by Henry Flynt and Catherine Christer Hennix (edited by William Duckworth), was published in 1996 by Bucknell University Press.

Eligibility It was awarded to officers of the Army Supplementary Reserve or Army Emergency Reserve of Officers for 12 years continuous or aggregate service, with war service counting as double and previous service in the ranks counting as half. Officers commissioned in either reserve between 8 August 1942 and 15 May 1948 who transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers after 10 years service were also eligible. The Emergency Reserve Decoration was not awarded for service after 1967, on the creation of the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, when it was replaced by the Efficiency Decoration with brooch bar inscribed T.& A.V.R., although a number of retrospective awards were later made. The official order of wear specifies that the ERD is worn after the Hong Kong Disciplined Services Medal and before the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. Recipients may use the letters ERD after their name. Other ranks in the Emergency Reserve were eligible for the Army Emergency Reserve Efficiency Medal. Appearance The obverse is a silver and silver- gilt oval wreath of oak leaves, 55mm high and 37mm wide. Queen Elizabeth II's Royal cypher (EIIR) is in the centre, surmounted by a crown, both gilded. The reverse is plain, with the year of award engraved at the bottom. The dark blue ribbon with a central yellow stripe is attached to a ring on top of the crown, and is finished at the top with a brooch bar bearing the inscription ARMY EMERGENCY RESERVE. Save for the different ribbon and bar brooch inscription, the award is identical to the Efficiency Decoration. A clasp, to be worn on the ribbon, was awarded upon the completion of each further period of six years of qualifying service. The clasp is silver and has the Royal Cypher in the centre, surmounted by the Royal Crown, with the year of the award engraved on the reverse. When ribbons alone are worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon to denote each clasp. The maximum number of clasps awarded to any one officer is four.

He wrote La Grande Monarchie de France as a supporter of the French crown, in the person of Louis XII. Written around 1515, in French, it was published 1519; it supports hereditary monarchy. A Latin translation De Republica Galliae was printed in 1548 in Strasbourg. Biography Seyssel was born in Aix-les-Bains as the bastard son of Claude de Seyssell, marshall of Savoy. He studied law and theology in Chamb√©ry, Turin and Pavia. He graduated in 1485 and started teaching at the university of Turin. In 1499, he became a counsellor to King Louis XII of France, and was charged with various embassies to Italy and England. He praised the French king in Histoire singuliere de Louis XII (A Biography of Louis XII) (1508) and in Les louanges de Louis XII (In Praise of the King)(1509). To extricate himself from the dispute opposing Louis XII to Pope Julius II, he withdrew for a while from politics; in 1512, however, he went back to Rome to present his credentials to the new pope, Leo X. This was the apex of his diplomatic career. After the death of Louis XII in 1515, he gave up politics. The same year he was made bishop of Marseille. His best-known work, written at the instigation of King Francis I of France, was La grant monarchie de France (1518). He is considered as one of the best examples of French political thinking in the early 16th century. Seyssel had a high regard toward the French monarchy and constitution. He thought the power wielded by the monarch was both controlled and balanced, being limited by religion, existing laws and justice. He discussed \\"estates\\", or social class as well, dividing society into the nobility, a composite class of merchants and bureaucrats, and a third class of producers and lower-ranking merchants.Hale, J R (1971) Renaissance Europe : individual and society 1480 - 1520 p.168. His ideas were very influential in the 16th century. Later French thinkers adopted a different stance and distanced themselves from his beliefs. He was made Archbishop of Turin, in 1517, through the king's influence. (in Latin)\\"Archbishop Claudio di Seyssel\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved January 4, 2017.

Kafka wrote it as the first chapter of a novel he called Amerika; but he abandoned the novel in 1913 and published the one completed chapter alone as a pamphlet later that year. Since his death, it has usually been published along with the uncompleted fragments of Amerika. Kafka, Franz (1996). The Metamorphosis and Other Stories, trans. Donna Freed. New York: Barnes & Noble. . (217). Plot Heizer The story begins with sixteen-year-old Karl Rossmann arriving at New York harbor on a slow-moving ship. Rossman has been sent to America \\"because a servant girl had seduced him and got herself with child by him.\\" As he is about to come ashore, he remembers that he has left his umbrella below deck. He asks a young man with whom he had been briefly acquainted during his voyage to watch over his trunk as he runs to get his umbrella. The boy gets lost in the corridors and begins pounding on a door. A man lets him in and the two start having a conversation. The man explains that he is a stoker, that he works on the ship, and that he is about to be fired because his boss (a Romanian named Schubal) has a preference toward Romanians (the ship and the stoker are both German). He goes on to explain that he has worked on many ships and has always been praised for his hard work. Karl sympathizes with the stoker's story and pledges to help him. Together they go to see the captain of the ship, who is in an informal meeting with a few people. The stoker is at first allowed to enter the room, but is asked to leave after the chief purser indicates that he is too busy to hear the stoker's case. As they are being shooed out of the room, Karl runs across the room and grabs everyone's attention. He then explains that he believes the stoker has been done an injustice and that he needs to be listened to. The captain steps forward and asks the stoker to make his case. The stoker begins describing the details of his case, but in a random and disorganized way. Karl intervenes and asks the stoker to be more organized and to avoid unnecessary details. Just then Mr. Schubal comes in and denies any dishonesty on his part. He's accompanied by 15 witnesses, who are waiting outside. Among the captain's guests is a senator named Mr. Jakob, who asks Karl for his name. After recognizing Karl's name, he explains that he is Karl's uncle and that he had been informed of Karl's arrival through a letter by the maid who had earlier seduced Karl. Consequently the focus of everyone's attention changes from the stoker to Karl and people begin congratulating the senator for finding his nephew. Karl tries to use his newly found influence to gather some sympathy for the stoker's cause, but his uncle explains that it is really up to the captain to decide what happens next. The captain orders a boat lowered for the senator and his nephew. As he is entering the boat, Karl begins to weep. Karl looks at the windows of the office as he is being rowed away. Schubal's witnesses are at the windows and waving the boat goodbye. The stoker is not mentioned as being among them. Karl wonders if his uncle could ever replace the stoker.Kafka, Franz (1996).

Publication Having stopped work on the novel in January, 1913, in March Kafka sent the publisher Wolff a copy of the Metamorphosis, and tried to convince him to publish it along with The Stoker and The Judgment as a book called The Sons. This plan was not followed, and in May The Stoker was published as a 48-page book in a run of Wolff's usual 1000 copies. It was presented as volume 3 of Wolff's Day of Judgment series.

Activities  The Constitution Unit‚Äôs stated aim is to ‚Äúconduct rigorous, independent research into constitutional change and its consequences with significant real-world impact: informing policy-makers engaged in constitutional reform both in the United Kingdom and around the world.‚Äù Historically, the Unit has published extensively on issues including Freedom of Information, judicial appointments and devolution. The current Director, Professor Meg Russell, is a well-known expert on the UK parliament, and on two-chamber parliaments (i.e. bicameralism) around the world. The Unit has produced many reports and papers on the House of Lords and its reform, and most recently its work on parliament has focused extensively on the extent to which both the House of Commons and the House of Lords influence policy. Two of Russell‚Äôs reports have had particular real-world impact. One, in 2000, explored the legality of all women shortlists for selection of parliamentary candidates, and was followed by legislation to make such shortlists explicitly legal. Another, in 2007, recommended establishment of a Backbench Business Committee for the House of Commons. This recommendation was subsequently taken up by the Select Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons (the ‚ÄòWright committee‚Äô) and implemented in 2010. A 2009 study by the Constitution Unit titled \\"Making Minority Parliament Work: Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall\\" led to the publication of a Cabinet manual by the British Government in December 2010. The Constitution Unit, in partnership with the London-based Institute for Government, played a key role in the writing of the Manual. Following the appointment of Dr Alan Renwick as Deputy Director, the Unit has increasingly focused on deliberative democracy and constitution-making. In 2015, the Unit contributed to the organisation of a citizens‚Äô assembly on English Devolution run by Democracy Matters. In autumn 2017, it ran another citizen‚Äôs assembly, this time on the issue of Brexit. The Unit also established an Independent Commission on Referendums including senior politicians, public officials and academics. It considered the role and conduct of referendums in the UK, and reported in July 2018. The Unit has regularly contributed to the discussion surrounding Brexit, notably concerning how Brexit is playing out in parliament and what the outlook is for a further referendum. In October 2018, it published a report titled ‚ÄúThe Mechanics of a Further Referendum on Brexit‚Äù. The report‚Äôs suggestion that such a referendum would take 22 weeks at a minimum was widely referenced during the ongoing debate. In addition to publications, the Constitution Unit runs a regular series of public seminars on these and other related topics. Contributors include politicians, journalists, academics from the UK and overseas, and various public officials.  Directors  In 2015, former Deputy Director, Professor Meg Russell replaced Robert Hazell as Director of the Constitution Unit. She leads the Unit‚Äôs research on parliament. In the same year, Dr Alan Renwick joined the Unit from the University of Reading and took over as Deputy Director. He specialises in elections, referendums and deliberative democracy. After twenty years as Director, Robert Hazell stepped down from the role in 2015. He continues to conduct research on the judiciary, civil service and monarchy. Publications The Constitution Unit publishes a triannual newsletter called Monitor. This contains analysis of constitutional developments in the UK and overseas, and details about the Unit‚Äôs research and publications. It also has a blog that features regular posts from academics and practitioners covering a wide range of constitutional issues in the UK and overseas. A full list of the Unit‚Äôs publications can be found on its website.  Legacy  The Constitution Unit Archive is housed at the British Library.

Initially having a nominal 750 cc displacement, actually , in 1973 it became an 850 cc, actually . It had a hemi-type head, similar to all OHV Norton engines since the early 1920s. During its ten years of production, the Commando was popular all over the world. In the United Kingdom it won the Motor Cycle News \\"Machine of the Year\\" award for five successive years from 1968-1972. Given that its engine was an old pre-unit design, even Norton's chairman, Dennis Poore, expressed surprise at the Commando's remarkable success. Background The origins of the Norton Commando can be traced back to the late 1940s when the Norton Model 7 Twin was designed by Bert Hopwood. The twin-cylinder design evolved into 600 cc, then the 650 cc Manxman and Dominator until superseded by 750 cc Atlas before being launched as the 750 cc Commando in 1967. As well as having a radical new frame, the Commando's engine was tilted forward. The previous featherbed framed models like the Atlas had vertically mounted engines. This forward leaning of the engine was relatively easy as the engine was \\"pre-unit\\", that is, the gearbox was not integral with the crankcase, and the change gave three benefits: (i) the centre of gravity was moved further forward; (ii) this allowed more space behind the carburettors for the airbox; and (iii) it gave an attractive raked appearance to the motorcycle. =Isolastic system= The revolutionary part of the Commando, compared to earlier Norton models, was the award-winning frame developed by former Rolls-Royce engineer Dr. Stefan Bauer. He believed the classic Norton Featherbed frame design went against all engineering principles, so Bauer designed his frame around a single top tube. Bauer tried to free the Commando from classic twin vibration problems, which had severely increased as the volume of the basic engine design expanded from the 500 cc of Edward Turner's 1938 Triumph Speed Twin. He, with Norton-Villiers Chief Engineer Bernard Hooper and assistant Bob Trigg, decided that the engine, gearbox and swing-arm assembly were to be bolted together and isolated from the frame by special rubber mountings. This eliminated the extreme vibration problems that were apparent in other models in the range, as it effectively separated the rider from the engine. Named the Isolastic anti-vibration system, the system's patent document listed Hooper as the lead inventor. 1974 Norton Commando Motorcycle Although the Isolastic system did reduce vibration, maintaining the required free play in the engine mountings at the correct level was crucial to its success. Models =Mk1 750 cc= 1969 Norton Commando 750 Fastback in Fireflake Silver. The Norton Commando was introduced in 1967 at the Earls Court Show. The original model, called the 'Fastback' was joined by the scrambler style 'S Type' which had a high level left-side exhaust and a 2.5-gallon (11 L) petrol tank. The first Commandos had a twin- leading-shoe front drum brake. Production of the machine was initially complex and located across different parts of England, with the engines produced in Wolverhampton, frames in Manchester, while components and final assembly was at Burrage Grove, Plumstead. In late 1968 Plumstead works was subject to a Greater London Council compulsory purchase order, and closed in July 1969. With assistance of a Government subsidy, the assembly line was moved to North Way, Andover; with the Test Department in an aircraft hangar on Thruxton Airfield. Frame manufacturing was transferred to Wolverhampton, where a second production line produced about 80 complete machines each week. Components and complete engines and gearboxes were also shipped overnight, from Wolverhampton to the Andover assembly line. The production racer, featuring a tuned engine, front disc brake and finished in bright yellow, was known as the 'Yellow Peril'. In March to June 1970 the updated S called the 'Roadster' had the 750 cc engine, low-level exhaust, upward-angled silencers with reverse cones. September 1970 saw the introduction of the classic 'Fastback Mk2', which had alloy levers with modified stands and chain guards. The ‚ÄòStreet Scrambler‚Äô and the ‚ÄòHi Rider‚Äô were launched in May 1971, with the ‚ÄòFastback Long Range‚Äô with increased petrol tank capacity from July 1971. Norton Commando 750 Interstate model with its distinctive large touring size petrol tank. The ‚ÄòCombat engine‚Äô engine was introduced in January 1972 saw the appearance of the ‚ÄòMk4 Fastback‚Äô, updated ‚ÄòRoadster‚Äô and the ‚Äò750 Interstate‚Äô. The ‚ÄòCombat‚Äô delivered at 6500 rpm with a 10:1 compression ratio, but the stressed 750 cc twin proved unreliable, with main bearing failures and broken pistons. The 'Combat' engine's quality control problems exacerbated the company's troubles. By the middle of 1972 BSA Triumph group were in financial duress. The UK Government offered a financial rescue package, providing it would agree to merge with Norton Villiers. Norton Villiers Triumph was duly formed. The last of the 750 series, the MkV was produced from November 1972 to mid-1973 as a 1973 model and featured improved crank bearings and the standard grind camshaft. Compression was reduced to 9.4:1. Interpol West Midlands Police 1974 or '75 Norton Interpol (left) beside a Morris Marina patrol car After some police forces expressed interest in the Commando, Neale Shilton was recruited from Triumph to produce a Commando to police specifications. The end result was the 'Interpol' machine, which sold well to police forces, both at home and abroad. The 750 cc machine was fitted with panniers, top box, fairing, radio mountings, police lights, and auxiliary equipment. The 'Interpol' name was retained for Norton's later Norton Interpol 2 rotary engined Police motorcycle. =1973 Mk1 850 cc= 1973 Norton 850 Commando In January 1973 the ‚ÄòMk.5 Fastback‚Äô was launched and the ‚ÄòLong Range‚Äô was discontinued, foreshadowing the first 850 cc machines launched in April 1973. The ‚ÄòRoadster‚Äô, ‚ÄòHi Rider‚Äô and the ‚ÄòInterstate‚Äô all began to use a new 828 cc. engine, which had similar power to the 750 cc models but were less stressed. In late 1973 redundancy notices were issued at Andover, followed by a sit-in at the works. The Conservative Government withdrew the subsidy in early 1974: it was restored after a General Election by the new Labour Government. So NVT decided to concentrate production of the Commando at Wolverhampton and Small Heath, causing unrest at Meriden which resulted in a workers‚Äô sit in and stopping production at Small Heath. By the end of 1974 NVT had lost over ¬£3 million. The company continued to produce new Commando models, with 1974 seeing the release of the fully faired, Roadster-based ‚ÄòJPN Replica‚Äô (for \\"John Player Norton\\") and also the ‚ÄòMk.2a Interstate‚Äô. =Mk3 850 cc= Norton Commando Interstate Mk3 Norton Commando 750cc 1971. The 850 cc MK3 Commando was launched in 1975 with an improved specification ‚Äì electric starter, isolastic head steady for improved vibration absorption, left side gear change and right side foot brake to comply with United States vehicle regulations, and a rear disc brake. (full page colour advertisement) An updated model, the 'Norton 76' was planned for 1976 but never reached production. The model featured cast wheels, twin front disc brakes and a new tank and seat. A prototype '900 Commando' was also produced. It used a Triumph T180 triple engine (a T160 Trident engine increased in capacity to 870 cc) in Commando cycle parts. An 8 valve version of the engine was also in development. The range of models was reduced to just two machines, the ‚ÄòMk.3 Interstate‚Äô and the ‚ÄòRoadster‚Äô. The specification remained unchanged until October 1977 when the last machines were made, although few Roadsters were made in the end due to the higher cash sales value of the Interstate. In 1975 the Industry Minister recalled a loan for ¬£4 million and refused to renew the company's export credits. The company then went into receivership and redundancies were announced for all of the staff at the various sites. At Wolverhampton an action committee was formed in an effort to continue production and develop the ‚ÄòWulf‚Äô engine - but the works was closed anyway. NVT was saved when the Small Heath/Meriden part of the company was subsidised by Industry Secretary Tony Benn as Industry Secretary, but this did not include Commando production. Ironically, the new company bought the gates from the demolished Tong Castle and erected them at the works entrance in Marston Road. Product Issues The first production machines completed in April 1968 had frame failure problems, which were resolved with the introduction of an improved frame in January 1969. There were numerous other design problems which were gradually addressed over the years, although some persisted to the end. The early clutches could not handle the engine torque, and two small internal pins would shear off, leading to severe slippage (later resolved). The side-stand tended to break off, particularly if the owner insisted on starting the machine on the side- stand, leaving a hole in the frame beneath the engine, while the center-stand was too short to provide good support for the motorcycle, dragged on the pavement, and tended to break in half (both later improved). The engine rubber mounting system, which isolated the rider from vibration very well, left the engine to its own devices, and it shook like a commercial paint can shaker at idle. Because the rubber-mounted engine was not restrained by the frame, it shook a great deal and parts that had worked well on previous Nortons were damaged. The rocker arm oil supply line had always been made of copper tubing, but on the Commando it would fracture from vibration. The line was later changed to nylon. The head steady would also fatigue and fracture from vibration (later improved). The Amal carbs had float needle leakage from vibration, which led to flooding and fires, exacerbated by having the ignition points located under the right hand carb (relocated to the right side of the engine after the first year). The carburettors themselves also wore out prematurely from vibration (persistent problem). The main bearings were of two types at first, ball and roller. In 1972 both bearings became roller-type, and the crankcase was stiffened. These main roller bearings in the now stiffer case would gall at high revs, leading to main bearing failure. This was resolved after the Combat model debacle, firstly using an R&M;/RHP 6/MRJA30 special bearing designated \\"Superblend\\". This was superseded by an extra high capacity FAG NJ306E standard bearing early in 1973. Images of the bearings are available on Wikimedia Commons. The threaded aluminum knobs holding the seat would strip, leaving the seat loose (never resolved). The chain guard mount would fracture (later improved). The exhaust pipe manifold nuts were problematic to the end, loosening from vibration no matter how tightly they were fastened, leading to a ruined cylinder head and constant rattling of the header pipes. The brake light switches were unreliable, leading at times to no brake light indicator (front was improved with disc brake). The steering head bearings were ball-type, and took a permanent set under the bearing pre-load, leading to weaving at speed (later switched to roller bearings). There was a rear chain oiler which covered the rear wheel in oil, and had to be pinched off by the owner. The speedometer drive mechanism operated from the rear wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from the right side of the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary chain tensioning bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain adjusting bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated). Racing From its 1967 beginnings the Commando took part in racing events. After successes in 1969 by dealer-entered machines like Paul Smart's second and Mick Andrew's 4th places in the Isle of Man TT Production class and a win in the Hutchinson 100 Production Class by Mick Andrew on the Gus Kuhn entered Commando and 4th by Peter Williams' Arter Bros machine, the company decided to produce a racing model, hence developed the S and \\"Yellow Peril\\" models. In the early 1970s, with sponsorship from John Player Special cigarettes, Norton went factory racing. The new race bikes were based on the Commando, and in 1973 Peter Williams won the Formula 750 Isle of Man TT on a semi-monocoque framed \\"JPS Norton\\" special which he designed as an integrated package with a Peel-type fairing incorporating handlebar blisters which helped to reduce the drag coefficient to 0.39. (full page colour advertisement) From John Player Norton: The Norton Twins. \\"The unique semi-monococque construction gives the Norton the advantage of less weight, improved ground clearance and better banking angles than other, ordinary bikes. Even the blunt fairing was designed to reduce the drag coefficient to a remarkable 0.39\\" Shortly afterward there was a merger of Norton Villiers with BSA-Triumph (to form NVT). This event led the factory to abandon racing; and a Norton factory team did not resume racing until the Wankel-engined Nortons of the 1980s.

These were based on production of new parts sourced from various manufacturers, and the legal battle over the Norton name between Germany (whose Norton was based on the Rotax 650 cc engine that powers the smaller BMW motorcycles), Canada and North America. Many used the Commando name for their lead model, or included the prospect of a Commando twin at a later date. However, the most interesting development for original Commando fans was the development of re- manufactured original motorcycles. These mainly came from Norvil in the UK and two companies in the United States, Colorado Norton Works and Kenny Dreer's Vintage Rebuilds based in Portland, Oregon. From 1995 onwards Vintage Rebuilds began restoring vintage British and Italian motorcycles, with Dreer showing a \\"new\\" Commando based Norton VR880 Sprint Special in 1999 with newly cast and manufactured parts, but using a bored out 880 cc twin engine with some modern developments. Kenny Dreer progressed from restoring and upgrading Norton Commandos to producing whole machines. He modernised the design and in the early 2000s went into series production of the Commando 961 SS, which combined traditional Norton cafe racer styling with new technology including carbon fibre wheels to reduce weight and a chro-moly tubular steel frame. Dreer was forced to suspend production in April 2006 following funding problems. The Norvil Motorcycle Company was formed to build replica models of some classic Norton models. The company acquired some Norton trademarks, including the hybrid name of 'Norvil'. New Commando 961 UK businessman Stuart Garner, owner of Norton Racing Ltd, acquired the rights to the Norton Commando brand. His company, Norton Motorcycles (UK) Ltd, established a new factory at Donington Park, Leicestershire in 2008 to manufacture a new Commando model, designed by Simon Skinner. There are three models in the new Commando range: a limited edition of 200 Commando 961 SEs, a Cafe Racer and a Sport model. In March 2010 Norton shipped the first new Norton Commando for over 30 years; and by mid-April 2010 the Company was shipping 5-10 new machines per week. The engine is a 961 cc fuel-injected air-cooled ohv 270¬∞ parallel-twin that produces 79 bhp (59 kW). The short-stroke engine is oversquare, with an 88 x 79 mm bore and stroke. At the bike's front are inverted (USD) forks and twin disc brakes. The engine (rather like the BSA A7) is \\"semi-unit\\", in that the 5-speed gearbox is a separate casting, but is bolted directly to the primary chaincase. Some styling is reminiscent of the original Norton Commando, especially the engine and petrol tank. The new Norton has received favourable press reviews. In a March 2012 interview, Garner revealed that Norton was receiving support from the UK Government's Export Credit Guarantee service, which should alleviate cash-flow problems and enable a significant increase in factory output. Garner added that Norton now makes an increasing number of components \\"in-house\\", reducing reliance on outside suppliers.

White Rock is a white sandstone outcrop and one of many on the ridge. The rock has views in all directions although there are small trees on top. The rock is quite soft and is covered with graffiti, from as early as 1919. The area was used as a training area by American forces in the late 1930s and 1940s. This protected the area from logging with munitions lodged in trees creating risk for timber cutters. Walking tracks The tracks in White Rock Conservation Park are a mixture of well-maintained near the carpark and unmaintained elsewhere. =White Rock Walking Track= This out-and-back track leads from the car park at Paperbark Flats Picnic Area located at the end of School Road to White Rock itself alongside the gully for most of the way. It is for the most part a gently graded well formed walk, although much of the route is on a vehicle track. In dry weather the track is covered with bulldust. In wet seasons there is often water obstacles to be crossed. There is a steep and rugged climb to the foot of White Rock at the end. There is no formal track to the top of White Rock, and it is claimed that the local indigenous people would prefer that you did not do so, but it is possible to scramble up via a route near the northern end of the rock. Local wildlife including echidnas, wallabies, kangaroos and even dingos have been observed in the area. The area has abundant bird life, including endangered species such as the Glossy Black Cockatoo. =The Ridge Track= An alternative route for most of the distance from the carpark to the Rock follows the ridge instead of the vehicle track. This is a Class 5 (Australian Standard) walk. The eastern end of this track is obvious from the foot of the Rock, but the western (start) end is not obvious and is not well signposted. The Western path has been updated as of April 2008 by the local council and is easily seen and has a clear track. The Ridge Track starts 50 m further along the vehicle track. =Little White Rock Track= Little White Rock Track is a 250 m diversion from the main White Rock Track. The walk is a Class 3 (Australian Standard) walk and travels up the hill to the sandstone outcrop. =Boardwalk= Six Mile Creek Boardwalk, 2010 Six Mile Creek boardwalk is a 375 m diversion from the main White Rock Track and transverses in a loop through paperbark forest. The boardwalk is a Class 2 (Australian Standard) walk. Depending on the time of year the area has abundant birdlife. There is also a significant intrusion of lantana. =North Valley Track= The North Valley Track is for advanced bush walkers only. This is an unmarked track. The north valley track used to be a vehicle track like most of the main tracks but is now overgrown and used mostly by dirt bike riders.

The type-piece, the first example discovered, is named for its location at Mantua; the type is represented by neo-Attic Imperial Roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed Greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century BCE, in a style similar to works of Polyclitus but more archaic. The Apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm, of which in the Louvre example (illustration) a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps. More than a dozen other replicas of the type have been found, the principal ones being those conserved in the national museums of Naples and of Mantua. The lost original would have been bronze. The name of the teacher of Phidias, Hegias of Athens is sometimes invoked, but there are no surviving examples of Hegias' work to judge from.

It is classically defined as \\"depression of gradual onset occurring during the involutional years (40-55 in women and 50-65 in men), with symptoms of marked anxiety, agitation, restlessness, somatic concerns, hypochondriasis, occasional somatic or nihilistic delusions, insomnia, anorexia, and weight loss.\\"Brown RP et al. Involutional melancholia Revisited, Am J Psychiatry 141;1, January 1984 Involutional melancholia is not recognized as a psychiatric disorder by the DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) classification and diagnostic tool. Signs an symptoms Hodophobia is a specific phobia as classified in the DSM-5. Involutional melancholy's 'course was chronic, with agitation, depersonalization and delusions of bodily change and guilt' featuring strongly, but 'without manic features'.Brockington, p. 47 Symptoms of fear are also considered to occur, as well as despondency and hypochondriacal delusions. The late onset of the disorder was matched with a prolonged course with poor prognosis and/or deterioration, in the absence of treatment. Treatments Involutional melancholia is classically treated with antidepressants and mood elevators. Electroconvulsive therapy may also be used. Mid-century, there was a consensus that the technique indeed 'yields the best results in the long-lasting depressions of the change of life, the so-called \\"involutional melancholias\\", which before this form of treatment was introduced often required years of hospitalization'.Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (Penguin 1976) p. 358 The 21st century also records 'an excellent and rapid clinical response found in melancholia of recent onset...in older rather than younger patients'M. A. Taylor/M. Fink, Melancholia (2006) p. 153 with ECT =Psychoanalysis= Otto Fenichel considered that 'psychoanalytically, not much is known about the structure and mechanism of involutional melancholias; they seem to occur in personalities with an outspoken compulsive character of an especially rigid nature. In the climacterium the compulsive defensive systems fail'.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 406 History Emil Kraepelin (1907) was the first to describe involutional melancholia as a distinct clinical entity separate from the manic-depressive psychosis, arguing that 'the processes of involution in the body are suited to engender mournful or anxious moodiness'.Kraepelin, quoted in G. E. Berrios, The History of Mental Symptoms (1996) p. 311 Right up until 'the seventh edition of his textbook Kraepelin considered involutional melancholia as a separate disease', of acquired origin, but (partly in response to Dreyfus) 'he decided to include it in the eighth edition under the general heading of manic depressive insanity'.M. M. Abou-Saleh et al., Principles and Practice of Geriatric Psychiatry (2011) p. 5 Dreyfus (1907) had challenged Kraepelin's concept of an acquired origin, maintaining it to be endogenous in origin - although 'a recent statistical study of Dreyfus's old series has also shown that his conclusion that the natural history of involutional melancholia was no different from that of depression affecting younger subjects was wrong'.Abou-Saleh, p. 5 Kirby (1909) described it as a distinctive syndrome, as did Hoch and MacCurdy in 1922. Titley (1936) described the premorbid personality and narrow range of interests, etc., Kallman (1959) found incidence of schizophrenia in the families of such patients. Debate about causation - endogenous or environmental - as well as its status as a clinical entity continued into the late twentieth century. Some contend that whereas 'involutional melancholy was conceptualized as an acquired rather than constitutional disorder, these ideas have not survived careful scrutiny'.I. F. Brockington, Motherhood and Mental Health (1996) p. 48 R. P. Brown in 1984 maintained that 'there is insufficient evidence to view involutional melancholy as a separate clinical entity', but at the same time that 'clinical characteristics of patients with unipolar endogenous depression may be influenced by age'.

The screenplay by Lester Cohen is based on the 1915 novel Of Human Bondage by W. Somerset Maugham. Plot Sensitive, club-footed artist Philip Carey is a Briton who has been studying painting in Paris for four years. His art teacher tells him his work lacks talent, so he returns to London to become a medical doctor, but his moodiness and chronic self-doubt make it difficult for him to keep up in his schoolwork. Philip falls passionately in love with vulgar tearoom waitress Mildred Rogers, even though she is disdainful of his club foot and his obvious interest in her. Although he is attracted to the anemic and pale-faced woman, she is manipulative and cruel toward him when he asks her out. Her constant response to his romantic invitations is \\"I don't mind\\", an expression so uninterested that it infuriates him ‚Äì which only causes her to use it all the more. His daydreams about her (her image appears over an illustration in his medical school anatomy textbook, and a skeleton in the classroom is transformed into Mildred) cause him to be distracted from his studies, and he fails his medical examinations. When Philip proposes to her, Mildred declines, telling him she will be marrying a loutish salesman Emil Miller instead. The self-centered Mildred vindictively berates Philip with nasty insults for becoming romantically interested in her. Philip begins to forget Mildred when he falls in love with Norah, an attractive and considerate romance writer working under a male pseudonym. She slowly cures him of his painful addiction to Mildred. But just when it appears that Philip is finding happiness, Mildred returns, pregnant and claiming that Emil has abandoned her. Philip provides a flat for her, arranges to take care of her financially, and breaks off his relationship with Norah. Norah and Philip admit how interpersonal relationships may amount to bondage (Philip was bound to Mildred, as Norah was to Philip, and as Mildred was to Miller). Philip's intention is to marry Mildred after her child is born, but a bored and restless Mildred is an uninterested mother, and gives up the baby's care to a nurse. Bette Davis and Leslie Howard At a dinner party celebrating their engagement, one of Philip's medical student friends, Harry Griffiths, flirts with Mildred, who somewhat reciprocates. After Philip confronts Mildred, she runs off with Griffiths for Paris. A second time, Philip again finds some comfort in his studies, and with Sally Athelny, the tender-hearted daughter of one of his elderly patients in a charity hospital. The Athelny family is caring and affectionate, and they take Philip into their home. Once again, Mildred returns with her baby, this time expressing remorse for deserting him. Philip cannot resist rescuing her and helping her to recover from another failed relationship. Things take a turn for the worse when Mildred moves in, spitefully wrecks his apartment and destroys his paintings and books, and burns the securities and bonds he was given by an uncle to finance his tuition. Philip is forced to quit medical school, but before he leaves the institution, an operation corrects his club foot. The Athelnys take Philip in when he is unable to find work and is locked out of his flat, and he takes a job with Sally's father as a window dresser. As time progresses, a letter is sent to Philip which informs him that his uncle has died, leaving a small inheritance. With the inheritance money, Philip is able to return to medical school and pass his examinations to become a qualified doctor. Later, Philip meets up with Mildred, now sick, destitute, and - the movie obliquely hints - working as a prostitute. Mildred's baby has died, and she has become distraught and sick with tuberculosis. Before he can visit her again, she dies in a hospital charity ward. With Mildred's death, Philip is finally freed of his obsession, and he makes plans to marry Sally.

Instead of Barthelmess, Cromwell's attention was drawn to Bette Davis, whose portrayal of a femme fatale brought to mind the slatternly waitress Mildred in W. Somerset Maugham's 1915 novel Of Human Bondage. Cromwell knew producer Pandro S. Berman had purchased the rights to Maugham's story for Leslie Howard and when he suggested Davis would be the perfect co- star, Berman agreed.Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis. New York: Hawthorn Books 1974; , pp. 41‚Äì42, 50‚Äì51, 57‚Äì63, 68 Maugham also supported her being cast in the role.Higham, Charles, The Life of Bette Davis. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1981; , pp. 66‚Äì72 Screenwriter Wilson Mizner brought a copy of the Maugham novel to Davis, who was in the midst of filming his 20,000 Years in Sing Sing. After reading it and learning RKO held the screen rights, she implored Jack L. Warner to lend her to the rival studio. \\"At the time, however\\", Davis later recalled, \\"Warner Brothers had other plans for me. They thought they needed me desperately for such immortal classics as Fashions of 1934, The Big Shakedown, and Jimmy the Gent.\\"Chandler, Charlotte, The Girl Who Walked Home Alone: Bette Davis, A Personal Biography. New York: Simon & Schuster 2006. , pp. 93‚Äì100, 102 She reluctantly filmed those as well as Fog Over Frisco but continued to harass Warner, who continued to object because he felt the role of Mildred would destroy her glamorous image, the same reason Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, and Ann Harding reportedly declined the role.Of Human Bondage at Turner Classic Movies \\"An evil heroine such as Mildred was really unheard of in that day. J. L. could not possibly understand any actress who would want to play such a part\\", Davis said. Warner finally relented only because Mervyn LeRoy wanted RKO contract player Irene Dunne for Sweet Adeline, the screen adaptation of the Jerome Kern-Oscar Hammerstein II musical, and the two studios agreed to trade actresses. Bette Davis was acclaimed for her portrayal of the shrewish Mildred in Of Human Bondage.In order to prepare for the role, Davis hired an English housekeeper: \\"She had just the right amount of cockney in her speech for Mildred. I never told her she was teaching me cockney ‚Äì for fear she would exaggerate her own accent.\\"Davis, Bette, A Lonely Life. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons 1962. , pp. 173‚Äì76, 179‚Äì80 Her efforts failed to impress Leslie Howard who, along with other British cast members, was upset an American had been cast in the role. \\"I really couldn't blame them\\", Davis stated. But his behavior on the set was distressing. \\"Mr. Howard would read a book off-stage, all the while throwing me his lines during my close-ups. He became a little less detached when he was informed that the kid was walking away with the picture.\\" Film historian Kingley Canham observes that Leslie Howard, in the ‚Äúgentlemanly understatement‚Äù of his performance, served as a counter-balance to Davis‚Äô frequent domination of her less-talented male co- stars.Canham, 1976 p. 74-75: Davis ‚Äúis matched by the gentlemanly understatement of Howard‚Äôs playing, yet he is sufficiently fluid an actor to present Davis from dominating the film as she used to do at Warners with male leads of limited talent such as George Brent and Paul Henreid.‚Äù Davis designed her own make-up for the scenes depicting the final stages of Mildred's illness, changed from syphilis to tuberculosis to satisfy the demands of the Hays Code,Vieira, Mark A., Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1999; , pg. 175 which, under Joseph Breen, was beginning to expand and rigidly enforce an all-encompassing Production Code. On July 1, 1934, three days after the film was released, the upgraded system of censorship was formally announced. \\"I made it very clear that Mildred was not going to die of a dread disease looking as if a deb had missed her noon nap. The last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are not pretty, and I intended to be convincing-looking. We pulled no punches, and Mildred emerged ... as starkly real as a pestilence.\\" Publicity still of Bette Davis in the 1934 film Of Human Bondage Reflecting on her performance in later years, Davis said, \\"My understanding of Mildred's vileness ‚Äì not compassion but empathy ‚Äì gave me pause ... I was still an innocent. And yet Mildred's machinations I miraculously understood when it came to playing her. I was often ashamed of this ... I suppose no amount of rationalization can change the fact that we are all made up of good and evil.\\"Canham, 1976 p. 75: ‚ÄúMiss Davis admirably projects the vulgarity and venality of the character without presenting a suggestion of depth - but then Mildred is a pretty shallow person.‚Äù Nervous about audience reaction to her performance, Davis opted not to attend a preview of the film in Santa Barbara, although her mother Ruth and husband Harmon O. Nelson went. Ruth later related, \\"For one hour and a half of horrible realism, we sat riveted without speaking a word, with only a fleeting glance now and then at each other. We left the theater in absolute silence. Neither of us knew what to think, for we felt the picture would make or break her, but would the public like the unpleasant story as well as the people at the preview seemed to?\\" Upon arriving home, her husband told Davis he thought her performance, while \\"painfully sincere\\", might harm her career. One reaction RKO executives never expected to hear at the preview was laughter. After watching the film several times, they felt the Max Steiner score was to blame, and the composer wrote a new one that included a motif for each of the principal characters. The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall on June 28, 1934, and went into general release on July 20. The generally rave reviews upset Warner executives, who were embarrassed one of their contract players was being acclaimed for a film made at another studio, and they tried to exclude its title from any publicity about Davis. Although her nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress was considered a sure thing by many, she was ignored in favor of Grace Moore for One Night of Love, Norma Shearer for The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and eventual winner Claudette Colbert for It Happened One Night. Angry voters ignored the nominees on their ballots and wrote in Davis's name, and it was later announced that she had come in third, after Colbert and Shearer. Price Waterhouse was hired to count the votes and initiated the custom of keeping the results a secret the following year, when Davis was named Best Actress for Dangerous. Entertainment Weekly called Davis's Oscar snub one of the worst ever. Reception Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times said the Maugham novel \\"has come through the operation of being transferred to the screen in an unexpectedly healthy fashion. It may not possess any great dramatic strength, but the very lifelike quality of the story and the marked authenticity of its atmosphere cause the spectators to hang on every word uttered by the interesting group of characters.\\" He thought Leslie Howard's portrayal \\"excels any performance he has given before the camera. No more expert illustration of getting under the skin of the character has been done in motion pictures\\", and he described Bette Davis as \\"enormously effective\\".New York Times review Also that year, a reviewer in Life magazine called Bette Davis' performance the greatest ever recorded on screen by an actress. Davis, however, failed to earn a Best Actress nomination for an Academy Award with only three nominees (Claudette Colbert, Norma Shearer, and Grace Moore) making the final cut. A loud faction heralding Davis' performance ended up with the Academy allowing \\"write in\\" votes in addition to the official nominees that year. Colbert, starring in three major films that year, nevertheless easily won the award for It Happened One Night (she also starred in two additional Best Picture nominees, Imitation of Life and Cleopatra) with Shearer coming in second. The non-nominated Davis came in third and reportedly the also non-nominated Myrna Loy came in to finish the top five for her performance in The Thin Man. The film recorded a loss of $45,000.Richard Jewel, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931‚Äì1951', Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television, Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p57 Home media In 1962, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Consequently, there are numerous poor quality DVD and online streaming copies available. WarnerMedia are the current owners of the bulk of the RKO library and a UK DVD was issued in 2003 by Warner Home Video. Original pre-print materials are not known to survive, but the film was preserved by the Library of Congress from archival 35mm elements and this version was released on US DVD and Blu-ray by Kino Lorber in 2013.

The Lemnian Athena, or Athena Lemnia, was a classical Greek statue of the goddess Athena. According to geographer Pausanias (1.28.2), the original bronze cast was created by the sculptor Phidias circa 450‚Äì440 BCE, for Athenians living on the island of Lemnos to dedicate on the Acropolis of Athens. It is unclear whether any copies survived. In 1891 German archeologist Adolf Furtw√§ngler reconstructed two virtually identical Roman marble statues which he claimed were copies of the original, and identified two Roman marble copies of the head alone. These completed statues were recreated by joining a poorly preserved marble head (kept at Dresden) and a plaster cast of a similar Roman marble head, from the collection of Pelagio Palagi in Bologna, to a pair of identical bodies in Dresden. However, both reconstructions and attributions have been disputed; see below. The sculptures concerned are: * Two full reconstructions (A and B) in the Staatliche Museum, Albertinum, Dresden, with bodies purchased in 1728 from the Chigi collection, Rome, Italy. * The Palagi head at the Archaeological Museum of Bologna, Italy. *A further head of this type, found at Pozzuoli is conserved in the Archaeological Museum of the Campi Phlegraei.Archaeological Museum of the Campi Phlegraei : Athena Lemnia As reconstructed, the completed statues are pastiches of two Roman marbles, one for the head and the other for the body. In them, Athena wears an unusual, cross-slung aegis decorated with the Gorgon's head. She is bare-headed, without a shield, holding her helmet out in her extended right hand, and with her left grasping her spear near the top of the shaft. Furtw√§ngler's identification of the original Athena Lemnia with the Dresden statues and Palagi head was based upon study of an engraved gem and by interpretation of the following passages from contemporary reports by Pausanias, Lucian, and Himerius:Furtw√§ngler, Meisterwerken der griechischen Plastik, (Leipzig-Berlin) 1893. * Pausanias 1.28.2: :[On the Acropolis] there are also two other dedications, a statue of Pericles, son of Xanthippus, and the most worth seeing of the works of Phidias, the statue of Athena called the Lemnian after those who dedicated it. * Lucian, Imagines 4 and 6: :(4) Lykinos: \\"Of all the works of Phidias, which one do you praise most highly?\\" :Polystratos: \\"Which if not the Lemnia, on which he thought fit to inscribe his name? Or the Amazon leaning on her spear? : ... :(6) From the Knidia the sculptor [of Panthea] will take only the head, ... allowing the hair, forehead, and that lovely brow-line to remain just as Praxiteles made them, and the liquid yet clear and winsome gaze of the eyes shall stay as Praxiteles conceived it. But he will take the curve of the cheeks and the fore part of the face from Alkamenes' [Aphrodite] in the Gardens, plus her hands, graceful wrists, and supple, tapering fingers. But the facial contour, its softness, and her well- proportioned nose will be supplied by the Lemnian Athena of Phidias, who will also furnish the meeting of the lips and the neck, taken from the Amazon.\\" * Himerios, Oratio 68.4 (Colonna): :Phidias did not always make images of Zeus, nor did he always cast Athena armed into bronze, but turned his art to the other gods and adorned the Maiden's cheeks with a rosy blush, so that in place of her helmet this should cover the goddess's beauty.

The seventh holder of the first creation was elevated to the peerage as Earl of Liverpool in 1796, a title which became extinct in 1851. The first Jenkinson baronetcy, of Walcot in the County of Oxford and of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, was created on 18 May 1661 for Robert Jenkinson. He had earlier represented Oxfordshire in Parliament. His son, the second Baronet, and grandsons, the third and fourth Baronet, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. The seventh Baronet (the son of Charles Jenkinson, younger son of the second Baronet) was a prominent politician and notably served as President of the Board of Trade and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1786 he was created Baron Hawkesbury, of Hawkesbury in the County of Gloucester, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and in 1796 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Liverpool, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. His eldest son, the second Earl, was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1827. He was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Earl, who notably held office as Lord Steward of the Household from 1841 to 1846. On his death the barony and earldom became extinct. The titles were revived in 1893 and 1905 respectively for his grandson Cecil Foljambe (the son of his daughter Selina Charlotte; see the Earl of Liverpool). The Jenkinson baronetcy passed to the late Earl's first cousin, the tenth Baronet. He represented Dover in the House of Commons. On his death the title passed to his nephew, the eleventh Baronet, the son of the Rt Revd John Jenkinson, Bishop of St David's. He sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Wiltshire North. The family seat is Hawkesbury near Badminton in Gloucestershire. The second Jenkinson baronetcy, of Walton Hall, Chesterfield, in the County of Derby, was created on 17 December 1685 for Paul Jenkinson, who was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1687.

Nyami Nyami is believed to protect the Tonga people and give them sustenance in difficult times. The River God is usually portrayed as male. Variously described as having the body of a snake and the head of a fish, a whirlpool or a river dragon, the Nyami Nyami is seen as the god of Zambezi Valley and the river before the creation of the Kariba Dam. He is regularly depicted as a snake- like being or dragon-like creature with a snake's torso and the head of a fish. It can be found as pendants on jewelry, usually carved out of wood, stone or bone, occasionally ivory, silver or gold both as a fashion accessory and as a good luck charm similar to the wearing of a St Christopher medallion. Elaborate traditionally carved walking sticks depicting the Nyami Nyami and its relationship with the valley's inhabitants were popular with tourists visiting Zambia and have historically been gifts to prestigious visitors. It is the traditional role of tribal elders and spirit mediums to intercede on behalf the inhabitants of the river valley when Nyami Nyami is angered. The Nyaminyami is said to reside in the Zambezi River and control the life in and on the river. The spirits of Nyaminyami and his wife residing in the Kariba Gorge are God and Goddess of the underworld. The Tonga people believe the building of the Kariba Dam deeply offended Nyami Nyami, separating him from his wife. The regular flooding and many deaths during the dam's construction were attributed to his wrath. After the Dam was completed the Tonga believe that Nyami Nyami withdrew from the world of men. Legend Although there are several different legends surrounding the Nyaminyami the Kariba legend is the most documented and widely known fable. ;The Kariba Legend \\"The BaTonga People lived in the Zambezi Valley for centuries in peaceful seclusion and with little contact with the outside world. They were simple folk who built their houses in kraal along the banks of the great river and believed that their gods looked after them supplying them with water and food. But their idealistic lifestyle was to be blown apart. In the early 1940s a report was made about the possibility of a hydro-electric scheme to supply power for the growing industry that colonialism had brought to the federation of countries that were known as Northern Rhodesia on one side of the river and Southern Rhodesia on the other, now Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 1956, construction on the Kariba Dam project was started. Heavy earth-moving equipment roared into the valley and tore out thousands of hundred-year-old trees to build roads and settlements to house the workers who poured into the area to build a dam that would harness the powerful river. The BaTonga's peace and solitude was shattered and they were told to leave their homes and move away from the river to avoid the flood that the dam would cause. Many of them were forcibly removed as they would not believe that their fields and homes they had known all their lives would now be flooded and under water. The name Kariba comes from the word Kariva or karinga, meaning trap, which refers to a rock jutting out from the gorge where the dam wall was to be built. It was believed by the BaTonga to be the home of Nyaminyami, the river god, and they believed anyone who ventured near the rock was dragged down to spend eternity under the water. Reluctantly they allowed themselves to be resettled higher up the bank, but they believed Nyaminyami would never allow the dam to be built and eventually, when the project failed, they would move back to their homes. In 1957, when the dam was well on its way to completion, Nyaminyami struck. The worst floods ever known on the Zambezi washed away much of the partly built dam and the heavy equipment, killing many of the workers. Some of those killed were white men whose bodies disappeared mysteriously, and after an extensive search failed to find them, Tonga elders were asked to assist as their tribesmen knew the river better than anyone. The elders explained Nyaminyami had caused the disaster and in order to appease his wrath a sacrifice should be made. They weren't taken seriously, but, in desperation, when relatives of the missing workers were due to arrive to claim the bodies of their loved ones, the search party agreed in the hope that the tribesmen would know where the bodies were likely to have been washed to. A Black calf was slaughtered and floated on the river. The next morning the calf was gone and the workers‚Äô bodies were in its place. The disappearance of the calf holds no mystery in the crocodile infested river, but the reappearance of the workers‚Äô bodies three days after they had disappeared has never been satisfactorily explained. After the disaster, flow patterns of the river were studied to ascertain whether there was a likelihood of another flood and it was agreed a flood of comparable intensity would only occur once every thousand years. The very next rainy season, however, brought further floods even worse than the previous year. Nyaminyami had struck again, destroying the coffer dam, the access bridge and parts of the main wall. The project survived and the great river was eventually controlled. In 1960 the generators were switched on and have been supplying electricity to Zimbabwe and Zambia ever since. The BaTonga still live on the shores of River Kariba, and many still believe one day Nyaminyami will fulfill his promise and they will be able to return to their homes on the banks of the river. They believe Nyaminyami and his wife were separated by the wall across the river, and the frequent earth tremors felt in the area since the wall was built are caused by the spirit trying to reach his wife, and one day he will destroy the dam. The small earthquakes are actually caused by the weight of water stored in Lake Kariba pressing down on the earth's crust, and intensify with changes in water levels in the lake.

It is known to play a vital role in cell-to-cell recognition processes. It is also the means by which an egg attracts sperm; first, to stick to it, then bond with it and eventually form a zygote. The discovery of the essential role that this tetrasaccharide plays in the fertilization process was reported in August 2011. Sialyl Lewis X is also one of the most important blood group antigens and is displayed on the terminus of glycolipids that are present on the cell surface. The sialyl Lewis X determinant, E-selectin ligand carbohydrate structure, is constitutively expressed on granulocytes and monocytes and mediates inflammatory extravasation of these cells. Resting T- and B-lymphocytes lack its expression and are induced to strongly express sialyl Lewis X upon activation. The sialyl Lewis X determinant is expressed preferentially on activated Th1 cells but not on Th2 cells. Structure Sialyl-Lewis X is a tetrasaccharide composed of a sialic acid, fucose and an N-acetyllactosamine. Its systematic name is 5-acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-galactosyl-(1-4)-(fucopyranosyl-(1-3))-N-acetylglucosamine (Neu5AcŒ±2-3GalŒ≤1-4[FucŒ±1-3]GlcNAcŒ≤). In humans, according to Table 1 and Fig.1 it is synthesized by four fucosyltransferases: FUT3, FUT5, FUT6 and FUT7. The other three enzymes of the sialyltransferase family ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4,and ST3GAL6 participate in the synthesis of the Sialyl-Lewis X precursor.(Fig.1) Function =Leukocyte homing= Sialyl-Lewisx is important in leukocyte tethering and rolling. Leukocytes move through the blood stream and then tether themselves to the endothelial wall and roll along the endothelial tissue to determine if they want to leave the bloodstream to get to necessary tissue. Sialyl-Lewisx is a necessary partner for the three selectins that bind the leukocyte and endothelial cells. When sialyl-Lewisx is part of an O-glycan and attached to CD34 it can then bind to L-selectin. For the binding to L-selectin to occur sialyl-Lewisx must undergo sulfation. For sialyl-Lewisx to bind to P-selectin, an O-linked glycan near the N-terminus of P-Selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is modified with sialyl-Lewisx and in combination with nearby tyrosine residues modified with sulfate, forms the binding contact for P-selectin. For sialyl-Lewisx to bind to E-selectin it can be part of either an N-linked or O-linked glycan attached to cell surface glycoproteins such as PSGL-1, CD43 or CD44. This sialyl-Lewisx mediated binding to selectins allows circulating leukocytes to stick to and roll along endothelial cells lining blood vessels thereby enabling the leukocytes to accumulate at a site of vascular inflammation. =Fertilization= Sialyl- Lewisx allows a sperm cell to recognize and fertilize an egg cell. For fertilization to occur, human sperm must bind to the zona pellucida (ZP), the translucent matrix covering the human egg composed of four glycoproteins ZP1, 2, 3, and 4, and transit through the matrix in order to fuse with the oocyte. Human ZP is coated with highly dense N- and O-glycans that are terminated with the sialyl-Lewisx sequence. The hemizona assay, which assesses sperm-ZP binding by counting the number of sperm bound to hemispheres of bisected nonliving human eggs in vitro, revealed that as little as 0.5 mM sialyl-Lewisx inhibits sperm-ZP binding by 63%. Furthermore, adding purified and solubilized ZP3 or ZP4 from the human oocyte dose-dependently inhibits sperm-ZP binding in the hemizona assay. Such evidence suggest that the early steps of human sperm- egg binding may be mediated by lectins for sialyl-Lewisx present on human sperm. Clinical significance =Leukocyte adhesion deficiency= Defective synthesis of the sialyl Lewis X antigen results in immunodeficiency (leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 2). Defective synthesis can be caused by the loss of fucosyltransferase, impairing the glycosylation of the glycosphingolipid. Sialyl Lewis x is being researched for detection and treatment of immune disorders because of its presence on leukocytes. =Blood cancers= Sialyl- Lewisx mediates phagocytosis and chemotaxis, found on neutrophils; expressed in patients with Hodgkin disease, some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and most acute nonlymphocytic leukemias. CD15 is present on almost all Reed‚ÄìSternberg cells, including their rare mononuclear variants, and, as such, can be used in immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of such cells in biopsies. The presence of these cells is diagnostic of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells display a characteristic pattern of Sialyl-Lewisx (CD15) positivity, with membranous staining combined with staining of the Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemical panels for the diagnosis of Hodgkins disease typically employ CD15 along with CD30 and CD45; the latter does not stain Reed-Sternberg cells, but does stain almost all other lymphoid cells. Sialyl-Lewisx is also present in about 50% of adenocarcinoma cells and can be used to distinguish such conditions from mesothelioma, which is typically negative. =Cancer metastasis= Sialyl- Lewisx plays a critical role in cancer metastasis, facilitating the extravasation of cancer cells out of the bloodstream while they are moving through the body. Its expression is related to tumor stage, recurrence, and overall patient survival. Therefore, sialyl Lewis x is being used as a target in studies to fight tumors and cancer cell growth. It has been shown that there is frequent overexpression of sialyl Lewis x on cancer cells and is found on both N-glycan and O-glycans. Sialyl Lewis x is being researched with CD markers to find new ways to create biosensors for cancer cells. Also, it is being used in new ways to target cancer cells specifically for cancer treatment. =In vitro fertilization= Sialyl-Lewisx is being used to achieve greater rates of fertilization of eggs in women by coating the eggs with sialyl Lewis x. =Immunity and inflammation= It plays a key role in the inflammatory response and may be used to increase the leukocyte response to infections. Sialyl Lewis x is also an inflammation-associated antigen on liver cells. It becomes over expressed on diseased liver cells and can be used as a way to detect liver disease in a patient. History The term Lewis in its name comes from the name of a family of people who suffered from a red blood cell incompatibility. The studies done on these individuals' red blood cells led to the discovery of sialyl Lewis X. Sialyl Lewis x is a very important red blood cell antigen present on the glycolipids on the plasma membrane of the cell. Its localization on the cell surface of cells led to its alternative nomenclature as a cluster of differentiation. Clusters of differentiation are a naming system devised in 1982 to classify cell-surface antigens on leukocytes identified via monoclonal antibodies. Sialyl Lewis X was assigned the name CD15.

This car sustained a loss of 34 linear feet of passenger compartment space (nearly half the car) due to telescoping. In a railway accident, telescoping occurs when the underframe of one vehicle overrides that of another, and smashes through the second vehicle's body. The term is derived from the resulting appearance of the two vehicle bodies: the body of one vehicle may appear to be slid inside the other like the tubes of a collapsible telescope ‚Äì the body sides, roof and underframe of the latter vehicle being forced apart from each other. Telescoping often results in heavy fatalities if the cars telescoped are fully occupied. The car riding on top will often be destroyed by the structure of the car below, leaving very little survivable space (although the physics of the incident may reverse the cars' roles).

Gamble's playing career spanned 16 years and saw him play for a number of teams across England and Ireland, most notably his local Cork City, as well as being capped twice for the national side before finishing his career in Singapore as player-assistant coach at DPMM FC. After retiring as a player, Gamble moved into full-time coaching before returning to Cork City as their first-team assistant coach. Club career =Cork City= Born in Cork, Gamble made his debut for Cork in the Super Cup against Bohemians in July 2000. Soon after he signed for Reading on a free transfer, before he returned to Cork City in 2004. He quickly established himself in the City first team and was a mainstay in the team that won the League of Ireland Premier Division in November 2005. He later went on to win the FAI Cup and the Setanta Sports Cup while at the club. =Hartlepool United= With Cork struggling financially Gamble was allowed to look for a new club and joined Hartlepool United for a trial in December 2009. Hartlepool's Director of Sport Chris Turner was impressed with Gamble and signed him permanently on 5 January 2010. He joins former Cork teammate Denis Behan at Victoria Park. In May 2011 he was not offered a new contract by the club, along with nine other players from the 2010/11 squad. =Limerick= Joe Gamble signed for Limerick on 23 June 2011. Gamble made his Limerick debut on 16 July 2011 against Athlone Town at Athlone Town Stadium. Joe Gamble was an integral part of the Limerick F.C side for the remaining of the 2011 season as Pat Scully's side pushed for promotion for from the First Division. Gamble made 13 league appearances in midfield for the Shannonsiders as they narrowly missed out on a promotion play-off place to Monaghan United. =DPMM FC= Following Gamble's release from Limerick, he went on a two-week trial with DPMM FC of the S.League, along with Francis Jeffers, on 24 November 2013. Following the completion of the trial Brunei DPMM announced they would be signing Gamble along with Robert Alvi≈æ and Boris Raspudiƒá. He scored his first goal for the club against Young Lions on 23 August 2015. He won the 2015 S.League with DPMM on 21 November 2015. International career In his early career at Cork City and Reading, Gamble made eight appearances for the Republic of Ireland under-21s, scoring once. The goal came as part of a 3‚Äì2 win against Denmark at his 'home' stadium, Turners Cross. In 2006 Joe was nominated on the eircom League team of the season and was shortlisted for player of the year. His displays for 'City did not go unnoticed by Ireland manager Steve Staunton and in May 2006 he was called up to the Irish International team. He manned the substitutes bench in a match against Chile, but a poor performance saw Staunton unwilling to experiment late in the game. Gamble later played for the Republic of Ireland B team against Scotland in November 2006. In doing so he became only the third City player ever to do so. In May 2007, it was announced that Gamble had again been drafted into Steve Staunton's Republic of Ireland squad to travel to the United States to take part in friendly matches against Ecuador and Bolivia. He made his international debut against Ecuador on 23 May 2007 at the Giants Stadium, and having suitably impressed, he started the game against Bolivia three days later at the Gillette Stadium, thus becoming the first home-based player to feature in a Republic of Ireland starting eleven since Glen Crowe's appearance against Greece in 2002. Coaching career In 2014 and 2015, Gamble assisted Steve Kean on and off the field at Singapore Premier League club DPMM FC as they won the league title for the first time in their history. Retiring at the end of 2015, he then worked as a fitness coach at Waterford FC in 2017 and later in a similar role at his former club, Limerick, from 2018 to 2019.

This database was created in response to a worldwide recognition that the absence of a readily accessible source of design data was acting as a significant impediment to the wider application of PM products. Primarily aimed at designers and engineers in the industries using PM products, it is designed to provide verified physical, mechanical and fatigue data for a range of commercially available PM materials. This culminated in the initial launch of the database at the PM World Congress in Vienna in October 2004. The content of the database, at this launch, was restricted to data on low alloy ferrous and stainless steel PM structural part grades and bronze and iron-based PM bearing grades. However, enhancement and extension of content and searching capability has been an ongoing process ever since. Of particular note, in January 2007, the content was expanded with the addition of data on non-ferrous PM structural part grades, followed, in March 2007, by the introduction of a new section covering data on Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) materials. The latest extension to capability involves making full SN Fatigue Curve ‚Äúpages‚Äù (comprising SN curves and details of individual test points) accessible to searchers. The initial content comprises over 130 SN Curve pages, covering a range of Fe-Cu-C grades and based on published information that has been analysed and collated by the group led by Professor Paul Beiss at the Technical University of Aachen. The collated SN curves cover a range of material processing conditions and density levels and a range of fatigue testing conditions (fatigue loading mode, mean stress level and notch factor). In assembling the GPMD content, a broad range of mechanical, fatigue and physical property data has been collected from the associations‚Äô memberships and rigorously evaluated by regional accreditation committees. However, the database‚Äôs primary targets are designers and material specifiers in end-user industries who may have no prior knowledge of PM. Therefore, the bulk of the search structure has been designed to take such a searcher to the point where they can decide that they ought to contact a PM parts manufacturer to discuss a potential application in more detail.

Although in one interpretation of his life, he was merely a high- flying banker, he could also have been said to have helped start the restaurant revolution in the UK of the 1980s, and to have been the original father of the Canary Wharf development. He helped found the London Eurodollar market, saving London's position as a global financial centre. He also made a huge impact in his work for charity and the English Speaking Union. All this despite his training being as a Professor of Anthropology. Early life and education Von Clemm was born in Long Island, USA on March 18, 1935, the son of Werner von Clemm, a prominent German-American banker, and grandson of a former Citibank Vice-President. When Von Clemm was 6 years old, during WWII, his father was arrested for trading smuggled diamonds from Europe and served two years in prison, before returning to banking. Michael was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy (class of 1953) and Harvard University (anthropology), where he met his wife Louisa B. Hunnewell of Wellesley, MA. The couple left the USA at the end of the 1950s to study, and Michael took a postgraduate course in anthropology at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was awarded his Doctorate. As part of his studies, he had lived with the Wachagga tribe in Tanzania for 14 months. Academic life did not entirely suit him, however, and he tried his hand at journalism, with a stint on the Boston Globe as a reporter. He maintained an interest in anthropology throughout his career in banking. He was an assistant professor of anthropology at Harvard University from 1971‚Äì1972 and then when he transferred to London with CSFB, became Visiting Professor of Anthropology at the University of Sussex, earning the title Professor. Von Clemm did not use it while in banking, but occasionally his bank colleagues ‚Äì and competitors ‚Äì referred to him as Professor in a reference to his intellectual style. Roux Brothers In 1967, Von Clemm borrowed $900 to help two young French brothers, Michel and Albert Roux, start a restaurant business. With their first enterprise, Le Gavroche in London's Mayfair, they won first one, then two, and finally three Michelin stars, the first restaurant in the UK to do so. The Roux brothers have been credited with helping make London one of the world's best cities for eating, paving the way for other high quality restaurants which opened in their wake during the 1970s and 1980s. Von Clemm became Chairman of the Roux Restaurants Group and remained friends with the brothers. Banking career In a career move away from academia, Von Clemm followed his father and grandfather to Citibank in 1963 where he gained a reputation for innovation ‚Äì and dealmaking. He responsible for inventing several financial instruments and services. He found himself posted to London where he worked with a fellow American, Stanislas Yassukovich, at White Weld, on the development of the Eurodollar CD market. Citibank launched its first Eurodollar issues in 1966. However Von Clemm went back to Harvard Business School to lecture. In 1971, Yassukovich hired Von Clemm to join White Weld, first as a temporary consultant on the feasibility of a Euro-commercial paper market, which did not catch on. However in 1972 Von Clemm effectively gave up his academic career to concentrate on banking full- time. He had an aggressive style ‚Äì for example on one occasion printing up T-shirts for staff which read Buy Bonds. He was also said to effectively bully clients into taking on the bank. When Credit Suisse took a 40% stake in White Weld, he rose rapidly to become a senior Director of the combined Bank. However, Merrill Lynch made a play for White Weld in 1978 and Credit Suisse needed a new partner. The existing Chairman Sir John Craven wanted Dillon (later Warburg Dillon Read). Von Clemm went behind his back and did a direct deal with First Boston. This prompted Craven's resignation. Von Clemm replaced Craven as Chairman of the newly formed Credit Suisse First Boston, and then additionally Chief Executive in 1979. Although often controversial in his decisions, and taking several large risks, he turned CSFB from a relatively staid bank to a global powerhouse, propelling it into the top leagues of global banking. He stepped away from his Chief Executive role in 1983 but remained Chairman until resigning in January 1986. Von Clemm was known for his enormous expense claims and dramatic personal style. He was a regular ‚Äì practically weekly ‚Äì user of Concorde ‚Äì and counted some of the world's most powerful figures as his friends. However, he also made large profits for his bank and was regarded as one of the biggest rain-makers in the City. Creates original concept of Canary Wharf In his capacity as Chairman of Roux restaurants, Von Clemm visited London Docklands in the early 1980s, in the company of London Docklands Development Corporation Chief Executive Reg Ward. He was looking for a site for a food processing plant and the old West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs seemed to be a sensible location. Billingsgate Market had already moved there from the City of London and the site was well linked with transport, land was relatively cheap and there were incentives available for regeneration projects. However, Von Clemm recognised the old 18th Century warehouses as similar to those in Boston which had been converted into shops, restaurants and flats ‚Äì as well as office developments. In fact, there was a direct connection ‚Äì the warehouses on both sides of the atlantic had been built at the same time to service the lucrative transatlantic trade in raw materials and manufactured goods. Von Clemm decided that a much more interesting use for the site would be as a back office for his bank. By the time he discussed this with his board, and in particular his buccaneering Kentuckian property adviser G Ware Travelstead, the idea had further developed into putting the front office of the bank on West India Docks, effectively creating a second financial services district in London. This idea later took shape as the Canary Wharf development, with CSFB both backing the scheme financially, and as one of the first tenants to move in. Post CSFB: Academic and charitable work Von Clemm was made an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and later President of Templeton College, Oxford, which merged with Green College in 2008 to become Green Templeton College, Oxford. He was a former President of The English-Speaking Union for the USA, and Vice-Chairman of the organisation until his death. At the ESU he was credited with transforming the governance of the organisation. He was Vice-President of the City of London Archaeological Trust, and the US Foundation for the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. Von Clemm remained involved in business as Chairman of Capital Markets for Merrill Lynch, and as a Board member of companies including Hafslund Nycomed. Death and memorial *Von Clemm died in 1997, at age 62, in Wellesley, MA from a brain tumour. His friend Sir Richard Branson said at the time that Von Clemm's doctors believed it was due to excessive mobile phone use ‚Äì Von Clemm had been an early adopter of the technology and was a constant user of his mobile. *After Von Clemm's death, the Michael Von Clemm Foundation continued his interests. Among other things, the Foundation supports a Fellowship at Harvard University for final year Oxford University students, and a Fellowship at Oxford for Harvard students. *There is a relief sculpture of Michael Von Clemm in Cabot Square at Canary Wharf, sculpted by Gerald Laing and unveiled by Eddie George in 1998 to commemorate his involvement in the Canary Wharf scheme.

It is named for the comarca of Sayago in the province of Zamora, in the western part of the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n, and is raised almost exclusively in that area. It may also be known as the Zamorana, the Moles de Sayago or the Castellana variedad Sayaguesa. It was traditionally kept mainly for draught work, but is now raised principally for meat.  History  The Sayaguesa was traditionally kept mainly for draught work; with the mechanisation of agriculture following the Second World War, this use declined. In the 1960s there were successive attempts to improve productive qualities by cross- breeding with Friesian, Braunvieh and Charolais, and later with other breeds. From 1970 the Sayaguesa was included with other regional breeds under the denomination Morenas del Noroeste. In 1997 it achieved separate recognition among the breeds identified by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Alimentaci√≥n y Medio Ambiente, the Spanish ministry of agriculture, as \\"at risk of extinction\\". Registration of the Sayaguesa began in 1980, and in 1981 a breeders' association, the Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Criadores de Ganado Bovino de Raza Sayaguesa, was formed. In 1998 a genealogical herd-book was established. Between 1950 and 1981 the population of the Sayaguesa fell by about a quarter, or some 17,000 head. By 2009 only about 450 head remained, on 29 farms. At the end of 2015 the population was 1,612, of which almost all were in Castilla L√©on.  Characteristics  The Sayaguesa is one of the largest indigenous Spanish cattle breeds. It displays considerable sexual dimorphism: bulls may weigh up to and cows up to . The height at the withers averages for bulls and for cows. The coat is black, sometimes lighter on the underparts. There may be a paler dorsal stripe, often absent in cows. The inside of the ears and the area round the mouth are pale. The hooves, muzzle and natural openings are black, the horns are white at the base and tipped with black. The head is relatively small, with a concave profile. Calves are born red, and only later turn black. The Sayaguesa is hardy, robust and frugal, and well adapted to the poor pastures and harsh environment of its native area.  Use  The Sayaguesa was traditionally kept mainly for draught work; with the mechanisation of agriculture following the Second World War, this use declined, and breeding was directed towards meat production. Calves are slaughtered at an average age of 12 months; yield is approximately 55%. Pairs of cows may sometimes be yoked to carts for folklore or festival occasions. The Sayaguesa has been used in nature conservation and in attempts to re-create the extinct aurochs.

The station operates at the federally assigned frequency of 99.1 megahertz, and is owned by BAS Broadcasting. History WFRO had for much of its existence, been a combination AM and FM station, with the FM first going on the air in 1946, and the AM (at 900 kHz) coming on the air three years later. Both stations simulcast each other for a portion of the broadcast day, breaking away for separate programming during the midday hours, with the AM concentrating more on information and talk, and the FM for music. For many years, WFRO AM broadcast a full-service MOR format heavy on local news and information; WFRO-FM played beautiful music during non-simulcast dayparts. AM 900's directional signal allowed WFRO programming to be heard clearly throughout much of southeastern Michigan (including the metropolitan Detroit area) and southwestern Ontario in addition to Ohio's North Coast region. By the 1990s, WFRO and WFRO-FM were simulcasting each other for most of the broadcast day, and WFRO's music format had evolved into a more contemporary mix of AC and adult-appeal CHR hits, but the full-service emphasis remained. The station was founded by Wolfe Broadcasting Company, which controlled the station until 2001, when both stations were sold separately to two different owners. BAS Broadcasting purchased WFRO-FM, while ABC/Disney purchased the license to WFRO/900, but not to run it as a separate entity. ABC purchased the license as part of an initiative to move recently purchased AM 910 WFDF in Flint, Michigan to Farmington Hills (in the Detroit market). The move was made to allow AM 910 to broadcast at an increased daytime power of 50,000 watts, up substantially from 5,000 watts. WFRO-FM changed to the satellite adult contemporary format it currently airs, and WFRO/900, after a brief period of silence, returned to the air using ABC's \\"Real Country\\" format and then ESPN Radio while preparations for WFDF's move into the Detroit area were made. WFRO/900 was officially silenced forever in June 2004 when ABC surrendered the license to the FCC. WFRO Today WFRO-FM continues as a full-service station serving the Sandusky/Port Clinton/Lake Erie Islands region, but without many of the live and local DJs that had proliferated on the station for many years. BAS Broadcasting signed an agreement with ABC Radio/SMN's \\"Hits and Favorites\\" AC format (formerly known as Starstation), and rebranded the station as \\"Eagle 99\\", though the heritage WFRO call letters were retained. In September 2006, WFRO and classic-rock sister station 92.1 WOHF \\"The Wolf\\" (the former WNRR \\"Hits 92.1\\"; the station has since switched to an oldies format) moved into a new broadcast facility in Fremont. WFRO also now operates from a new tower that is double the original tower's height, allowing the station to be heard clearly across Lake Erie in Monroe County, Michigan and in Essex County, Ontario while continuing to provide a strong signal to serve Fremont and the surrounding cities of Tiffin, Port Clinton, Norwalk, Sandusky, Clyde and Bellevue. In March 2009, WFRO-FM switched affiliations from ABC's (now Citadel Media) \\"Hits and Favorites\\" format over to Waitt Radio Networks' AC Pure service, but has kept ABC News Radio newscasts for both morning and afternoon drive. In 2019, local hosts returned to WFRO with Kyle Knight in middays and Russ Rutherford in afternoons. BAS Broadcasting, owned by Jim Lorenzen and Tom Klein, also owns WMVO and WQIO in Mount Vernon, Ohio, as well as WCPZ, WMJK, WLEC, and WOHF in Sandusky.

He emigrated to the British Colonies in North America in 1775. Beginning in 1776, he lived with the Creek Indians of the Upper Towns for about 20 years in frontier territory of present-day Alabama. He was befriended by the chief Alexander McGillivray, who used him as his war chief in battles. Later, after his return to Paris, Milfort joined the French Sacred Society of Sophisians. Commissioned a general in the army, he was forced into retirement with a pension. Early life He was born as Jean-Antoine Le Clerc, but used several alternatives and aliases during his life, especially Jean LeClerc Milfort, and Louis Le Clerc Milfort. He was from Thin-le-Moutier, near M√©zi√®res, France.\\"Notes and Documents: Milfort's Plan for a Franco-Creek Alliance and the Retrocession of Louisiana\\", ed. by E. Wilson Lyon, The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 4 No. 1, February 1938, JSTOR Journal Archive, accessed 15 September 2011 He served in the French army from 1764-1774. According to his 1802 memoir, after having killed a servant of the king's household in a duel, Milfort emigrated to North America, arriving in Boston. Among the Creek Indians He went to Indian territory east of the Mississippi River (present-day Alabama), where he lived and traveled with the Creek Indians of the Upper Towns, in what was former French territory of La Louisiane. He gained Creek friendship by adopting their customs and was said to have been adopted into the tribe. Milfort lived with the Upper Creek in present-day Alabama from 1776 until 1795. During the American Revolutionary war, Colonel Alexander McGillivray, chief of the Creek and commissioned by his British allies, directed several expeditions against the rebel colonists. He relied on Le Clerc Milfort as his War Chief, or Tustunneggee (Tastenagy), to carry out his orders. Milfort led Upper Creek forces in battles against colonial frontier settlements. McGillivray remained at his base, controlling the chiefs, and compelling them to raise warriors to attack other settlements. Marriage and family As part of his alliance with the Creek, Milfort married Jeannet McGillivray, a sister of the chief Alexander McGillivray, of the Creek Indian Nation. They were both of Creek and Scots descent. Their nephew was the chief William \\"Red Eagle\\" Weatherford. After returning to France, Milfort married a French woman named Marie-Anne Beya. Return to France Hearing of the changes after the French Revolution, Milfort went to Philadelphia to get a passport in 1795. He returned to Paris in 1799. He joined the Sacred Order of the Sophisians, a secret society formed during the Napoleonic years, as the 41st member.Darius Alexander Spieth, \\"Louis Milfort\\", in Napoleon's Sorcerers: The Sophisians, Associated University Presse, 2007, pp. 153-154 He offered his services to the government, specifically to make a Franco-Creek alliance and revive French claims in North America. He hoped to command a French expedition for this purpose, a proposal well received by the foreign ministers Delacroix and Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana to the United States in 1803 rendered Milfort's plan moot. Milfort was ordered to remain in France; he was commissioned as a general and forced to retire, but given a pension.web.genealogie During the Russian invasion of 1814, Milfort was attacked in his house and was rescued by French grenadiers. He died in 1817 or 1820. His memoirs He published M√©moires, ou coup-d'oeil rapide sur mes voyages en Louisiane, et mon s√©jour dans la nation Creeke (Paris: De l'Imprimerie de Giguet et Michaud, 1802). In his account, he described his travels, hoping to stimulate French interest in the lands of the Creek and Southeast Indians. In his 2007 book, the scholar Darius Alexander Spieth noted that Milfort used a ghostwriter for his memoirs. His book has been printed in English translation by Lakeside Classics.

The organization embraced what became known as Jewish Territorialism also known as Jewish Statism (though not to be confused with the political philosophy of the same name). The ITO was dissolved in 1925. Overview of territorialism The first instance of what might be termed Territorialism, though the term did not yet exist, much predated Zionism. In 1825 the playwright, diplomat and journalist, Mordecai Manuel Noah ‚Äì the first Jew born in the United States to reach national prominence ‚Äì tried to found a Jewish \\"refuge\\" at Grand Island in the Niagara River, to be called \\"Ararat\\", after Mount Ararat, the Biblical resting place of Noah's Ark. He purchased land on Grand Island - then on the frontier of white settlement - for $4.38 per acre, in order to build a refuge for Jews of all nations.Image of the City of Ararat (Grand Island, NY) Image in 1825, a Pivotal Year on the Niagara Frontier on New York Heritage He had brought with him a cornerstone which read \\"Ararat, a City of Refuge for the Jews, founded by Mordecai M. Noah in the Month of Tishri, 5586 (September, 1825) and in the Fiftieth Year of American Independence.\\" However, the scheme failed to attract Noah's fellow Jews. It began and ended with the ceremonial laying of that cornerstone. The Jewish Colonization Association, created in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was aimed at facilitating mass emigration of Jews from the Russian Empire and other Eastern European countries, by settling them in agricultural colonies on lands purchased by the committee, particularly in North and South America (especially Argentina). Before 1905 some Zionist leaders took seriously proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than the Land of Israel. Theodor Herzl hoped for a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel but recognized that global events demanded an immediate solution to the Jewish problem, in Russia at least, even if that solution required Jewish refugees to settle outside of Eretz Israel. Theodor Herzl's Der Judenstaat argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, \\"our ever- memorable historic home\\", or Argentina, \\"one of the most fertile countries in the world\\". Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.). As early as 1902, Herzl's negotiations with the Ottoman Empire for a Jewish homeland in Palestine had proven so futile and the dream of Zion so distant that he decided to approach the British about the creation of a Jewish colony in Africa. And in April 1903 his efforts in London seemed to bear fruit. In response to the horrors of Kishinev, England's Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain proposed to Herzl the creation a semiautonomous region on the Uasin Gishu plateau in British East Africa for Jewish settlement. When Herzl revealed Chamberlain's offer to the Sixth Zionist Congress in August 1903, Israel Zangwill spoke in favor of the proposal. In his speech to the Congress Zangwill made clear that, though he did not see East Africa as the ultimate consummation of the Zionist cause, he did believe that it proved a particularly useful, temporary (if still somewhat long-term) solution to the Jewish problem in Russia. In 1903 British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Program, land for a Jewish state in \\"Uganda\\" (actually in modern Kenya). Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. Notwithstanding its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal still proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was demonstrated by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. Few historians believe that such a settlement scheme could have attracted immigrants, Jewish financial support, or international political support. Since there was strong support on the part of some members of the Zionist leadership, however, peace was kept in the movement by the time- honored parliamentary maneuver of voting to establish a committee for the investigation of the possibility, which was not finally dismissed until the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905.Seventh Congress - Basle, 1905 (Jewish Virtual Library) History The Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO) was founded by British Jewish author, critic, and activist Israel Zangwill and British Jewish journalist Lucien Wolf in 1903 and institutionalized in 1905. The establishment was a response to Herzl's rejection of Uganda proposal, as the ITO led by Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. It attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston), and on the African, Asian, and Australian continents, yet with little success. Zangwill's interest in territorialism began in 1903 in response to the Kishinev Pogrom. In April of that year in Kishinev, Bessarabia, a Western province of the Russian Empire, a local newspaper accused the region's Jews of killing a Christian child as part of their Passover rituals. This inflammatory use of the ancient \\"blood libel\\" sparked a three-day pogrom which resulted in the deaths of over forty Jews, as well as the destruction and looting of hundreds of Jewish homes and businesses. The specter of Kishinev profoundly influenced Zangwill's actions and work. Indeed, several years after the event, Zangwill would make the protagonist of his most important play, \\"The Melting Pot\\", a survivor of the pogrom who escapes to America after witnessing the murder of his family. The events of Kishinev also convinced Zangwill of the immediate need to find a place of Jewish refuge be it in Palestine or some other site. In commenting on the pogroms in a greeting to the Federation of American Zionists Zangwill commented: :The Kishineff massacre has brought home to the blindest the need of a publicly and legally safeguarded home for our unhappy race. When you come to consider where this centralized home should be you will find no place as practicable as Palestine, or at least for a start, its neighborhood. But few in the Zionist Organization supported the Uganda Scheme, as the East Africa offer was called, particularly representatives from Eastern Europe who argued that Palestine was the sole acceptable site for a Jewish homeland. Herzl was severely criticized for his willingness to seek a Jewish state outside of the Middle East, and such criticism, Zangwill claimed, contributed to Herzl's death from heart failure in 1904. In a 1905 speech on the East Africa offer he exclaimed: :Herzl is dead: he worked for his people as no man ever worked for them since Judas Maccabaeus. His people called him dreamer and demagogue, and towards the end men of his own party called him traitor and broke his heart. He worked for his people: they paid him his wages and he has gone home. In 1905 the members of the Seventh Zionist Congress formally rejected the Uganda Scheme. Following the rejection of the East Africa offer, Zangwill contacted Lucien Wolf, an English Jewish journalist and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of Anglo Jewry. Wolf was an opponent of political Zionism, but did support the creation of Jewish colonies in the Diaspora. In August 1905 Zangwill and Wolf met to discuss the Uganda Scheme, and in subsequent correspondence between the two we learn that both supported the creation of a Jewish colony in British East Africa. Wolf had objected to any specifically \\"Jewish national homeland\\", that is to say a state which ghettoized Jews, preserving Jewish customs and law as the basis for governance. Though Zangwill's literary works suggest his nostalgia for the ghetto, he too recognized the need for a modern Jewish polity. Both concurred that a self-governing Jewish territory should be based on a preponderance of Jews in the region rather than British legislative fiat, and both concurred that the new government should be formed on a modern, democratic basis rather than some earlier biblical ideal or Eastern European Kehilla structure. This basic agreement between Zangwill and Wolf would lead to the formation of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO), an organisation dedicated to \\"obtaining a large tract of territory (preferably within the British Empire) wherein to found a Jewish Home of Refuge\\", and to the elevation of Zangwill to the ITO presidency. Organizational structure The ITO's members were known as territorialists or \\"ITOmen\\". ITO attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston, Alaska), Africa (in Angola, establishing several contacts with the Portuguese government, the colonial power at the time), Asia, and Australia, but with little success. The ITO lasted until at least 1943, though indeed it lost much of its power and impetus after the Balfour Declaration of 1917 and Zangwill's death in 1926. =Zionist Socialist Workers Party= In pre-1917 the Zionist Socialist Workers Party also took up the idea, combining it with a strong Socialist Revolutionary orientation, and for a time had a considerable influence among Russian Jews. = USSR= After the October Revolution there was in the USSR a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region surrounding Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was established in 1934.Territorialism (Jewish Virtual Library) (The Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO) (, Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast; ) is still today an autonomous oblast situated in Russia's far east.) In the United States, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia worked to encourage the emigration and settlement of Jews there. =Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization= In the face of the looming Nazi genocide, Isaac Nachman Steinberg established the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization (Frayland-lige far Yidisher Teritoryalistisher Kolonizatsye) in London in 1935. This organization attempted, unsuccessfully, to pursue Jewish autonomy by obtaining a large piece of territory in sparsely populated areas in Ecuador, Australia, or Suriname. One of the more well-known ventures was the Kimberley Plan, to secure land in Australia.A Jewish colony in the Kimberleys The Kimberley Plan was officially vetoed on 15 July 1944 by Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, who informed Steinberg that the Australian government would not \\"depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in Australia\\" and could not \\"entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the exclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League\\".Steinberg, Isaac Nachman (1888 - 1957) by Beverley Hooper, Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16, Melbourne University Press, 2002, pp 298-299. Online Ed. published by Australian National University After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Steinberg criticized the exclusivist politics of the Israeli government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other region of the world. After Steinberg's death in 1957 the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals.

Harold Searles has the reputation of being a therapeutic virtuoso with difficult and borderline patients; and of being, in the words of Horacio Etchegoyen, president of the IPA, \\"not only a great analyst but also a sagacious observer and a creative and careful theoretician\\". Life Searles was born in 1918 at Hancock, New York, a small village in the Catskill Mountains along the Delaware River, which was the subject of many of his reminiscences in his first book, The Nonhuman Environment. He attended Cornell University and Harvard Medical School before joining the US armed services in World War II, where he served as a captain After the war he continued his psychiatric training at the Chestnut Lodge, a private sanitarium in Rockville, MD from 1949‚Äì1951, then at the Veterans Administration Mental Hygiene Clinic in Washington, DC from 1951‚Äì1952.APA Biographical Dictionary (1977) In 1949 he started work at Chestnut Lodge, where he stayed for the next fifteen years. His colleagues included Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, to whose philosophy of treatment he acknowledged his personal debt. Searles retired from his private practice in Washington, D.C., in the mid-1990s and moved to California in 1997, where both of his sons lived. Searles' wife died in 2012, at the age of 93. Thereafter, Searles lived with his youngest son Donald, a Los Angeles- based attorney. Searles' daughter is Sandra Dickinson, a London-based actress. His eldest son, David Searle, is a Southern California motorcycle journalist. He died on November 18, 2015 in Los Angeles. Searles is survived by three children (one of whom is the US-British actress, Sandra Dickinson), five grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. Influence Arguably, Searles' work was largely ignored in the wider analytic community until the 1980s, when his radical views on the analyst's involvement through countertransference started to become more normative. Since then Jungians in particular have paid increasing attention to his work, linking his findings both to those of Jung and to the work of another maverick analyst, Robert Langs.Sedgwick (1993), p. 1. Searles has also been associated with Donald W. Winnicott and Hans W. Loewald as psychoanalytic figures who all emphasized the importance of the part played in psychic development by the external environment. On countertransference Searles has been singled out as one of the pioneer investigators of the potentially useful role of countertransference, and of the therapist's use of his or her own self in treatment.Foreword by Lewis Aron in In his 1959 article \\"Oedipal Love in the Countertransference\\", Searles wrote that he not only fell in Pygmalionesque love with his patients as they recovered, but also told them how he felt. Searles argued that \\"the patient's self-esteem benefits greatly from his sensing that he (or she) is capable of arousing such responses in his analyst\\"Searles, quoted in Malcolm (1988), p. 168n.‚Äîa view which can be seen as a forerunner of intersubjective psychoanalysis with its emphasis on the spontaneous involvement of the therapist in terms of countertransference. In his later paper of 1975, \\"The Patient as Therapist to his Analyst\\", Searles argues that everybody has an urge to heal‚Äîsomething only distinguished in the psychotherapist in being tapped into formally. Using the concept of what he called the patient's \\"unconscious therapeutic initiative\\",Searles, quoted in ‚Äîa precursor of much later thinking on patient/analyst interaction‚ÄîSearles suggested that psychological illness is related to a disturbance of this natural tendency to heal others; with the surprising corollary that to help a patient the analyst/therapist must really experience the patient as doing something therapeutic for them. In his 1978-9 article, \\"Concerning Transference and Countertransference\\", Searles continued exploring intersubjectivity, building on his belief that \\"all patients...have the ability to 'read the unconscious' of the therapist\\".Searles, quoted in Searles emphasized the importance of the therapist's acknowledging the core of truth around which a patient's transference materializes. On relatedness Searles saw the schizophrenic individual as struggling with the question, not so much of how to relate, but of whether to relate to others. Searles, however, considered this merely as an exacerbated version of the same (if hidden) conflict that affects us all. Searles' interpersonal ideal ‚Äì in the formulation of which he was indebted to Martin Buber ‚Äì was of what he called a mature relatedness, something which involves connection without merging, or the loss of personal boundaries.Klein (2003), pp. 191 & 194. On \\"The Effort to Drive the Other Person Crazy\\" In an article of 1959, \\"The Effort to Drive the Other Person Crazy\\", Searles examined six modes of interpersonal communication, arguing that \\"each of these techniques tends to undermine the other person's confidence in his own emotional reactions and his own perception of reality\\".Searles quoted in Among these techniques were switching emotional wavelengths while discussing the same topic; and dealing with different topics (life and death/trivial) while remaining on the same wavelength. Such attempts at crazy-making were often applied by patients to therapists, who had the task of enduring them without retaliation. Searles added moreover that it was important for the therapist to survive their own wish to kill the patient.Scharff in Like many articles in psychoanalysis from the early and middle part of the 20th century Searles' work reflects an older version of views on homosexuality and transsexuality that are no longer part of the current mainstream of psychoanalytic thought. Whatever outdated views he may have expressed, like many of the revolutionary analytic writers, do not detract from the essential contributions he made to a revised understanding of the psychoanalytic treatment relationship and its complex processes.

In the 1950s route 27 became the main route and route 27A was withdrawn from being the main route. In 1950, the route took part in trials to reassure the police that eight-foot buses presented no danger to other traffic. The route operated from Holloway garage at the time. Upon being re-tendered, the route was awarded to First CentreWest's Westbourne Park garage on 11 November 2000.

It is a unitary authority, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. The borough is divided into 19 wards, electing 57 councillors. History The council was formed by the Local Government Act 1972 as the Milton Keynes District Council, under Buckinghamshire County Council. The council was first elected in 1973, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the District of Milton Keynes on 1 April 1974. The council gained borough status, entitling it to be known as Milton Keynes Borough Council and to annually appoint a (ceremonial) Mayor of Milton Keynes. It was envisaged through the Local Government Act 1972 that Milton Keynes as a non-metropolitan district council would share power with the Buckinghamshire County Council. This arrangement lasted until 1997 when the district council gained responsibility for services that had been provided within Milton Keynes by the county council. On becoming a Unitary Authority, the council renamed itself Milton Keynes Council. Powers and functions The local council derives its powers and functions from the Local Government Act 1972 and subsequent legislation. For the purposes of local government, Milton Keynes is within a non- metropolitan area of England. In its capacity as a district council it is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. In its capacity as a county council it is a local education authority and is responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council also appoints members to Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Authority and the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel, both of which serve the borough. Political control One third of the council is elected each year for three years, followed by one year without election. Since 1996 political control of the council has been held by the following parties: { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\\" !

The Labour Party continues in office with confidence and supply support from the Liberal Democrats. Technology facilitation In recent years, the Council has promoted the Milton Keynes urban area as a test-bed for experimental urban technologies. One of these projects is the LUTZ Pathfinder pod, an autonomous (self-driving) vehicle built by the Transport Systems Catapult. Trials took place in Milton Keynes in 2016.

Biography  Krusenstjerna was born in V√§xj√∂ and brought up in G√§vle. Niece of Edvard von Krusenstjerna, she was born in to the nobility. She was educated at the teacher's academy of Anna Sandstr√∂m in Stockholm. She married David Sprengel in 1921. Agnes von Krusenstjerna was on several occasions admitted to mental hospitals. In 1940, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour; she died on the operating table in March 1940. Krusenstjerna died in Stockholm. =Works= Agnes von Krusenstjerna She debuted as a writer with the girls' novel Ninas dagbok (1917) and made her breakthrough with the Tony novel series (1922‚Äì26) about a girl's development in a noble environment. The Tony series was greatly controversial, as it depicted sexual themes as well as mental disorders, which made Krusenstjerna controversial. Sexuality was, before the 1920s, not mentioned in novels, and her books depicted sex and intercourse. The novel series Fr√∂knarna von Pahlen created one of the greatest debates and controversies of its time in Sweden, known as Krusenstjernafejden (The Krusenstjerna feud): the series described sexual intercourse, which caused an enormous amount of attention and led to a two-year-long (1933‚Äì35) debate about the freedom of speech, the relation of literature toward the moral standards, the right of female expression and the right to sexual freedom, which ended with the writers' conference of Sigtuna 1935. She was supported by Eyvind Johnson, Johannes Edfelt, Elmer Diktonius and Karin Boye, who compared the affair to the censorship of Nazi Germany. Her writing was closely inspired to her own life and can be regarded as partially autobiographical, especially her last, unfinished series, Fattigadel (Poor Nobility) (1935‚Äì1938).

It was directed by Babak Payami. The film covers a day in the life of an agent collecting votes on an island in Iran. Plot summary 160px The story begins at a small, two-man army post on a remote island. It is voting day, and an election agent is due to arrive by boat. A young woman arrives, collects the official voting box, and demands that the soldier on duty escort her around the island. They climb into a military jeep and begin driving around, looking for voters. The nameless woman is totally dedicated to her duty, a true believer in the importance of voting, a tireless worker, rather voluble and certainly not submissive. This confuses and angers the dim-witted soldier, who feels that a man should be the voting agent. Chador and all, she's clearly a liberated woman, a \\"city gal\\" as described by the soldier. The couple-by-necessity do eventually (jeep trouble aside) scour the land to find eligible voters among the sparse locals. The trek starts in a desert and gradually moves to somewhat greener places. It is educational for both parties. They encounter a variety of people (mostly illiterate peasants) and situations, which simultaneously instructs the two roamers and the audience. By the end of the film, only a few people have voted, and the young woman is largely disillusioned about the entire process. Several people refused to vote for the \\"approved\\" candidates, and one voted for her. There is an undercurrent of an unspoken affection having developed between her and the soldier. Overview Ra'ye makhfi was filmed entirely in Kish Island, a resort island in the Persian Gulf although it is not mentioned in the movie. In fact the setting looks like a semi-barren landscape that could be a mainland or an island. There, by the sea, on a desert beach, two soldiers stand guard against smugglers. Apparently, the locals are not particularly fluent in Persian, the national language of Iran, with some speaking in gulf dialect Arabic. On several occasions, the election agent is frustrated by the language barrier. It is implied that a number of foreign nationals (fishermen, peddlers) are present on the island -- they are not eligible to vote, of course. The locals are very strict Islamists; some of the women even wear face masks in public. Women are completely submissive to the wishes of their men and will not vote unless given permission. A serious natural, sly, or tongue-in-cheek humor emerges in this realistic, ethnographic, patriotic work that is quite outspoken which stresses isolation, not poverty. And it is not bound by politically correct limitations. The young woman from the city, commenting on the minimum voting age, says of a local \\"She can marry at 12 but she cannot vote.\\" She is fanatical about the importance of everybody having the opportunity to cast a vote, contrasted to the soldier's near indifference. He sees no real point, and some of the islanders agree with him. Yet others go to great lengths to find her. They live in a remote rural area with unpaved roads, little electricity, and few cars, and Payami is using the various people they meet to show some of the views on the democratic process and life in general. One woman is young enough to wed but not old enough to vote. Some people disagree with the entire list of candidates; others feel it is wrong for women to vote at all. The negative experiences are enough to test the agent's unwavering confidence in her beliefs, and her conviction is enough to cause the soldier to question his indifference. Payami makes pronounced use of long shots (avoiding close-ups in favor of vistas, framing people and sights at a distance) and long takes with shooting scenes continuously for three minutes or more. This directly impacts upon the mood in the film.

Taking place some 80 km southeast (downstream) of Baghdad, the battle ended in a decisive victory for the Abbasids, forcing Ya'qub to halt his advance into Iraq. The town of (, ; literally \\"monastery at the river-bend\\", from a Syriac  ø \\"bend\\") was the main town of the fertile district () in central Nahrawan, making it the most important town on the Tigris between Baghdad and Wasit. The battle itself took place near a village of the town's district, called Istarband, between Dayr al-Aqul itself and Sib Bani Kuma.Bosworth, \\"Dayr al-\`Aqul\\" Background Ever since the assassination of the caliph al-Mutawakkil in 861, the Abbasid Caliphate had been in a state of turmoil (the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\"). The Turkish military establishment, in an effort to preserve the power of its leaders, began to overthrow any caliph whom they considered unsatisfactory. Between the death of al-Mutawakkil and the ascension of al- Mu'tamid in 870, three caliphs met violent ends.Al-Musta'in (r. 862‚Äì866), al- Mu'tazz (866‚Äì869) and al-Muhtadi (r. 869‚Äì870). In addition, al-Muntasir (r. 861‚Äì862) died under mysterious circumstances, possibly due to poison. With the Turks exercising unprecedented control over the empire while the finances of the caliphate were increasingly unable to support them, the prestige of the caliphs reached its lowest point thus far.Gordon, p. 90; Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 138 As the situation in the capital declined, various groups in different parts of the empire took advantage of this period of weakness. In Tabaristan a Zaydi dynasty came to power in 864. In 868 the Turk Ahmad ibn Tulun gained control of Egypt and gradually asserted his independence from Samarra. In Lower Iraq and Khuzistan, the Zanj Rebellion began in 869 and posed a serious threat to the Abbasid Caliphate in the region. In Iran, meanwhile, the most significant threat against the caliphate came in the form of the Saffarid Ya\`qub bin Laith. Ya\`qub first came to power in 861 in Sistan, a province which had been held by 'ayyƒÅr bands since 854. From there he rapidly expanded, and in 873 he extinguished the rule of the Tahirids, who were governors loyal to the Abbasids, in Khurasan. This left him in control of much of eastern and central Iran plus parts of Afghanistan.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 73‚Äì75, 83 ff., 108 ff. Back in Samarra, reconciliation between the Turks and the caliphs had begun during the reign of al-Mu'tamid (870‚Äì892). Al-Mu'tamid's brother, al-Muwaffaq, was the driving force behind this success; he had good relations with the Turkish leaders such as Musa bin Bugha and he gradually gained more and more power until he was the actual administrator of the empire.Gordon, pp. 142‚Äì43; Kennedy, pp. 148‚Äì50 Musa bin Bugha held the governorships of several of the eastern provinces, but his failure to make any headway against the rebels caused him to resign from these governorships in frustration, after which al-Muwaffaq took over the positions.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 149‚Äì50; al-Tabari, pp. 164‚Äì65 The Abbasids were concerned about the threat the Saffarids posed, especially after Ya\`qub conquered Fars from Muhammad bin Wasil in 875.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 150‚Äì52; al-Tabari, p. 166; Ibn al-Athir, p. 252 From Fars Ya\`qub moved on to Khuzistan, taking possession of Ramhurmuz in December of 875. This move put the Saffarid army close to Iraq. It also put Ya\`qub close to the Zanj revolt; the Abbasids feared that the Saffarids and Zanj would band together against the caliphate, although Ya\`qub's later rejection of an offer by the Zanj to become allies casts doubt on this possibility. In any case it was an alarming development, as the caliph did not feel that he had the resources to stop Ya\`qub. All of Ya\`qub's supporters in Baghdad, who had been imprisoned in 873 following his conquest of Khurasan, were released, and al-Mu'tamid sent an embassy to Ya\`qub to grant him the governorships of Khurasan, Tabaristan, Fars, Gurgan, and Ray, as appoint him as head of security in Baghdad.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 153‚Äì55; al-Tabari, pp. 168‚Äì69; Ibn al-Athir, p. 260. Ibn Khallikan, p. 312, adds Kirman, Adharbayjan, Qazwin and al-Sind to this list. Ya\`qub, sensing that the offer was made due to the weakness of the caliph, rejected it and wrote back that he would be advancing to the capital. The offer also alienated the Turks of Samarra, who felt that Ya\`qub represented a threat to their interests. Seeing that an agreement with the Saffarid was impossible, al-Mu'tamid decided upon war and pronounced a formal curse upon Ya\`qub. On March 7, 876 he left Samarra, leaving his son al-Mufawwad in charge of the capital. On March 15 he arrived at Baghdad, before arriving near Kalwadha and setting up camp. From there his army marched to Sib Bani Kuma, where al-Mu'tamid's general Masrur al-Balkhi joined him after slowing down Ya\`qub's army (see below). While there the caliph gathered more troops to his side.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids, pp. 155, 157‚Äì59; al-Tabari, p. 169-70 (but with incorrect date conversions); al-Mas'udi, pp. 42‚Äì43; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 313, 316 Map showing the location of the battle, as well as the routes taken by the Saffarid (red) and main 'Abbasid (blue) armies For his part, Ya\`qub traveled through Khuzistan, during which he gained the defection of a former general of the caliph's, Abi'l-Saj Devdad, and entered Iraq. The caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi managed to slow down his progress by flooding the land outside Wasit, but the Saffarid army was able to get through this and he entered Wasit on March 24. Leaving Wasit, he set for the town of Dayr al-\`Aqul, which was about fifty miles from Baghdad.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 158‚Äì59; al-Tabari, pp. 169‚Äì70; Ibn al-Athir, pp. 260‚Äì61; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 313, 316 According to one source, Ya\`qub did not actually expect the caliph to offer battle; instead he would give in to any demands that the Saffarid had.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 161; Ibn Khallikan, p. 315 Al-Mu'tamid, however, sent al-Muwaffaq to stop him. The two armies met at Istarband, between Dayr al-\`Aqul and Sib Bani Kuma.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 159; al-Tabari, p. 170; al-Mas'udi, p. 43; Ibn Khallikan, p. 31 The battle The battle took place on April 8.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 159. The actual date is given variously in the Arabic sources, such as April 1 (al-Tabari, p. 170) and April 10 (Ibn al-Athir, p. 261). Before the battle, Ya\`qub reviewed his troops, who apparently numbered about ten thousand. The Abbasids, however, had a numerical superiorityBosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 159; Ibn Khallikan, p. 314 and the additional advantage of fighting on familiar territory. The center of the Abbasid army was commanded by al-Muwaffaq. Musa bin Bugha had command of the right wing, and Masrur al- Balkhi the left.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 159; al-Tabari, pp. 170, 172; Ibn al-Athir, p. 261 A final appeal was made to the Saffarids to restore their loyalty to the caliph, and the battle began.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 159‚Äì60; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 313‚Äì14 The fighting raged on for most of the day. The Saffarid army was somewhat reluctant to directly fight the caliph and his army. Despite this, there were heavy losses on both sides, and several Abbasid and Saffarid commanders were killed. Ya\`qub himself was wounded, but he did not leave the field. As evening approached, reinforcements arrived to support al-Muwaffaq.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 160; al-Tabari, pp. 170‚Äì71; Ibn al- Athir, p. 261; al-Mas'udi, pp. 43‚Äì44; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 314‚Äì16; 318‚Äì19 The mawla Nusayr created a diversion by attacking the Saffarid rear from boats on the Tigris and setting fire to the Saffarid baggage train, giving the Abbasids a further advantage.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 160; al-Mas'udi, pp. 44‚Äì45 Eventually the Saffarid army began to flee from the battle. Ya\`qub and his bodyguards continued to fight, but were forced to leave the field as the army retreated, leaving them behind. The caliph had apparently flooded the lands behind the Saffarids before the battle, and this made a retreat difficult; many men drowned attempting to escape the Abbasid army.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 159; al-Mas'udi, p. 43 With the Saffarids making their hasty exit, al- Muwaffaq was able to capture Ya\`qub's baggage. Several political prisoners that Ya\`qub had brought with him, such as the Tahirid Muhammad bin Tahir, also fell into Abbasid hands and were freed.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" p. 160; al- Tabari, p. 171; Ibn al-Athir, p. 261; al-Mas'udi, pp. 44‚Äì45; Ibn Khallikan, pp. 315‚Äì16, 319 Aftermath The battle completely halted Ya\`qub's advance and put an end to what was arguably a major threat to the Abbasid Caliphate.Flood, 165. The exact motivations for Ya\`qub's advance have been debated; Tor, pp. 159, for example, argues that he was an Abbasid legitimist whose actions were prompted by a misguided attempt to protect the caliphate. Ya\`qub did not make any subsequent campaigns against Iraq. Al-Mu'tamid, following the victory, restored several individuals to their governorships in Iran, such as Muhammad bin Wasil to Fars and Muhammad bin Tahir to Khurasan, but they were unable to enforce their claims against the Saffarids. Ya\`qub died three years later, in 879; his brother and successor, 'Amr concluded a peace with the caliph that lasted for a few years.Bosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 161‚Äì66, 186 ff. The Abbasids were able to continue to work reasserting their authority in several provinces; the Zanj were defeated in 883, and Egypt and FarsBosworth, \\"Saffarids,\\" pp. 262‚Äì63 would eventually return to the Abbasid fold.

If a fourth rung of \\"engagement\\" is added, then the whole can be seen as a ladder, with each level from the foot upwards representing a decreasing concentration on military engagement. Whereas the purest form of tactics or engagement are those free of political imperative, the purest form of political policy does not involve military engagement. Strategy as a whole is the connection between political policy and the use of force to achieve it. Grand strategy In its clearest form, strategy deals solely with military issues: either a threat or an opportunity is recognised, an evaluation is made, and a military stratagem for meeting it is devised. However, as Clausewitz stated, a successful military strategy may be a means to an end, but it is not an end in itself. Where a state has a long term political goal to which it applies military methods and the resources of the state, that state can be said to have a grand strategy. To an extent, all states will have a grand strategy to a certain degree even if it is simply determining which forces to raise as a military, or how to arm them. Whilst early Rome did raise and arm troops, they tended to raise them annually in response to the specific demands of the state during that year. Such a reactive policy, whilst possibly more efficient than the maintenance of a standing army, does not indicate the close ties between long-term political goals and military organization demanded by grand strategy. Early indications for a Roman grand strategy emerged during the Punic wars with Carthage, in which Rome was able to influence the course of the war by selecting to ignore the armies of Hannibal threatening its homeland and to invade Africa instead in order to dictate the primary theatre of war. In the Empire, as the need for and size of the professional army grew, the possibility arose for the expansion of the concept of a grand strategy to encompass the management of the resources of the entire Roman state in the conduct of warfare: great consideration was given in the Empire to diplomacy and the use of the military to achieve political goals, both through warfare and also as a deterrent. The contribution of actual (rather than potential) military force to strategy was largely reduced to operational strategy - the planning and control of large military units. Rome's grand strategy incorporated diplomacy through which Rome might forge alliances or pressure another nation into compliance, as well as the management of the post-war peace. Strategy: from political policy to military engagement Operational strategy Vegetius wrote that \\"every plan... is to be considered, every expedient tried and every method taken before matters are brought to this last extremity [general engagements]... Good officers decline general engagements where the odds are too great, and prefer the employment of stratagem and finesse to destroy the enemy as much as possible... without exposing their own forces.\\".Vegetius, The Military Institutions of the Romans, Greenwood, 1985, p. 87 However, Vegetius was writing late in the fourth century AD, in the latter years of the Empire. During this period, and for much of the Empire, it can be argued that the Romans did follow a grand strategy calling for limited direct operational engagement. However, earlier in its history, in the Republic and early Empire Rome showed little reluctance to become engaged in direct military engagement, prosecuting offensive operations against numerous adversaries. When a campaign did go badly wrong, operational strategy varied greatly as the circumstances dictated, from naval actions to sieges, assaults of fortified positions and open battle. However, the preponderance of Roman campaigns exhibit a preference for direct engagement in open battle and, where necessary, the overcoming of fortified positions via military engineering. The Roman army was adept at building fortified camps for protection from enemy attack, but history shows a reluctance to sit in the camp awaiting battle and a history of seeking open battle. Infantry tactics Roman armies of the Republic and early empire worked from a set tactical 'handbook', a military tradition of deploying forces that provided for few variations and was ignored or elaborated only on occasion. =Tactical pre-battle maneuvers= Once the legion had deployed on an operation, they would generally march to their objective. There were exceptions when the armies were transported by the Roman navy but even then in most instances this was followed by a march of several days or weeks. The approach to the battlefield was made in several columns, enhancing maneuver. Typically a strong vanguard preceded the main body, and included scouts, cavalry and light troops. A tribune or other officer often accompanied the vanguard to survey the terrain for possible camp locations. Flank and recon elements were also deployed to provide the usual covering security. Behind the vanguard came the main body of heavy infantry. Each legion marched as a distinct formation and was accompanied by its own baggage train. At the end of a day's march, the Romans would typically establish a strong field camp called a castra, complete with palisade and a deep ditch, providing a basis for supply storage, troop marshalling and defence. Streets were laid out, units designated to take specific places, and guards posted at carefully designed gates. Construction could take between 2 and 5 hours with part of the army laboring, while the rest stood guard, depending on the tactical situation. No other ancient army persisted over such a long period in systematic camp construction like the Romans, even if the army rested for only a single day. This concentration of conservative security in deployment was mirrored both in the measured tactics of engagement for the infantry and by the largely conservative operational strategies employed. =Tactical deployment= The Roman heavy infantry typically was deployed, as the main body, facing the enemy, in three approximately equal lines, with the cavalry or equites on their wings to prevent them being flanked and turned, and light infantry in a screen in front of them to hide maneuvers of the heavy infantry, harass the enemy forces and, in some cases, drive off units such as elephants that would be a great threat to close-order heavy infantry. They were deployed in a quincunx checkered pattern. Alternative tactical formations were adopted occasionally. 620px =Tactical engagement= In the same way that Roman tactical maneuver was measured and cautious, so too was their actual engagement of the enemy. The soldiers were long-term service professionals whose interest lay in receiving a large pension and an allocation of land on retirement from the army, rather than in seeking glory on the battlefield as a warrior. The tactics of engagement largely reflected this, concentrating on maintaining formation order and protecting individual troops rather than pushing aggressively to destroy the maximum number of enemy troops in a wild charge. A battle usually opened with light troops skirmishing with the opposition. These light forces then withdrew to the flanks or between the gaps in the central line of heavy infantry. Cavalry might be launched against their opposing numbers or used to screen the central core from envelopment. As the gap between the contenders closed, the heavy infantry typically took the initiative, attacking on the double. The front ranks usually cast their pila, and the following ranks hurled theirs over the heads of the front-line fighters. If a cast pilum did not cause direct death or injury, they were so designed that the hard iron triangular points would stick into enemy shields, bending on their soft metal shafts, weighing down the shields and making them unusable. After the pila were cast, the soldiers then drew their swords and engaged the enemy. However, rather than charging as might be assumed, great emphasis was placed on the protection gained from sheltering behind the scutum and remaining unexposed, stabbing out from behind the protection of the shield whenever an exposed enemy presented himself. Fresh troops were fed in from the rear, through the \\"checkboard\\" arrangement, to relieve the injured and exhausted further ahead. Many Roman battles, especially during the late empire, were fought with the preparatory bombardment from ballistas and onagers. These war machines, a form of ancient artillery, launched arrows and large stones towards the enemy, proving most effective against close-order formations and structures.

Founded in 1915, it is the United States' oldest nonsectarian international development organization and the second American humanitarian organization to be chartered by an act of Congress. Near East Relief organized the world's first large-scale, modern humanitarian project in response to the unfolding Armenian and Assyrian genocides. Known as the Near East Foundation since 1930, NEF pioneered many of the strategies employed by the world's leading development organizations. In the past 100 years NEF has worked with partner communities in more than 40 countries. The foundation had organised the world's first great humanitarian project of the United States, in the beginning of the 20th century.Historian of the Present - Thomas De Waal on Armenian Genocide Ellison Centre, Washington  Mission and focus  The Near East Foundation's current mission statement states: The Near East Foundation helps build more sustainable, prosperous, and inclusive communities in the Middle East, Africa, and the Caucasus through education, community organizing, and economic development. NEF is an operational non-governmental organization with projects in Armenia, Jordan, Lebanon, Mali, Morocco, the West Bank, Senegal, Sudan, and Syria. In these countries, it works with disadvantaged social groups including people coping with conflict, displacement, exclusion, and climate change. The organization focuses on three program areas that are aimed at addressing development challenges in the long-term: peacebuilding, sustainable agriculture and natural resource management, and microenterprise development. It is structured to work with local partners to deliver services. NEF activities are rooted in an approach referred to as \\"Knowledge, Voice, and Enterprise\\". This approach is guided by the principle that to take a leadership role in the development of their communities and countries, individuals require opportunities and tools: the knowledge to participate in civic and economic life, a voice in public decisions that affect their wellbeing, and a means of making a meaningful living (enterprise). NEF's partners include local and international non-governmental organizations, bilateral and multilateral donors, foundations, financial institutions, and government ministries.  History  Lest they perish campaign poster of the American Committee for Relief in the Near East The Near East Foundation was founded in 1915 in response to Ambassador Henry Morgenthau Sr.'s reports of governmental atrocities against Ottoman Armenians. Morgenthau referenced the deportations of intellectuals and requested urgent and immediate assistance. Former missionary and educator James L. Barton and philanthropist Cleveland Hoadley Dodge led a group of prominent New Yorkers in forming the American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief. The committee raised $60,000 for direct relief at its first meeting on September 16, 1915. The money was wired to Ambassador Morgenthau for distribution. Cleveland H. Dodge personally financed the committee's operating expenses in order to ensure that all funds went to direct relief. The committee then embarked upon an unprecedented grassroots campaign to raise money and awareness across the United States. The campaign combined striking imagery, passionate celebrity spokespeople, and captivating stories from the field to inspire Americans from all economic backgrounds to become citizen philanthropists. The organization also briefly used the name American Committee for Relief in the Near East in 1918‚Äì1919; that name appears on many of the committee's most iconic posters. In August 1919, the committee received a congressional charter (the second humanitarian organization to receive this recognition, after the American Red Cross) and was renamed Near East Relief. From 1915 to 1930, Near East Relief saved the lives of over a million refugees, including 132,000 orphans who were cared for and educated in Near East Relief orphanages. Near East Relief also mobilized the American people to raise over $116 million for direct relief. Nearly 1,000 U.S. citizens volunteered to travel overseas. Near East Relief workers built hundreds of orphanages, vocational schools, and food distributions centers. Overseas relief workers were responsible for the direct care of orphans and refugees, including the organization of vast feeding and educational programs. Thousands of Americans volunteered throughout the U.S. by donating money or supplies and hosting special events to benefit Near East Relief's work. The organization created the International Near East Association, which then dedicated Sunday, December 2, 1923, as an International Sunday of the Golden Rule. The \\"Golden Rule Sunday\\" as it became known, encouraged people to eat something simple‚Äînamely staple menus typically served in orphanages‚Äîand offer the money they saved as a donation to the orphans of the Armenian Genocide. The Sunday of the Golden Rule was celebrated in many parts of Europe, Australia, and America. President Calvin Coolidge urged the American people to express a spirit of sacrifice and generosity on December 2, 1923 as part of the larger philanthropic effort.Armenian students in California to honor ‚ÄòGolden Rule Sunday‚Äô In 1930, Near East Relief was renamed the Near East Foundation (NEF)Protestant diplomacy and the Near East:missionary influence on American policy, 1810-1927, Joseph L. Grabill to reflect the organization's shift in focus from emergency relief to long-term social and economic development. NEF expanded its geographic focus to include North Africa, sub- Saharan Africa, and the area now known as the Middle East. NEF launched the Near East Relief Historical Society in 2014 in an effort to preserve and share the organization's history.  Impact  Lest we perish campaign poster of the American Committee for Relief in the Near East During almost a century of service, NEF has partnered with communities in nearly 50 countries to improve millions of lives, and has played a crucial role in establishing the American philanthropic tradition. The relief effort that launched the organization in 1915 was the first broad national appeal of its kind to solicit funds from the American public, and it was unique in its use of media outlets and support from celebrity spokespeople and citizen volunteers alike. This effort grew and gave birth to what is now known as \\"citizen philanthropy\\" ‚Äì appealing directly to the public to support humanitarian work overseas. This model of philanthropy is used today by a majority of non-profit organizations around the world. When NEF established the practice of working in tandem with foreign governments and local organizations to improve the lives of citizens, it was nearly unprecedented. NEF has since provided the model for many of today's well-known development organizations, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Peace Corps. It has also left a legacy of enduring development institutions it had helped create that continue as centers of innovation and service, including the American University of Beirut's Faculty of Agriculture and Food Science, American University in Cairo's Desert Development Center, Agricultural College of Rezaiye and Ahwaz Agricultural College in Iran, Center for Development Services in Egypt, and dozens of others. As an example of its legacy, one of the oldest basketball teams in Greece, Near East B.C. took its name in order to honour the foundation, since it helped Greeks refugees after the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations.  Partnership with Syracuse University  In 2010, the Near East Foundation moved its headquarters to Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. At Syracuse University, NEF engages faculty and students in its international development work through strategic partnerships with the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, and the Whitman School of Management. NEF works frequently with experts in the Program for the Advancement of Research on Conflict and Collaboration.

It was first published in Salmagundi of Fall 1984Salmagundi, Fall 1984, pages 63-79 and was collected in The Cure of Poetry in an Age of Prose: Moral Essays on the Poet's Calling, and a somewhat shorter version of the essay was later anthologized in Twentieth-Century American Poeticsedited by Dana Gioia, David Mason, and Meg Schoerke The essay was one of several of the mid-1980s that sparked a heated discussion over the role of form in American poetry, and was thus implicated in the formation of the New Formalism movement. The rhapsodic conception of poetry Kinzie begins the essay by identifying two contradictory strands in the critical writing and poetry of Edgar Allan Poe which she perceives as \\"begetting\\" the \\"rhapsodic\\" conception of poetry. These strands are: #\\"intensity can only be achieved in spontaneous, fragmented utterance\\", and #\\"the mental epic is viable\\" She moves on to lament the loss of many forms or genres of poetry that were widely used in earlier times, including satire, the epistle, georgic, pastoral, allegory, philosophical poem, epic, verse drama, and tragedy, and quotes an essay by Australian poet A. D. Hope: \\"One after another the great forms disappear\\".A. D. Hope, \\"The Discursive Mode: Reflections on the Ecology of Poetry\\" Kinzie sees free verse as the \\"great equalizer\\" and ushering in an age of reduced scope and ambition. \\"When poems not only set themselves at a uniform pitch, but also contract themselves to recurrent, predictable five- or ten-line climaxes, pretty soon the surprises do not surprise us any more. The new prosaic-lyrical effusion is organized to get us into and out of the poem with extraordinary rapidity and no lasting effects.\\" Kinzie proceeds to identify three main contemporary \\"substyles\\" of the prosaic-rhapsodic: #the Objective Style #the Mixed Ironic Style #the Innocuous Surreal Style The objective style Kinzie describes the Objective Style as gaining its effects from \\"the cumulative effect of a string of brief, bland declarative sentences\\". She lists the tools of the style as being: juxtaposition, portent, non sequitur, and passivity. The last of these, she notes, claims \\"a kind of reportorial honesty\\" for the poem. The mixed ironic style In the Mixed Ironic Style the poet injects into the work a \\"stylistic agitation that at first feel rich, sensitive, conscious, attentive to response\\". Kinzie regards John Ashbery as a prime example of a poet of this style. The innocuous surreal style In the third style described by Kinzie, the Innocuous Surreal Style, the poet whimsically and abruptly \\"violates\\" the \\"realistic surface\\" of the poem. Kinzie describes variants of this style: the Muted Innocuous Surreal and the Comic Surreal.

PTT has more than 1.5 million registered users, with over 150,000 users online during peak hours. The BBS has over 20,000 boards covering a multitude of topics, and more than 20,000 articles and 500,000 comments are posted every day. Background Using the TELNET protocol, PTT provides a quick, free of charge, and open online forum community. Currently, PTT has two branch sites, PTT2 () and PTT3 (). Of the three sites, the main site PTT is largest in scale and capacity, currently handling up to 150,215 visitors online at a time (9 September 2008), making it the largest Chinese language-based BBS in the world. The main site was founded on 9 September 1995 by Yi-Chin Tu ( D√π Y√¨j«ên), then a sophomore in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. PTT2 was founded in 2000, with the aim of providing a similar system centered around groups and individuals. PTT3, powered by MediaWiki, was founded in 2004 in Washington, D.C., United States for Taiwanese students studying abroad. PTT also provides wiki and blog services for registered users. The PTTwiki service was activated on 5 February 2004 and powered by Tavi wiki system. It is the main wiki service for individuals in Taiwan. Since 2000, PTT has become the largest online forum in Taiwan due to its increasing number of users. Various issues are enthusiastically discussed on PTT, even to a profound extent generating social impacts in reality. The newspaper and television media started to report on PTT, with journalists assigned to monitor PTT for the latest updates. PTT is an open source project. The source code is released under GPL 2.0. Organization PTT is registered as a student organization at the National Taiwan University. The BBS Technology Research Club () was founded in 1999 by several BBS sites at NTU, with Yi-Chin Tu as its leader. In 1999 and 2000, the club held public events on campus for BBS users. Although PTT is a club and the most famous BBS site in Taiwan, it is not the official BBS site for NTU. The machines and other hardware used to set up PTT was obtained by the administrators without the help of the university, and hence it operates with a high level of freedom. However, it still operates on the NTU network, and hence must abide by its rules and regulations. System PTT runs under Linux, while PTT2 runs under FreeBSD 4.11. The BBS system used by PTT, PTT2, PTT3 is called Open PTT, and is under the GPL. Development The code for PTT was original forked from MapleBBS 2.36 that operated the Sun of Beach BBS. Many programmers and system administrators contributed to the PTT project, with the goals of making PTT efficient in terms for memory usage and disk access and allowing as many users on the system at a single time as possible. The code is licensed under GPL 2.0. =Open PTT= Open PTT is a BBS implementation known for its ease of installation, which is why many BBSes directly run Open PTT as their system. It can be set up with little manual configuration, and it is well documented. =Current PTT= Another fork of the PTT code is known as Current PTT, which is documented at the PttCurrent board. This is the version of the code that runs PTT and PTT2, with many additional features. It currently supports the FreeBSD and Linux platforms. =Commenting: commendation and criticism= PTT implements an article commendation () and criticism () scheme as its article rating and commenting system, in place since 25 May 2002. PTT was the first Chinese-language BBS to implement such a system. Under this system, users can evaluate an article by giving it a tuei (), adding a point, or a hs√º (), subtracting a point. Individual boards can turn off this feature or set a minimum amount of waiting time between comments. =Sticky posts= Sticky posts reside at the bottom of the forum, right after the most recent posts. =Guardian Angels= The Guardian Angels is a group of experienced PTT users who act as mentors and help answer questions that new users might have. The guardian angels remain anonymous. This system has been in place since May 2004. The 29th of every month is Guardian Angel Day, during which users express their gratitude towards their guardian angels. PTT Culture =PTT culture and lingo= * (fifth floor) -- the fifth comment of a post, which is often regarded as words of wisdom; also (fifth floor, please rate this post) * (villager) -- Refers to PTT users. Comes from the line in the Stephen Chow movie Hail the Judge. This term can also be pejorative, suggesting that users blindly follow other users. * (rookie police officer) -- refers to new users (like the term \\"newbie\\"). * ' (kk) -- A chuckle, normally , but changed to when the use of bopomofo is prohibited. * ' (to hit home) and ' -- A pun on , meaning \\"to hit home\\", referring to efforts of the Chen Shui-bian government to replace the character (China) with (Taiwan). * Pictures -- PTT users often ask for pictures. (wtf, where's the picture?), (pics or it didn't happen), similar to some western online communities * (the original poster is a pretty girl) * (our children's education cannot wait) * (Tinky Winky is talented) Said ironically, to insinuate someone is stupid * (brain-damaged) * (Step aside, let the pro do the job) Some of the popular lingo used by PTT users are vulgar, which has caused public concern, while others believe that as long as this behavior is contained online and does not affect the user's real-life behavior this is nothing to be concerned about. =Aligned comments and comment art= Aligned comments () is a cultural phenomenon in which users align their comments for special effect. Comment art () is a phenomenon inspired by the 2chAA community, in which lines of comments collectively form a picture. Since comment art is sometimes perceived as waste of system resources, some of the forums prohibit its use. =PTT blood drive= In 2004, PTT activities coordinator Huan-Yu Chen () teamed up with an on-campus organization NTU Blood-Donating Bus () to hold a blood drive to solicit blood donations in exchange for PTT money, which led to the creation of the Donate- Blood forum. =PTT logo design contest 2018= The management team of PTT held a logo design contest from May 6, 2018 to July 15, 2018. Users could submit their logo designs by posting on the contest board with their PTT ID as the title of the post. The submission session was May 6, 2018 to June 15, 2018. All PTT users had two weeks (June 16, 2018-June 30, 2018) to vote for their favorite design. The management team then together decided three winners of this contest from ten most voted designs (July 3, 2018-July 13, 2018). The champion (announced on July 15, 2018) was awarded 1,000,000 P coins (currency on PTT) along with other souvenirs. The champion design was posted on the official Facebook page and website for a year. PTT Boards The forums are subdivided into boards () and named by a string of alphanumeric characters. These boards can be searched as well as ordered by popularity. They can also be added to a user's list of favorite boards.

It is a partnership between the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, the Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing at Simon Fraser University, the University of Pittsburgh, Ontario Council of University Libraries, the California Digital Library and the School of Education at Stanford University. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of academic research through the development of innovative online environments. History The PKP was founded in 1998 by John Willinsky in the Department of Language and Literacy Education at the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, based on his research in education and publishing. Willinsky is a leading advocate of open access publishing, and has written extensively on the value of public research. PKP Bibliography The PKP's initial focus was on increasing access to scholarly research and output beyond the traditional academic environments. This soon led to a related interest in scholarly communication and publishing, and especially on ways to make it more cost effective and less reliant on commercial enterprises and their generally restricted access models. PKP has developed free, open source software for the management, publishing, and indexing of journals, conferences, and monographs. The PKP has collaborated with a wide range of partners interested in making research publicly available, including the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), the Brazilian Institute for Information Science and Technology (IBICT), and the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP). Together with INASP, the PKP is working with publishers, librarians, and academics in the development of scholarly research portals in the developing world, including African Journals OnLine (AJOL) and Asia Journals Online. As of 2008, the PKP has joined the Synergies Canada initiative, contributing their technical expertise to integrating work being done within a five-party consortium to create a decentralized national platform for social sciences and humanities research communication in Canada. Growth 2005 to 2009 The Public Knowledge Project grew between 2005 and 2009. In 2006, there were approximately 400 journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS), 50 conferences using Open Conference Systems (OCS), 4 organizations using the Harvester, and 350 members registered on the online support forum. In 2009, over 5000 journals were using OJS, more than 500 conferences were using OCS, at least 10 organizations are using the Harvester, and there were over 2400 members on the support forum. Since 2005, there were major releases (version 2) of three software modules (OJS, OCS, Harvester), as well as the addition of Lemon8-XML, with a growing number of downloads being recorded every month for all of the software. From June 12, 2009 to December 21, 2009, there were 28451 downloads of OJS, 6329 of OCS, 1255 of the Harvester, and 1096 of Lemon8-XML. A new module, Open Monograph Press (a publication management system for monographs) has also been released. The PKP also witnessed increased community programming contributions, including new plugins and features, such as the subscription module, allowing OJS to support full open access, delayed open access, or full subscription-only access. A growing number of translations have been contributed by community members, with Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese versions of OJS completed, and several others in production. Growth from 2010 A German platform, based on OJS, is being developed by the Center for Digital Systems (CeDiS), Free University of Berlin and two other institutions. Funding by the German Research Foundation (DFG) initially runs from 2014 to 2016. PKP conferences The PKP holds a biannual conference. The First PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on July 11‚Äì13, 2007 and the Second PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was also held in Vancouver on July 8‚Äì10, 2009. The Third PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in Berlin, Germany between 26‚Äì28 September 2011. The fourth PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference was held in Mexico City, Mexico in August 19‚Äì21, 2013. Notes on the presentations were recorded on a scholarly publishing blog for both the 2007 PKP 2007 Conference Blog and 2009 PKP 2009 Conference Blog conferences, and selected papers from the 2007 conference were published in a special issue of the online journal First Monday. Papers from the 2009 conference are available in the inaugural issue of the journal Scholarly and Research Communication. Next meeting will be on 20th Nov in Barcelona. Software The PKP's suite of software includes four separate, but inter-related applications to demonstrate the feasibility of open access: the Open Journal Systems, the Open Conference Systems, the PKP Open Archives Harvester, and Open Monograph Press. PKP briefly experimented with a fifth application, Lemon8-XML, but has since opted to incorporate the XML functionality into the existing applications. All of the products are open source and freely available to anyone interested in using them. They share similar technical requirements (PHP, MySQL, Apache or Microsoft IIS 6, and a Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X, or Windows operating system) and need only a minimal level of technical expertise to get up and running. In addition, the software is well supported with a free, online support forum and a growing body of publications and documentation is available on the project web site. Increasingly, institutions are combining the PKP software, using OJS to publish their research results, OCS to organize their conferences and publish the proceedings, and the OAI Harvester to organize and make the metadata from these publications searchable. Together with other open source software applications such as DSpace (for creating institutional research repositories), institutions are creating their own infrastructure for sharing their research output.

It played a significant role in the early development of computer graphics and continued to innovate in interactive media, sonic arts and moving image. It also provided postgraduate and undergraduate teaching. History A pen-plotted animated sequence from Keith Waters early work on 3D modelling of the Statue of Liberty 1987. The Centre for Electronic Arts was renamed the Lansdown Centre for Electronic Arts after the death of the computer graphics pioneer John Lansdown, its head from 1993 until 1997. Its roots lay in the work of John Vince to develop computer graphics at the university (then a polytechnic). From the 1970s, Vince and others developed two suites of computer graphics subroutines in the FORTRAN programming language, initially to create line drawings of 2D and 3D objects and, later, full colour images with smooth Gouraud and Phong shading. This work fed into short courses attended by media personnel. In 1985, Middlesex had been awarded the status of National Centre for Computer Aided Art and Design, under Paul Brown. The UK's first MSc course in Computer Graphics was developed there. One graduate, Keith Waters, went on to a PhD in 1988, awarded for his development of a muscle-based model for facial animation.

Barrow Sixth Form College was established in 1979 to fulfil the role of the main A level provider in Barrow following the merger of the two Barrow Grammar Schools and their change to deliver education to only 11 to 16 year-olds. It is the only sixth form college in Cumbria. A levels and Cambridge Technical qualifications are taught in buildings that have been specially designed for students over the age of sixteen. It includes facilities for physically disabled students and is a satellite campus for Beaumont. The college primarily educates students within the age range of 16‚Äì18 years, as well as courses for adult learners. In August 2016, the college gained chartered college status. This membership is awarded to the higher performing further education colleges and training providers in the UK. The college is also a member of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear. Profile As part of Furness College, the college is the largest provider of education and training in south Cumbria offering a wide range of A levels and technical/professional courses to its students. The college works closely with its local community providing a wide range of part-time and full- time courses and links closely to the courses offered at the Channelside campus. The college has over 1400 students aged 16‚Äì18, of which over 500 study at the Rating Lane campus. Campus Rating Lane Campus Entrance The Rating Lane campus is located at the north end of Rating Lane in Barrow-in-Furness. Nearby sites include Furness Abbey, Furness General Hospital, Chetwynde School, St. Bernard's Catholic High School and Abbey Road (the town's main central road network). The campus was purpose built to replace existing school sixth forms in the town and it opened its doors in 1979. Plans to rebuild the campus in 2010 did not come to fruition due to the withdrawal of national college capital funding by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The campus has received substantial investment since the college's merger to fund, for example, upgrades to the fabric of the building, up-to-date computer equipment and a new IT network infrastructure, and cosmetic improvements around the campus. As part of the merger, the college committed to continue this investment to upgrade learning facilities. The Rating Lane campus is one of two of Furness College's campuses, the other being Channelside in Barrow which is located approximately 3 miles away in the centre of the town. Merger Channelside Campus On 1 August 2016, Barrow Sixth Form College underwent a 'type B' merger with Furness College. The Sixth Form College received a financial notice to improve in January 2016 from the Education Funding Agency and was deemed no longer to be financially viable due to its inadequate financial health. As a result, merger discussions between the two colleges continued and on 1 August 2016, the corporation of Barrow Sixth Form College was dissolved and its assets and liabilities transferred to Furness College. The college will continue to operate on both campuses, which are approximately three miles apart, retaining both the Furness College and Sixth Form College brands. Both A level and technical/professional courses will continue, with further expansion of the curriculum planned for future years where there may be opportunities for students to study a 'blended' curriculum offer. A level provision is predominantly offered at the college's Rating Lane campus with technical and professional qualifications mainly delivered at the Channelside campus. Courses Barrow Sixth Form College offers a wide range of A level courses which are predominantly studied on a full-time basis. Subject areas include: * Sciences * English * Mathematics * Humanities * Creative and performing arts * Modern languages * Social sciences * Health studies * Sport * Computer Science As part of Furness College, the following courses are also offered: * Full- and part-time courses - the college runs a large range of technical and professional courses for young people and adults, including T levels from 2021. * Business Development - the college works with the local business community to provide bespoke training courses. * School Leavers - a wide range of full-time courses are available from Art & Design through to Engineering, Health & Social Care, Sport and lots more. * Apprenticeships - Furness College currently trains over 1000 apprentices and works with over 400 employers. * Higher Education - from foundation degrees to master's degrees in a range of subject areas. Ofsted Inspection In March 2019, the college underwent a full Ofsted inspection which was its first Ofsted inspection since the merger between Furness College and Barrow Sixth Form College in August 2016. Inspectors judged the College to be a good (grade 2) college with good provision in all main judgement areas. Student Union The Barrow Sixth Form College Students' Union is affiliated to the National Union of Students, and all students are entitled to membership. The college also offers extensive academic and pastoral support to all its students. Leadership and Management The College is led by the senior leadership team under the direction and scrutiny of the Board of the Corporation which is also responsible for overseeing the strategic direction of the college.

In 2003, a chilling story emerged that the once family Anne and Arthur were found brutally murdered inside the upper floor of the Grange. It is believed foul play was to blame as there were stab wounds to their necks and weirdly, to both of their eyes. The killer, who got the infamous name Eye Ripper, has never been caught and perhaps roams the streets of Hurworth to this day...  History  Hurworth Grange was constructed in Hurworth-on-Tees by Alfred Waterhouse, commissioned by Alfred Backhouse as a wedding gift for his nephew, James Edward Backhouse. The building is a large brick Victorian mansion that at one time boasted of a lovely rock garden created by the famous Backhouse nursery of Yorkshire. Hurworth Grange in 2005 Over the years the house changed hands, being used as a residence by the Rogerson family and then later the Spielman family. During World War II Jewish refugees were housed at Hurworth Grange and a military installation was set up in its grounds. In 1956 Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God purchased Hurworth Grange to use as a Juniorate School. In 1967 the Juniorate School was closed and Hurworth Grange was purchased by the local Parish Council for use as a community centre.  Hauntings  Regular patrons of the Hurworth Grange Community Centre have reported various types of paranormal activity occurring. In early 2005 Anomalous Phenomena Investigations (API), of Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England, run by founders Colin & Cindy Nunn and Chris & Jo Carnegie, were granted exclusive privileges to investigate the alleged hauntings.

At the time of his death he was one of five actors on Caricature, a 45-minute comedy satire on Al-Sharqiyah TV, that did not hesitate to make fun of U.S. forces, Shiite militias, Sunni-Arab insurgent groups, and the chaotic governments that have tried to rule Iraq since Saddam Hussein was overthrown in the 2003 invasion. The popular actor's TV show provided hard-pressed Iraqis with comic relief by poking fun at everything from politicians to long lines at fuel stations.

JADE system supports coordination between several agents FIPA and provides a standard implementation of the communication language FIPA-ACL, which facilitates the communication between agents and allows the services detection of the system. JADE was originally developed by Telecom Italia and is distributed as free software.  Resume  JADE is a middleware which facilitates the development of multi-agent systems under the standard FIPA for which purpose it creates multiple containers for agents, each of them can run on one or more systems. Is understood that a set of containers constitutes a platform. JADE provides: * An environment where JADE agents are executed * Class libraries to create agents using heritage and redefinition of behaviors * A graphical toolkit to monitoring and managing the platform of intelligent agents  History  JADE was initially developed by Telecom Italia Lab. This sector is the R & D branch of Telecom Italia Group which is responsible for promoting technological innovation. Telecom Italia conceived and promoted JADE by basing it in 2000. The latest available dates from June 2017 (version 4.5). The first version of JADE distributed as free software is available from February 2000 (versi√≥n 1.3). In March 2003 Motorola and Telecom Italia created the JADE Governing Board with the objective of promoting the development and adoption of JADE in the mobile telecommunications industry as middleware based. The JADE Governing Board accepts to any company and/or organization interested in the commercial use and exploitation of JADE to commit to its development and promotion.  Platform  JADE is a distributed agents platform, which has a container for each host where you are running the agents. Additionally, the platform has various debugging tools, mobility of code and content agents, the possibility of parallel execution of the behavior of agents, as well as support for the definition of languages and ontologies. Each platform must have a parent container that has two special agents called AMS and DF. * The DF (Directory Facilitator) provides a directory which announces which agents are available on the platform. * The AMS (Agent Management System) controls the platform. It is the only one who can create and destroy other agents, destroy containers and stop the platform. = DF Agent = To access the DF agent the class \\"jade.domain.DFService\\" and its static methods are used: register, deregister, modify and Search. = AMS agent = To access the AMS Service an agent is created which automatically runs the register method of the AMS by default before executing the method setup from the new agent. When an agent is destroyed it executes its takeDown() method by default and automatically calls the deregister method of the AMS.  Agent class  The Agent class is a superclass which allows the users to create JADE agents. To create an agent one needs to inherit directly from Agent. Normally, each agent recorder several services which they should be implemented by one or more behaviors. This class provides methods to perform the basic tasks of the agents as: * Pass messages by objects ACLMessage, with pattern matching * Support the life cycle of an agent * Plan and execute multiple activities at the same time  JADE agent The cycle of life of a JADE agent follows the cycle proposed by FIPA. These agents go through different states defined as: # Initiated: The agent has been created but has not registered yet the AMS. # Active: The agent has been registered and has a name. In this state, it can communicate with other agents. # Suspended: The agent is stopped because its thread is suspended. # Waiting: The agent is blocked waiting for an event. # Deleted: The agent has finished and his thread ended his execute and there is not any more in the AMS. # Transit: The agent is moving to a new location.  Agents' behaviour  The behavior defines the actions under a given event. This behavior of the agent is defined in the method setup using the method addBehaviour. The different behaviors that the agent will adopt are defined from the abstract class Behaviour. The class Behaviour contains the abstract methods: * action (): Is executed when the action takes place. * done (): Is executed at the end of the performance. A user can override the methods onStart () and OnEnd () property. Additionally, there are other methods such as block () and restart () used for modifying the agent's behavior. When an agent is locked it can be unlocked in different ways. Otherwise the user can override the methods onStart() and onEnd() the agent possess. =Unlock an agent= # Receiving a message. # When the timeout happens associated with block (). # Calling restart.  ACL messages  Message passing ACL (Agent Communication Language) is the base of communication between agents. Sending messages is done by the method send of the class Agent. In this method, you have to pass an object of type ACLMessage that contains the recipient information, language, coding and content of the message. These messages are sent asynchronously, while messages are received they will be stored in a message queue. There are two types of receiving ACL messages, blocking or non- blocking. For this provide methods blockingReceive () and receive () respectively. In both methods, you can make filtering messages to be retrieved from the queue by setting different templates.

About 1430 he received the degree of Doctor of Both Laws at the University of Padua. Filled with the prevalent ideas of reform, this ardent and eloquent jurist was naturally attracted to the Council of Basle, convened, according to the assembled prelates, for \\"the extirpation of heresy, and of the Greek schism. . . .and for the reformation of the Church in her Head and members\\". While at the council he became the secretary of √Üneas Sylvius. He left Basle in 1433, when he was elected syndic of Nuremberg, in which capacity he served until 1461. After the election of Albert VI of Austria, he was sent, with John of Lysura, to the Council of Basle to demand that the proceedings against the pope be suspended, and then to Eugene IV at Ferrara to propose that the negotiations with the Greeks be carried on in a German city. In 1446 he was again placed at the head of an embassy to Eugene IV. The pope had deposed the Archbishops of Cologne and Trier, both electoral princes, who favoured the antipope Felix V. The other electors now demanded of Eugene (1) his approval of certain decrees of Basle; (2) the convocation of a general council in a German city within three months; (3) the acceptance of the article on the superiority of the council over the pope; and (4) the reinstating of the two deposed archbishops. But Gregory's mission was unsuccessful. On the advice of Frederick III the pope sent Cardinal Tommaso Parentucelli and Cardinal Juan Carvajal, with Nicholas of Cusa, as legates to the Diet of Frankfort, 14 Sept., 1446. With them was √Üneas Sylvius, now the private secretary of Emperor Frederick III. Some of the electors were won over to the cause of the pope; a new embassy was organized; and in February, 1447, shortly before the death of Eugene, the four Bulls constituting the Concordat of the Princes was promulgated. In February, 1448, a complete agreement was reached in the Concordate of Vienna, concluded between Frederick III and Nicholas V. Gregory, who had considered even the declaration of neutrality an ignoble concession, was disappointed at this turn of events and decided to abandon ecclesiastical politics. During the negotiations between the pope and the electors there appeared the anonymous \\"Admonitio de injustis usurpationibus paparum\\" or, as Matthias Flacius entitles it, \\"Confutatio primatus pap√¶\\", which is generally ascribed to Gregory. In 1458 Gregory entered the service of Albert of Austria and his opposition to papal authority was again aroused. √Üneas Sylvius had ascended the papal throne as Pius II the same year, and soon afterwards (1459) summoned the princes of Christendom to Mantua to plan a crusade against the Turks. Gregory was present as the representative of Bavaria-Landshut, Kurmainz, and the Archduke Albert of Austria. The failure of the project was partly due to his influence. Sigismund of Austria, on his return from the Congress of Mantua, imprisoned Nicholas of Cusa, Bishop of Brixen, with whom he was quarrelling over certain fiefs. He was excommunicated 1 June 1460, and through Gregory of Heimburg appealed to a general council. Gregory went to Rome, but to no avail, and on his return journey posted the duke's appeal on the doors of the cathedral of Florence. The pope then excommunicated him and ordered the Council of Nuremberg to confiscate his property (18 October 1460). Gregory answered in January, 1461, with an appeal to a general council. Pius II renewed the excommunication and commissioned Bishop Lelio of Feltre to reply to Gregory's appeal. The \\"Replica Theodori L√¶lii episcopi Feltrensis pro Pio Papa II et sede Roman√¢\\" brought forth from Gregory his \\"Apologia contra detractationes et blasphemias Theodori L√¶lii\\" together with his \\"Depotestate ecclesi√¶ Roman√¶\\", in which he defended the theories of Basle. His next important writing, \\"Invectiva in Nicolaum de Cusa\\", appeared in 1461. Shortly before the death of Pius II in 1464, Sigismund made his peace with the Church, but Gregory was not absolved. In 1466 he was taken into the service of George Podiebrad, King of Bohemia, and exercised a great influence on the Bohemian king's anti-Roman policy. In two apologies for Podiebrad, Gregory violently attacked Pope Paul II, whom he charged with immorality. He was again excommunicated and his property at Dettlebach confiscated. After the death of George Podiebrad (22 March 1471) Gregory took refuge in Saxony. Writing to the Council of W√ºrzburg as early as 22 January 1471, he said he was never accused of having erred in one article of Christian faith. He applied by letter to Sixtus IV, who gave the Bishop of Meissen full power to absolve him. He was buried in the Kreuzkirche at Dresden. Works His writings were published at Frankfort in 1608 under the title \\"Scripta nervosa justiaque plena ex manuscriptis nunc primum eruta\\". They may be found in Goldast, \\"Monarchia\\", in Marquard Freher, \\"Scriptores rerum Germanicarum\\", and in Joachimsohn (see below).

This was also the last to be broadcast in Northern Ireland in 2018. The BBC Two '1991‚Äì2001' idents were broadcast from 16 February 1991 until 19 November 2001, and again from 9 July 2014 until 27 September 2018, on BBC Two in the United Kingdom. The idents, which consisted of a sans-serif '2', accompanied by the colour viridian, were created by branding agency Lambie-Nairn (and later, Red Bee Media), who also created the Channel 4 logo. The ident package was retained following the corporate rebrand of the BBC in 1997 with a new logo and new idents commissioned. They were taken out of service in November 2001, and were later revived on 21 June 2014 for 90's Night and in July 2014, to commemorate the 50th birthday of BBC Two. They replaced the 'Window on the World' idents and were broadcast until the early hours of 27 September 2018. Conception The newly recruited BBC2 controller, Alan Yentob, noticed that the then-logo for the channel, which featured the word 'TWO' in red, green and blue within a white background and the 'O' being white, was affecting the reputation of BBC2. Surveys commissioned realised that most viewers thought the branding was \\"dull\\" and \\"worthy\\". He then decided to commission a worthy successor capable of displaying the personality of the channel, revealing his thoughts in the How Do They Do That? episode - about the idents. The idents were designed by branding expert Martin Lambie-Nairn, and first aired on the same day as the BBC1 virtual globe ident, also designed by Lambie-Nairn as part of a corporate rebrand of both channels. Idents The idents featured a sans-serif '2' in a variety of different forms and environments usually accompanied by an element of the colour viridian and accompanied by a static corporate logo DOG below the '2'. Another DOG often used with the look was a small '888' legend in the top right of the screen. This meant that subtitles were available to accompany the programme on Ceefax page 888. Following the 1997 rebrand, the BBC logo was changed, with the word TWO added after the logo at the bottom of the screen. The '888' legend was also phased out in 1999, to be replaced with 'Subtitles' following the uptake in digital television and the increased use of the new BBC Text service. A section of the TV programme How Do They Do That? that was broadcast on 15 February 1995 described how the graphics and sound of some of the idents were created. The clock idents had been changed through years and were mainly used for closedowns and news. The first clock ident was used in February until late 1991, the second was used in late 1991 until October 1997. The clock was edited in October 1997 with the new logo. This was the last BBC TWO logo to use the clock ident. The new idents commissioned after 1997 placed less emphasis on the use of the colour viridian and the bell/harp music. Later on, as the Internet began to grow, the URL of BBC's website (www.bbc.co.uk) was included in idents on-screen from January 2000. On 27 September 2018, BBC Two received a rebrand, with the sans-serif '2' symbol being retired after 27 years; a new set of idents featuring a curve motif resembling a '2' were introduced. The last ident from this set, Optics, was aired one minute before the new set of idents were introduced.

Format Gareth Jones & Gilbert the Alien. A Saturday- morning kids' TV show, broadcast on the Children's ITV network. The show featured Gareth Jones (aka Gaz Top), Charlotte Hindle, and, for the first year of its run, Gian Sammarco, the British child actor best known for his portrayal of the character 'Adrian Mole'. Sammarco was replaced for the 2nd and 3rd series by a puppet named Gilbert the Alien (voiced by Phil Cornwell). Each week the series would be broadcast from a different UK location and centred on the Millennium Dustbin, a fictional space ship in which the presenters would travel the country. The show invited a live audience to attend and give vox-pop comments, to give presentations on local community activities, and to participate in games and challenges. Pop stars would also appear to perform on the show. The show featured a unique play-by-phone challenge, using the Amiga video game Xenon, where viewers would call in and shout \\"left, left, right, shoot\\" commands to a blindfolded player. Get Fresh also featured the animated series The Centurions and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers. Spin-offs Get Fresh Sunday was a pre-recorded Sunday morning edition of the show also presented by Gaz, Charlotte and Gilbert. This spin-off featured The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin and Gummi Bears and studio- based interviews and features, and was more item-based than the activity driven Saturday live show. Gilbert later featured in a further two series for Tyne Tees Television, Gilbert's Fridge (1988) and Gilbert's Late (1990). Production notes The series was administrated by Tyne Tees Television from a Central Unit based at their London office, but was produced in conjunction with the local ITV station from where the series was to broadcast that week. Get Fresh Sunday was produced solely by Border Television. The theme music for the programme was written by Mick Jones of The Clash and Big Audio Dynamite fame. =Series 1 - 1986 = * * 3 May - The Glebe, Windermere (Border) * 10 May - Coney Beach Pleasure Park, Porthcawl (HTV Wales) * 17 May - Tuxedo Princess, Newcastle (Tyne Tees) * 24 May - Glasgow Mayfest (Scottish) * 31 May - Carmunnock Highland Games (Scottish) * 7 June - Portrush (Ulster) * 14 June - Cardiff Castle (HTV Wales) * 21 June - Colchester Zoo (Anglia) * 28 June - Bath Festival of Steam (HTV West) * 5 July - Weymouth Beach (TSW) * 12 July - Bellahouston Park, Glasgow (Scottish) * 19 July - Aberdeen (Grampian) * 26 July - Swaffham (Anglia) * 2 August - Whitehaven Harbour (Border) * 9 August - Scone Palace, Perth (Grampian) * 16 August - Ashton Court Park, Bristol (HTV West) * 23 August - Tyne Tees Studios, Newcastle (Tyne Tees) * 30 August - Carlisle Castle (Border) * 6 September - Beamish Open Air Museum, County Durham (Tyne Tees) * 13 September - Plymouth Hoe (TSW) =Series 2 - 1987 = * 25 April and 2 May - \\"Get Ready for Get Fresh\\" (Studio-based episodes made by Border) * 9 May - Sheepmount Athletics track, Carlisle (Border) * 16 May - Yeovil (TSW) * 23 May - Duxford Air Museum (Anglia) * 30 May - Edinburgh Castle (Scottish) * 6 June - Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (Grampian) * 13 June - Lakeland Forum, Enniskillen (Ulster) * 20 June - Ulster Folk Museum (Ulster) * 27 June - New Lanark Old Mill Town (Scottish) * 4 July - Cardiff Ice Rink (HTV Wales) * 11 July - Plymouth (TSW) * 18 July - Newquay (TSW) * 25 July - Kelso Agricultural Fair (Border) * 1 August - Clydebank (Scottish) * 8 August - Northumberland Scout and Guide Camp, Gosforth Park (Tyne Tees) * 15 August - Border TV, Carlisle (Border) * 22 August - Norwich (Anglia) * 29 August - Bristol (HTV West) =Series 3 - 1988= * 9 April - Newcastle, County Down (Ulster) * 16 April - Giant's Causeway (Ulster) * 23 April - Maritime Museum, Exeter (TSW) * 30 April - Lord Montagu's Transport Museum, Beaulieu (TVS) * 7 May - St Austell (TSW) * 14 May - Great Yarmouth (Anglia) * 21 May - Galloway Games, Stranraer (Border) * 28 May - Ferry Meadows Country Park, Peterborough (Anglia) * 4 June - Roman fort, South Shields (Tyne Tees) * 11 June - Dundee (Grampian) * 18 June - Killington Lake services (Border) * 25 June - Glasgow Show, Bellahouston Park (Scottish) * 2 July - Summerlee Heritage Trust, Coatbridge (Scottish) * 9 July - Eden Court Theatre, Inverness (Grampian) * 16 July - Glasgow Garden Festival (Scottish) * 23 July - Teignmouth (TSW) * 30 July - Douglas, Isle of Man (Border) * 6 August - Metrocentre, Gateshead (Tyne Tees) * 13 August - Tropicana, Weston- super-Mare (HTV West) * 20 August - Tavistock Meadows (TSW) * 27 August - Margam Country Park, Port Talbot (HTV Wales) Transmission guide *Series 1: 20 editions from 3 May 1986 ‚Äì 13 September 1986 *Series 2: 29 editions from 25 April 1987 ‚Äì 29 August 1987 *Series 3: 42 editions from 9 April 1988 ‚Äì 28 August 1988 References External links * * Get Fresh on Paul Morris' SatKids Category:1986 British television series debuts Category:1988 British television series endings Category:1980s British children's television series Category:ITV children's television shows Category:British television shows featuring puppetry Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:English- language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Tyne Tees Television Category:Television shows produced by Border Television Category:Television shows produced by Harlech Television (HTV) Category:Television shows produced by Anglia Television Category:Television shows produced by Television South West (TSW) Category:Television shows produced by Television South (TVS) Category:Television shows produced by Ulster Television Category:Television shows produced by Scottish Television Category:Television shows produced by Grampian Television ","title":"Get Fresh"},{"id":"8050200","text":"Stari Grad () or Stara Varo≈° (), was one of five city municipalities which constituted the City of Kragujevac.

The discovery of a parallel inscription in grave 172 of the \\"Unterer Stollen\\" cemetery in Bad Krozingen in 2001, reading :boba : leub  agirike revived discussions regarding the authenticity of the Kleines Schulerloch inscription. Still, in 2003, Looijenga concluded that the inscription is an obvious falsification. In 2012, Findell, accepting the Bad Krozingen inscription as genuine, noted that most scholars still objected to its authenticity and considered the Kleines Schulerloch inscription to be at least \\"suspect\\".

Early life and career Barlow was born in Fairfield, Vermont, son of Colonel Bradley and Deborah (Sherman) Barlow. Barlow attended the common schools and then engaged in mercantile pursuits in Philadelphia with his father until 1858, when he moved to St. Albans, Vermont. Barlow began his banking career in St. Albans as a cashier. Originally a Democrat, and later a Republican, Barlow was a delegate to the Vermont State constitutional conventions in 1843, 1850, and 1857, and was acting assistant secretary in 1843. He was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1845, 1850 to 1852, 1864, and 1865. He engaged in banking and in the railroad business from 1860 to 1883. He was chairman of the school committee in St. Albans and president of the village corporation and treasurer of Franklin County from 1860 to 1867. Barlow served in the Vermont Senate from 1866 to 1868. In 1878 he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for Congress at a time when Vermont elected only Republicans to statewide and national office, and lost to William W. Grout. Barlow then ran as a \\"National Republican\\" with Democratic and Greenbacker support and won the general election, serving in the Forty- sixth United States Congress, March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1881. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1880, and began to suffer business setbacks, largely engineered by Republicans including former Governor J. Gregory Smith, who were part of Vermont's business and banking community and resented Barlow's insurgency against the dominant Republican hierarchy.Samuel B. Hand, The Star That Set: The Vermont Republican Party, 1854-1974, 2003, page 43 Scandals Barlow was implicated in the star routes mail scandal of 1876 in which he was identified as one of the most successful mail contractors in the country. He was called to testify before Congress several times regarding the scandal. One of his first was in 1876, where he was accused of bribing Congress in 1872 with $40,000 to stop the initial investigation of the forty- second congress. Later years Barlow was President of the Vermont National Bank in St. Albans when it failed in 1883 as a result of an unsuccessful attempt to sell his South Eastern Railway of Canada and an economic downturn. He declared bankruptcy, assigned all of his personal property to the bank and reported that he was penniless. The bank failure had severe repercussions for the town. He was also accused of refusing to pay Vermont state taxes that year. In 1885, a judge in Montreal, Quebec, Canada rendered a judgement against Barlow and others for $1,550,929 for unrecovered promissory notes relating to the South Eastern Railway. His house, known as Villa Barlow, was taken over by the Congregation of Notre Dame based in Montreal, which had established a convent and school in St. Albans in 1869. In 1903 the American- born Eliza Healy, whose mother was a slave in Georgia, was appointed mother superior at the convent and school, both of which she managed for 15 years. Barlow later lived in Denver, Colorado with one of his daughters. He died in Denver on November 6, 1889, and was interred in Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans, Vermont. Personal life In 1837 he married Caroline Farnsworth. They had six children: Deborah Barlow, Helen K. Barlow, Joanna F. Barlow, Laura Barlow, Charlotte Barlow and Anna Barlow.

Unusually for the time the band was based on a skiffle sound, making use of a washboard for percussion instead of a drum kit. Terry Lilley plays double bass, and Gerry Colvin sings lead vocals and plays acoustic guitar. History Gerry Colvin had studied American Studies at university and worked for an American bank before turning to music. Americana and comment on American politics and culture were to feature strongly in some of the band's songs (\\"Kennedy Says\\", \\"Reservation\\", \\"A Thousand Towns\\", \\"Pizza Pie and Junk\\"). Terry Lilley had previously been a member of punk band Dennis & the Din Makers and later of Vision Collision. Terry and Gerry took their style from nineteen fifties pop artists ‚Äì they wore black evening suits and ribbon ties in the style of the Everly Brothers while sounding more akin to Britain's Lonnie Donegan. The songs written by Colvin/Lilley were remarkable for their brevity with the three songs on the first side of their debut EP Butter's on the Bread totalling just four minutes and five seconds. Butter's on the Bread referred to the miners' strike of 1984. Butter's on the Bread appeared on Robert Lloyd's Vindaloo records but subsequent records were released on the in Tape record label run by Marc Riley (ex The Fall). BBC disc jockey and Donegan fan John Peel promoted the band when apparently by chance he picked out their demonstration tape because his wife's best friends were also known as Terry and Gerry. He thought the coincidence was too great to ignore.John Peel, Margrave of the Marshes, Corgi Books, The band recorded three sessions for the John Peel programme. Their second and most successful release \\"Clothes Shop\\" was reviewed by Morrissey on BBC Radio who declared \\"I like it ‚Äì don't know why\\". It reached number 5 in the UK Indie Chart. The band's third release \\"Banking on Simon\\" was used in abridged form as the theme to the ITV children's television music-themed quiz game Poparound, which was produced by Central Independent Television and ran for two series between 1985‚Äì6. Terry and Gerry appeared on one edition of the programme to perform the song (with \\"Doreen\\" playing washboard). Despite the use of the A-side as a children's TV theme the B-side featured a song about a young man named Joey tragically addicted to illegal drugs. At the time the name Joey had a particular stigma attached to it after children cruelly used it to abuse others in reference to Joey Deacon a man with cerebral palsy who had appeared on BBC children's TV show Blue Peter. Another theme was recorded for the Newshound show but not released on record. Terry and Gerry's only LP record From Lubbock to Clintwood East is a reference to Buddy Holly's hometown Lubbock, Texas and a fictitious suburb that is a play on the name of the actor Clint Eastwood. \\"Reservation\\", a comment on European treatment of indigenous Americans also serves as a comment on UK housing policy. It was backed by \\"Pizza Pie and Junk\\" a tale from the point of view of a British person saving up to fly to America on Freddie Laker's or Richard Branson's cut-price airlines and what they might find. \\"Last Bullet in the Gun\\" is an uncharacteristically slow-paced song that offered no hope or joy and which describes a suicide. It was to be the band's last single and it reached No. 1 in the indie charts. After Terry and Gerry In 1986 Gerry Colvin worked with other musicians as The Man Upstairs co-writing \\"Consumer Song\\", \\"Country Boy\\" and \\"I Bet They're Really Missing Me Downstairs\\" on the collectable The Consumers' EP. Gerry Colvin collaborated with singer-songwriter Alison Moyet on the song \\"Find Me\\" which appears on her 1991 album Hoodoo. He went on to front two bands, Gerry Colvin's Inexperience and The Atlantics, both of which were popular live acts. Colvin subsequently performed and recorded with Nick Quarmby, Martin Fitzgibbon, Allen Maslen and Marion Fleetwood as ColvinQuarmby. Terry Lilley studied for and achieved a higher national diploma in jazz studies; the only double-bass player to do so. Jeremy Paige formed Rumblefish releasing an album on East West Records in 1992 and then Low Art Thrill releasing an album on Island Records in 1996, both with various supporting singles. Mick Howson joined the Destroyers, a 15 piece gypsy band playing hurdygurdy. In 2007 Cherry Red Records issued a retrospective collection of studio and live recordings In 2014 autumn dates were advertised for Terry and Gerry performing as part of a John Peel Commemorative tour. During this tour, the band sold a new 6 track recording called \\"Dear John EP\\". In April 2015 Terry and Gerry were the special guests of Status Quo on the \\"Aquostic ‚Äì Live\\" tour culminating with a performance at the Royal Albert Hall.

The purpose of such visual merchandising is to attract, engage, and motivate the customer towards making a purchase. Visual merchandising traditionally occurs in brick and mortar stores using a blend of lighting, color combinations, and articles of decor to stimulate an observer and generate interest. However, many e-commerce retailers have begun to apply the techniques as well. History When the giant nineteenth century dry goods establishments like Marshall Field & Co. shifted their business from wholesale to retail, the visual display of goods became necessary to attract the general consumers. The store windows were often used to attractively display the store's merchandise. Over time, the design aesthetic used in window displays moved indoors and became part of the overall interior store design, eventually reducing the use of display windows in many suburban malls. In the twentieth century, well-known artists such as Salvador Dal√≠ and Andy Warhol\\"Andy Warhol, 'Window Display for the Bonwit Teller Department Store', New York, 1960 \\" Photograph by Mike Kelley, http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/kelley-andy- warhol-window-display-for-the-bonwit-teller-deprtment-store-new- york-1960-l02640\\"Andy Warhol\\" Gagosian Gallery, retrieved 5 December 2013, http://www.gagosian.com/artists/andy-warhol/ created window displays. In the beginning of twenty-first century, visual merchandising is forming as a science. Nowadays, visual merchandising became one of the major tool of business promotion which is widely used to attract customers and increase sales. WindowsWear is a community and database of visual merchandising from around the world.  Contribution to retail brand strategy  Visual merchandising contributes to a brand's personality and the characteristics associated with the brand. The design of the store should reflect this as part of their retail brand strategy. This includes the in-store environment and brand communications used, such as signage and images displayed in-store. These visual elements play a part in building a retail brand and therefore they help a brand differentiate itself from its competitors, create brand loyalty, and allows for a brand to place premium pricing on their products. Part of the brand strategy used in visual merchandising is research into the brand's target market to find out what their customers‚Äô values and self-images are. This information can allow the retailer to cater the design of a store and their advertising to match their consumers. Methodology =Techniques= Visual merchandising supports retail sales by creating an appealing and enticing environment for the customer that will further maximize company growth and profit by educating the customer with strategic product placement that will highlight and easily stretch the brand image. Detail is retail. In order for retailers to gain an important competitive advantage in the marketplace, visual merchandising is an important factor and an effective way of adding value to their brand. Visual merchandising communicates with customers through elements that stimulate their senses such as lighting, music, aromas, and television screens.Monash University. (2002). The Power of In-store Music and its Influence on International Retail Brands and Shopper Behaviour: A Multi-Case Study Approach. Retrieved from http://www.semus.lt/medziaga/1.pdf. The environment in which a consumer is in can influence the purchasing decisions they make. Research shows that stores that do not communicate well with their customers, such as the retail store having a poor layout can cause customers to incur psychic costs, and may lead to customers being deterred from shopping again as overall shopping pleasure has been reduced. The physical environment is a primary objective in communicating with customers in retail. Research from Thaler shows that consumers are more willing to pay a higher price for a product if the product is purchased in a more favourable environment. This makes customers become more accepting of the higher price, rather than if it were to be sold in an old rundown store. Customers can form an important bias of the merchandise quality based on the retail store design environment, and even factors such as employee's interpersonal skills and how they are treated. Visual merchandising builds upon or augments the retail design of a store. It is one of the final stages in setting out a store in a way customers find attractive and appealing. Many elements can be used by visual merchandisers in creating displays including color, lighting, space, product information, sensory inputs (such as smell, touch, and sound), as well as technologies such as digital displays and interactive installations. Visual merchandising consists of mainly two techniques; interior and exterior displays, also known as in-store design and window displays. The goal of these two techniques is to attract the attention of consumers, entice them into the store, to keep them in the store as long as possible, and influence purchasing decisions. A recent study has found that these two techniques have the greatest effect on impulse buying; therefore, they are important aspects for the retailer. In-store design and window display techniques can be used to enhance the store environment, influencing consumer behaviour and purchasing decisions. In-store design is a technique, which can be used to enhance the atmosphere of the store and the overall store environment. Having a visually appealing store design can simulate the representation of the brand and attract customers. Efficient, customer friendly environment makes shopping easier for consumers, which encourages buying and, most importantly, reassures repeat purchasing. The window design technique is a way of communicating with customers, which uses a combination of lighting, colours, props, text, and graphic design to display goods, attract the attention of the customer, and sustain a brand image. The overall goal of the window display for the retailer is to persuade the customer into the store and motivate purchasing.  Interior displays  In-store visual merchandising can be used to capture the attention of consumers whilst they are in the store, an essential component in the buying decision-making process. To capture the attention of the customer, the retailer must consider the customer's needs during this process. Factors that contribute to the overall in-store design include the store layout, store design, point of purchases displays, item display, assortment display, and signage. When applied successfully to a store, these factors can meet the needs of the consumer and provide a positive in-store purchasing environment.  Store layout  The layout of a store is a significant factor for the maintenance of a thriving business, which can help advance sales and profitability. An effective store layout encourages consumers to shop the entire store and view an extensive assortment of merchandise. The most common forms of store layouts include grid layout, racetrack layout and free form layout. Choosing a store layout depends on the type of store and the nature of the product sold. A grid layout is generally organized in a rectangular shape, which allows customers to shop quickly and maximize shop floor space, ideal for a supermarket or hardware store. A racetrack layout ensures that the consumer only follows one path when browsing the store. This is beneficial in the sense that the consumer will come into contact with every product on the shelf. However, this can irritate customers. Customers may feel that they are being forced to follow a certain path, and can be frustrating when trying to make a quick purchase. Free form layout is a suitable layout for a store that encourages browsing. This type of layout is more relaxed in its structure, which leaves the customer feeling less rushed. The entrance of the store, otherwise known as the transition zone, is an important area in the store. The term \\"transition zone\\" was first coined by retail anthropologist Paco Underhill. This is an area where all shoppers pass on entry into store, and is significant as this zone is where consumers can observe the stimuli and sense the general vibe of the store. Therefore, thoughts and representations a consumer has about the store and the brand depend on this area. When customers enter the transition zone they need time to adjust to the new environment including the lighting, the temperature and other sights and sounds. Higher profit margin items aren‚Äôt recommended to be placed in that area because customers don't notice it while they are preoccupied with adjusting to the new environmental stimuli. Spatial design of a retail store is a key aspect when it comes to creating an enjoyable experience, and is also an effective way of communicating with customers. Colour can be considered as one of the most important variables when it comes to ambiance in retail. (Van Rom pay, Tania- Dijkstra, Verhoeven, & van Es, 2011). Certain colours that can be considered as highly arousing can encourage customers to make purchases out of impulse. Warm colors such and orange, red, and yellow give consumers a sense of excitement but also provide a sense of anxiety and create a distraction. Recreational shoppers that enjoy a sense of excitement may prefer these high arousal colors. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011). In general, people prefer cool colours such as green and blue and associate these colours with a sense of calmness and security. Shoppers that are more task oriented are more likely to prefer these cool colours as they bring this calming effect and are also less likely to distract them from the task at hand. The way the furniture such as shelves and racks and seating are set up is a tangible element is store design. A store layout with a higher regard for space can increase customer pleasure, and a store filled with clutter can have the opposite effect. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011). When It comes to a simple well-spaced layout in a store, task oriented customers find this type of layout to be the most effective, as they can easily locate the items they want without the unnecessary clutter and obstacles in their way. These simple factors can encourage customers to stay in the store longer and in turn spend more. (Van Rompay et al.,. 2011).  Mannequins  Mannequins are used by apparel retailers to display their products in-store and in the window display. They are a tool used to show consumers what their products look like on a person. The mannequins will commonly be styled to match trends as well display the latest products available. A study found that retailers projected an ideal image to consumers with the size and proportions of the mannequins. This is used to further reinforce the characteristics of their target market. However, consumers found the size of mannequins to be unrealistic but would give a favorable response to the mannequins when they were headless. This was because the participants in the study found the faces of the mannequins unrealistic and could not relate to them. Therefore, it is important for retailers to understand the thoughts and opinions of consumers on visual stimuli such as mannequins so they can create a more desirable shopping environment for the consumers.  Point of purchase display  Endcap at the end of a retail aisle Merchandise must be visible, easy to access, and there must be a range of merchandise to choose from. Having visible merchandise is essential for retailers as consumers not only \\"buy what they see\\" but are also able to tangibly engage with the physical product. This creates an emotional connection, which can drive the customer to purchase the product. The physical positioning of the product also increases visibility. Products at eye level also get more attention. ‚ÄúEye level is buy level‚Äù. Considering these elements when merchandising gives the customer a sense of freedom of choice. \\"Less is more\\" is a key principle in visual merchandising. Although having a wide variety of stock and product options is important for consumers, it is also important not to overwhelm the consumer. Having too many choices can be confusing to consumers and that phenomenon is referred to as the ‚Äútyranny of choice‚Äù. Arranging stock so it is not overcrowded, and limiting the amount of merchandise on the shop floor, are important aspects of merchandising. Over- crowded stores can create a sense of stress and anxiety, which does not encourage the consumer to shop the entire store. A limited product selection can make the purchasing decision easier. In a study done at a high end supermarket in California by psychologist Shenne Iyengar and Mark Lepper, there were two tables of jam samples, one with 24 flavors and the other with 6 flavors. More shoppers were attracted to the booth with the larger selection, 60%, as opposed to 40% being attracted to the smaller selection, but the sales that resulted from that were surprising. Only 3% bought from the larger selection and 30% from the smaller suggestion.  Bundling  Bundling is promoting objects that work together as a set. It inspires people how to use the products in their lives and also makes complementary product suggestions. In a fashion retail store, complete outfits on a mannequin or the placement of tops beside jackets and bags by other accessories such as scarves and jewelry are an example of bundling. The store has already done work in envisioning the look the items can used to achieve. Bundling also directs attention to specific products thereby limiting the product selection presented.  Atmospherics  The atmospherics also have a large influence on the store environment. Atmospherics should all coordinate with each other to create a consistent ambience and positively influence the consumer's shopping experience and buying decision-making process. Visuals such as light and display are not always enough to enhance the overall ambience of the store, and retain customer attention; therefore, other elements such as music and scents can be used.  Light  Light can be used in many ways in retail stores, from highlighting an object or area of a store to simply illuminate the entire store. Bright light can create a sense of honesty, positivity, and can promote impulse purchasing. Lighting can also be used to highlight the store layout and urge customers to flow through the store, exposing them to more merchandise. The level of brightness in the store is a very important factor in consumer behavior and the retail environment, as rooms that have dim lighting are less arousing than more brightly lit spaces. (Areni, 1994). Lighting can influence the customer's decision making, behavior, and also the overall spatial environment as lighting and ambiance are connected. Customers become more stimulated when the lighting in the room is considered to be very bright and speeds up the pace at which customers purchase products. Markin recommended that in order to slow the pace customers shop at, the merchandiser should adopt a softer lighting technique which will increase the amount of time customers spend in the store. (Areni, 1994). The result of this is a possible increase in the amount of merchandise the stores customer's purchase. This shows us that the differing levels of in store lighting can directly affect the amount of time consumers spend in the store. (Areni, 1994). The lighting inside a retail store can be used strategically to highlight products on display or to create a comfortable environment for consumers. It is an important element used (alongside music, temperature, fragrance, and layout) in retail to create an atmosphere that matches with the brand's personality. Atmosphere of a retail store is significant as it was found that the mood of a customer will affect their buying behavior. A retailer can use soft lighting to create a calm and peaceful atmosphere for the customer or bright lighting to represent a fun and vibrant feeling associated with the brand. The strategic use of light can change the mood of a consumer and affect their subconscious mind during their shopping experience within a retail store. A retail store with a soft ambiance and bright lights highlighting certain products will drive the customer towards these products and motivate them to make a purchase.  Music  The music played within a store can promote a brand's image, and can also aid consumers into making purchase decisions. Music that suits the style of the store and the target audience is an important factor to consider. Music with a slow tempo can cause the consumer to relax; therefore, they spend more time in the store. This leads to more contact with merchandise and increased purchasing. Having music, which is popular within the target market, can also encourage consumers to linger in the store longer. For example, a store with a teenage target market should consider playing pop music, as this is a genre that a younger audience commonly enjoys. Playing this genre will make their shopping experience more enjoyable, which can result in them staying longer in the store, exposing them to more merchandise, and influencing possible purchasing decisions.  Scent  Having a unique scent in a store can differentiate the brand from others. When customers smell that scent outside of the store, this will trigger their senses and remind them of that brand and its products. Scents can also trigger emotional responses for example, * Lavender, basil, cinnamon orange‚Äì relaxing, soothing, calming, and reduces anxiety * Peppermint, thyme, rosemary, grapefruit, eucalyptus ‚Äì enterprising, stimulating, increases arousal and productivity * Ginger, chocolate, cardamom, liquorice ‚Äì romance * Vanilla ‚Äì comforting and calming * Black pepper ‚Äì sexually stimulating Distributing scents throughout the store such as vanilla, lavender, thyme, rosemary, grapefruit, and eucalyptus can be advantageous for the retailer. These scents calm, soothe, and comfort, therefore, stimulating the consumer to loiter in the store, leading to increased merchandise awareness and increased impulse purchasing.  Exterior displays  Exterior window displays can be used to sell product and entice customers into the store. An eye-catching, innovative window display can promote the brand image. It can be used to advertise. Windows can give consumers and by-passers understanding as to what goods are sold in store They are also an effective way of promoting fashion trends and providing useful information to the target audience. = Window display = Visual merchandising is a multi-sensory tool used by retailers to catch the attention of customers and attract them into a store to make a purchase. The first piece of visual merchandising customers encounter with a brand is the window display. Window displays are used as an initial attraction to bring customers into a store and are also used as a marketing tool to communicate the brand's image to the consumers as well as to distinguish itself from its competitors. The importance of the window display is that it is a touch point consumers have with the brand. By generating interest or curiosity with the window display, a brand can leave an impression on the consumer and furthermore the consumer can figure out the quality and character of the products the brand has to offer. An appealing window display can create desire of products from that brand and therefore help with generating sales. A study in Nottingham, England of the pharmacy and beauty retailer Boots, has found that products introduced in a window display increases the sales of those products and even help with increasing the sales of products which have low sales. Overall, stores who had a window display had a positive increase in sales compared to those who did not. = Colour = Colour is a powerful tool in exterior displays. It can aid creativity for exterior window displays and can have a unique effect on the consumer. The use of color can create atmosphere, grab the attention of by-passers, and attract them to the store. Different colors can trigger different emotional responses. For example, blue can trigger a calm response, green and brown can promote restfulness, warm colours such as red, orange and yellow can initiate exciting, cheerful, friendly, vibrant, simulating reactions, purple can give the impression of elegance and sophistication, while grey colours can give off a depressing, dull feel. Using colors that associate with a certain product or brand representation is also a useful technique when planning window displays. For example, using neutral colors such as green and brown when promoting environmentally friendly products is favorable, as they give off an earthy, relaxing effect; therefore, the consumer perceives those products as environmentally friendly. Colour is a significant tool used in visual merchandising. It can be used to influence the behavior of consumers and evoke different reactions. Each color can make consumers feel a different emotion, and therefore, retailers will use colors selectively to help consumers make associations about their products on display. Bright and warm colors such as red and yellow can be used to attract attention as well as excite the viewer. Cooler colors such a blue and green gives a calm and tranquil response to the viewer while purple gives the feeling of sophistication and elegance. A mixture of colors to create a contrasting background to the products on display can have a high recall rate by consumers. International retailers need to be wise on their choice of colors used in visual merchandising as colors take a different meaning in different countries. For example, red is seen as a color of luck and good fortune in many Asian countries while it represents danger and excitement in Western countries. Therefore, global retailers are not able to use one set of colors for their visual merchandising across all their stores around the world. = Graphics, photography and signage = The use of graphics and photography in window displays is an effective way of communicating information to the consumer. The most common form of communication in window displays is through text and signage, especially when advertising a sale or a special. This technique is commonly directed towards price driven customers who are constantly on the look out for bargains. Colorful, bold text and graphics are used to grasp the attention of these consumers. Signage should communicate a short, clear message, which is consistent with the brand's marketing communications model. Visually, signage should be appealing to the eye and easy to read. One effective way of using signage in windows is using a self-adhesive vinyl cutout to the window; small signs in the window can also be used to communicate the price of a good or the discount. Photography can be used in a window display to enhance the theme of window or reinforce the brand's advertising campaigns. = Lighting = Lighting is another technique, which can be used to enhance window displays. Lighting can be used to highlight certain products, and create dimension and set the mood for the window display. It is a successful tool as it can not only be used to highlight product during the day, but at night also. The brightness and colours of lighting can be adjusted to suit the mood of the display. Once again, different colours trigger different emotions and therefore create different moods. = Seasonal displays = Adjusting window displays based on seasonal events, calendar dates, and consumerism- based holidays such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Father's Day can be a useful approach to encourage consumer purchasing. Choosing products that suit the season to display in the window can remind consumers to purchase gifts and provide gift ideas for the particular holiday. = Fashion trends = Window displays can be used to set trends; therefore, window display designers must always be one step ahead of trends and predict future fashion movements. The merchandise must be able to direct these trends to the target audience, and be able to communicate them in a way so the audience is able to understand. Clothing must be styled on mannequins appropriately with popular clothing to draw consumer attention to the store. =Tools= A floor map helps visual merchandisers to find the best place for garments, according to the color stories of clothes and footwear in the shop. It is a kind of floor plan with merchandise marked. Another valuable tool is a planogram, to determine the visual look of your store's flow. Forms =POS display= =Properties= =Window displays= Window displays can communicate style, content, and price. Window displays are often used by stores to entice customers into the store. Store visual merchandisers will dress the window in current season trends - often including fully dressed mannequins as well as accessories on plinths or hanging from special display equipment. A study in 2002 (Sen et al., 2002) found that clothing retailers will have the most success enticing their customers into their store by focusing on communicating current fashion trends and styling suggesting and ensure that they have a strong store image portrayed in the window display. Sen et al.'s study was an in-depth analysis of the various factors of window displays, and its findings argue that styling and display of clothing, instead of atmospherics, play a large part in consumer behavior and purchasing. Display windows may also be used to advertise seasonal sales or inform passers-by of other current promotions. =Food merchandising= Restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, etc. use visual merchandising as a tool to differentiate themselves in a saturated market. =E-commerce= Visual merchandising techniques are increasingly used by online retailers to develop high-quality displays and page designs because products cannot be touched, measured, worn directly, or otherwise physically assessed online.

It is the usual pose for the practice of yoga nidra meditation. Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§∂‡§µ ≈öava, \\"corpse\\" and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÄsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The alternative name Mrtasana is from Sanskrit ‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ m·πõta, \\"death\\". The earliest mention of this asana is in the 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika 1.32, which states that \\"lying full length on the back like a corpse is called Shavasana. With this asana, tiredness caused by other asanas is eliminated; it also promotes calmness of the mind.\\" Description Shavasana and some sitting asanas maintain the balance between relaxation and meditation (two key components of yoga) by their equal input of physical stimuli. To perform Shavasana, lie on the back with the legs spread as wide as the yoga mat and arms relaxed to the side, and the eyes closed. The whole body is relaxed on the floor with an awareness of the chest and abdomen rising and falling with each breath. During Shavasana, all parts of the body are scanned for muscular tension of any kind. Any muscular tension the body finds is consciously released as it is found. All control of the breath, the mind, and the body is then released for the duration of the asana. Shavasana is typically practiced for 5‚Äì10 minutes at the end of an asana practice, but can be practiced for 20‚Äì30 minutes. The asana is released by slowly deepening the breath, flexing the fingers and toes, reaching the arms above the head, stretching the whole body, and exhaling while bringing the knees to the chest and rolling over to the side in a fetal position, drawing the head in the right arm. From here, one can push up into a seated position. Drowsiness or restlessness of the mind while in Shavasana may be counteracted by increasing the rate and depth of breathing. While in Shavasana, it is important to be in a neutral position. Variations Modification with knees bent for people with low back pain Shavasana can be modified by bending the knees, keeping the feet hip-width apart, to allow people with low back pain to recline comfortably. The variation can also be used by practitioners who find it hard to relax when lying flat. Effects Shavasana is intended to rejuvenate the body, mind, and spirit. In the pose, the breath deepens, and the stress of the day is released. The yogi forgets all other thoughts and surrenders any psychological effort. While in Savasana, yogis slip into blissful neutrality and reflect on the practice. Comfort is essential in the pose; the slightest point of discomfort can be endlessly distracting. Shavasana is a good way to reduce stress and tension. Yoga nidra Yoga nidra (\\"yogic sleep\\") meditation is often practiced in Shavasana.

The arrival of the permanent settlements of Europeans, under the Dutch East India Company, at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 brought them into the land of the local people, such as the Khoikhoi (called Hottentots by the Dutch), and the Bushmen (also known as the San), collectively referred to as the Khoisan. While the Dutch traded with the Khoikhoi, nevertheless serious disputes broke out over land ownership and livestock. This resulted in attacks and counter-attacks by both sides which were known as the Khoikhoi‚ÄìDutch Wars that ended in the eventual defeat of the Khoikhoi. The First Khoikhoi-Dutch War took place from 1659 ‚Äì 1660 and the second from 1673 ‚Äì 1677.Scientia Militaria, South African Journal of Military Studies, Vol 16, Nr 3, A short chronicle of warfare in South Africa, compiled by the Military Information Bureau, Page 40 First Khoikhoi-Dutch War = Beginning of the War = The arrival of the Dutch East India Company began a complicated series of relations between the Khoisan and the Dutch. The chief Hessequa Khoisan opened up trade with the Dutch, leading to economic prosperity for the Khoisan. The extended trade offers opened up the Khoisan to infiltration by the Dutch. Dutch began disrupting lands used by Khoisan for seasonal farming, forcing adaptation of the Khoisan in the form of finding new resources or rationing existing resources. The Khoikhoi nomadic people were disgruntled by the disruption of their seasonal visit to the area for which purpose they grazed their cattle at the foot of Table Mountain only to find European settlers occupying and farming the land. Their leader 'Doman' lived in the Fort de Goede Hoop at the time. One night Doman left the fort to join his clan where after he led several cattle-lifting excursions against the settlers. In 1659 the settlements farmers protested against the continual cattle theft and called an urgent council meeting with Jan van Riebeeck. The council, consisting of representatives of the Dutch East India Company and free burghers gathered to discuss the protest made by the free burgher farmers. The Company was not in favor for war and the free burghers made it clear that their only desire were to live in peace and trade with the natives, yet they could not endure any more harassment. The free burghers and the Company stated that they could not see any other way to attain peace and quietness in the area than to declare war on Doman's clan.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. = Settlements response = During the event of the council meeting, Doman and his party attacked a farm and murdered the cattle herder, a boy named Simon Janssen. News of the attack reached the fort soon thereafter and panic ensued throughout the settlement. The Khoisan clan called the Strandlopers, who lived near the Fort at the time, fled from Table Valley fearing to get caught up in the conflict. The burghers who were unable to defend themselves were evacuated to the Fort, while guards were stationed to protect the families who remained on the farms. Additional soldiers arrived by ship and guard houses were erected along the border of the settlement. Doman's clan were however difficult to apprehend. Jan van Riebeeck decided upon the following measures as a temporary measure to make safe the area; deepening the existing redoubts, build additional three watch-houses, put up a strong fence, mounted patrols along the line and Boerboel dogs on farms. The fence line became the official border of the settlement. = Khoisan Involvement = During the war, a devastating virulent sickness occurred among the cattle of the settlers causing the death of at least four out of five of some of the flocks. The settlers instituted a prayer meeting every Wednesday to pray for relief from the dire situation and for victory. Another Khoisan clan under the leadership of Oedasoa, who were also at war with Doman's clan approached the settlers and offered an alliance. The Council decided to accept Oedasoa's advice on expedition matters but not to accept any men from his clan for the purpose of conducting military operations since they felt that additional manpower were unnecessary and costly. The arrival of 105 additional European soldiers greatly strengthened the garrison at the Cape. The additional men enabled the settlers to carry out several expeditions, of which most were unsuccessful. The Council approached Harry, the leader of the Strandloper clan for assistance with regards to expeditions, who pointed out that Doman's people had placed men as sentinels on every hill. = Skirmishes = Skirmishes between the mounted patrols and Doman's people erupted on several occasions where Doman's men were defeated owing to the advantage in weapons on the side of the settlers. During a particular skirmish, Doman was wounded and his party dispersed from the area. After the conflict ended, the Strandloper clan moved back to the area near the Fort where they had lived before and a time of peace emerged. = Peace treaty = On the 6th of April 1660 Doman and his followers arrived at the Fort and concluded a treaty. Both parties agreed that neither would molest each other in future and that Doman's people would only enter the settlements territory, and remain on the designated paths as pointed out, for the purpose of trade in order to replace the stolen cattle. It was further declared that the free burghers and the Company would retain ownership of the land occupied by them and that the settlers would not treat the natives harshly for what had happened during the war, upon which all parties agreed. Second Khoikhoi-Dutch War =Beginning of the war= In 1672 the settlement dispatched explorers in search of Khoisan to trade with since they relied on trade with the Khoisan to obtain livestock for passing ships. The explorers discovered that the Chainouqua and Cochoqua clans were at war with each other. In November 1672 the governor at the Cape sent three hunters to Riebeek's Kasteel to hunt for meat when upon their arrival they were ambushed and robbed by Gonnema's gang. Gonnema, the chief of the Cochoquas, frequently plundered neighbouring Khoisan camps in the area. Gonnema was displeased because of the assistance which the settlement provided in trade with his enemies the Chainouquas. In June 1673 the governor sent another hunting party consisting of nine men with two wagons to hunt large game, the hunters went up into the mountains where they were surrounded and captured by the Cochoquas who detained them for several days and then murdered them at a place called Moordkuil.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 229 =Cochoquas attack on Saldanha Bay= Cochoquas, disguised as traders, arrived at the Company's trading post at Saldanha Bay on the 6th of July 1673 when suddenly they attacked and murdered four of the soldiers stationed there. The Chochoquas then plundered the outpost. Only one soldier managed to escape.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 230 =Settlements response= After receiving news of these attacks the counsel resolved to send soldiers in search of the Cochoquas. Ensign Hieronymus Cruse assembled and led 36 Freeburghers and 36 Company soldiers to the area of Twenty Four Rivers. Reinforcements in the form of eighteen horsemen under leadership of freeburgher officer Elbert Diemer were dispatched a few days later to assist Hieronymus Cruse in his mission. The settlements combined forces marched across the area of Twenty Four Rivers when their scouts discovered a Cochoqua kraal among the mountains on the 18th of July. By the time the forces arrived at the kraal it had been abandoned. They found property belonging to the murdered settlers inside the abandoned huts. The following day the horsemen followed the fugitives resulting in the Chochoquas fleeing into the mountains and leaving their cattle behind. Hieronymus Cruse then took possession of the cattle ordered his forces to return to the fort. When the forces stopped to set up camp for the night the Cochoquas mobilised an attack in an attempt to recover the cattle, during the skirmish one burgher was wounded and two horses killed while about twelve Cochoquas were fatally wounded. Gonnema failed to recover the livestock and the expedition forces reached the ford again on the 25th of July 1673 with eight hundred head of horned cattle and nine hundred sheep.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 231 =Dutch-Chainouqua Alliance= The Chainouquas, who were already at war with the Cochoquas, now allied with the settlers. On the 20th of August the Chainouquas with more than a hundred of their people arrived at the fort. They had captured four of Gonnema's followers and delivered them to the governor to be tried by a court. They were found guilty of participation in the murder of the burghers and were sentenced to death at the hands of the Chainouquas.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 232 The war had been suspended for some months, owing to a fatal disease which had broken out among the Khoisan people. On the 24th of March 1674 the Chainouquas reported that their spies had located Gonnema's camp at the Little Berg River at Tulbagh Kloof whereafter it was resolved to send combined forces to that location. There were fifty freeburghers under command of Wouter Moster, four hundred Chainouquas under command of captains Klaas, Koopman, Schaecher, and Kuiper, and fifty soldiers under Ensign Cruse, who was also commandant-general of the expedition. The Cochoquas anticipated and attack and fled leaving their possessions and livestock behind. The army seized eight hundred head of horned cattle and four thousand sheep. The spoils were divided among the soldiers and the Company.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 234 =1675 Cochoqua Offensive= In November 1675 Gonnema led a surprise attack at Tigerberg where the Chainouquas kept their cattle during which several of the herders were killed and a large portion of their cattle were taken. During the skirmish fifteen Cochoquas were killed. By the time reinforcements from the settlement arrived Gonnema had already escaped into the mountains.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 239 =1676 Dutch-Chainouqua Offensive= In 1676 the council dispatched a military expedition under the command of Lieutenant Cruse, in search of the Cochoquas, consisting of fifty foot-soldiers, twenty-three horsemen, fifty burghers and a large band of Chainouquas. They were unable to track down the Cochoquas location. It was then decided to send a spy named Jacob to locate Gonnema, the spy returned with news that the Cochoquas were at war with other Khoisan clans named the Namaquas and the Chariguriquas. Another force were dispatched under guidance of the spy Jacob to Saldanha Bay where they found and killed several of Gonnema's followers. They seized one hundred and sixty- five head of horned cattle and thirty sheep which was taken by the Chainouquas as spoils of war.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 247 =1677 Peace Treaty= On the 8th of June 1677 Cochoqua messengers arrived at the Castel of Good Hope to initiate peace negotiations of which the council were in favour. On the 24th of June a delegation of high ranking Cochoquas arrived at the Castle with nine head of cattle to negotiate for peace. The following terms were agreed upon; trade relations between the Cochoqua and the Dutch East India Company would be restored and the Cochoquas would deliver as tribute thirty head of cattle yearly to the return fleet of the Company. Furthermore, the Cochoquas would instruct their people to refrain from stealing livestock from the settlers and their allies and severely punish those who commit such a crime. The Cochoquas vowed not to wage war against any of the Companies allies.History of South Africa, 1486 ‚Äì 1691, G.M Theal, London 1888. Page 248 Conclusion Some modern scholars have observed that superior war-making ability was not the only means whereby the Dutch forced the Khoikhoi to submit and concluded that: The disappearance of these people from the land can be attributed to the conflicts of the Khoikhoi Dutch Wars and the political and legal aftermath in the resulting areas. The hunter- gatherer lifestyle associated with the Khoisan faced new barriers from legal changes around activities necessary to maintain a hunter gatherer society. Additional contributions to the disintegration of the Khoisan ethnicity revolve around the loose structure of the Khoisan society. The relative lack of a strong, Khoisan social structure created an environment in which Khoisan people were ready to acculturate to the Dutch and Bantu speaking intruders given the collapse of the existing Khoisan social structure or disruption of the existing lands being used for survival by the Khoisan. Khoisan people were spread all throughout the southern portion of Africa as seen in Map 1. The portions of land seen in Map 1 were commonly shared with the Bantu people, but the alignment of the Bantu with Dutch goals contributed to the downfall of Khoisan political influence in Southern Africa. The loss of Khoisan political influence has also led to the decline in the commonality of the Khoisan language. Khoisan pottery was one of the few expressions of Khoisan language and most remnants of this style of pottery have been wiped out. The final conclusion of the Khoikhoi-Dutch wars is that the Khoisan people along with their culture was completely wiped out in a complex struggle balancing potential prosperity with cultural identity. The complexity of the disappearance of the Khoisan from influence in Southern Africa is often seen as the Khoisan trading away their influence for livestock. The truth is the resistance of the Khoisan was a response and reaction to the disposition of the Boers. The downfall of the Khoisan came at the hands of violence that is often overlooked when considering the ethnic identities that vanished from the African continent in the 17th and 18th centuries.

In pigs, nose rings are alternatively pierced through the rim of the nose. Nose rings are often required for bulls when exhibited at agricultural shows. There is a clip-on ring design used for controlling and directing cattle for handling. Nose rings are used to encourage the weaning of young calves by discouraging them from suckling. History The Standard of Ur Historically, the use of nose rings for controlling animals dates to the dawn of recorded human civilization. They were used in ancient Sumer and are seen on the Standard of Ur, where they were used on both bovines and equines.Calvin W. Schwabe, 'Cattle, Priests and Medicine', Vol.4, at p. 16 (U. of Minn. 1978), There are theories that the rod-and-ring symbol are a shepherd's crook and a nose rope.Hallo, W.W. 2005.

Sefati et al (eds), ‚ÄòAn Experienced Scribe who Neglects Nothing‚Äô: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Honor of Jacob Klein. Bethesda, MD: CDL Press, 142-62. Use The nose ring assists the handler to control a dangerous animal with minimal risk of injury or disruption by exerting stress on one of the most sensitive parts of the animal, the nose. Bulls, especially, are powerful and sometimes unpredictable animals which, if uncontrolled, can kill or severely injure a human handler.Dairy Care Practices: Animal Care Series, Dairy Workgroup University of California Cooperative Extension (2008) A nose ring is used to maintain control of this bull being exhibited at a livestock show. Control of the bull may be done by holding the ring by hand, looping a piece of rope through it, clipping on a bull staff. A rope or chain from the ring may be attached to a bull's horns or to a head-collar for additional control. With an aggressive bull, a short length of chain or rope may be left hanging loose from the ring, so when he ducks in a threatening manner, the bull will step on the chain and be deterred from attacking.Miller, William C., & Robertson, Major E D S, Practical Animal Husbandry Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, 7th ed, 1959: p 16 This lead may also facilitate capture and control of a frisky bull. Construction and insertion Bull rings are usually about in diameter, depending on the size of the bull. Bull rings are commonly made from aluminium, stainless steel or copper, in the form of a pair of hinged semicircles, held closed by a small brass bolt whose head is broken off during installation. If a ring needs to be removed (for example, if the bull has grown out of it), it is cut or unscrewed. The ring is normally placed on the bull between 9 and 12 months of age.Dairy Care Practices: Animal Care Series, Dairy Workgroup University of California Cooperative Extension It is usually done by a veterinarian, who pierces the septum with a scalpel or punch. Self-piercing rings (with sharp ends designed to be pressed through the septum and then pulled together with a screw) have been available for many years; these are also usually installed by a veterinarian rather than the owner.C. Dalton, Noseringing a Bull Other designs =Calf-weaning ring= Calf-weaning nose rings or nosebands provide an alternative to separating calves from their mothers during the weaning period. They have plastic spikes which are uncomfortable for the mother, causing her to reject the calf's efforts at suckling. Weaning nose rings are also available for sheep and goats. These nose rings (usually made of plastic) clip onto the nose without piercing it, and are reusable. A spiked ring which prevents suckling =Bulldogs= Self-locking or spring-closing show-lead nose rings, also called \\"bulldogs\\" or nose grips, are removable rings that do not require the nose to be pierced. They are often used on steers and cows, along with a halter, at agricultural shows, or when handling cattle for examination, marking or treatment. They stay shut until released, and usually have a loop for the attachment of a cord or lead rope. They give similar control to a bull ring without the need for permanent attachment. Show-lead nose ring (bulldogs), and bull tongs or bull-holders on the right =Bull tongs= Bull- holders, also known as bull-tongs, have a pliers action and are used for short periods on grown cattle when they are being mouthed or drenched. A chain, rope or strap keeps the grips closed and may be passed over a bar at the front of a head bail to elevate the head. The thumb and forefinger may also used in this way on smaller animals. Pig nose rings Nose rings on a young pig foraging on the New Forest Rooting is the act of a pig nudging into something with its snout, such as into the dirt to unearth plants to eat. In some circumstances, owners of pigs may find this undesirable. Nose rings make rooting painful for the animal, although a ringed pig may still able to forage freely through leaf litter and surface vegetation. Pig nose-ringing may sometimes be required by local regulations, as when farm pigs are released into public woods to pannage (such as on the New Forest in southern England). Nose rings specifically designed for pigs usually consist of open copper or steel wire rings with sharp ends, about one inch (about 2.5 cm) in diameter. These are typically clipped to the rim of the nose instead of through the septum, as this is far more painful to the pig and is considered \\"thus more effective for deterring the pig from rooting than piercing through the septum is\\". As they may sometimes become dislodged, an adult pig may be given three to four rings. Bull handling in the show ring For safety reasons, many show societies require bulls over 12 months to be led with a nose ring. A bull may be led by a rope tied through the ring, although a halter (headcollar) is usually also used so as not to rely unduly on the nose ring for control. If the bull has horns, the lead rope may also be fastened around those and then passed down through the nose ring. Some shows require other cattle to be led with nose grips (bulldogs). Several methods exist for handling a bull with a ring installed. One method of leading a bull is to have one person on either side of the bull with both halter lead ropes through the ring, which prevents the bull from gaining pace and also from running into the handlers.Land Newspaper, Rural Press, Richmond, 20 March 2008 - p. 68 Another practice is for one handler to use a rope and the other a bull-staff attached to the ring.Bucks County Agricultural Health and Safety PolicyBridgend County Show Health and Safety Policy Charolais & Murray Grey bulls on parade with nose rings and a show lead ring, Australia Bull handling on the farm or ranch It is estimated that 42% of all livestock-related human fatalities are a result of bull attacks, and only about one in twenty victims of a bull attack survives. Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the United States.Larry D. Jacobson, Extension Agricultural Engineer, Safe Work Practices on Dairy Farms, University of Minnesota Extension Services (1989) (\\"During the last 10 years, 12 farmers in Minnesota were mauled and gored to death by dairy bulls\\").Cumberland County (Pa.) Sentinel, Shippensburg, Pa., February 12, 2008 A farmer in Southampton County, Michigan, was killed by a 2000 pound Holstein bull in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in February, 2008, prompting comments from experts ranging from \\"never trust a bull\\" to \\"always take a dog with you\\" when handling a bull.The Reading (Pennsylvania]Eagle), March 1, 2010 On February 28, 2010, a farmer near Reading, Pennsylvania was trampled and gored to death by a 2000 lb. black Angus bull that he had been urged to get rid of by friends after earlier mishaps. Michelle Park, \\"Bull attacks, kills owner at South Heidelberg Township farm\\". Most cattle breeders recognize the importance of looking after expensive bulls that are expected to improve herds and profits. Nonetheless, the dangers of bull handling, particularly from dairy bulls in close quarters, are regularly proven by the obituaries.See C. Parsons, Students Mourn Teacher: FFA Advisor Killed by Bull, 81 Capital Press, No.38, page 1 (Sept. 19, 2008) (veteran agricultural instructor killed by a dairy bull after warning others not to enter pen) Good bull management and safety practices require caution in handling beef and dairy bulls, and use of the nose ring and chain is a recommended precaution for modern farmers.Kerri Ebert and Michael Dennis, Pa. Ag. Extension Service, Cattle Safety, National Ag Safety Database, 2001B. Grove & A. Mills, Bulls on the Dairy Farm, Kansas State University, Oct. 4, 2002 However, in many regions, particularly in the beef industry, bulls do not have nose rings unless they are to be exhibited and they are generally driven about as other cattle would be.W A Beattie, Beef Cattle Breeding and Management, Popular Books, 1990 Cows with young calves can be particularly dangerous if protecting their young, and cattle in general, including calves, steers and bullocks, do cause many serious human injuries and deaths.Serious Cattle-lnflicted InjuriesGrandin.com. Injuries are caused by a steer or cow Generally the use of both a ring and a halter, and management of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring.An example of a bull staff A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding.The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), at p. 103 Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehavesV G Cole, Beef Production Guide, Livestock & Grain Producers Association of NSW, 1978 many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: > Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. But a ring in his nose > is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. A bull staff is a pole > with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. Leading a bull with a > staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer > to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in > the ring lets him run over you at will.C.E. Spaulding, D.V.M. & Jackie Clay, > Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners, Rodale Press, Inc., Emmaus, Pa. (2d ed. > 1998), p. 27. Most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one, if not several, bulls for breeding purposes.U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Yearbook 1922, Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. (1922), pp. 325-28 (noting a national on-farm bull population of over 600,000 \\"scrub\\" bulls in addition to a multi-year supply of \\"pure bred\\" bulls)O.C. Gregg, Ed., Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual No. 15, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902), pp.129-32 (recommending the keeping and testing of sires for dairy herd improvement). The handling of an aggressive, powerful animal was a practical issue with life-threatening consequences for the farmer. The need to move the bull in and out of his pen to cover cows exposed the farmer to serious jeopardy of life and limb.Alvin H. Clement, We Gotta Have More Jails, The Writer's Club Press, New York (1984-87), at pp. 79-80. A humorous description of moving a cow to a neighbor's Jersey bull for breeding purposes, and the use of a 12-foot bull staff to get the loose-running bull under control after he had already spotted the cow Being trampled, jammed against a wall or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry prior to 1940.O.C. Gregg, Ed., Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual No. 15, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902), at p. 125; The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), p. 103 As suggested in one popular farming magazine, \\"Handle [the bull] with a staff and take no chances. The gentle bull, not the vicious one, most often kills or maims his keeper.\\" Helpful Information for Dairymen, The Farmer Webb Publishing Co., St. Paul, Minnesota, Mar. 12, 1927, p. 6 Bulls respond well to a good handler When allowed outside his pen, the bull typically was kept in a halter connected by a strap snapped into the ring in his nose for ease of control.O.C. Gregg, Ed., Minnesota Farmer's Institute Annual 15, p. 126, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1902) In the bull pen, the use of a ring connected by a cable to a fixed point was recommended as a means of controlling and securing the bull while allowing a degree of movement by the subject bull.The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1930), p. 114 If the pen was strong enough, the bull could be turned loose, and if needed, placed in a stanchion.The James Way, The James Manufacturing Co., Ft. Atkinson, Wisc. (1914), p. 103 Farmers who lacked an assistant, or a bull staff, had no choice but to adopt other means. Some farmers elected to move their bulls by tying a rope to the ring and tying the other end of the rope to a farm tractor, providing both motive power and a degree of protection from the angry bull.Sara De Luca, Dancing the Cows Home: A Wisconsin Girlhood, Minn. Hist. Soc. Press, St. Paul, Minn. (1996) pp.99-100 (moving a heifer with a tractor) The efficacy of this technique is doubtful, and may depend on the size of the tractor and of the bull; one authority has \\"seen a bull lift the front end of a tractor like a toy\\". Others used dogs and horses. Not all farmers could afford specially designed and manufactured bull handling products, which were not readily available until the 1980s. The experimental improvisation of techniques for bull handling, as in many aspects of family farming, was a common practice.M. Cotter & B. Jackson, Voices of America: Growing Up on a Minnesota Farm, Arcadia Publishing Co., Chicago, Ill. (2001), pp. 23-24 (driving a 1500 pound Hereford bull named \\"Domino\\" by repeatedly firing a shotgun loaded with birdshot into its rear end)C.E.

Since then it has been called the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI). Publications The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JACI), published monthly, is the official scientific journal of the AAAAI. It is the most-cited journal in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. In January, 2013, the AAAAI launched The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, a publication aimed at the practicing clinician treating allergies, asthma and immunologic disorders. The organization also publishes educational materials for patients and consumers. National Allergy Bureau The National Allergy Bureau (NAB) is an AAAAI- certified pollen and outdoor mold spore counting network. The NAB issues pollen and mold reports three times a week and provides information on common seasonal outdoor allergy triggers. The NAB is part of the AAAAI's Aeroallergen Network, and consists of pollen and spore counting stations staffed primarily by AAAAI member volunteers. They provide pollen and mold counts from approximately 80 counting stations throughout the United States, two counting stations in Canada, and two in Argentina. Annual meeting Each year, academic and clinical leaders attend the AAAAI Annual Meeting, which showcases new research and discuss other developments in the areas of allergy, asthma and immunology.

Vail mansion in Morristown, New Jersey (1916), now the Morristown Town Hall. Bosworth was also responsible to a large degree for the architectural expression of Kykuit, the famous Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills, New York, working closely with the architects William Adams Delano and Chester H. Aldrich and the interior designer, Ogden Codman.Mark Jarzombek, Designing MIT: Bosworth‚Äôs New Tech Northeastern University Press, 2004.Great Houses of the Hudson River, Michael Middleton Dwyer, editor, with preface by Mark Rockefeller, Boston, MA: Little, Brown and Company, published in association with Historic Hudson Valley, 2001. . Bosworth is not as well known in the United States as other Beaux-Arts architects of that time, because his career, under the auspices of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., led him to France in the 1920s, where he was put in charge of the restoration of the Palace of Versailles and Notre-Dame de Reims, projects Rockefeller was interested in and that he financed. In time, Bosworth was awarded the French Legion of Honor and the French Cross of the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, one of the few Americans ever to receive such honors. In 1918, Bosworth was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1928.http://www.nationalacademy.org/academy/national-academicians/ Early life Bosworth was born in 1868 in Marietta, Ohio, and received his architectural training at MIT, one of the leading Beaux-Arts oriented schools in the United States at the time. In 1896, Bosworth left for Paris to study at the famous √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Attending the √âcole was a must for anyone who wanted to make a name for himself in the United States, especially during the years following the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Richard Morris Hunt, H. H. Richardson before him as well as Ernest Flagg, Charles McKim, John Merven Carr√®re, and John Russell Pope, had all studied in Paris. Upon his return to the United States in 1900, Bosworth worked for the firm Carr√®re and Hastings, which had recently won the competition for the design of the New York Public Library, their most significant and best-known project. Major commissions Bosworth designed the new campus for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology including Building 10 and the Great Dome In 1906, Bosworth was called in to design a garden for the prominent philanthropist, the New Yorker Valentine Everit Macy, who lived at Scarborough-on-Hudson. This led to Bosworth‚Äôs acquaintance with Frank Vanderlip (1864‚Äì1937), president of the City Bank of New York, and former assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President William McKinley. Bosworth designed for Vanderlip a gate for his family estate north of Tarrytown, New York. He also designed a schoolhouse not far from Vanderlip‚Äôs estate, the Scarborough School, which is still extant. At about the same time, Vanderlip was appointed to the board of Letchworth Village, an institution for epileptics and the mentally ill founded in 1907. Vanderlip called in Bosworth to lay out the village with its various schools and residences. It is located across the Hudson from Scarborough on a hill not far from the current town of West Haverstraw. For the Rockefellers, he designed Kykuit, transforming a barren treeless site into a lush and spectacular garden. In 1912, Theodore Newton Vail (1845‚Äì1920) gave Bosworth his largest and most visible commission yet: the corporate headquarters of AT&T; Corporation, located on a prestigious site in downtown New York City at 195 Broadway, just a few blocks from Wall Street. It was a modern steel structure clad top to bottom in a Greek-styled exterior, the three-story-high Ionic columns of Vermont granite forming eight registers over a Doric base. In 1913, Bosworth received the commission to design the new campus for MIT in Cambridge, MIT having outgrown its old buildings near Copley Square in Boston. The plan featured a large paved court (now called Killian Court) that is now, however, planted with grass and trees, at the head of which was a domed structure modeled on the Pantheon in Rome in the manner of the Altes Museum in Berlin. It was at the time the largest non-governmental building in the US. Although some of Bosworth's subsequent American commissions were office buildings, like the Ocean Cable Office Building (1916) (since demolished), most were houses, estates, and townhouses. This included houses for William Barclay Parsons (at 121 East 65th Street) and Philip Gossler (at 14 East 65th Street) in New York. In the Locust Valley area of Long Island, commissions included 'Mallow' (1920), a mansion for Walter Farwell which now houses the East Woods School, and house alterations and a garden for Charles A. Stone. Vail, who was a great admirer of Italian art and had traveled extensively through Italy, asked Bosworth in 1916 to design his home in Morristown, New Jersey. Bosworth also designed extensive gardens for the house of Samuel Untermyer, a famous lawyer, in Yonkers, New York. In 1925, he designed the unbuilt Egyptian Museum for Cairo. In 1921, Bosworth built his own house on Long Island next to that of Stone. Bosworth‚Äôs U.S. career, promising as it was, came to an end when John D. Rockefeller Jr., traveling in France in 1922, and appalled at the dire condition of French monuments, set up a fund in 1924 to pay for the restoration of the Palace of Versailles and the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. Bosworth was put in charge of the project. He also took over the restoration of the Notre-Dame de Reims, and in 1935, he founded the University Club of Paris. In 1934, he supervised the restoration of Queen Marie Antoinette‚Äôs Trianon cottage near Versailles. Although Rockefeller's project ended in 1936, Bosworth remained in his adopted country in semi- retirement, building a house for himself and his family, Villa Marietta, in Vaucresson (1935‚Äì1936). During WWII, Bosworth was chairman of the Paris committee of the American Volunteer Ambulance Corps. In 1945, he was named associate member of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1949, he headed a fund drive for restoration of Vimoutiers in Normandy, which had been destroyed by error in a World War II bombing raid. These efforts earned him considerable recognition in France. See also *Rockefeller family References Notes Bibliography *Chafee, Richard. The Architecture of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts.

It is primarily known for catalyzing the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, the first step in polyol pathway of glucose metabolism. Reactions Aldose reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent conversion of glucose to sorbitol, the first step in polyol pathway of glucose metabolism. The second and last step in the pathway is catalyzed by sorbitol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the NAD-linked oxidation of sorbitol to fructose. Thus, the polyol pathway results in conversion of glucose to fructose with stoichiometric utilization of NADPH and production of NADH. ;glucose + NADPH + H+ \\\\rightleftharpoons sorbitol + NADP+ Galactose is also a substrate for the polyol pathway, but the corresponding keto sugar is not produced because sorbitol dehydrogenase is incapable of oxidizing galactitol. Nevertheless, aldose reductase can catalyze the reduction of galactose to galactitol ;galactose + NADPH + H+ \\\\rightleftharpoons galactitol + NADP+ Polyol pathway scheme depicting both the NADPH-dependent reduction step catalyzed by aldose reductase and the NAD+-induced oxidation catalyzed by sorbitol dehydrogenase Function The aldose reductase reaction, in particular the sorbitol produced, is important for the function of various organs in the body. For example, it is generally used as the first step in a synthesis of fructose from glucose; the second step is the oxidation of sorbitol to fructose catalyzed by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The main pathway from glucose to fructose (glycolysis) involves phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate, followed by isomerization to fructose 6-phosphate and hydrolysis of the phosphate, but the sorbitol pathway is useful because it does not require the input of energy in the form of ATP: *Seminal vesicles: Fructose produced from sorbitol is used by the sperm cells. *Liver: Fructose produced from sorbitol can be used as an energy source for glycolysis and glyconeogenesis. Aldose reductase is also present in the lens, retina, Schwann cells of peripheral nerves, placenta and red blood cells. In Drosophila, CG6084 encoded a highly conserved protein of human Aldo-keto reductase 1B. dAKR1B in hemocytes, is necessary and sufficient for the increasement of plasma sugar alcohols after gut infection. Increased sorbitol subsequently activated Metalloprotease 2, which cleaves PGRP-LC to activate systemic immune response in fat bodies. Thus, aldose reductase provides a critical metabolic checkpoint in the global inflammatory response. Enzyme structure Aldose reductase may be considered a prototypical enzyme of the aldo-keto reductase enzyme superfamily. The enzyme comprises 315 amino acid residues and folds into a Œ≤/Œ±-barrel structural motif composed of eight parallel Œ≤ strands. Adjacent strands are connected by eight peripheral Œ±-helical segments running anti-parallel to the Œ≤ sheet. The catalytic active site situated in the barrel core. The NADPH cofactor is situated at the top of the Œ≤/Œ± barrel, with the nicotinamide ring projects down in the center of the barrel and pyrophosphate straddling the barrel lip. Mechanism of NADPH- dependent conversion of glucose to sorbitol. Note the hydride transfer from NADPH to the carbonyl carbon of the aldose. Depiction of NADPH in extended confirmation and hydrogen bonded to the residues physically near the active site of the enzyme. Role of aldehyde reductase (shown in yellow box) in norepinephrine degradation, contributing in the creation of MHPG, a minor catecholamine metabolite.Figure 11-4 in: Role of aldehyde dehydrogenase (shown in red box) in norepinephrine. Enzyme mechanism The reaction mechanism of aldose reductase in the direction of aldehyde reduction follows a sequential ordered path where NADPH binds, followed by the substrate. Binding of NADPH induces a conformational change (Enzyme‚Ä¢NADPH ‚Üí Enzyme*‚Ä¢NADPH) that involves hinge-like movement of a surface loop (residues 213-217) so as to cover a portion of the NADPH in a manner similar to that of a safety belt. The alcohol product is formed via a transfer of the pro-R hydride of NADPH to the re face of the substrate's carbonyl carbon. Following release of the alcohol product, another conformational change occurs (E*‚Ä¢NADP+ ‚Üí E‚Ä¢NADP+) in order to release NADP+. Kinetic studies have shown that reorientation of this loop to permit release of NADP+ appears to represent the rate-limiting step in the direction of aldehyde reduction. As the rate of coenzyme release limits the catalytic rate, it can be seen that perturbation of interactions that stabilize coenzyme binding can have dramatic effects on the maximum velocity (Vmax). The hydride that is transferred from NADP+ to glucose comes from C-4 of the nicotinamide ring at the base of the hydrophobic cavity. Thus, the position of this carbon defines the enzyme's active site. There exist three residues in the enzyme within a suitable distance of the C-4 that could be potential proton donors: Tyr-48, His-110 and Cys-298. Evolutionary, thermodynamic and molecular modeling evidence predicted Tyr-48 as the proton donor. This prediction was confirmed the results of mutagenesis studies. Thus, a [hydrogen-bonding] interaction between the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-48 and the ammonium side chain of Lys-77 is thought to help to facilitate hydride transfer. Role in diabetes Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a leading cause of new cases of blindness, and is associated with increased risk for painful neuropathy, heart disease and kidney failure. Many theories have been advanced to explain mechanisms leading to diabetic complications, including stimulation of glucose metabolism by the polyol pathway. Additionally, the enzyme is located in the eye (cornea, retina, lens), kidney, and the myelin sheath‚Äìtissues that are often involved in diabetic complications. Under normal glycemic conditions, only a small fraction of glucose is metabolized through the polyol pathway, as the majority is phosphorylated by hexokinase, and the resulting product, glucose-6-phosphate, is utilized as a substrate for glycolysis or pentose phosphate metabolism. However, in response to the chronic hyperglycemia found in diabetics, glucose flux through the polyol pathway is significantly increased. Up to 33% of total glucose utilization in some tissues can be through the polyol pathway. Glucose concentrations are often elevated in diabetics and aldose reductase has long been believed to be responsible for diabetic complications involving a number of organs. Many aldose reductase inhibitors have been developed as drug candidates but virtually all have failed although some such as epalrestat are commercially available in several countries. Additional reductase inhibitors such as ranirestat, ponalrestat, rinalrestat, risarestat, sorbinil, and berberine are currently in clinical trials.

Orginally there were two separate societies of Serjeants-at-law: the Fleet Street inn dated from 1443 and the Chancery Lane inn dated from 1416. In 1730, the Fleet Street lease was not renewed and the two societies merged. The society's relevance diminished as Serjeants-at-Law were gradually superseded by Queen's Counsel in the nineteenth century. The building in Chancery Lane was sold in 1877 and the assets were distributed amongst the surviving members, although the society was not formally dissolved. The last member, Lord Lindley, died in 1921. (A. M. Sullivan, who died in 1959, was appointed to the equivalent Irish office in 1912, when the English society had effectively dissolved.) Both the Fleet Street and Chancery Lane buildings were destroyed in the 1941 bombing raids during World War II. Fleet Street site today The Amicable Society offices at 50 Fleet Street in 1801 The lease of the site of the former Serjeants' Inn on Fleet Street was taken on in 1737 by the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, the first life insurance company in the world, who raised a new building on the site in 1792‚Äì93, designed by Robert Adam. The site was redeveloped after the destruction of this building in the Second World War, but retained its name and a physical connection with the Inns of Court, since the modern buildings, although commercially occupied, stand around a small courtyard used for parking which connects to the Inner Temple through an archway which allows pedestrian access. That site is now, therefore, effectively part of the precincts of the Inner Temple and the wider legal area of the Temple. Moreover, in 2001 the Inner Temple acquired the freehold from its former commercial occupiers. The Inner Temple announced its intention to use the space for barristers' chambers, like those in the Inner Temple itself. However, in March 2008 it informed its members that both refurbishment and rebuilding for this purpose had proved to be financially unviable, and that it had therefore granted a long lease for hotel premises at 1‚Äì2 Serjeants' Inn to recover its acquisition costs. The Apex Temple Court Hotel opened in March 2012. No. 3 Serjeant's Inn has been a barristers' chambers, occupying commercial premises, since 1986.

After his death and on his instructions, Margaret Emerson Vanderbilt passed it to her son Alfred G. Vanderbilt, Jr. for his twenty-first birthday. As a member of New York's wealthy Vanderbilt family, Alfred would become the owner and president of Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course. He also became President of Belmont Park. As well, he served at various times as head of the New York Racing Association and the United States Jockey Club. In 1938, Vanderbilt staged the famous match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral at Pimlico. In 1941, Vanderbilt teamed up with Walter P. Chrysler Jr. and other investors to acquire for breeding services the 1935 English Triple Crown winner Bahram from the Aga Khan III. Bahram stood at stud at Sagamore Farm then was sent to Chrysler's North Wales Stud in Warrenton, Virginia. In 1966, Vanderbilt was part of another syndicate that bought Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Kauai King who would also stand at stud at Sagamore Farm. The Vanderbilt/Sagamore Farm best known racehorses were Discovery, Bed o'Roses, and Native Dancer, all of whom were inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Native Dancer is considered one of the greatest race horses of all time. Vanderbilt sold the farm to developer James Ward in 1986.

Although freight transport is the focus of a large proportion of its activities, the airport is increasingly used for passenger flights, mainly charter and holiday flights organised by tour operators. It is also often used for private business flights. History Main building During the Second World War, the Luftwaffe moved the airfield of Ostend-Stene to a site in the territory of the municipality of Middelkerke, five kilometres southwest of Ostend. It played a major role in the air battle with Britain. After the war, the airport of Raversijde-Middelkerke was turned into an international airport by the Department of Airways which had been established by that time. In 1992, the ownership of the regional Flemish airport was transferred from the Belgian State to the Flemish Region. The airport was given a new name: \\"Ostend‚ÄìBruges International Airport\\". On 23 May 2003, Mr. Gino Vanspauwen was appointed CEO/Managing Director of Ostend‚ÄìBruges International Airport by the Flemish government. He effectively took up his duties on 1 June 2003. The airport was operated by the Department of Mobility and Public Works of the Flemish government. The Flemish Government made an agreement with Egis Group to operate it starting 2014 for a duration of 25 years. Between May and December 2003, Ryanair operated a route between Ostend and London-Stansted. For 2015, Jetairfly began service to a number of new destinations from Ostend.

Project cancellation may result from cost overruns, schedule overruns, changes in budget, change or obviation of the goal of the project, political factors, or any combination of these and other factors. Contracts often stipulate the time and manner in which a project may be cancelled. Contracted projects typically have a specified end date, at which point the contract may or may not be renewed; non-renewal often has the same effect as cancellation, but carries different legal ramifications. In software development Cancellation occurs for around half of U.S. software development projects, whether developed for in-house corporate use or for sale as retail software. When a project is cancelled early on, it probably has little financial effect, but if project sponsors wait until the project has gone over budget, it can be very expensive. Software engineers and business analysts have studied the reasons for project cancellation. Most are due to poor planning or the lack of planning. The biggest worry and most troublesome concern for managers is the waste of resources that occurs when projects are cancelled. Some project cancellations are widely reported and acknowledged in the media ‚Äì the most notorious example in 2005 being the failed $170 million FBI project to update their case management system. Since no one wants to admit failure, especially public companies, the vast majority of internal corporate project cancellations are performed quietly and are not as widely reported as the FBI case. However, it is generally understood by most business people that cancellations do occur regularly in their organizations. A related topic is deciding when to cancel a project. Early identification and action will permit project resources to be re-deployed to other projects. Based on the number of projects that a company is pursuing at any given time, the total value of cancelled projects could be as much as 10% of the total annual IT development budget.

It is now officially known as the \\"Kirk of St Nicholas Uniting\\" as it has membership of both of the Church of Scotland and the United Reformed Church. It is also known as \\"The Mither Kirk\\" (mother church) of the city. The church has a dark mahogany interior. History The earliest mention of a church on the site of the present Kirk can be found in a Papal document of 1151.Historical Walkabout of Aberdeen Given Aberdeen's proximity to the sea, St Nicholas was chosen as the patron saint of Aberdeen, as a miracle attributed to him was the rescue of some sailors in a storm. The Kirk was enlarged in the 15th century. St Nicholas and St Mary's, Dundee, were probably the largest parish churches in medieval Scotland. This work was dedicated by Bishop Elphinstone in 1498. The 500th anniversary of the dedication of the enlarged church was marked with the installation of a special stained glass window at the main entrance to the Kirk, overlooking Drum‚Äôs Aisle. The church contains the Drum Aisle (the ancient burial-place of the Irvines of Drum Castle) and the Collison Aisle, which divide the two congregations and which formed the transepts of the 12th- century church of St Nicholas (architectural detail survives from this period). The West Church was built between 1751 and 1755, to plans given to the burgh by James Gibbs, in the Italian style, on the site of the medieval nave, the East in 1834 in Gothic-revival style on the site of the choir. In 1874 a fire destroyed the East Church and the old central tower with its lead- clad timber spire and its fine peal of nine bells, one of which, Laurence or \\"Lowrie\\", was 4 ft (1.2 m) in diameter at the mouth, 3.5 ft (1.1 m) high and very thick. The church was rebuilt and a massive granite tower erected over the intervening aisles, a new carillon of 36 bells, cast in Belgium, being installed to commemorate the Victorian jubilee of 1887. Because the tuning of these bells by van Aerschot was not so good, the bells were replaced in 1950 with 48 bells made by Gillett & Johnston, it is now one of the largest carillons in the UK. The building includes two sanctuaries under one roof (though only one is now used). Following considerable decay, the old nave collapsed in approximately 1742. A rebuilt church ‚Äì known as the West Kirk ‚Äì was built in 1755, by James Gibbs. This is still used for regular worship. The other section ‚Äì the East Kirk ‚Äì though it was still complete and retained a wooden medieval roof similar to that which survives at King's College Chapel, Old Aberdeen, was rebuilt in 1837, by Archibald Simpson, and had to be again rebuilt following a fire in 1874. Extensive renovation and archeological work is currently taking place in the East Kirk. The foundations of earlier phases of the kirk, many medieval burials, and large numbers of architectural fragments are among the rich finds from this important site. Despite the many alterations to the fabric of the Kirk over the year's, St Nicholas retains a larger number of medieval effigies than any other Scottish parish church, though none of these are in their original positions. The Vault or Chapel of Our Lady of Pity survives under the east end of the Kirk. It has been refaced externally, but retains its medieval vaults within. A number of pieces of late medieval and 17th century woodwork are preserved in this vault. The present minister is the Rev Stephen Taylor. Churchyard The southern boundary of the churchyard to the Kirk of St Nicholas, Union Street, Aberdeen The graveyard surrounds the church on three sides: north, south and west. It is extremely crowded on the west and south sides. It has a high proportion of table stones. It does not follow the standard Scottish pattern of stones generally facing east, and can best be described as disorganised. Close to the church on its south side a number of ground slabs now form part of paving, and (rather disrespectfully) are also used for car parking, a feature generally unseen in Scotland. Monuments date from the mid 17th century. The boundary onto Union Street was rebuilt as a very formal Georgian colonnade in the 19th century.

It shows individual zones in the Gulf of Mexico region; within a zone the risk is for insurance considered to be equal. CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluation and Standardizing Target Accumulations) was founded as a joint project of Swiss Reinsurance Company, Gerling-Konzern Globale Reinsurance Company, and Munich Reinsurance Company. CRESTA has set itself the aim of establishing a globally uniform system for the accumulation risk control of natural hazards - particularly earthquakes, storms and floods. Those risk zones are essentially based on the observed and expected seismic activity, as well as on other natural disasters, such as droughts, floods and storms. CRESTA zones regard the distribution of insured values within a region or country for easier assessment of risks. CRESTA Zones are the essential basis for reinsurance negotiation and portfolio analysis. Nowadays, CRESTA sets widely accepted standards which apply throughout the international insurance industry. CRESTA zone information is used by most insurers for assessing the insurance catastrophe premiums they will charge. Origin of the name While the acronym CRESTA stands for Catastrophe Risk Evaluation and Standardizing Target Accumulations, the name was derived from the name of the hotel (Cresta Hotel) where the founding meeting occurred, and the subsequent creation of a suitable acronym to correspond to the name. About CRESTA Overview of the worldwide CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and Standardizing Target Accumulations)coverage. CRESTA has set itself the aim of establishing a globally uniform system for the accumulation risk control of natural hazards - particularly earthquakes, storms and floods. Nowadays, widely accepted standards apply throughout the international insurance industry. CRESTA's main tasks are: * Determining country-specific zones for the uniform and detailed reporting of accumulation risk data relating to natural hazards and creating corresponding zonal maps for each country. * Drawing up standardised accumulation risk-recording forms for each country. * Working out a uniform format for the processing and electronic transfer of accumulation risk data between insurance and reinsurance companies. In addition, CRESTA also undertakes the following activities: * Collating relevant scientific and insurance-related data dealing with insurance and natural phenomena in a written record. * Collecting summaries of information dealing with natural phenomena for each country, in particular relating to earthquakes. * Collecting information on natural hazards for each country which is of relevance to the insurance and reinsurance industry. As of 18.8.2008 http://www.cresta.org/) Hazard and Disaster Risk Assessment There is basically no risk that cannot be insured against, however it is difficult to assess how risky it is to give out insurance contracts to customers and to assess for insurance providers how high their rates should be. One main indicator for every insurer is the premiums that are paid for their reinsurance. When applying for reinsurance the forms will often be based on the models provided by CRESTA. CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and Standardising Target Accumulations) is an independent group led by Munich Re and Swiss Re which promotes the accurate and efficient mapping and evaluation of catastrophe perils. CRESTA furthermore and most importantly established a worldwide zone classification used within the insurance industry, the CRESTA Zones. The CRESTA Zones are defined for much of the world down to postcode level. CRESTA Zones can form the basis of reinsurance negotiation and portfolio analysis. In order for an insurer to calculate the risk distribution in their portfolio for each natural disaster type, accumulations of insured property in individual CRESTA Zones will be taken into account. In seismic risk analysis, for example, a successful loss estimation of insured and reinsured values depends on the seismic hazard analysis, on the vulnerability of facilities and on the ability to calculate the earthquake risk premium, also known as average annual loss (AAL). CRESTA is simply one of the biggest, if not the most comprehensive and most actual information resource for natural risks and hazards. On the downside, CRESTA specific information is not available freely. CRESTA zone information can either be bought directly from CRESTA or bundled with map systems. CRESTA zoning uses a simple rating scheme, where the higher the zone rating, the higher the exposure to that hazard. For example, Earthquake Exposure Zone 0 is low exposure, while Zone 4 is the highest.

He was the son of Rabbi Abraham Pereira Mendes, grandson of Rabbi David Aaron de Sola, and great-grandson of Haham Raphael Meldola. He was also brother of Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes. He was educated at Northwick College and at University College School, London, and at the University of London (B.A. 1869). Subsequently, he went to Breslau, Germany, where he entered the university and studied rabbinics at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau. Mendes received the degree of Ph.D. from Jena University in 1871. Rabbinic career Returning to England, he was licensed to preach as rabbi by Haham Benjamin Artom, in London, 1873; in the same year he was appointed preacher of the Great St. Helen's Synagogue of that city, but in December removed to New York, where he had accepted a call to the rabbinate of Shaaray Tefillah congregation (now the West End Synagogue); he entered upon his duties there January 1, 1874 as assistant minister to Rabbi Samuel M. Isaacs. In 1877, Dr. Mendes was elected rabbi of the congregation and continued in that position until 1920 when he retired as Rabbi Emeritus. Writings Dr. Mendes achieved a great reputation for scholarship and writing power. In conjunction with his brother Henry Pereira Mendes and others, he was one of the founders of the American Hebrew and was its editor during the first six years (1879-1885).

MacVicar received her undergraduate and graduate degrees at MIT and joined the faculty, giving her the rare distinction of being a \\"MIT lifer.\\" Background MacVicar was born on November 20, 1943 in Hamilton, Ontario to George and Elizabeth MacVicar. Her family relocated to Flint, Michigan in 1946 where she lived until she graduated from high school in 1961. Because she had been taking classes at a local junior college as a high school student, a local retired General Motors senior executive offered to help defray the costs of attending MIT. At MIT, she was one of the first residents of the McCormick Hall women's dormitory, which opened in the fall of 1963. She was the president of the Association of Women students, and also served as a physics tutor at McCormick Hall; Shirley Ann Jackson was one of the students she tutored. She received a bachelor of science degree in physics in 1964 (although she is often identified as a member of the class of 1965, with whom she entered MIT; compare and ) and a doctor of science (Sc.D) degree in metallurgy and materials science in 1967. Between 1967 and 1969, she worked as a post-doctoral fellow in the Royal Society Mond section of Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. In 1969, she joined the Department of Physics at MIT, where her research investigated high-temperature metal and ceramic superconductors, single crystal and thin-film materials research, and detecting corrosion kinetics using superconducting magnetometry. As Dean for Undergraduate Education, she worked to recruit more women, minorities, and students of varied interests, implemented changes in the humanities and social science requirements, and publicly criticized a Department of Defense policy barring homosexuals from ROTC programs. Professor MacVicar was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from Clarkson University in 1985. She was Orator at the 1984 Literary Exercises of Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard University; Cecil and Ida Green Distinguished Lecturer at the University of Texas in 1979; and Vollmer W.

She died on September 30, 1991 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a year after being diagnosed with cancer. UROP MacVicar established the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program in 1969 based upon a suggestion from Edwin H. Land. The program allows undergraduates to gain hands-on research experience with faculty members around the university and provides the laboratories with the funds to employ the students.

Rogers, a seminal figure in the history of America's state park system, served as counsel for the American Civic Association, a group dedicated to the preservation of Niagara Falls.  Early life  Rogers was born and raised in the farming community of East Palestine, in Columbiana County. After finishing school, he taught for one term and then studied telegraphy. Rogers took a position as an operator in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, and later served on a construction crew that strung a wire along the old National Pike from Pittsburgh to Baltimore.John C. Melnick, The Green Cathedral: History of Mill Creek Park. (Youngstown, OH: Youngstown Lithographing, 1976), p. 32. While employed as a telegrapher for the Pennsylvania legislature in Harrisburg, Rogers decided to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1871, and formed a partnership with his brother, Disney Rogers. The business partners set up an office in downtown Youngstown.  Birth of Mill Creek Park  Mill Creek Park An avid horseback rider, Rogers encountered Mill Creek Gorge during a jaunt through Youngstown Township in 1890. He was so impressed with its natural beauty that he took steps to preserve the gorge, which was then becoming a locus of timber production and the site of numerous stone quarries. An account published after Rogers' death describes the scene as follows: \\"Already, the sound of sawmill buzz saws could be heard in the distance, and Volney Rogers resolved to secure Mill Creek for a park for Youngstown for then, for now, and for the evercoming future\\". Rogers secured options on much of the land and was able to purchase large tracts of it. This was no small task given that he was compelled to deal with more than 90 landowners. Once the land was secured, Rogers framed and promoted what he called the \\"Township Park Improvement Law\\". Upon the law's passage, Rogers turned over all of the land he had secured for park purposes. Rogers enlisted the help of his brother Bruce, who had studied landscape architecture; and Bruce Rogers became the first Mill Creek Park superintendent. The project also benefited from the contributions of well- known landscape architect Charles Eliot, and the park is considered one of his notable works. The Mahoning County commissioners issued bonds to pay for the parkland, and Rogers purchased $25,000 of them, with the understanding that they would be the last ones paid. Ironically, the financial panic of 1893 facilitated the park's development. As a later newspaper account observed: \\"Unemployed men found work there. A second bond issue paid for their wages. The men cut trails, established drives, restored Pioneer Pavilion (a renovated factory building that was the oldest structure in the park) and built Lake Cohasset Dam\\".  Challenges  Yet, Rogers' struggle to preserve the Mill Creek gorge was hardly over. He battled continuous efforts by various interest groups to employ the park for purposes other than those he intended. In one instance, the Rogers brothers successfully rolled back a push by local water works trustees to use Mill Creek as a source of water supply. According to one account, this was achieved \\"by going through the park and nailing boards on the trees showing where the water level would be if dams were built to provide the water\\". Not all of Rogers' efforts on behalf of the park were successful. In 1913, a public sewer was run through Mill Creek Park, contaminating the water and leaving Rogers demoralized. The consequences were very much as Rogers had predicted, and swimming was soon inadvisable in many of the parks once pristine lakes. In the wake of this reversal, Rogers became interested in traveling. In 1919, he embarked on what he envisioned as a world tour. While exploring Colorado's Royal Gorge, Rogers caught a cold that eventually progressed into pneumonia.  Death and legacy  Rogers died in Ca√±on City, Colorado. On November 26, 1919, about a week before his passing, he wrote matter-of-factly of his impending death to brother Bruce: \\"Unless there is some change, you will have a brother to bury. Better go to Orr's undertaking establishment and learn what should be done at this end of the line.... This is a sad message, but I have thought it best you know everything. I don't want any of you to worry about me. We all have to go sometime\\". In 1920, less than a year after Volney Rogers' death, Youngstown Mayor Fred J. Warnock presided over the public unveiling of a massive bronze likeness of Rogers that was designed to honor his achievements. Rogers had been alerted to plans for the tribute before his death and was deeply moved. The Volney Rogers Memorial still stands near the main entrance of Mill Creek Park. At the time of its unveiling, Warnock captured the sentiments of many community residents when he stated: \\"We do not erect monuments to selfishness.... We erect monuments to those who live for the community and whose high ideal is the welfare of the many. That is why we are honoring Volney Rogers today\\". In 2000, Volney Rogers was inducted into Ohio's Natural Resources Hall of Fame for his principal role in establishing Ohio's park districts. A middle school in the Youngstown City School District is named for Volney Rogers.

The colonial era stone and brick manor house is now a museum and is a National Historic Landmark. History By Royal Charter, Van Cortlandt Manor was originally a tract granted as a Patent to Stephanus Van Cortlandt in 1697 by King William III, stretching from the Hudson River on the west to the first boundary line between the Province of New York and the Colony of Connecticut, on the east, twenty English miles in length by ten in width, in shape nearly a rectangular parallelogram, forming, \\"The Manor of Cortlandt.\\" The massive holding was acquired by direct purchase from the Indians, in part, by Stephanus van Cortlandt, a native born Dutch gentleman of New York, and in part by others whose titles he subsequently bought, this tract, together with a small tract on the west side of the Hudson River opposite the promontory of Anthony's Nose, which he also purchased from the Indians. The Manor House was built sometime before 1732 but was not any owner's principal residence until a grandson, Pierre Van Cortlandt, moved there in 1749. At that time the manor house was on a portion of the original tract. Pierre brought his family to the estate in 1749 and established the manor into its most vibrant days, according to some. During this period, the manor was operating an apple orchard, dairy farm, a bee house, a kiln, a tavern, and carpenter and blacksmith shops. Van Cortlandt Manor was a self-sustaining community while Pierre and his family resided in the estate.Hall, Barbara. \\"Van Cortlandt Debate Marks Its 300th Year.\\" The New York Times, 18 Oct. 1997.

At this time, though, tensions leading to the Revolutionary War were building and the manor would become a place of wartime retreat. Pierre sided with the colonies and the manor was used to assist the Continental Army, using its resources to make food and supplies. Pierre was involved with military legislature, and his son Philip was a soldier for the Continental Army. Eventually Pierre and his family vacated the manor in the thick of the war. The manor was ransacked by the British Army and left in poor standing. Philip, becoming a brigadier general by the war's end, returned and, along with his sister, Catherine, brought the manor back to working order.Northshield, Lee. \\"Van Cortlandt Manor\\".

Van Cortlandt Manor became an essential stop on the route from New York to Albany in the years that followed the war. The mills were once again thriving and provided the community and travelers with food, supplies, and lodging. Pierre and his wife did not return until 1803 once the manor was in full working order again. The manor was passed down in the family until it was sold to a non-relative, Otis Taylor, in 1945. By this time the property had lost luster, and was not the flourishing estate it has once been. Some buildings and barn houses were taken down to accommodate for more modern facilities, such as a movie house. In 1953 John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased the property and began restoring the manor to previous prominence. In 1961, Van Cortlandt Manor became registered as a National Historic Landmark. The house is not included in the area of Cortlandt Manor, New York. It is one of the mansions included in Historic Hudson Valley.

Early life and education Pierre Amine Gemayel was born in Beirut on 24 September 1972 to a Maronite Christian family that has long been involved in Lebanese politics. Gemayel was the eldest son of former President Amine Gemayel and grandson of Pierre Gemayel, founder of the Kataeb Party. He was also the nephew of former president-elect Bachir Gemayel, who was assassinated in Beirut in 1982. Gemayel studied law in Beirut and Paris, and began his legal career at a firm in Beirut. A short while later he took over the legal practice of his father. Political career Gemayel started his political life in the year 2000, when he was elected to Parliament in the Matn District as an independent. An active member of the Kataeb movement (an offshoot of the Kataeb Party), he rejoined his father in the Qornet Shehwan Gathering. He was re-elected in 2005. On the other hand, he was the only member of the Alliance list of 14 March to win a parliamentary seat in the Metn district. He was well known for his opposition to Syrian occupation and influence in Lebanon. He was against the mandate ruling of President √âmile Lahoud, and took part in the Cedar Revolution after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. In July 2005, he was named minister of industry in Fouad Siniora's government. He served as the representative of the Phalange party in the Siniora government. Assassination Supporters gather at Gemayel's funeral On 21 November 2006, the day before Lebanese Independence Day, at least three to four gunmen opened fire at close range on Gemayel with five different types of suppressed automatic weapons, all using 9 mm bullets, after ramming his car from the front in the Jdeideh suburb north of Beirut with a Honda CRV with tinted windows that they were driving.\\"Assassination sparks new Lebanon crisis\\", tmcnet.com; accessed 21 November 2016.\\"Brammertz visits site of Gemayel assassination\\", dailystar.com.lb; accessed 20 November 2016. Gemayel was the fifth prominent anti-Syrian figure to be killed in Lebanon in two years.Sharon Behn,\\"Killing seen as bid by Damascus, Tehran to hit U.S. role in Mideast\\", The Washington Times, 22 November 2006. Gemayel was visiting his electoral district of Metn, in Jdeideh that day. The method by which Gemayel was assassinated is much more brazen than that used in the past - gunmen killing in broad daylight, rather than anonymous car bombs detonated remotely. He was rushed by his driver, who escaped the attack unhurt, to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was declared dead. His bodyguard, Sameer Chartouni, was also killed in the attack. =Perpetrators= His killers issued a communique in which they referred to themselves the \\"Fighters for the Unity and Liberty of Greater Syria.\\" They said that they killed Gemayel because he was \\"one of those who unceasingly spouted their venom against Syria and against Hezbollah, shamelessly and without any trepidation. Those allegations could point the fingers at the Syrian National Social Party that has a long history of political assassinations in Lebanon.\\" A report by Kuwaiti daily Al Seyassah alleged that an editor from the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency contacted a Lebanese pro-Syrian newspaper 55 minutes prior to the assassination to inquire about the murder. The story claims the SANA reporter called back 10 minutes later to apologize for the original call. Al Seyassah further states it did not name the Lebanese newspaper to protect its identity. Lebanese law requires the dissolution of the government if one third of the 24-member Cabinet resign or become unavailable. It has been speculated that Gemayel's assassination was an attempt by pro-Syrian groups to reach the required third, and so force the current Government from power. With the recent resignation of six Hezbollah MPs from the Cabinet, added to Gemayel's death, the resignation or death of only two more ministers would topple the government. Others from the close circle of Pierre Gemayel would speculate that his fast political ascension had bothered many local powers mainly Syria's regime allies. Others have, however, put forward many conspiracy theories regarding the murder such as a possible false flag operation. Many have questioned Syria's interest in targeting the Christian society as that could have the effect of destabilising a rival Christian party, namely Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement which, together with Hassan Nasrallah's Shia Group Hezbollah, forms the largest parliamentary pro-Syrian block. However the pro-Syrian coalition managed to establish a sit- in, later growing into a protest camp, in the martyr's square downtown Beirut, to insist on their demands. Despite these claims, the unidentified perpetrators are still at large and the investigation on the attack has been inconclusive. Funeral A funeral ceremony for him was held on Martyrs' Square on 23 November 2006 with the participation of hundreds of thousands of supporters of the March 14 Alliance, and turned to be a political character. His body was buried in his hometown Bikfaya after Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir performed the rites in Beirut. =Lebanese reaction= Gemayel's coffin making its way through the crowds Saad Hariri, then majority leader of the Lebanese Parliament and the head of the Current for the Future political movement, accused Syria of ordering the killing. The Syrian government denied any involvement, and condemned the killings.\\"Crowds mourn Lebanon politician\\", bbc.co.uk; retrieved 1 April 2007. Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt also blamed Syria for the assassination, and said he expected more such killings aimed at undermining the Lebanese parliament's ruling majority. \\"I bluntly accuse the Syrian regime\\", Jumblatt said.\\"Jumblatt blames Syria for Gemayel's murder\\", yalibnan.com; November 2006. Samir Geagea, the leader of The Lebanese Forces, one of the major Christian parties, demanded President √âmile Lahoud resign, and also accused Syria of ordering the killing. Michel Aoun, leader of The Free Patriotic Movement, strongly condemned the murder, and argued that it was aimed at generating chaos and uncertainty, primarily among the Christian society in Lebanon. Similar remarks and condemnation were issued by almost all of the major Lebanese political players. =World reaction= The U.N. Security Council condemned Gemayel's assassination.Assassination increases tensions with Syria, Iran Washington Post 21 November 2006 Pope Benedict XVI's representative at the funeral condemned the \\"unspeakable\\" assassination. British Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the murder. Margaret Beckett, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in the United Kingdom, called the killing \\"contrary to the interests of all in the region\\" in a press conference aired on Al Jazeera English approximately an hour after Gemayel's death was confirmed. The White House also condemned the murder. The U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton said, \\"One pattern we discern in these political assassinations of Lebanese leaders ‚Äî journalists, members of parliament ‚Äî they are all anti-Syrian. So I suppose one can draw conclusions from that,\\" he said. Personal life Gemayel married Patricia Daif, a Lebanese Christian, in 1999, and they had two sons, Amine and Iskander (Alexander). The wedding was held in Limassol, Cyprus, so that Gemayel's father, who was then in self- exile, could attend.

The highway extends for from NY 23 in the Greene County town of Cairo to U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in the Schoharie County town of Sharon. Along the way, NY 145 intersects NY 30 in Middleburgh and Interstate 88 (I-88) east of Cobleskill. NY 145 is a two-lane highway its entire length, with a passing lane on hills leaving Middleburgh in both directions. The route follows parts of the Susquehannah Turnpike from Cairo through East Durham and west. Route description = Greene and Albany counties = NY 145 begins at an at-grade interchange with NY 23 in the hamlet of Cairo (within the town of the same name). NY 145 proceeds northwest through Cairo as a two-lane asphalt residential street, becoming a commercial/residential mix near a large quarry on the southbound side. NY 145 continues northwest for several miles, passing Old State Highway 145 on the southbound side, bending further to the northwest into an intersection with County Route 31 (CR 31; Roosevelt Avenue) in a small residential neighborhood of Cairo. A short distance to the northwest, NY 145 crosses the town line, leaving Cairo for the town of Durham. NY 145 through Durham remains a two-lane asphalt road, passing residences on both sides of the road, winding northwest past another quarry. Just north of the quarry, NY 145 becomes a two-lane commercial/industrial roadway, passing an intersection with the terminus of CR 67A. After CR 67A, more residences and industrial buildings begin to appear as the route enters the hamlet of East Durham. In East Durham, NY 145 intersects with CR 20B, leaving the small hamlet near Golden Hill Road. NY 145 winds northwest through Durham, passing a large industrial complex before crossing into the fields and residences nearby. At CR 27, NY 145 turns westward, slowly bending to the northwest once again. NY 145 through the town of Durham remains a mix of commercial/industrial/residential buildings on each side of the highway, intersecting with CR 22 at the center of the hamlet of Durham.

After crossing a short residential stretch to the north, NY 145 intersects with the terminus of CR 352 (Fox Creek Road), entering the hamlet of Preston Hollow. In Preston Hollow, the route winds northwest past numerous residences and a local cemetery before bending westward at Preston Hollow Park. NY 145 northwest of Preston Hollow remains a two-lane rural roadway, winding northwest alongside Catskill Creek. A short distance to the northeast, NY 145 crosses the county line once again, this time leaving Albany County for Schoharie County. = Schoharie County =  Broome to Cobleskill  After crossing the county line into Schoharie County, NY 145 winds northwest through the town of Broome, remaining a two-lane residential/rural roadway. A short distance to the northwest, the route enters a small hamlet centered around an intersection with CR 19A (Hauverville Road). The route proceeds west out of the hamlet, intersecting with CR 19 (Stone Store Road), where it bends to the north. NY 145 proceeds north through Broome for a distance, passing a large pond. It then starts to wind north, passing the eastern shore of Vlai Pond near Gates Hill Road. Proceeding alongside Vlai Pond, NY 145 crosses north into the hamlet of Franklinton. After leaving Franklinton, NY 145 intersects with the southern terminus of CR 50 (Windy Ridge Road). NY 10 briefly in Cobleskill, although erroneous US-style shields are used to denote NY 145 continues north through Broome on a parallel with CR 50, soon crossing into the town of Middleburgh. Through Middleburgh, NY 145 remains a two-lane rural road, proceeding north into the village of Middleburgh. Passing south of Middleburgh Cemetery, the route intersects with the terminus of CR 21 (Huntersland Road) and CR 66 (Cotton Hill Road). Now in downtown Middleburgh, NY 145 proceeds northwest along Main Street, a two-lane commercial street, passing an intersection with the village continuation of CR 36 (Clauerville Road). Several blocks east of CR 36, NY 145 intersects with NY 30 (River Street). NY 30 and NY 145 become concurrent for the length of a bridge over Schoharie Creek. NY 145, after NY 30 forks to the southeast, proceeds northwest through the town of Middleburgh alongside Schoharie Creek. Bending northward, NY 145 bends away from Schoharie Creek, passing through numerous farms that separate the road from the creek. After intersecting with CR 57 (Sunnyside Road), NY 145 winds northwestward for a distance through Middleburgh, intersecting with CR 41 (Ecker Hollow Road). Continuing the winding route through Middleburgh, NY 145 passes the town line, crossing into the town of Schoharie and an intersection with CR 1A. Just after CR 1A, NY 145 bends west and crosses into the town of Cobleskill. Now paralleling I-88 to the south, NY 145 winds west through Cobleskill, intersecting with the northern terminus of CR 41, crossing through the residential hamlet of East Cobleskill. After a bend to the northwest, NY 145 intersects with CR 1 (Mineral Springs Road) before entering exit 22 of I-88, a diamond interchange. Just north of I-88, NY 145 intersects with NY 7\\\\.

Cobleskill to Sharon  NY 145 northbound at the junction with CR 29 in Lawyersville. Signage is present, pointing drivers to US 20 Now in the village of Cobleskill, NY 7 and NY 145 gain the moniker of East Main Street, crossing over Cobleskill Creek before entering the downtown section of the village. After crossing over railroad tracks, NY 7 and NY 145 bend southwest through the village as East Main Street, a two-lane commercial street. At the intersection with South Grand Street, the routes intersect with NY 10 (North Grand Street). At this intersection, NY 7 forks onto a concurrency with NY 10 south, while NY 145 turns north onto North Grand, running concurrent with NY 10 north. This concurrency lasts three blocks, before NY 10 turns west on Elm Street. NY 145 continues north out of the village of Cobleskill. The route passes west of Cobleskill Rural Cemetery before crossing the town line at Edgewood Drive, back into the town of Cobleskill. NY 145 continues northwest through the town of Cobleskill as a two-lane residential/rural road, entering the hamlet of Lawyersville. In Lawyersville, NY 145 intersects with CR 29 (Lawyersville Road), turning north onto a residential street through the hamlet.

In Carlisle, NY 145 intersects with the terminus of CR 11 (Little York Road), soon crossing into the town of Seward, where it intersects with Rock District Road. At this intersection, NY 145 bends west onto the right-of-way of Rock District, winding past farms on both sides of the highway. Winding northwest through Seward, NY 145 crosses past residences before intersecting with CR 30 (Gardnersville Road). After a long wind to the northwest, the route crosses out of Seward for the town of Sharon. Through Sharon, NY 145 proceeds northwest as a two-lane rural road, soon entering the hamlet of Sharon, where it intersects with US 20\\\\. At this intersection, the NY 145 designation terminates, while the right-of-way continues north as CR 5A (Augusville Road) north to the Montgomery County line. History In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route 5-b, an unsigned legislative route extending from Cairo in Greene County to Cooksburg in Albany County via Durham. One year later, the legislature created Route 38-a, which began in Cobleskill and passed through Sharon before ending in Sharon Springs. On March 1, 1921, Route 5-b was eliminated while Route 38-a became part of Route 39, which continued west along what is now US 20 from Sharon Springs to the town of Madison. None of former Route 5-b nor the portion of Route 39 south of Sharon received a signed designation when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, all of former legislative Route 5-b was designated as NY 145 while the Cobleskill‚ÄìSharon segment of former legislative Route 39 was assigned NY 164. At the same time, what is now NY 145 from Cooksburg to Middleburgh was designated as part of NY 81. The section of modern NY 145 between Middleburgh and NY 7 east of Cobleskill was assigned NY 433 . By the following year, NY 145 was extended northward to Middleburgh while NY 81 was truncated southward to Cooksburg. NY 145 was extended again in both directions . On its north end, it was altered to continue northwest through Cobleskill to Sharon, supplanting both NY 164 and NY 433 and briefly overlapping with NY 7 and NY 30 in Cobleskill and Middleburgh, respectively. On its south end, it was modified to overlap with NY 23 eastward to Catskill on what is now County Route 23B (CR 23B). NY 145 originally entered the hamlet of Cairo on what is now CR 84 and met NY 23 in the center of the community at what is now CR 23B. Both NY 23 and NY 145 were realigned in the 1960s to follow a new arterial between Cairo and the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in Catskill. The first segment of the highway, a northerly bypass of the hamlet of Cairo, opened . The remainder of the arterial was completed in the mid-1960s. On January 1, 1970, NY 145 was truncated back to its current southern terminus in Cairo, eliminating the overlap between NY 23 and NY 145.

It is usually relevant to a condition or state of war where one side depletes the resources of another through attrition. Specifically and most often used as a comparator in aerial combat, where it is known as a kill-ratio. For example, during the Korean War, American combat jets had a kill-ratio of 4-1. This means for every four aircraft shot down by an American aircraft, one American plane was shot down by an enemy fighter.  Historical applications  Loss exchange ratio has played a significant role in past wars, especially those that have devolved into stalemate and become wars of attrition. For example, the German objective at the Battle of Verdun (1916) during World War I was not the seizure of any strategic objective, but rather to inflict an LER of 2:1 on the French forces and thereby cripple the French army. During the First Indochina War, V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, the leader of the Vi·ªát Minh, told his French opposite number that \\"you can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, and at that rate, I will still triumph.\\" In fact, the LER was approximately 3:1 in favor of the French, and they did indeed withdraw in defeat. A total of 500,000+ Vietnamese were either killed, wounded or captured during the First Indochina War.Smedberg, M (2008), Vietnamkrigen: 1880‚Äì1980. Historiska Media, p. 88 Contemporary employment It is arguable that the concept of the Loss exchange ratio has become relatively less important in modern Western military doctrine, as some military theories posit that it is just as militarily effective to disrupt enemy forces and outmaneuver them, thereby reducing their combat effectiveness without necessarily inflicting massive casualties.

He was the first master of the Beth Limud School of Kingston, but resigned in order to prepare in London, England for the vocation of preacher and rabbi. He studied under Dr. David Meldola, son of Haham Raphael Meldola, as well as under his future father-in-law, the Rev. D. A. de Sola, known as \\"the learned Hazzan\\" of the Sephardic community, and received his diplomas. He returned to Jamaica and became for a short time assistant to the Rev. Isaac Lopez, minister of the Kingston Sephardic congregation, but was soon called from that position to be the minister of the Montego Bay community. There he stayed until his wife's failing health compelled him, in 1851, to return to her milder native climate. Mendes was then elected minister and preacher in the Birmingham (Eng.) congregation, and remained there until 1858, when he moved to London, became head of the Neveh Zedek for six years, and established Northwich College, a school for Jewish youth. He continued meanwhile his ministerial duties and literary labors, and on the death of Haham Artom acted as preacher and dayyan for the Sephardic community of London. In 1883, he was called to the ministry at the historic Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, by the guardian Congregation Shearith Israel of New York and continued as its minister until his death ten years later. He was the first among the Sephardim to publish a volume of sermons in English (1855).

Founded in 1989 at the Sussex Aids Centre in Brighton, England, the objective was to provide a cultural response to HIV and Aids.Aputheatre website ; retrieved on 2007-11-22 The company quickly established a reputation for hard-hitting drama very much in the In-yer-face theatre style and a good example of queer theatre. From 1994 onwards, Aputheatre produced work that moved away from being exclusively about HIV- AIDS. Though HIV remained a key subtext in many works, other themes like prostitution, pornography, sexual politics became more important.‚ÄúA significant shift in Aids Theatre‚Äù - (Plays and Players May 1990)Ice Pick Poster ; retrieved on 2007-11-22 The company‚Äôs first production, Crying Celibate Tears by John Roman Baker, was performed as part of the Brighton Festival Fringe. It was an instant hit with public and critics alike and the company was invited to perform the following year as part of the main Brighton Festival programme. This time the play was The Ice Pick and the company won the Festival Award for Best Theatre.Ice Pick Poster 1 ; Retrieved on 2007-11-22 The Los Angeles Times called the play \\"vivid and compelling\\".Ice Pick Poster 2 ; Retrieved on 2007-11-22 Several sponsors withdrew funds from the Brighton Festival in protest at the company's inclusion, causing embarrassment within the festival administration and much public outcry. Political controversy often accompanied the company's performances. Politicians in Edinburgh and Forl√¨, Italy tried to gain votes by calling for theatres' funding to be withdrawn. Printers also refused to print festival brochures. Even with the company's home base, the Sussex Aids Centre, there was great opposition to the company's work which was considered too strong, too gay and which never followed a politically correct line. Aputheatre became Brighton and Edinburgh Festival regulars. Between 1989 and 1997 their work was in many cities in the UK and internationally in Italy and the United States. In 1998 Aputheatre‚Äôs two founders, John Roman Baker and Rod Evan moved to Amsterdam, where a creative relationship was established with COC Nederland, a Dutch organization for LGBT men and women. The company initially developed four strong plays which explored the sub-culture of prostitution among young East European men living in Amsterdam. The Prostitution Plays'together with a later production Romophobia have charted the evolution and demise of male street prostitution in Amsterdam that has occurred at the beginning of the 21st Century. With its establishment on the continent in the Netherlands, the company was able to take its work to other European countries, with tours in Italy, Poland and Ukraine. In 2003, the controversial East Side SkinFilm: East Side Skin (2003); was performed in Amsterdam and Eindhoven. The play explored the attraction of the far right within gay subculture and was inspired in part by the assassination earlier that year of Dutch Populist politician Pim Fortuyn. A DVD of that production was released early in 2004. In 2005, the play Romophobia explored the lives of two Romanians living illegally in Amsterdam, against a backdrop of sexual uncertainty and police harassment. The play highlighted the policy of police to raid gay bars on Amsterdam's Paardenstrat and then arrest, incarcerate and deport young men, with no legal representation. During the run of the play, perhaps as a result of publicity generated around the issue, the Police raids stopped. In 2006 with the production Prisoners of Sex author John Roman Baker and Aputheatre returned to their original theme of HIV-AIDS to explores the complexity and compulsions of unprotected sex among men.Netherlands: Unprotected Acts On Stage ; retrieved on 2007-11-22 In November 2008 the company announced a new production entitled 'TOUCHED' to be premiered in Amsterdam in December 2008.

Gurukula Kangri has 24 academic departments covering Engineering, Applied Sciences, Vedic Sciences, Humanities & Social Sciences and Management programs with a strong emphasis on Vedic and Modern Sciences and technological education and research.  History  Gurukula Kangri (Deemed to be University) was founded on 4 March 1902 by the Arya Samaj sannyasi Swami Shraddhanand, who was a follower of Dayananda Saraswati, with the sole aim to revive the ancient Indian gurukula system of education. This institution was established with the objective of providing an indigenous alternative to Lord Macaulay's education policy by imparting education in the areas of Vedic literature, Indian philosophy, Indian culture, modern sciences, and research. The Arya Samaj which advocated women‚Äôs education, as part of its policies for the upliftment of women in the country, established the Kanya Gurukula Campus, Dehradun in 1922 by Acharya Ramdevji making it a second campus of women‚Äôs education. But to give real shape to the dreams of Swami Shraddhanandaji, Kanya Gurukula Campus, Hardwar was established in 1993. The Gurukula has witnessed many distinguished guests. A few of them being C. F. Andrews, Ramsay MacDonald, Mahatma Gandhi, Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Dr Radha Krishnan, Sh.Jamnalal Bajaj, Dr. Munje, Sadhu Vaswani, Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, Smt. Indira Gandhi and Sh. Gyani Jail Singh, Sh. L.K. Advani and in 2011 Smt. Meira Kumar,then speaker of the Lok Sabha. The impetus for the foundation was found in the teachings and activities of Dayananda Saraswati, founder of the Arya Samaj. The first foundation brick was laid down in Gujrawala, Punjab. During India Partition Swami ji searched for a suitable palace in India according to the imagination of Dayananda Saraswati as mentioned in Satyarth Prakash. The site of Kangri village, Bijnor district, was flooded when the river changed course in 1924; the new (present) campus was built subsequently.

Harris Health System is an integrated delivery system that provides healthcare services open to all residents of Harris County, Texas. It is the first accredited healthcare institution in Harris County to be designated as an NCQA Medical Home and one of the largest in the country. History The Harris County Hospital District was created by voter referendum on November 20, 1965 and was formally designated as a political subdivision with taxing authority on January 1, 1966. Its creation is largely attributed to the publication of Jan de Hartog's novel The Hospital, which described the horrific conditions of the Jefferson Davis Charity Hospital. The new district replaced an existing city-county system in which the two governmental bodies shared funding responsibility. Quentin Ronald Mease was a founder and chairman of the Harris County Hospital District and chaired the Harris County Hospital Foundation. A Hospital District is a governmental entity in Texas, established pursuant to the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const. art. IX, ¬ß 4; Tex. Health & Safety Code ¬ß 281.002 or the general statutes of Texas, and its purpose is to provide medical care to the needy residents of a particular county.Tex. Const. art. IX, ¬ß 4; Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. ¬ß¬ß 281.002, 282.049. By 1989, the hospital had exceeded U.S. federal patient mortality rates for two years in a row; Ben Taub and Jefferson Davis were the sole Houston hospitals above their predicted mortality rates. Roger Widmeyer, the district spokesperson, said \\"We are a very unique hospital because of the number of acutely ill patients we receive. We think the taxpayers understand that we handle a lot of sick people here. A lot of the people we treat don't come to the hospitals until they are very, very sick.\\"Perry, Earnest L. \\"Hospital district exceeds mortality rates.\\" Houston Chronicle.

By 1990, when LBJ received an emergency room and Ben Taub received an emergency care facility, the district began to assign county residents to each hospital depending on zip code. Residents of northern areas in the county, including patients treated at Acres Home, Settegast, Bordersville and Baytown clinics were assigned to LBJ. Residents of southern areas, including patients at Casa de Amigos, Martin Luther King, Ripley House, Strawberry Road, and West End county clinics were assigned to Ben Taub.Zuniga, Jo Ann and Mitch Whitten. \\"Hospitals to divide patients.\\" Houston Chronicle.

Widmer was a medical specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy FMH (Foederatio Medicorum Helveticorum), employed in his own medical practice. He lived and worked in L√ºsslingen near Solothurn (Schweiz). He was a specialist in Psychedelic psychotherapy and had special permission from the BAG (Eidgen√∂ssisches Bundesamt f√ºr Gesundheitswesen), to use MDMA and LSD in psycholytic psychotherapy from 1988 to 1994. Along with Peter Baumann, he was one of the founders of the ECBS (Europ√§isches Collegium f√ºr Bewu√ütseinsstudien) and the S√ÑPT ‚Äì \\"Schweizerische √Ñrztegesellschaft f√ºr Psycholytische Psychotherapie‚Äú. Widmer spoke during the Basel Psychotherapy Days (Basler Psychotherapietage). He led spiritual workshops, seminars in meditation and Tantra and meditation- voyages. Among the spiritual teachers he was inspired by were Jiddu Krishnamurti and Carlos Castaneda. Widmer lived with two women and had children with both. A huge group of followers grew around Widmer and his wife Dani√®le Nicolet, including 80 adults and 55 children. Because of that, Widmer was suspected to be the leader of a cult or sect by the media.  The Core‚Äìshell model (Kern-Schalen-Modell)  The basic assumptions of this theory is, that during a man‚Äôs development, ‚Äúemotional layers‚Äù grow around the ‚Äúessential core‚Äù of his mind. This model shall be imagined as an onion, whose core is the source of our zest for life. Around this core, a layer of pain and dolor grows throughout development, because of experienced and not worked up injuries. Because these feelings often are felt insufferable, another layer is built, the layer of defending emotions like anger, aggression, rage and defiance. For that, the child is often penalized with deprivation of love ‚Äì another layer gets built, again: The layer of adaption, whose characteristics are boredom, weariness, senselessness and depression. If a person wants to regain his ability to be happy or be happier, he had to work his way through these layers. Widmer used legal psycholytic substances to support this way to the inner core.

A Federalist, he is most notable for his service as a member of the New York State Assembly, a United States Representative from New York, and Charg√© d'Affaires to the Netherlands. Born in Albany in 1779, Bleecker belonged to an old Dutch family that had lived in Albany since the 1600s. He was educated in Albany, and learned to speak the Dutch language. After studying in the private law office of two established attorneys, Bleecker attained admission to the bar in 1801, and began a practice in Albany. He became a highly regarded lawyer and teacher, and many men who went on to prominent legal and business careers learned the law under his tutelage. He was also active in numerous business ventures, including banks and canal construction and operation. In 1810, Bleecker won a seat in the U.S. House. He served in the 12th United States Congress (March 4, 1811 to March 3, 1813). Bleecker did not run for reelection in 1812, and resumed practicing law. In 1814 and 1815 he served in the New York State Assembly, where he worked with Governor Daniel D. Tompkins to provide funding for New York troops taking part in the War of 1812. In 1837, Bleecker took office as Charg√© d'Affaires to the Netherlands, appointed by longtime friend Martin Van Buren, who shared Bleecker's interest in the Dutch language and culture. He served until 1842, after which he resumed practicing law in Albany. Bleecker took part in numerous philanthropic and civic endeavors, including the establishment of several Albany-area hospitals and oversight of several universities. He died in Albany in 1849, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery. Bleecker married late in life, and had no children. After her death in 1885, his widow honored his request to leave his fortune for the benefit of the citizens of Albany. The money was used to construct Bleecker Hall, a library and theater. The association responsible for the institution later sold Bleecker Hall, and then constructed Harmanus Bleecker Library, a building that was used solely as a library. Bleecker Library was later redeveloped as private offices, and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places Early life Harmanus Bleecker was born into an old Dutch family in Albany, New York on October 9, 1779.John D. Whish, Albany Guide Book, 1917, page 90 His father Jacob Bleecker was a prominent merchant, and his mother Elizabeth Wendell was the daughter of Hermanus Wendell, an Albany furrier. Harmanus Bleecker was also the great- great grandson of Jan Jansen Bleecker, the first Bleecker family member to reside in North America.

They sold the 1889 Bleecker Hall and used the proceeds to construct Harmanus Bleecker Library near the intersection of Washington and Dove Streets, which opened in 1924. Blecker Hall burned in a 1940 fire and was later demolished. In 1977, the Albany Public Library's Washington Avenue Branch moved from Bleecker Library into a Washington Avenue building on the site of the old Bleecker Hall.

See calendar for 1887. * . was an officer in the United States Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and, despite being Northern-born, a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War. He was also an author and a prosperous South Carolina businessman. Early life and career Ripley was born in Worthington, Ohio, a small village in Franklin County not far from Columbus. His family relocated to the state of New York, where he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He graduated in 1843, ranked 7th out of 39 cadets. Other classmates in his year included Ulysses S. Grant, William B. Franklin, Samuel G. French and Franklin Gardner. He was assigned as a second lieutenant to garrison duty, as well as becoming an artillery instructor. Lieutenant Ripley served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War on the staffs of Gen. Zachary Taylor and Gen. Gideon Pillow, and saw action at the battles of Monterey, Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, Chapultepec, and the capture of Mexico City. For gallantry in action, Ripley was brevetted captain for Cerro Gordo and major for Chapultepec. He published a History of the Mexican War (2 vols., New York, 1849). He was engaged in the Second Seminole War in Florida in 1849, where again he saw combat. Following the war, he was on garrison duty in various posts in the South, including Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina. Also living on the island was a wealthy widow, Alicia (Middleton) Sparks (1824‚Äì1899), from Charleston. They married in 1852. The novelist William Gilmore Simms was living on the island at the time, and tells of an incident during their courtship involving Ripley's boots and a barman. Alicia's uncle was Arthur Middleton Manigault, later a Confederate general. Ripley resigned from the army in 1853 and moved to Charleston to settle his wife's estates. From 1853‚Äì1854 he was the publisher, along with Charles G. Baylor, of the Baltimore Daily American Times. He later established a successful business, and, over time, Ripley became a supporter of states rights. He joined the South Carolina state militia and became a major of ordnance. Civil War After South Carolina seceded from the Union, Ripley became a lieutenant colonel in the Army of South Carolina. He and his men helped garrison Fort Moultrie. He helped direct the fire from a battery during the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor on April 13, 1861. On August 15, 1861, he was appointed as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army and assigned command of the Department of South Carolina and its coastal defenses. From December 1861 until May 1862, he had charge of the Second Military District of South South Carolina. Transferred to field command in Virginia, Ripley commanded an infantry brigade (comprising two Georgia and two North Carolina regiments) in the defenses of Richmond, Virginia, in June 1862. Assigned to the Army of Northern Virginia, Ripley's Brigade participated in the battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines Mill, and Malvern Hill during the Peninsula Campaign. Despite being depleted from recent fighting and illness, Ripley's Brigade fought in the Maryland Campaign at the Battle of South Mountain and the Battle of Sharpsburg in September 1862. He suffered a severe wound in the neck at Sharpsburg, but soon recovered and rejoined the army. In November, he was involved in the defense of Fredericksburg. Criticized for his performance at Antietam, General Ripley in early 1863 returned to South Carolina and took charge of the First Military District. His men constructed a series of improved defenses around Charleston, and Ripley commanded the troops that repelled a Union Navy attack on April 7, 1863. He continued in command of Charleston's fortifications until the city was evacuated in mid-February 1865 and fought under Joseph E. Johnston at the Battle of Bentonville. Postbellum After the war, Ripley, whose wife and daughter had left him, went abroad and resided in England for over twenty years. In the late 1880s, he returned to the United States and settled in New York City, where he died of a massive stroke. He was buried in Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston, South Carolina. His uncle, James Wolfe Ripley, had led the Federal troops in Charleston Harbor during the Nullification Crisis, and was the Chief of Ordnance of the U.S. Army during the first half of the Civil War. @This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Wilson, James Grant; Fiske, John, eds.

It is completely independent from political parties or lobbies of any kind. It numbers around 3,000 members. UAAR was founded in 1991 to promote the diffusion of atheist and agnostic ideas, operate for a thoroughly secular state, and struggle against any privilege granted to the Roman Catholic religion and against any discrimination of nonbelievers. UAAR's activities include the following: * Since December 1996, UAAR has regularly published the bi-monthly magazine L‚ÄôAteo (The Atheist) and in 1998 it created a website on the Internet. * Besides seeking contacts with government representatives, UAAR is prepared to initiate legal actions to obtain the full acknowledgement for atheism and atheists' rights; they have, for instance, obtained recognition of the right for those baptised as infants to be considered no longer Catholic if they wish. * Through its membership of the Humanists International (HI) and European Humanist Federation (EHF), UAAR collaborates with other humanist organisations on international issues; its logo references the Happy Human symbol, in common with other humanist organisations. Among UAAR's main goals is the abrogation of article 7 of the Italian Constitution, which recognises the Lateran Treaties between Italy and Vatican City.  The Atheist Bus Campaign  Atheist Bus ad.: \\"The bad news is that God does not exist. The good news is that you don't need it\\" In January 2009, the organisation promoted an atheist bus campaign inspired by the similar initiative of the British Humanist Association. The campaign, due to start on 4 February 2009, was symbolically launched in Genoa, on the occasion of the nomination of the city's archbishop, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI). The original slogan chosen for the Italian campaign reads: \\"The bad news is that God does not exist. The good news is that you don't need it\\". On 16 January 2009 IGPDecaux, the company holding licenses for ads on public transport in Genoa, refused to give authorization to the atheist bus campaign on the grounds that it may \\"offend the moral, civic and religious convictions of the public\\". Antonio Catrical√†, the then head of the Italian National Authority for Fair Trading and Competition, announced that the Authority filed a case against the Atheist Bus initiative because of the potentially \\"dangerous and mendacious nature\\" of the ads. As a reaction, the UAAR launched a new campaign in Genoa with a different slogan to comply with the advertising authority's rules: \\"The good news is that there are millions of atheists in Italy. The excellent news is they believe in freedom of speech\\".

Background Bred by renowned sportsman John W. Galbreath at his Darby Dan Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, Graustark was named for the fictional country used as the setting in several early 20th century novels by George Barr McCutcheon. He was chestnut and had a stride that was believed to be at least as long as Man o' War's. Graustark's nickname was \\"The Big G\\". Sired by European champion Ribot, Graustark was born in the same year as Ogden Phipps' future Hall of Fame colt Buckpasser. Racing career =1965:two-year-old season= Racing at age two in 1965, Graustark competed in three races - including the Arch Ward Handicap, which he won by six lengths on a very muddy track - but an injury (shin splints) sidelined him for the rest of the year. Although he won all three of his races by wide margins, he did not compete enough to be seriously considered for the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse. Buckpasser, who won the award based on his nine wins in eleven races, went into the 1966 racing season as the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby. =1966:three-year-old season= In early 1966, Graustark came back from his injury after five months of recuperation. Ridden by jockey Braulio Baeza (who was also Buckpasser's jockey), he made his three-year-old debut with a win in the Grenada Purse at Hialeah Park. He then began winning race after race and was soon talked about as being a serious rival to Buckpasser. At the time, Baeza considered Graustark to be the best horse he had ever ridden. He was touted as a superhorse who was likely to win the Triple Crown, thus ending the drought since Citation's win. The anticipated showdown between Buckpasser and Graustark at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May never happened after Buckpasser suffered a quarter crack injury and missed the U.S. Triple Crown races. Graustark then became the heavy favorite for the Derby. However, after winning seven straight races, he sustained a career-ending coffin bone break while in the lead in the Blue Grass Stakes. Racing on a very muddy track, he was in front by six lengths in the back stretch but lost by a nose to Abe's Hope (who nearly beat Buckpasser in the Flamingo Stakes). Prior to the last race, a safety pin was found stuck in Graustark's frog/hoof, but after icing he was declared fit to run.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/15375/the-year-of- buckpasser-and-graustark?id=15375 Stud career Graustark was syndicated for a record $2.4 million, an enormous amount at the time. Standing at stud at Darby Dan Farm, he proved reasonably successful as a sire. Among his progeny were Key To The Mint, Avatar, Caracolero, Protection Racket, Gregorian and Jim French. Graustark was also the damsire of multi-millionaire Bien Bien. Graustark's full brother was His Majesty, who set a track record of 1:46 2/5 for 1 1/8 miles at Hialeah Park Race Track. His Majesty was also a Leading sire in North America whose offspring included Pleasant Colony, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and 1981 - 3 yo Eclipse Award Winner. Graustark died at age 25 on August 21, 1988, and was buried in the equine cemetery at Darby Dan Farm.

Flooding is occasionally a problem along the Salt Brook, especially in the Memorial Field area and parts of New Providence. Local tradition is that the brook got its name when the locals dumped their salt into the brook to keep it out of the hands of advancing British soldiers during the American Revolutionary War.

The estate called K√ºr√ºmonostora was endowed by King Charles Robert in 1318 to Peter Kompolty, chamberlain of the queen. Owing to its geographic position, Nagyk√∂r≈± managed to survive the Turkish rule successfully. According to the legend, the Turkish troops were lost in the marsh on 19 July 1530 (day of Elijah).

In July 1942, having just completed the first two of the series, N√©mirovsky was arrested as a Jew and detained at Pithiviers and then Auschwitz, where she was murdered, a victim of the Holocaust. The notebook containing the two novels was preserved by her daughters but not examined until 1998. They were published in a single volume entitled Suite fran√ßaise in 2004. Background The sequence was to portray life in France in the period following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under German occupation on 14 June. The first novel, Temp√™te en juin (Storm in June) depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and in the days following it. The second, Dolce (Sweet), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as N√©mirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them. The third novel, Captivit√© (Captivity), for which N√©mirovsky left a plot outline, would have shown the coalescing of a resistance, with some characters introduced in Temp√™te en juin and Dolce having been arrested and put under threat of death, in Paris. The fourth and fifth novels would perhaps have been called Batailles (Battles) and La Paix (Peace) but these exist only as titles in N√©mirovsky's notebook, against which she had placed question marks. Nothing can be said about the plots of Batailles and La Paix. To quote N√©mirovsky's notes, they are \\"in limbo, and what limbo! It's really in the lap of the gods since it depends on what happens\\". Books =Temp√™te en juin= The narrative follows several groups of characters who encounter one another rarely if at all. All are impelled to flee from Paris in advance of the German entry into the city. As transport and distribution collapse under German bombardment, all have to change their plans and nearly all lose the veneer of civilization. The P√©ricands are making for N√Æmes, where they have property. They reach the city but in the course of the journey, Charlotte P√©ricand's senile father-in-law is left behind (forgotten) while her second son, Hubert, runs away to join the army and shares in its collapse. Her elder son, Philippe, is a priest and is shepherding a party of orphans, who eventually kill him (in a death scene perhaps in need of revision, N√©mirovsky comments in her notebook, because it is melo [melodramatic]). Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for Vichy, where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the Loire; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably. Maurice and Jeanne Michaud, minor employees at a bank, are instructed to go to Tours though deprived at the last minute of the transport promised by their employer. Their son, Jean-Marie is with the army and they have no word of his fate. They cannot get to Tours and eventually return to Paris, unemployed and almost destitute but destined to survive. Jean-Marie is in fact wounded; he is being tended by the Sabarie family at their small farm near Bussy, where he is nursed back to health by Madeleine, the Sabaries' foster daughter. At the end of the novel as postal services are restored, Jean-Marie is able to contact his family and return to Paris. The Michauds, alone among major characters, grow in moral stature as chaos spreads. =Dolce= The small town of Bussy and its neighbouring farms are the scene throughout. The German occupation seems sweetly peaceful but there is no doubt over the balance of power. The Germans get whatever they ask for; official notices promise the death penalty for those who disobey their regulations, and French collaborators, including the P√©ricands, make their own settlement with their German overlords. The main plot concerns Lucile Angellier, whose unfaithful husband is a prisoner of war. She lives uneasily, with her mother-in-law. Theirs being the best house in the village, it is where the German commander, Bruno von Falk, an accomplished musician, is billeted. Unwillingly Lucile finds herself falling in love with him. In this and several parallel strands, the novel explores the deep, perhaps unbridgeable, differences and the perhaps superficial sympathies, between military Germans and rural French. The minor plot concerns the family of Beno√Æt Sabarie, a prisoner of war who escapes from German captivity, returns home to the family farm near Bussy, marries his fianc√©e Madeleine and believes (with some justification) that she still pines for Jean-Marie Michaud, whom she nursed during his recovery. Jealous by nature, Beno√Æt also believes that Madeleine risks being seduced by the German interpreter, Bonnet, who is billeted in their house. Caught poaching, arrested for possessing a gun, Beno√Æt struggles free and shoots Bonnet dead. (In her notebook, N√©mirovsky mentions a possible revision where Bonnet is wounded, not killed.) The stories come together when, at Madeleine's request, Lucile conceals Beno√Æt in her house. It is widely assumed that Bruno's presence in the house and his liking for Lucile, will protect her against searches. The need to conceal Beno√Æt brings Lucile and her mother-in-law closer; it drives her apart from Bruno, though he never knows why. After an astonishing and powerful scene in which German troops celebrate the first anniversary of their entry into Paris, Dolce ends in July 1941, when Germany begins its invasion of the Soviet Union. The troops occupying Bussy are posted to the Eastern Front. Lucile and Bruno fear that he will not survive and she has no difficulty in persuading him to give her a travel document and petrol coupon, which (unknown to him) will enable her to drive Beno√Æt to a new refuge. The title of Dolce, like that of the whole sequence, intentionally recalls musical terminology, dolce means \\"sweet\\" or \\"soft\\" in musicians' Italian. This title is truthful but also ironic, since bitterness exists under the surface, and a far less peaceful sequel was to follow. =Captivit√©= The plot of N√©mirovsky's third novel exists as a plot outline, with some contradictions, in her notebook. Beno√Æt has \\"friends\\" (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives him to the city, where he is concealed by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in Temp√™te en juin. In Paris, Beno√Æt and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced and arrested, and in prison, they meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Beno√Æt and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is still in love with Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in Temp√™te en juin, emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Beno√Æt dies brutally and full of hope. The manuscript and its rediscovery Suite fran√ßaise, so far as it was completed, was written in microscopic handwriting in a single notebook; Temp√™te and Dolce together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It would possibly be the earliest work of literary fiction about the Second World War, and is remarkable as a historical novel sequence written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such as might be expected to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy N√©mirovsky experienced. It is extraordinary that the manuscript should have survived in such extreme circumstances, having been taken by Irene N√©mirovsky's daughter Denise as she was being helped to flee from hiding place to hiding place during wartime. Denise, however, kept the notebooks containing the nearly indecipherable manuscript of Suite fran√ßaise unread in an old suitcase for more than sixty years, convinced that it would indeed be a painful diary reminding her of the war that would not be beneficial to read. In the late 1990s, having made arrangements to contribute these manuscripts to a French archive, Denise decided to decipher the notebooks first, which resulted in the rediscovery of the original manuscripts of the fictional work Suite fran√ßaise which she had published in association with publisher Olivier Rubinstein in France in 2004. Publication history =French publication= Suite fran√ßaise was published by √âditions Deno√´l, Paris, in 2004. The edition includes a preface by Myriam Anissimov, notes by N√©mirovsky about the revision and planned continuation of the sequence, and correspondence between N√©mirovsky herself, her husband Michel Epstein, her publisher Albin Michel and others in the period before and after her deportation. Suite fran√ßaise won the Prix Renaudot for 2004, the first time that the prize has been awarded posthumously. =Translations= An English translation by Sandra Smith was published by Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, and by Knopf, New York, in 2006. A Korean translation, ÌîÑÎûëÏä§ Ï°∞Í≥° (P'≈≠rangs≈≠ chogok) by Yi Sang-hae was published by Munhak Segyesa in 2005 (). An Indonesian translation by Mimi Benetto and Lenah Susianty was published by Qanita, Jakarta, in 2011. . Critical reception Suite fran√ßaise was published to high acclaim from critics. The book received a 95/100 weighted average on the old Metacritic site, based on the reviews of 19 critics. In The New York Times, Paul Gray called the book \\"stunning\\" and argued that it ranks with \\"the greatest, most humane and incisive fiction that conflict has produced. Janice Kulyk Keefer of The Globe and Mail wrote the book was \\"miraculous for the power, brilliance and beauty of the writing, and for the very wholeness\\". In 2009, The Times ranked it the fifth best book of the 2000s. In 2014, The Telegraph placed it No. 31 on their list of the all-time greatest novels. =Similarities with other novels= Some readers have noticed similarities between Bruce Marshall's 1943 novel Yellow Tapers for Paris and Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky's Suite fran√ßaise which was written at about the same time but not discovered until 1998. There is no suggestion of plagiarism, N√©mirovsky was dead before Marshall's novel was published and no one saw N√©mirovsky's work before its 1998 discovery. Both works have protagonists who work in finance, Marshall's protagonist is an accountant while N√©mirovsky's work has several characters who work for a bank. Both books were written during and/or immediately after the event but show significant reflection; they are not autobiographical works but fiction featuring invented characters. The stories cover the prelude of the Nazi invasion and its aftermath but the events in the stories are much different. Marshall's ends before the occupation, while N√©mirovsky's has significant portions devoted to it. \\"Dolce,\\" the second part of Suite fran√ßaise, is similar to Le Silence de la mer, a novella by the French author Vercors (pseudonym of Jean Bruller). Both stories deal with a German officer, who in civilian life was a composer, who is quartered in the house of a young French woman. Suite fran√ßaise and Le Silence de la Mer were finished in early 1942. =Controversy= Several reviewers and commentatorsNextbook: Behind the Legend have raised questions regarding N√©mirovsky's attitude toward Jews, her generally negative depiction of Jews in her writing and her use of anti-semitic publications in advancing her career. A review of her work published in The New Republic states: > N√©mirovsky was the very definition of a self-hating Jew. Does that sound too > strong? Well, here is a Jewish writer who owed her success in France entre > deux guerres in no small measure to her ability to pander to the forces of > reaction, to the fascist right. N√©mirovsky's stories of corrupt Jews‚Äîsome of > them even have hooked noses, no less!‚Äîappeared in right-wing periodicals and > won her the friendship of her editors, many of whom held positions of power > in extreme-right political circles. When the racial laws in 1940 and 1941 > cut off her ability to publish, she turned to those connections to seek > special favors for herself, and even went so far as to write a personal plea > to Marshal P√©tain. Film adaptation The film rights to Suite fran√ßaise were purchased by Universal in 2006. Ronald Harwood, who wrote the script for The Pianist, was set to write the screenplay, with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall producing the film. In 2007, TF1 Droits Audiovisuels acquired the rights to the novel from publisher √âditions Deno√´l. The novel was then adapted for the screen by Saul Dibb and Matt Charman, with Dibb directing. Production began to move forward in 2012, with Michelle Williams starring as Lucille Angellier alongside Kristin Scott Thomas as her mother-in-law, and Matthias Schoenaerts as Bruno von Falk. Filming began in Belgium and Paris in June 2013 and the film was released in 2015.

Since 1974, Philadelphia Green has supported the development and ongoing care of community gardens, neighborhood parks, and public green spaces in Philadelphia. Working in partnership with neighborhood residents, community organizations, and city agencies, the program uses greening as a community building tool. Additionally, it educates people to make the city a more livable place though horticulture. Proceeds from the annual Philadelphia Flower Show‚Äîalong with support from foundations, corporations, government agencies, and individuals‚Äîhelp fund Philadelphia Green. In more than 400 community gardens, residents are tending plots, growing fresh produce, sharing food with neighbors, and discussing and resolving neighborhood issues. In 80 neighborhood parks, ‚Äúfriends of the park‚Äù groups work with Philadelphia Green to revitalize their parks. Philadelphia Green also manages the renovation and long-term maintenance of of high profile landscapes in the downtown area including the grounds of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Azalea Garden, the 26th Street corridor (connecting the airport to Center City), and Penn‚Äôs Landing along the Delaware River. Philadelphia Green also works with the City of Philadelphia to address the problem of vacant land, a serious blight that depresses community property values. To date, more than 3,000 lots, once vacant, abandoned, and blighted as a result of persistent illegal dumping, are now clean and green spaces with lawns and trees that are maintained on a regular basis. The goal is to turn former liabilities into new community assets. Lastly, the work of Philadelphia Green is having a significant economic impact on real estate values. In two recent studies by the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School, research indicates that planting street trees increases the value of adjacent homes by nearly 10 percent. And the cleaning and greening of vacant lots has a much larger impact‚Äîincreasing the value of nearby homes by at least 30 percent. Clearly, quality open space in our urban environments is a wise investment. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society‚Äôs urban greening program, Philadelphia Green, works with residents, community organizations, and public and private entities to create and restore open spaces in the city‚Äôs neighborhoods, downtown area, and at its gateways.

The MPC&A; Program is part of the U.S. Department of Energy's nonproliferation program, under the National Nuclear Security Administration. This program seeks to improve the security of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons material through upgrades to material protection and material control and accounting at nuclear sites in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. Since the program's inception as part of the Department of Defense's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, it has improved the security on thousands of tons of weapons grade nuclear material in the FSU. The Issue After the Cold War, there were large quantities of enriched uranium and plutonium-239 left in Russia. The problem was that due to the weakened economy of the Soviet Union, Russia's stockpile of nuclear waste and weaponry were left for free picking by anyone, which included possible terrorists. This security threat is a direct possibility of the fall of the FSU (Former Soviet Union) because security implemented before the fall also fell with it. To help solve this and alleviate risk, U.S. Congress passed the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act in 1991. This act would give the President the authority to work with the FSU to help dispose of and protect their nuclear devices. The part of this program involving providing security upgrades for the FSU's nuclear weapon materials would come to be known as MPC&A.; \\"Nuclear Weapons in Russia: Safety, Security, and Control Issues\\" As Russia and the United States left the Cold War and began to see the threat of their weaponry, they both made agreements to help dispose and protect the Russians' armaments. The MPC&A; was not the only agreement to settle the protection of these weapons. The U.S provided assistance worth up to two billion in American currency through the START program. This assistance was to help Russia transport their nuclear materials back to safe locations in Russia. The MPC&A; came into place to help protect those nuclear materials from outside sources. This cooperation of Russia and the U.S allowed some ease between the nations and restore a level of security against nuclear threat. Medeiros, Evan S. \\"Gore-Chermomyrdin Commission Expands Nuclear Security Cooperation.(Russia-US Cooperation on Nuclear Materials Security).\\" Arms Control Today 5 (1996): 25. Print. In an effort to improve the security of nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, then Acting Secretary of Energy Charles Curtis and Russian Minister of Atomic Energy and co-chairman of Atomic Energy Policy Viktor Mikhailov, one of the commission's eight committees signed a joint statement on February 7; that reaffirms each side's commitment to the bilateral nuclear materials protection, control and accounting (MPC&A;) program and includes the Instrument Research Institute (Lytkarino) in the program beginning this year. As a clear indication of the progress that has been made thus far, the sides noted that 15 Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MIN ATOM) facilities were incorporated into the MPC&A; program during the previous three sessions of the Gore Chernomyrdin Commission. Six additional MINATOM facilities also engage in MPC&A; related activities through a cooperative program between each side's nuclear laboratories, known as the \\"lab to lab\\" program. A total of 44 sites in the former Soviet Union participate in the MPC&A; program. Doyle, Jim. \\"Improving Nuclear Materials Security in the Former Soviet Union: Next Steps for the MPC&A; Program. (Nuclear Material Protection, Control and Accounting).\\" Arms Control Today 2 (1998): 12. Print. As Doyle points out, there were many challenges that the MPC&A; program faced during the 1990s. Some of which included an unexpected abundance of nuclear waste that needed to be handled and disposed of in Russia during the late 1990s. It also had difficulties with gaining enough financial support for nuclear facilities, while facing imposed taxes. This is also at the same time that they are working on this system between Russia, which is coming out of the Soviet Union. As a result of this, there‚Äôs trouble with the MPC&A; and moving the Russians away from its earlier habits in nuclear security. Following these difficulties, Doyle also points out that the MPC&A; program received $137 million in 1998 as aid to remedy the situations.

The structure was at first known as Zeltner's Hall and was surrounded by a picnic park. Following the sale of the entertainment and meeting hall by the Zeltner family, the property was called Niblo's Garden, a familiar name borrowed from an early New York opera house on Broadway, near Prince Street that was razed in 1895. The building was used as a meeting hall by politicians and union members, and served variously as an entertainment hall, skating venue, and amusement park until its destruction by fire in 1929. Noted activities Judge William Jay Gaynor and the principal Tammany Hall political machine nominees spoke at a public meeting under the auspices of the Taxpayers‚Äô Protective Union, held at Niblo's Garden, 170th Street and Third Avenue, on October 28, 1909, and on October 21, 1913, mayoral candidate John A. Hennessy spoke to a Niblo's Garden audience of more than 3,000, charging that Tammany candidate Judge Edward E. McCall bought his Supreme Court position. A riot erupted at the hall and park on June 6, 1914, when more than 200 members of the Bronx Bakers and Confectioners‚Äô Union were involved in late-night fight following the group's annual Summer Night picnic. Rioters used beer bottles and chairs as weapons during a disturbance that erupted in the open air garden at the rear of the dance hall. Several injuries were reported both by bakers and responding Sheriff Deputies, but no one was hospitalized. A December 17, 1916 fight at Niblo's Garden led to a panic among some 500 dance patrons when guns were fired and responding police were attacked. Six arrests were made after the incident, which apparently erupted when hall security officers told several youths to discontinue their ‚Äúextreme styles of dancing.‚Äù A 1920 disturbance involved fifty men battling for their garments in the coat check room at Niblo's Garden, the Bronx, resulting in a call to the Bathgate Avenue police station. The crowd was moved to the police station, where twenty-five stolen property complaints were made before the incident was finally sorted and garments returned to proper owners with the exception of a single missing coat. A sales notice in July, 1922 transferring the property to Assets Funding Corporation described Niblo's Garden as ‚Äúfronting 92 feet on Third Avenue and 323 feet on East 170th by 170 feet in depth. It consists of about sixteen lots with a three-story building, 92 by 150, which will be used for an entertainment hall, skating, amusement park, etc.‚Äù However, an August 5, 1922 announcement marked the sale of Niblo's Garden at the ‚Äúsoutheast corner of Third Avenue and 170th Street‚Äù by W. C. Reeves & Co. to the newly formed corporation ‚ÄúClaremont Palace Garden, Inc., which will continue it as a dancing place,‚Äù under the incorporators, Donato Piciulo, Joseph Blum, and George Axelrad. In 1924 French societies in New York celebrated Bastille Day, July 14, at the Bronx Lyceum. French war veterans and all French societies of the metropolitan district, thirty-five in all, organized the event. The Starlight Athletic Club sponsored an amateur boxing tournament in the building in October 1926. A program of ten bouts, which included New York bantamweight champion Eddie Reid, was held. Following a walkout called by Allied Council of Cleaners and Dyers in February 1928, union organization meetings were held in many locales, including the Lyceum, and in July 1928 New York City supporters of William III of England marched to the building from Bronx Avenue, in celebration of the 238th anniversary of the Battle of Boynton. Political speeches were made followed by an evening of dancing. Destruction Three firemen were burned by a fire which destroyed the Bronx Lyceum in an early morning blaze on March 3, 1929. The fire began around 3:45 a.m., several hours after a dance by the Lena Lang Circle of the Foresters of America had concluded. It threatened to spread to the warehouse of the Bronx Drug Company, where large quantities of chemicals were stored. The structure was described as being an old three-story wood and stucco, which was the cradle of the careers of many politicians. The smoke drove forty-eight families in the tenement across the way, at 581 East 170th Street, to the street. Firemen of Engine Company 50, stationed on the roof, wet the fire down. The building was designed by architect Louis Falk, New York architect.

History Eyl is the site of many historical artifacts and structures. Along with a rock shelter in the southern town of Buur Heybe, it is the seat of the first professional archaeological excavation in the country.Peter Robertshaw, A History of African archaeology, (J. Currey: 1990), p.103. Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's historic Daarta Sayyidka Dervish fort in Eyl. At the turn of the twentieth century, the city served as a bastion for the Dervish forces of Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (\\"Mad Mullah\\"). Several forts remain from this period, in addition to colonial edifices built by the Italians. Following the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, foreign trawlers began to illegally fish in the unpatrolled waters off of Eyl's coastline. Piracy subsequently emerged, as fishermen banded together to protect their livelihood. However, by 2010, intensive security operations by Puntland military forces coupled with community-led initiatives managed to force out the pirates from their operating centers in the hamlet as well as adjacent settlements. In March 2012, the Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) dispatched a unit of officers and support elements to Eyl at the request of the municipal authorities. The move was intended to ensure permanent security in the area and to support the local administration. To this end, PMPF soldiers were slated to establish a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in the town earmarked for counter-piracy activities, to begin construction of a logistics airstrip, and to engage in water-drilling. In December 2014, Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali laid the foundation stone for the new PMPF base in Eyl, which occupies an area of 300 square meters on land donated by the municipality. Municipality Town affairs are managed by the Eyl Municipality. As of March 2012, the city authority is led by Mayor Muse Osman Yusef. Demographics Eyl has a population of around 21,700 inhabitants. The broader Eyl District has a total population of 32,345 residents. Services As of 2012, the town has one general hospital serving residents. Plans are underway to expand delivery. In April 2012, community leaders and civil society representatives met with Italian Ambassador to Somalia, Andrea Mazzella, to discuss strategies for ameliorating local health and education services. In October 2014, the Puntland government in conjunction with the local Kaalo NGO and UN-HABITAT launched a new regional census to gather basic information in order to facilitate social service planning and development, as well as tax collection in remote areas. According to senior Puntland officials, a similar survey was already carried out in towns near the principal Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway. The new census initiative is slated to begin in the Eyl District, in addition to the Bayla District and Jariban District. Education Eyl has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 13 primary schools in the Eyl District. Among these are Qarxis Primary, Horsed, Kabal and Xasbahal. Secondary schools in the area include Eyl Secondary. Economy Prior to the start of the civil war, Eyl was one of the chief fishing hubs in Somalia. Tuna, lobster, and other high value marine stock were harvested locally for the domestic and international seafood markets. The Puntland authorities have since endeavoured to work with the townspeople to rebuild the industry and normalize trade. As of 2012, several new development projects are slated to be carried out in the town, with the Italian government pledging to support them. In September 2013, Puntland Minister of Fisheries Mohamed Farah Adan also announced that the Puntland government plans to open two new marine training schools in Eyl and Bandar Siyada (Qaw), another northeastern coastal town. The institutes are intended to buttress the regional fisheries industry and enhance the skill set of the Ministry's personnel and local fishermen. In March 2015, the Ministry of Labour, Youth and Sports in conjunction with the European Union and World Vision launched the Nugal Empowerment for Better Livelihood Project in the Eyl, Garowe, Dangorayo, Godobjiran and Burtinle districts of Puntland. The three-year initiative is valued at $3 million EUR, and is part of the New Deal Compact for Somalia. It aims buttress the regional economic sector through business support, training and non-formal education programs, community awareness workshops, and mentoring and networking drives. Media Media outlets serving Eyl include the Garowe-based Radio Garowe, the sister outlet to Garowe Online. The broadcaster launched a new local FM station in March 2012. Transportation In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) announced a project to connect Eyl and other littoral towns in Puntland to the main regional highway. The 750 km thoroughfare links major cities in the northern part of Somalia, such as Bosaso, Galkayo and Garowe, with towns in the south. In May 2014, Puntland Vice President Abdihakim Abdullahi Haji Omar arrived in Eyl to inaugurate a newly completed 27 kilometer paved road between the town and adjacent hamlets. For air transportation, Eyl is served by the Eyl Airport. Notable residents *Hirsi Bulhan Farah ‚Äì Former Minister in the civilian government of the 1960s, a political prisoner.

Life  = Childhood = Born as Lensey Chao in Beijing, China, the daughter of linguist Yuenren Chao and physician Buwei Yang Chao. The family moved frequently in China. In 1937, the Chaos were living in Nanjing, and fled westward in the face of the Japanese Invasion. They eventually made their way to Hawaii, then Cambridge, Massachusetts. When she moved to the United States from China at age of nine, Lensey Chao initially knew no English. Because it used the same numerals regardless of languages, math seemed easier to her than other school subjects. = Education and later life = Lensey Chao attended Radcliffe College and the University of California at Berkeley,. where her father was a professor of Asian Studies, to study mathematics. Here she met and married Isaac Namioka, a fellow graduate student who was born in Japan. Namioka ended up earning a bachelor's and a master's degree in math. The Namiokas moved to Ithaca, New York, where Isaac taught at Cornell University, and Lensey taught at Wells College. The family moved to Seattle in 1964, when Isaac accepted a position at the University of Washington. Namioka has two daughters, Aki (born 1959) and Michi (born 1961).  Work  Namioka's first love has been reading and writing adventure stories. As a child, she read Chinese martial arts novels, as well as Sherlock Holmes stories and The Three Musketeers. At the age of eight, she wrote her first book on pieces of scrap paper that she sewed together with thread. It was about a woman warrior called the Princess with a Bamboo Sword. In the 1970s, on a visit to Japan, Namioka visited Namioka Castle. The experience inspired her to learn more about the Samurai. This study culminated in The Samurai and the Long-nosed Devils, which was published in 1976. Namioka expanded this book into a whole series of books about samurai in sixteenth-century Japan. Namioka has also written a series of books about a Chinese American family named Yang, and several books about young women and girls facing difficult choices, as well as travel books about Japan and China. =Books= * The Samurai and the Long-Nosed Devils (New York: D.

Her name has an especially unusual property for a Chinese person born in China: there are no Chinese characters to represent it. When Lensey's father was cataloguing all of the phonemes used in Chinese he noted that there were two syllables which were possible in the Chinese language, but which were used in no Chinese words. These syllables could be written in English as \\"len\\" and \\"sey.\\" His third daughter was born soon after, so he named her \\"Lensey.\\" Sources Meet the Author Lensey Namioka, eduplace.com Lensey Namioka, goodreads.com Biography Lensey Namioka, learner.org References External links * archived 2013 Category:1929 births Category:American children's writers Category:Chinese children's writers Category:Writers from Beijing Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:American writers of Chinese descent Category:Living people ","title":"Lensey Namioka"},{"id":"8051432","text":"Eggert Magn√∫sson (born 20 February 1947) is an Icelandic businessman and former President of the Football Association of Iceland and ex-chairman of West Ham United.

He was most famous for the long-running series Le G√©nie des alpages (The Genius of the Mountain Pastures). Biography 180px Peyzaret grew up as an admirer of Herg√© and Andr√© Franquin, but studied Applied Arts for six years in Paris before meeting the BD industry, by arriving at the workshop of Raymond Po√Øvet. This led to an introduction to Ren√© Goscinny and starting work for Pilote magazine in 1971, making his debut with the gags series Contes √† Rebours. The unused boards of this strip later formed the basis of his first album, Au loup!. While at Pilote, he began his most famous work, Le G√©nie des alpages in 1973. This series features an old and a young shepherd, their talking shepherd's dog, a flock of mad sheep and other abnormal characters behaving unpredictably in alpine surroundings. When Pilote ceased publication, the series were issued directly into albums. He also held a long associations with several of the other francophone serial magazines of this period. Naphtal√®ne was also published in Pilote, Porfirio et Gabriel in Le Canard Sauvage and Circus, Jehanne d'Arc in M√©tal Hurlant, Robin des Bo√Ætes in Fluide Glacial, and Les Mirrois de Marguerite and Ala et Lolli were created for the Spirou magazine supplement Le Trombone Illustr√©. In 1985 he began the strip Histoires D√©plac√©es in (√Ä SUIVRE) satirizing the ongoing Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. These were collected in the 1987 album named Le char de l'√©tat d√©rape sur le sentier de la guerre (The State's Tank Slips on the Path of War). A few instances of F'Murr translated into the English language were printed in Heavy Metal and National Lampoon magazine in the late 70s. Eight albums of Le Genie des Alpages were published in Norway in the 1980s by A/S Hjemmet-Serieforlaget under the name of Ullkorn, which is a pun on \\"gullkorn\\", a Norwegian word for aphorism - i.e. corn being found as gold (gull), or in this instance, wool (ull). The first four albums of \\"Le Genie des Alpages\\" were published in Denmark in the 1980s by Serieforlaget under the name of \\"F√•rf√¶ngelighedens marked\\", which is a pun on \\"f√•r\\", the name for sheep, and \\"Forf√¶ngelighedens marked\\" (Vanity Fair).

The reservoir was constructed in 1796 in order to feed the Charnwood Forest Canal, which has long since vanished. The first dam constructed was an earthworks one, and this failed on 20 February 1799. In eleven minutes the reservoir was empty and as a result local farmland was ruined, sheep were drowned, and much of Shepshed and nearby Loughborough were affected by flood waters. The dam was repaired in 1801, but the canal was no longer commercially viable. The present gravity dam was constructed in 1906 and was officially opened by the first Mayor of Loughborough Joseph Griggs. In 1957 the dam felt the effects of a magnitude 5.3 earthquake. The tremors caused heavy coping stones to shift and cracks appeared in the faces of the dam. The reservoir has a plant community on its margins which is unique in the Midlands and only found in a few northern sites. Its unusual mix of flora includes Juncus filiformis at its most southern locations, and the lake itself has native white-clawed crayfish, where it is isolated from the invasive American signal crayfish. One Barrow Lane crosses the south-eastern end of the reservoir. The lane is carried by the One Barrow Viaduct, a blue brick construction consisting of three arches. Previously it served as the entranceway drive to the now demolished One Barrow Lodge Farm. This is a public footpath which eventually leads you out on the Oaks Road, near Mount St Bernard Abbey. The dam and reservoir is managed by Severn Trent and is currently in a redundant state. There is strictly no access to the dam which is on private land - a part of the Grace Dieu & Longcliffe Estate.

The Israeli Government has registered same-sex marriages performed abroad for some purposes since 2006. However, marriages performed in Israel are only available from one of the 15 religious marriage courts recognized by the state, none of which permit same- sex marriage under their respective auspices. Consequently, Israelis who desire to have their same-sex marriage recognized by the Israeli Government must first marry outside Israel, in a jurisdiction where such marriages are legal, and then register upon returning home, though these are not treated as marriages by Israel. Cohabitating same-sex and inter-faith couples in Tel Aviv may register as married in that city. History The religious authority for Jewish marriages is the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and there are parallel authorities for Christians, Muslims and Druze, with a total of 15 religious courts. These regulate all marriages and divorces for their own communities. Currently, they all oppose same-sex marriages. If the views of one of these bodies were to change, however, it would be legal for members of that religious community to enter into same-sex marriages in Israel. Same-sex wedding ceremonies without legal significance can be conducted in Israel, which, coupled with legally recognized foreign marriages, allows for both same-sex wedding ceremonies in Israel and legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Israel, on condition that the marriage certificates come from another country. The first unofficial municipal wedding took place in August 2009 following the Tel Aviv Pride Parade; five couples were married by Mayor Ron Huldai. The traditional verse for wedding ceremonies from Psalm 137, \\"If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither...\\" was used, but replacing Jerusalem with Tel Aviv, Israel's most gay-friendly city. On 4 June 2019, as a protest against the lack of legal recognition of same-sex unions, 23 same-sex couples held an unofficial mass wedding in Tel Aviv. =Foreign marriages= Same-sex marriages performed abroad in a jurisdiction where such marriages are legal can be recorded at the Israeli Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, according to a November 2006 High Court of Justice ruling which defined such records as strictly \\"for statistical purposes\\", thereby avoiding official recognition of same-sex marriages by the state. The case was filed by five male Israeli couples married in Canada. The ruling was strongly condemned by conservative politicians, including by United Torah Judaism MK Moshe Gafni, who called the ruling \\"the destruction of the family unit in the state of Israel\\". In December 2012, a Ramat Gan family court granted a same-sex married couple a legal divorce. This was the first decision of its kind, setting a non-binding precedent. In December 2016, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an instruction to Israel's Interior Ministry to consider applications for citizenship by same-sex and opposite-sex couples equally under the same terms. The same-sex spouse of an Israeli will now be able to claim Israeli citizenship at the same speed as an opposite-sex spouse. Previously, same-sex couples had to wait up to seven years, and would generally only be granted permanent residency rather than citizenship. The process was far quicker for opposite-sex couples. The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed before the High Court of Justice by the Gay Fathers Association. In June 2020, it was reported that Tel Aviv will explicitly recognize both civil unions and same-sex marriage from outside Israel. Same-sex marriages solemnised overseas are not recognised by religious authorities in Israel. Statistics In 2018, more than 400 same-sex couples registered their foreign weddings in Israel. =Unregistered cohabitation= Despite the fact that same-sex marriage (or opposite-sex civil marriage) is not legal in Israel, unmarried same-sex and opposite-sex couples have equal access to many of the rights of marriage in the form of \\"unregistered cohabitation\\" (Hebrew: ; Arabic: ) status, similar to common-law marriage. =Legislation= In February 2009, MK Nitzan Horowitz (Meretz) introduced a civil marriage bill which included provisions for same-sex marriages. The bill was rejected in May 2012 in a 39 to 11 vote, with 70 not attending. In March 2010, the Knesset passed the Civil Union Law for Citizens with no Religious Affiliation, 2010 (Hebrew: ; Arabic: ). The law allows opposite-sex couples to form a civil union in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion. In October 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the law. By 2016, only 121 couples had entered into civil unions.Expected progress towards civil unions not realized In June 2013, Hatnuah MKs, led by Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, introduced a bill that would have provided for civil unions in Israel for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. In October 2013, Yesh Atid MKs, led by Finance Minister Yair Lapid, introduced a similar bill. Meretz MK Zehava Gal-On introduced a civil marriage bill which included provisions for same-sex marriages. On 8 July 2015, the Knesset rejected the civil union bill proposed by Yesh Atid and the civil marriage bill proposed by Meretz. The Knesset voted 39-50 to reject the two bills. Hatnuah's bill was rejected by the Knesset on 22 February 2016 in a 40-47 vote. A same-sex marriage bill failed in the Knesset in June 2018 by three votes, 42 to 39. The bill's sponsor, MK Stav Shaffir from The Zionist Union, blamed its failure on MKs from the Coalition Government who promised publicly that they would vote in favor, but instead chose to vote against or abstain from voting. The vote happened shortly after an estimated 250,000 people marched in the Tel Aviv Pride parade and an opinion poll found a large majority of Israelis in support of same-sex marriage. Signs supporting same- sex marriage in Israel =Legal challenges= In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognize same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages. The court did not immediately rule against the validity of the petition. In January 2017, at a public hearing and in its capacity as the High Court of Justice, two justices of the court implied the issue of civil and same-sex marriage is the responsibility of the Knesset, rather than the courts. The court handed down its ruling on 31 August 2017, determining the issue was the responsibility of the Knesset, and not the judiciary. =Knesset recognition of same-sex partners= After the April 2019 elections and the election of a record five openly LGBT MKs, it was announced that the Knesset would amend \\"husband and wife\\" to \\"couple\\" on all its official documents, and would grant more rights to partners of LGBT legislators, such as permanent entry passes to the Knesset, authorization to drive Knesset-issued cars assigned to their partners, and invitations to all official ceremonies and events. Political support Political parties and alliances represented in the Knesset as of 2020 that have expressed support for same-sex marriage include Blue and White, Labor-Gesher-Meretz, Kulanu, Yesh Atid and Hadash.2013 Elections: Which parties support same-sex marriage?, Channel 2 News, January 8th, 2013 Some former parties, such as Hatnuah, also supported same-sex marriage. *Likud: The official position has not been made clear.

In 2019, the Labor Party made the legalization of same-sex marriage a condition for joining a coalition government. *Blue and White: The political alliance supports LGBT rights.

Meretz and Hadash have long had gay divisions. In 2009, Kadima, led by Tzipi Livni, became the first major party of the center to establish a gay division. Labor and Likud soon followed suit. Yesh Atid also has a gay division. In February 2013, Mayor of Tel Aviv Ron Huldai expressed his support of same-sex marriage. In May 2015, following Ireland's legalization of same-sex marriage through popular vote, Huldai reiterated his support, calling on the Knesset to act on the issue.Tel Aviv Mayor Huldai: Israel should follow Ireland‚Äôs lead on gay marriage, Jerusalem Post, 28.5.2015 Public opinion According to a poll conducted in August 2009, 61% of Israelis supported equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, with 31% opposed. Furthermore, 60% supported joint adoption by same-sex couples, with 34% opposed. A June 2016 poll showed 76% supporting civil unions or same-sex marriage, including 46% of Religious Zionists and 16% of Haredi Jews. A Rafi Smith Institute poll conducted in June 2017 asked Israelis: \\"Do you think same-sex couples should be permitted to marry or have civil unions in Israel?\\" In total, 79% expressed support for either same-sex marriage or civil unions.

The term Great Migration usually refers to the migration in this period of English Puritans to Massachusetts and the West Indies, especially Barbados. They came in family groups rather than as isolated individuals and were motivated chiefly by a quest for freedom to practice their Puritan religion. Town sign for Hingham, Norfolk, England showing Puritans who left to found Hingham, Massachusetts Context King James I of England made some efforts to reconcile the Puritan clergy who had been alienated by the lack of change in the Church of England. Puritans embraced Calvinism (Reformed theology) with its opposition to ritual and an emphasis on preaching, a growing sabbatarianism, and preference for a presbyterian system of church polity, as opposed to the episcopal polity of the Church of England which had also preserved medieval canon law almost intact. They opposed church practices that resembled Roman Catholic ritual. This religious conflict worsened after Charles I became king in 1625, and Parliament increasingly opposed his authority. In 1629, Charles dissolved Parliament with no intention of summoning a new one, in an ill-fated attempt to neutralize his enemies there‚Äîwhich included numerous Puritans. With the religious and political climate so unpromising, many Puritans decided to leave the country. Some of the migrants were also English expatriate communities (of non-conformists and Separatists) from the Dutch Republic who had fled to the European mainland since the 1590s. The Winthrop Fleet of 1630 included 11 ships led by the flagship Arbella, and it delivered some 700John Winthrop, The History of New England from 1630 to 1649, Vol. I, 2nd edition (James Savage, ed.), Little, Brown and Company publ. 1853, page 442 passengers to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Migration continued until Parliament was reconvened in 1640, at which point the scale dropped off sharply. The English Civil War began in 1641, and some colonists returned from New England to England to fight on the Puritan side. Many then remained in England, since Oliver Cromwell backed Parliament as an Independent. The Great Migration saw 80,000 people leave England, roughly 20,000 migrating to each of four destinations: Ireland, New England, the West Indies, and the Netherlands. The immigrants to New England came from every English county except Westmorland; nearly half were from East Anglia. The colonists to New England were mostly families with some education who were leading relatively prosperous lives in England. One modern writer, however, estimates that 7 to 10 percent of the colonists returned to England after 1640, including about a third of the clergymen.Susan Hardman Moore, Pilgrims: New World Settlers and the Call of Home (2007). Religious societies in New England Pilgrims Going to Church by George Henry Boughton (1867) A group of separatist Puritans had fled from England to the Netherlands because they were unhappy with the insufficient reforms of the English church, and to escape persecution. After a few years, however, they began to fear that their children would lose their English identities, so they traveled to the New World in 1620 and established Plymouth Plantation. They and the later wave of Puritan immigrants created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit, and politically innovative culture that is still present within the United States. They hoped that this new land would serve as a \\"redeemer nation.\\" They fled England and attempted to create a \\"nation of saints\\" in America, an intensely religious, thoroughly righteous community designed to be an example for all of Europe and the rest of the world.John Winthrop, A Model of Christian Charity, Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1838), 3rd series 7:31-48. Roger Williams preached religious toleration, separation of church and state, and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished in 1635 from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded Providence Plantations, which became the Rhode Island Colony. The Rhode Island Colony provided a haven for Anne Hutchinson, who had been tried and banished from Massachusetts Bay in 1638 for her Antinomian beliefs.Edwin S. Gaustad, Roger Williams (2005). Quakers were also expelled from Massachusetts, but they were welcomed in Rhode Island.Carla Gardina Pestana, Quakers and Baptists in Colonial Massachusetts (1991). In 1658, a group of Jews were welcomed to settle in Newport; they were fleeing the Inquisition in Spain and Portugal but had not been permitted to settle elsewhere. The Newport congregation is now referred to as Jeshuat Israel and is the second-oldest Jewish congregation in the United States.

Permission to construct the reservoir was granted via a water order in 1960 and Thruscross was completed in 1966, much later than the other three reservoirs which date back to the nineteenth century. The construction of the reservoir flooded the village of West End, which was already largely derelict following the decline of the flax industry.

The remains of a flax mill can be seen at the edge of the reservoir, and more of the village has been revealed at times of drought, such as the summers of 1989 and 1990. The work to build the reservoir included clearing trees, removing sacred items from the church and exhuming bodies from the graveyard. The reservoir is the property of Yorkshire Water, which manages it for the benefit of walkers, anglers and wildlife. The section of the river below the reservoir is used for Whitewater kayaking when water is released by Yorkshire Water. In the novel In a Dry Season by the English-born, Canadian-based crime writer Peter Robinson, the fictional village of Hobb's End, flooded by the creation of the Thornfield Reservoir, is exposed during a drought, leading to the discovery of a body.

Kneebone et al., eds., Dictionary of Virginia Biography (Richmond, 2006), 3:27-28. Early and family life Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dabney Carr, 1826. Library of Congress Martha Peyton Jefferson gave birth to this Dabney Carr at Spring Forest, a Goochland County, Virginia, plantation just three weeks before the death of his father, also named Dabney Carr. His father was a close friend of Thomas Jefferson; his mother was Jefferson's sister; his elder brothers Peter Carr (who served in the Virginia General Assembly) and Samuel Carr received posthumous notoriety as possible fathers of Sally Hemings's children. Jefferson took an active role in the guiding and educating his fatherless nephew, as would his friend James Madison while Jefferson was pursuing diplomatic duties in France. The younger Carr attended Hampden-Sydney College from 1786 to 1789 and returned home to study law with William Wirt, who was just one year older. The two men (and Francis Walker Gilmer) remained friends for the rest of their lives. An extensive collection of their letters can be found in the Manuscripts Department, Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This Dabney Carr married his paternal cousin, Elizabeth Carr, in June 1802. Although both their sons died young (Dabney Jefferson Carr at age 9), their daughters Nancy Addison Conrad (1803-1868)and Jane Cary Henderson (1807-1859) would marry and have children, and notwithstanding a satirical essay discussed below, Carr educated his daughters. Career Carr started his private legal practice in Albemarle and adjoining counties in 1796. In 1802 Albemarle voters elected him commonwealth's attorney (prosecutor), and Carr served for a decade, until resigning in March 1811 to become an interim judge when William H. Cabell was elevated to what was later known as the Virginia Supreme Court (and on which Carr would also later serve). Although the legislature ended up electing another man to fill that vacancy, it created a new district court in chancery and elected Carr as Chancellor for the Winchester District in January 1812, so he moved to Winchester.Kneebone Meanwhile, Carr published several articles on non-legal topics. Using the pseudonym Obediah Squaretoes, Carr contributed a satirical article to William Wirt's The Old Bachelor (1814). Although he owned no slaves in the 1800 census and only 5 slaves in 1810, in the 1820 census (before his daughters married), Carr owned 22 slaves and his household also included 8 other white people.1820 U.S. Federal Census for Albermarle County On February 24, 1824, Virginia legislators elected Carr a judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals and he moved to the outskirts of Richmond and held this office until his death. In April 1825 he declined Jefferson's offer to become a professor of law at the University of Virginia, believing himself unqualified to teach. He became known as hardworking, as well as somewhat eccentric for the long walks he favored on a physician's recommendation, particularly because his exercise also involved flinging his arms. In the 1830 census, Judge Carr owned 5 slaves.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Henrico County Death Judge Dabney Carr died at his home on January 8, 1837 and is interred in Richmond's Shockoe Hill Cemetery.Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia References Category:Justices of the Virginia Supreme Court Category:1773 births Category:1837 deaths Category:Virginia lawyers Category:Virginia state court judges Category:People from Goochland County, Virginia Category:Hampden‚ÄìSydney College alumni Category:Jefferson family Category:Virginia colonial people Category:Burials in Virginia ","title":"Dabney Carr"},{"id":"8051520","text":"Edward S.

It defines two mechanisms for identifying the protocol carried in ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) frames. It replaces RFC 1483, a standard data link access protocol supported by DSL modems. RFC 2684 describes two encapsulation mechanisms for network traffic: Virtual Circuit Multiplexing and LLC Encapsulation. Either mechanism carries either routed or bridged protocol data units, and DSL modems often include a setting for RFC 1483 bridging. This is distinct from other \\"bridge modes\\" commonly found in combined DSL modems and routers, which turn off the router portion of the DSL modem. In VC Multiplexing (VC-MUX), the hosts agree on the high-level protocol for a given circuit. It has the advantage of not requiring additional information in a packet, which minimises the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer; nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate virtual circuit for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each virtual circuit, customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost. In LLC Encapsulation the hosts use a single virtual circuit for multiple protocols. This has the advantage of allowing all traffic over the same circuit, but the disadvantage of requiring each packet to contain octets that identify the protocol type, which adds overhead. The scheme also has the disadvantage that packets from all protocols travel with the same delay and priority. RFC 2684 specifies that hosts can choose between the two methods of using AAL5. Both the sender and receiver must agree on how the circuit will be used, and the agreement may involve manual configuration. Furthermore, the standards suggest that when hosts choose to include type information in the packet, they should use a standard IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) header, followed by a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header if necessary. The AAL5 trailer does not include a type field. Thus, an AAL5 frame is not self-identifying. This means that either the two hosts at the ends of a virtual circuit must agree a priori that the circuit will be used for one specific protocol (e.g., the circuit will only be used to send IP datagrams), or the two hosts at the ends of a virtual circuit must agree a priori that some octets of the data area will be reserved for use as a type field to distinguish packets containing one protocol's data from packets containing another protocol's data.

Nicknamed \\"Princess Pat\\", she was the youngest singer ever to star at the Metropolitan Opera. Life magazine (February 21, 1944) Early years An only child, Patrice Beverly Munsil (she later changed the spelling of her surname) was born and raised until age 15 in Spokane, Washington. Her father, Audley J. Munsil, was a local dentist. She attended Lewis and Clark High School before leaving at age fifteen, accompanied by her mother, to study in New York City,The Dictionary of Opera, Charles Osborne, Macdonald & Co., London, UK; coached by Giacomo Spadoni (1884‚Äì1960). Career Munsel first sang at the Metropolitan at age 17 in March 1943. She made her official Metropolitan debut on December 4, 1943, aged 18, singing Philine in Mignon, for which won popular praise but poor critical reviews. Her first opera contract was for three years at $40,000 per year; with other appearances she was making around $100,000 annually. Perhaps best known for the roles of Adele in Die Fledermaus and Despina in Cosi Fan Tutte, Munsel sang 225 times at the Metropolitan Opera. Sir Rudolf Bing called her a \\"superb soubrette\\" and implied that she was the world's best. Her opera roles also included Rosina in The Barber of Seville and Gilda in Rigoletto. Her husband Robert C. Schuler (1917‚Äì2007) conceived and produced the ABC-TV primetime variety series The Patrice Munsel Show, which starred his wife, and was broadcast in the 1957‚Äì1958 season. Munsel appeared on many other TV shows during her career, including the role of Marietta (Countess d'Altena) in the January 15, 1955 live telecast of the operetta Naughty Marietta. She portrayed the title role in the 1953 film Melba, which chronicled the life of the great opera singer, Dame Nellie Melba. Munsel made frequent television appearances on The Bell Telephone Hour, and was the central singer in the Camp Fire Girls' famous TV commercial and song \\"Sing Around the Campfire (Join the Camp Fire Girls)\\", aired in the mid-1960s. A former Camp Fire Girl herself, she was also a spokeswoman for the organization. Munsel made her final performance for the Metropolitan Opera on January 28, 1958, in the title role in La P√©richole. She appeared on stage as a guest during the 1966 Gala Farewell to the old opera house at Broadway and 39th Street.
