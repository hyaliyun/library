Practically functioning as ungoverned terra nullius prior to the Svalbard Treaty of 1920, the Arctic Ocean archipelago dominated by glaciers and barren rock, is part of Norway, and hence Norwegian law applies. Under it, there is a sliding scale approach to cannabis legislation. Possession for personal use, defined as up to 15 grams, is punished with a fine of between roughly 1,500 and 15,000 Norwegian kroner. Possession of amounts larger than that is punished by jail, ranging from 6 months all the way up to 21 years. These laws are enforced by the Norwegian Police Service, the small Svalbard district of which is run by the Governor of Svalbard. Context With the exception of minor scientific stations, Svalbard has three main permanently inhabited settlements – the administrative capital Longyearbyen, the Russian coal mining town Barentsburg, and the small research settlement Ny-Ålesund. As of 1 July 2015, the archipelago's total population is 2,677 people, in addition to large numbers of temporary workers and tourists. The use of illegal drugs is a small but growing issue within Svalbard's society, according to the Longyearbyen Community Council. While there is reportedly little evidence of an active narcotics trade in Longyearbyen, authorities are encouraged to pay close attention to the increasing liberalization of opinions relating to drug use among Svalbard's youths, and ample amounts of substance abuse prevention measures have been enacted. A 2013 survey has shown that cannabis consumption among youths on Svalbard is somewhat lower than among youths on the Norwegian mainland, although certainly still existent. Significantly, only 7% of those surveyed stated that a belief that they – if they wanted to – could procure cannabis within a couple of days, compared to 41% of youths on the mainland. 2011 bust In 2011 the police made one of Svalbard's first drug busts, in which a total of 11 people were apprehended under suspicion of both using and selling cannabis. They were charged with a total of 24 offenses, which resulted in a 26 percent rise in the regional crime rate that year. One of them was later expelled from the archipelago, and another given a preliminary warning of expulsion. That autumn, the Governor of Svalbard officially announced the presence of illegal drugs among \\"young adults\\" in Longyearbyen. Following a lengthy investigation, a similar drug bust was made in October 2015, when a multi-national group of 11 men and women in their twenties were arrested and charged with, primarily, possession of cannabis, with some suspicion of cocaine usage as well. Several of those apprehended were given fines ranging between 4,000 and 9,000 Norwegian kroner. Whether any of them are to be expelled from Svalbard is currently under investigation. Following this event, an online poll run by the local newspaper Svalbardposten showed that 86% of respondents favored expulsion for drug crimes, although some sentiment towards legalization or decriminalization was also found. The Governor of Svalbard, Kjerstin Askholt, stated that her administration has zero-tolerance policy towards illegal drugs, and \\"will do what we can to prevent a drugs culture from establishing itself here\\". Svalbard Global Seed Vault While cannabis is strictly illegal in Svalbard, there is one place in the archipelago that possesses an amount of it – the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. A seed bank located outside of Longyearbyen, the secure vault contains thousands of seeds from around the world, in order to ensure their preservation in case of other seed banks being destroyed or damaged during large-scale regional or global crises. Among the species of plant preserved in the vault are around 21,500 seeds belonging to the cannabis genus, donated in 2014. The seeds were provided by Alchimia, a Spanish seed bank.

He was a member of Arti et Amicitiae and is considered to be part of the Laren School, an offshoot of the Hague School,The Hague School is at the end of the typical dutch development during the time of the Realism and Romanticism. The art historians do speak of the Dutch eye of the impression of the landscape, the people and the unique atmosphere. which is an independent part of the international movement of impressionism.The independence begins with the choice of the themes, the colors and the dutch eyes of the interpretation.  Biography  Tending the Fire His father was Franz Wilhelm Heinrich Deutmann (1840–1906), a well known photographer. He studied painting with , a genre artist. After a brief stay in Germany in 1884, he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) from 1884 to 1887. During his studies at the academy he was a student of Prof. Charles Verlat. In 1891, due to financial difficulties, he returned to Amsterdam and took a position in his father's photography studio.Biographical notes @ De Valk Lexicon kunstenaars Laren- Blaricum By 1896, he had established himself as an artist and opened his own studio. Many of his works from this period have a sad feeling to them, and it is possible that he was suffering from depression. In 1892 he moved to the artists' colony in Laren.From the perspective of the art historian he belonged to the 2nd generation of this school. His Œuvre can be assigned to the Hague School of the first generation. Plein air painting in the company of his fellow artists seems to have cheered him up. His portraits and figures were more colorful and lightly rendered, although his interiors still had a touch of melancholy. After a few years his depression returned and he stayed in his studio, doing still lifes of flowers.The rediscovery of still-life as a subject belongs to Amsterdam Impressionism. His work was not as successful as most of his associates in the Laren School. After 1903, he went back to Amsterdam, but stayed there for only one year. Then he retired to Blaricum and lived in a house named \\"Heide-Weide\\" (Heide Meadows), which was later occupied by several other well-known artists and writers. After a long illness he died there in 1915, aged only forty-eight. Franz Deutmann was a member of Arti et Amicitiae and the .

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with revelations about Hydra. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Jed Whedon and DJ Doyle, and directed by Garry A. Brown. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell. The episode retcons the history of Hydra that was established in the films, tying it into the series' Inhuman storyline. \\"Many Heads, One Tale\\" originally aired on ABC on November 17, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 3.60 million viewers. Plot Confirming he knows Ward is looking for a secret Strucker family vault said to contain a secret great power, Malick orders his men to kill him. However Ward overpowers and tortures them, learning the vault is in Germany. Mack voices his concerns over Coulson's relationship with Price, but Coulson reveals that though he wants to trust Price, he has been planning a sting operation to unearth the ATCU's secrets. While Coulson gives Price a tour of the Playground, Daisy uses a device smuggled into the ATCU with Andrew to hack their mainframe, and Hunter and Morse visit to deal with the security breach, disguised as an FBI team. Morse sneaks away to investigate the part of the facility where the Inhumans are being held, but instead finds vitamin supplements containing Terrigen, discovering that they are given to all ATCU staff. She realises that the ATCU are keeping the Inhumans elsewhere and are not working on a cure for Terrigenesis, but are instead trying to activate more Inhumans. Updated on the situation, Coulson interrogates Price, suspecting she is Hydra, but she claims innocence of administering Terrigen to her staff, and reveals that Malick, her business partner, is responsible for overseeing the captured Inhumans. They realise that Malick has been removing the Inhumans to an unknown location, and is making more to serve him. Morse and Hunter are attacked by Malick's chief of security, the telekinetic Inhuman Giyera. After they subdue him, Banks helps them escape. Investigating the Distant Star symbol, Fitz and Simmons find variations over the centuries, and learn of a group who have been sending people through the Monolith for hundreds of years. Simmons becomes frustrated with Fitz for being so willing to help rescue Will, and he expresses his belief that they are cursed, because every time they have tried to express their feelings for one another something has interfered, such as Fitz nearly drowning or Simmons being sent to another planet. They kiss twice, the first being initiated by Fitz out of frustration, and the second being initiated by Simmons. By the way her head moves after the kiss, she is going for a third kiss, but Fitz breaks away, knocking a book off of the table. Simmons notices that one of the old Distant Star variants is identical to the symbol of Hydra. Price explains that she met Malick in 2001, when he was working with NASA on Project Distant Star. Meanwhile, Ward breaks into the Strucker vault and finds a waiting Malick, who shows him the family treasure: pieces of the Monolith carved centuries earlier. He claims that Red Skull did not create Hydra - the organisation was instead founded in ancient times by the worshippers of a powerful Inhuman, whose enemies feared him so much that they banished him to another world using the Monolith. Ever since then Hydra have been sending sacrifices to this Inhuman (the creature Will and Simmons fought against), and have been seeking a way to bring it back to Earth. Malick has also been building an army of Inhumans to serve the ancient creature. Ward agrees to help Malick rescue the Inhuman, in exchange for his help destroying SHIELD. Ward later tortures Andrew with mustard gas in a bid to make him transform into Lash. Production =Development= In November 2015, Marvel announced that the eighth episode of the season would be titled \\"Many Heads, One Tale\\", to be written by executive producer Jed Whedon and DJ Doyle, with Garry A. Brown directing. =Casting= In November 2015, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, Adrianne Palicki, Henry Simmons, and Luke Mitchell would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Daisy Johnson, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, Bobbi Morse, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, and Lincoln Campbell, respectively.

With the motto The Best in Live British Entertainment, the BTP is internationally focused with a British connection, as well as it is a long-standing member of the Singaporean British Chamber of Commerce and the European Chamber of Commerce. In 2012, the BTP also established a UK branch office, in order to work more closely with British playwrights, writers, actors, directors, musical directors, and set and costume designers. The company has produced and presented a series of highly successful British productions in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, UAE and the UK, and is currently looking to expand its production output in Hong Kong and India. Its aim is to continue bringing to the audience shows which feature stars and other prominent stage, television and film actors, or music performers, from London’s West End, as it has been the case with all its shows so far, and presenting them in world-class hotels and other venues. So far, the BTP has produced 21 plays and musicals, making it a largely active production company, as it has been steadily achieving at least 2 productions per year since its foundation. British Theatre Playhouse launched its branch office in Malaysia as the company has been bringing shows to Malaysia since 2005, so the new office will continue to work and grow the market.  Founding history  The founders of the British Theatre Playhouse are Cecilia Leong-Faulkner and John Faulkner. Cecilia and John met in Kuala Lumpur in 1987 when Cecilia was working for American Express International in Kuala Lumpur which sponsored the play Bedroom Farce by Sir Alan Ayckbourn CBE and John was appearing in a dinner-theatre play at The Regent Hotel for the late British actor and producer Derek Nimmo. The idea for the foundation of the BTP came to them over a dinner one evening back in 2002, two years before the foundation of the BTP in 2004, when a comment was made about the absence of British plays in Singapore. Cecilia has always enjoyed British theatre and music. Her love for the arts and culture sparked off in childhood, and one of her favourite magazines was Vogue, which introduced her to glossy lifestyle and people with interesting careers or hobbies. To her, art is culture, an expression of one’s dreams, inspiration, life and society. Cecilia is currently the Managing Director of the company. Previously, she worked as a Marketing Executive for American Express when she was living in Kuala Lumpur, then as a Marketing Manager for Wembley Stadium when she moved to live in London, then when she first moved to Singapore as a Marketing Manager for Magazines Inc., then as a Corporate Director of Marketing Communications for the luxury Banyan Tree Resorts and Spas again in Singapore, and as a Regional Advisor to the Association of Business Executives (ABE). At some point, she even formed her own marketing and PR firm called Cecilia Leong-Faulkner Marketing and PR Consultancy, and thus she worked for various clients including the Six Senses Hotels, Resorts and Spas, for fashion events with the Singapore Tourism Board, and for fashion designers such as Lawrence Steele, Neil Barrett and DSquared2. In addition to her background in magazine publishing with Magazines Inc., she has also been a freelance journalist writing articles for Singapore’s Women’s Weekly. She is a current Life Member of the Chinese Women's Association in Singapore, which is well-known for its fund-raising activities and currently sits on the Executive Committee as the Honorary Secretary. She also holds a Graduate Certificate in Hotel Management from Cornell University, one of the top Ivy League universities in the US, and a Diploma in Business Management from the Association of Business Executives (ABE). She is a committee member of the Leadership, Talent and Professional Development Business Group of Singapore's British Chamber of Commerce. John Faulkner (also known by his equity performer’s name Richard Denning) was born and raised in London, and saw his career starting in London when he graduated from the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. He has since worked as a producer, director and performer in London, UK, and in over twenty other countries. His London West End shows include e.g. Sir John Gielgud’s production of The Gay Lord Quex with Judi Dench, and Me And My Girl at the Apollo Theatre. In London too, he performed his cabaret act featuring the songs of Noël Coward, Cole Porter, George Gershwin and many others of that period, at The Ritz, The Dorchester and Claridges Hotel. His overseas work includes the recital programme Remembrance for Shakespeare in the US with Princess Grace of Monaco, which was also presented in London six months later in the presence of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and a year in Paris with Roland Petit and his wife Zizi Jeanmaire in their revue Zizi, Je T’Aime! at Le Casino de Paris. He produced and acted in Noël Coward’s Cowardy Custard in a national tour of Sweden in conjunction with the Swedish National Theatre. In Singapore, he co-founded the LaSalle School of Drama at LaSalle College of the Arts, and he was also the director of the Musical Theatre School, which offered recreational classes in song and dance for musical theatre to adults. He is currently the Artistic Director of the BTP. Thanks to their long- standing promotion of the British culture in the area through the British Theatre Playhouse, Cecilia and John were also invited to meet The Queen and Prince Philip on the occasion of the Queen’s State Visit to Singapore in March 2006. On another occasion, Cecilia was invited to meet Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton when they officially visited Singapore in September 2012. Further to the above, Cecilia also collaborated with the welfare charity The Mission to Seafarers and was thus invited to meet its Royal Patron, HRH Princess Anne, at a reception on board the Royal Albatross yacht on 3 November 2016.

It was built in the 18th century to house the city's administrative council, and it was subsequently used as the General Post Office and the Public Registry. The Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business, and it is officially known as Palazzo Zondadari. History The Banca Giuratale was originally a house which belonged to Dr. Gio Batta Piotto, and it was taken over by the treasury of the Order of St. John in 1665. In 1721, the Università, which was the local administrative council of Valletta, acquired the building in exchange for its original premises located across the street (now the Monte di Pietà). The building was subsequently reconstructed during the magistracy of Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari. The new building was designed by the architect Romano Carapecchia.UOM. p. 12. The Banca Giuratale in the 19th century, when it was the GPO The Banca Giuratale was renovated in 1762, during the magistracy of Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. Napoleon is said to have spent his last night in Malta, between 13 and 14 June 1798, at this building. The Banca Giuratale remained in use by the Università until that body was suppressed by Governor Thomas Maitland in 1818. In 1841, the Banca Giuratale became a post office when the Packet Office was transferred there from the Casa del Commun Tesoro in Piazza Tesoreria. The Island Post Office was also transferred into the Banca Giuratale on 1 April 1849, and the two were merged into the General Post Office in 1885. A year later, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio. For many years, the Banca Giuratale housed the Public Registry. The latter has now moved to Evans Building, and the Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The façade was restored sometimes in 2014. Architecture The Banca Giuratale is built in the Baroque style. The main portal is flanked by Doric columns which support an open balcony. Two arcades are located on either side of the doorway, above which are oval windows set in blind arches. The first floor contains five ornate windows, and an ornate centrepiece is located above the central window. This includes a bust of Grand Master Zondadari, carved figures and drapery and a marble slab with the following Latin inscription: The centrepiece also contained a number of coats of arms, but these were probably defaced during the French occupation of 1798–1800. The central coat of arms was later replaced by the British royal arms in the early 19th century.

The church is situated in the northern Christiansbjerg neighbourhood on Frederikshaldsgade. It is a parish church, and the only church in Christians Parish, under the Diocese of Aarhus and within the Church of Denmark, the Danish state church. The church serves some 14.000 parishioners in Christians Parish and holds weekly sermons along with weddings, burials and baptisms. The present Christians's Church was inaugurated on 2 March, 1958. The congregation in Christiansbjerg had for some years made do with a crypt, built during the Second World War, which had doubled as a temporary church. The crypt church replaced an older Christian's Church which had been in use since 1913 to 1946. The old church was found too small with just 90 seats, and an architects' contest was established in 1937 to find a design for a new church. The contest was won by Aage C. Nielsen. A committee led by the bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus started raising funds for the new church but war and occupation delayed the project. The funds were used to build the crypt church which had to double as a church until the 1950s. Minister of Ecclesiastical Affairs Bodil Koch made the project a priority and construction on the new church began in 1957. The resulting church was characteristic with sharp lines and a hexagonal church tower. The porch is low and leads into a large, tall church room which can seat 500 people. The church room stretches to the roof with the aid of buttresses which gives the otherwise modernistic church a gothic element. The south wall is one large window which is the main source of light. The church exterior is made of red brick.

After his retirement in 2005 due to a shoulder injury, he came out as gay. He speaks against the lack of acceptance of homosexuality in Aboriginal culture and is a youth worker performing outreach for homeless kids. He is also well known as a male model for the Australian swimwear brand aussieBum.  Early life and sporting career  Conway grew up in Bluff in Central Queensland as one of five boys. He went to boarding school in Yeppoon at St. Brendan's College, which had a specialised rugby league programme and is where he was discovered by Arthur Beetson for the National Rugby League team the Sydney Roosters. Conway joined the Sydney Roosters' Jersey Flegg Cup team in 2003. At the time, he was still uncertain about his sexuality and was socialising covertly on Sydney's gay scene, where he has described facing \\"casual racism\\". After discussion with club officials, Conway decided not to come out — publicly or to his team-mates — until after leaving the club in 2005. His retirement at the age of 22 was the result of a shoulder injury.  After retirement  After retiring from semi professional sport, and after a brief spell in fitness, Conway moved to work in youth work on Queensland's Gold Coast. In a 2015 interview with NITV when Conway did come out, he expressed disappointment that fellow Aboriginal rugby league player Anthony Mundine had claimed, two years previously, that homosexuality was not an acceptable part of Aboriginal culture. He did describe a perception of change in professional sport, however: : There's not too many [professional athletes] who have come forward, but I definitely think there's been a change. There are lots of different sporting identities, clubs and codes that are saying, \\"we're for equality\\". I think that's really great. It's really positive.

This book is said to encompass post digital print and explain examples of the many ways print has been expanded on, changed, and different inventions that have come about over the post-digital age. Ludovico makes it a point to emphasize how print has been thought to die off since 1894 but how in his opinion it has done no such thing, but instead is needed for the future.The book is one of the 10 best books of 2019 recommended by LSE (London School of Economics).  Author  The author Alessandro Ludovico was born in 1969 and resides in Bari, Italy. It is said that Ludovico has contributed greatly to the post digital age. This is due to his success as a Media critic and editor-in-chief of the magazine Neural since 1993, a host for the weekly radio show Neural Station, a collaborator of the Digital Kraft exhibitions, a founding contributor of the Nettime community, a founder of the organization Mag.Net, and a founder of the European Peripheral Magazine list.  Synopsis  A chapter by chapter synopsis of the book has been depicted as follows by a review from the website We Make Money Not Art. Chapter 1, “The death of paper (which never happened),” analyzes 7 moments when a new medium in history was thought to be a superior alternative to paper. Chapter 2, “A history of alternative publishing reflecting the evolution of print,” depicts how artistic avant-garde has used print during the 20th century. Chapter 3, “The mutation of paper: material paper in immaterial times,” looks at the explanations for why paper makes sense even in our digital age. Chapter 4, “The end of paper: can anything actually replace the printed page?” critically views electronic devices, strategies, and platforms. Chapter 5, “Distributed archives: paper content from the past, paper content for the future,” explores any long-term implications of choosing one medium over another. Chapter 6, “The network: transforming culture, transforming publishing,” explains how working as a network can increase the quality of cultural entities.  Content  According to Ludovico the first announcement of \\"the death of print\\" was in 1894. The book looks at how since that time independent bookshops, large bookshop chains, newspapers and magazines have to compete with Internet-based publishing or be wiped out. Ludovico explains how physical print publishing can survive and why he believes it is important that it should. He does this by tying together the current situation and future prospects of physical print publishing. It is explained that not every print technology was designed to print millions of copies. Spirit duplicators, photocopiers, and print-on- demand publishing allowed access to print for smaller print runs of projects with less mass appeal. Post-Digital Print innerpages Artists and political groups pushed the technology with pamphlets, unlicensed newspapers, the alternative press, fanzines, books, and journals. Ludovico establishes that due to how technology and the internet present the problem of filtering rather than access. This is not the only problem that he explains the print interface does not have. This Ludovico considers in depth when looking at eBooks which simulate print ever more closely which, according to a reviewer, confirms his argument that print is the better interface. This is also because the book explains that eBooks have an environmental impact that makes books look more appealing, and suffer all the problems of censorship and technological obsolescence that print now does not. The reviewer of Furtherfield.org believes that Ludovico certainly has the credibility that “lends his conclusions a context and authority that mere theory might lack.” This is because Ludovico is part of numerous art projects, events, and interventions that have placed him in the changes in publishing and textual media occurring over this period. He feels that printed materials are better interfaces, archives, and art objects than purely digital objects and therefore post- digital print and original print have to merge to spawn new models for carrying and spreading unprecedented amounts of information and culture.

The church is situated in the southern Langenæs neighbourhood on Langenæs Alle. Langenæs Church is a parish church, and the only church in Langenæs Parish, under the Diocese of Aarhus and within the Church of Denmark, the Danish state church. The church serves some 6.000 parishioners in Langenæs Parish and holds weekly sermons along with weddings, burials and baptisms. Langenæs Church is a Green Church (Grøn Kirke), a network of Danish churches dedicated to implement and further an environmentally friendly operation and climate actions in relation to the current climate crisis. The network agenda was launched by the National Council of Churches in Denmark (NCCD) in 2011.  History  Langenæs Church was built in response to sustained population growth in St. Lukas Parish prior to the Second World War. As the Langenæs neighbourhood was under development, the population was projected to exceed 30.000 people, so a splitting of the parish was planned, just as St. Lukas Parish had previously been split from St. Pauls Parish. This plan was halted by the Second World War and subsequent occupation of Denmark. From 1946, until construction began, fundraising campaigns were held every year on the last day of January in the adjacent Frederiksbjerg neighbourhood until sufficient funds had finally been collected. An architectural contest were held in 1957 which was won by Arne Gravers and Johan Richter who later designed the listed Århus Statsgymnasium and Aarhus Concert Hall. Building permits were obtained in 1962, construction began in 1964, and in 1966, the church stood completed. The church is built in red brick and concrete. It underwent repair and restoration in 2013, led by Cubo Architects. In the process, visual artist Elle-Mie Ejdrup Hansen installed new glasswork in the nave, for which she was awarded Farveprisen (The Colour Prize).

Retrieved 2015-10-26. The European Accounting Review is an international scholarly journal of the European Accounting Association (EAA). Devoted to the advancement of accounting knowledge, European Accounting Review provides a forum for the publication of high-quality accounting research manuscripts. It emphasizes openness and flexibility, not only regarding the substantive issues of accounting research, but also with respect to paradigms, methodologies, and styles of conducting that research. European Accounting Review is global in scope and welcomes submissions relating to any country or region as long as their relevance to an international audience is clearly communicated. The European Accounting Review was established in 1992. The journal initially published three issues per year, which was increased to four issues per year as of 1995. It is the only academic journal to provide a European forum for accounting research.European Accounting Association, EAR - European Accounting Review. Retrieved 2015-10-28. The editor is Beatriz Garcia Osma, of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain. The European Accounting Review organizes an Annual Conference since 2020.  Registered Reports and Open Science Section  The European Accounting Review promotes research that is based on the open science principles, meaning the practice of science in such a way that others can collaborate and contribute. Research that complies to these principles can be submitted to the newly introduced Open Science Section. We expect research in this section to be based on data that is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Commercially licensed data can qualify as FAIR as long as the authors provide reproducible code to obtain the data. Applied methods should be communicated by means that make findings reproducible, normally by providing program code. Data and code will be assessed as potential separate contributions to the literature in addition to the actual findings of the study per se. The Open Science Section is open to all topics and methods, including work that is mostly methodological in nature. In addition, the European Accounting Review introduces a new section Registered Reports. Submissions to this section have to follow a two-stage review process. The first stage requires a research proposal containing a motivated research question, clearly characterizing the potential contribution of the proposed study and a detailed outline of the proposed research design. This research proposal will be reviewed using the normal review process. In case that (a potentially revised version of) the research proposal is accepted, and the actual research is being carried out according to the accepted proposal, the final study will only be only reviewed for expositional clarity but not for contribution and implementation. We envision that this new section is particularly fitting for experimental studies and for studies that require substantial upfront investments in terms of data collection. Submissions that fit to both, the Registered Reports and the Open Science Section are possible and particularly encouraged.

The palace was built in the mid-16th century by a branch of the patrician Gussoni family and attributed to a design of Michele Sanmicheli. The Gussoni family is said to have played a role in the founding of Santa Sofia, San Matteo, and Santa Maria dei Crociferi. A different branch of the family lived in the Gussoni palace in San Vitale, later owned by the Cavalli. In May 1569, the archduke Charles of Austria watched a regatta in his honor from this palace. During 1647-1690, the palace hosted the Accademia Delfica, also called Gussonia. The male Gussoni branch extinguished in 1735 with the death of the Senator Giulio. The palace briefly passed to the Minio family, who sold it to the Grimani. In 1816, it was purchased by the Jewish family Dalla Vida (Della Vida).

As an illustrator, Bougas has worked with writer and publisher Jim Goad on such publications as Answer Me!  A. Wyatt Mann  According to a 2015 BuzzFeed News report, Bougas used the pseudonym \\"A. Wyatt Mann\\" to produce overtly racist and antisemitic cartoons in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Besides Africans and Jews, his cartoons occasionally targeted other minorities, gays, and feminists. Many of them were published at the time by white supremacist Tom Metzger. Bougas has not responded to the allegations but his identity as Mann was confirmed by multiple people who worked with him at the time and in captions of photos taken at various events. The Mann cartoons have been widely reused as memes by white supremacists as well as by various internet trolls, and later by the alt-right. One of them, a caricature of a Jew, became one of most popular antisemitic images on the internet. It was reused, modified and parodied multiple times, eventually becoming part of the visual languages of websites such as Reddit and 4chan. Bougas' work as Mann has frequently been combined with cartoons by political cartoonist Ben Garrison as a means for internet trolls to generate confusion between the two artists and make Garrison's work look racist.

He has been a member of the National Council since 2003. Originally a member of the Green Party of Switzerland, he founded the Green Liberal Party of the Canton of Zürich in 2004 and the national party in 2007. He was the first president of the national Green Liberal Party from 2007 to 2017.http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/biografie.aspx?biografie_id=1138 Biography Bäumle was born in Thalwil in the Canton of Zürich in 1964. He studied chemistry at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and earned a diploma in Atmospheric science. In 1987, at the age of 23, Bäumle was elected to the Cantonal Council of Zürich as a member of the Green Party. With the exception of 1995 to 1999, he served on the council until 2004. He was also elected to the municipal council of Dübendorf in 1990 and in 1998, moved to the Executive Council for the municipality. He served as the president of the Green Party of Zürich from 1998 to 2004. In 2004, he was defeated for re- election to the post by Balthasar Glättli. This led to a split in the Green movement as Bäumle and his supporters founded the Green Liberal Party in Zürich. Upon founding the national party in 2007, he was elected as the president. In the 2007 Swiss federal election, the Green Liberals tallied 1.4% of the votes and won three seats in the National Council. The Green Liberals made significant gains in the 2011 elections, taking 5.4% of the vote and 12 seats in the National Council and two seats in the Council of States. Bäumle launched an initiative to replace the country's VAT with an energy based tax on non-renewable resources. The measure came to a vote in March 2015 and was crushed with 92% of the voters going against the initiative. In the following elections the GLP's vote dropped to 4.6% and the party lost five seats in the National Council and both in the Council of States. Bäumle had health problems leading up to the 2015 election, fainting in 2012 and a suffering a heart attack in 2014. In May 2017, after a decade at the head of the GLP, he announced that he would resign. Jürg Grossen succeeded him as the party president. In early 2017, Bäumle joined the Green Cross International as its interim chairman. He took over as the organization was alleged to be near bankruptcy with the organization's founder Mikhail Gorbachev resigning from the board. In 2019, Bäumle revealed that the organization had fraudulent reporting of its balance sheet under its former managing director and the organization would continue, but with scaled back operations. In 2019, Bäumle was ordered to pay 1,000 CHF to a construction company in a case dating back to 2011. Then, as a councilor in Dübendorf, he was accused of breaching official secrecy when he leaked negative credit information to a reporter a proposed public works project. Voters rejected the project and the construction company sued for compensation. Bäumle was convicted by a district court in Uster, but acquitted by the Appeals Court of Zürich in 2017. Bäumle was nevertheless ordered to pay the company compensation, but was himself compensated for his legal fees.

In the late 1980s, Starhead experimented with standard format comics, and from 1991–1995 the company focused almost exclusively on this form, often publishing Pacific Northwest-based creators like Dennis P. Eichhorn, Forney, Gregory, Lasky, Colin Upton, and J. R. Williams. The company's last few years were limited to publishing reprints and updates of the pornographic Tijuana Bibles from the 1930s. In 1999, publisher Dowers retired the Starhead Comix name and created Brownfield Press to sell remaining titles and occasionally publish new projects. In 2010, Fantagraphics Books published Newave!: The Underground Mini Comix of the 1980s, a nearly 900-page collection of minicomics (many of which originally saw print via Starhead), edited by Dowers.

The church is situated in the northern Risskov neighbourhood on the street Jellebakken. Ellevang Church is a parish church, and the only church in Ellevang Parish, under the Diocese of Aarhus and within the Church of Denmark, the Danish state church. The church serves some 10.000 parishioners in Ellevang Parish and holds weekly sermons along with weddings, burials and baptisms. The history of Ellevang Church stems from the population growth in Vejlby Parish during the 1960s. The parish had grown to some 15.000 inhabitants so it had become necessary to build a new church relieve the existing ones in Vejlby Parish and Vejl-Risskov Parish. Vejlby Parish had been divided in 1940 and Risskov Parish with Risskov Church, inaugurated in 1934, had been created. Vejlby Parish sought permission from the government to construct a new church in the north of Vejlby which was granted in 1973 on the condition that the new parish borders were drawn exclusively within Vejlby Parish. The new parish became Ellevang Parish which today has some 10.000 parishioners. Construction of the church was initiated on 21 September 1973 and includes a few bricks from the 800 year old Vejlby Church as a symbol of the close connection to it. The church was completed and inaugurated on 1 December 1974 by the bishop of the time, Henning Høirup. The name of the parish and church was selected by the parishioners by popular vote as a reference to a medieval name of the area. The new parish shared the pastorate with Vejlby church until 1974 when the parish had grown to almost 6000 parishioners and the church got its own priest.

As the changing names suggest, it did not spend all of its existence in what is now the London Borough of Hackney. It eventually became part of New College, London, now subsumed within the University of London. The Hackney Theological Seminary began in 1802 as a philanthropic non- denominational venture promoted by the Anglican Rev. John Eyre of Homerton, and the Independent Rev. George Collison, with their associates, the Rev. Matthew Wilks of Whitefield's Tabernacle, Moorfields, and Rev. Rowland Hill of Surrey Chapel. It opened the following year, with £10,000 from a wealthy resident of Homerton named Charles Townsend. This seminary was intended to send evangelical preachers into the countryside, what was at first called the Village Itinerancy Society, or Evangelical Association for the Propagation of the Gospel. According to the Victoria County History: :The academy was managed by a committee, with George Collison of Walthamstow (Essex) as tutor, and used Eyre's house in Well Street, where the students lived in converted stabling until new quarters were built after purchase of the freehold in 1843. Training of Congregational ministers came to predominate over missionary work, although in 1898 the college's trustees had built or enlarged over 50 chapels, many of which they still maintained. The college moved to Finchley Road, Hampstead, in 1887. 'Hackney: Protestant Nonconformity', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10, Hackney, ed. T F T Baker (London, 1995), pp. 130-144 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol10/pp130-144 [accessed 25 October 2015] The training of ministers evolved as only part of the academy's function. It also raised funds to build dozens of new chapels, and worked closely with the non-denominational London Missionary Society, with which several of the college's founders were associated, to promote missionary work. On Collison's death in 1847, the presidency of Hackney Academy passed to the Rev. John Watson (1804–1859) of Union Chapel, Islington, who died when struck down by a vehicle on London Bridge. After 1871 the academy formally used the name Hackney College. In 1887, as it had outgrown its Well Street premises in Hackney, it took on new premises at Finchley Road, Hampstead, where it was associated with Peter Taylor Forsyth. In 1900 it merged with New College London and became part of the University of London. From 1924 onwards it was known as Hackney and New College. Confusingly, the Hampstead building frequently used the name Hackney College.

The primary factor that sets a minipiano apart from other types of piano is the fact that the sound producing mechanism is positioned below the keyboard, allowing an economical use of space. History The first minipiano brought onto the market in 1934 was known as the ‘Pianette’ model and had an Art Deco appearance which was at the time popular in many different fields of art and design.Robinson, M. & Ormiston, R. (2008), ART DECO: The Golden Age of Graphic Art & Illustration, Flame Tree Publishing, London, pp.12-20. In the fifties another model was sold, and was known as the ‘Royal’ model. The minipiano contrasted with existing forms of piano produced in London at the time. Relatively small and inexpensive, it enjoyed enormous popularity from the mid-thirties until the fifties. As a result, other manufacturers brought similar forms of diminutive piano onto the market to compete with Brasted's design.Laurence, Alistair (2016),The Rise and Fall of the Minipiano, Galpin Society Journal, Volume LXIX.The minipiano ‘Pianette’ model viewed with its original matching stool; the wooden flap at the front of the instrument has been dropped revealing the unique tuning pins at the front of the instrument, although the cover is closed hiding the keys. In spite of the name, a minipiano is not a toy piano but is instead a patented alternative designed to compete with larger and heavier instruments. The ‘Pianette’ model was the first of its kind. The development of the pianoforte included many experiments in the size and layout of the instrument. As Hammered Dulcimers developed into Clavichords which in turn influenced the development of the Harpsichord, many sub-families developed as instrument-makers experimented with new techniques and ideas. The minipiano was one of these. The minipiano’s lid has been completely detached to allow access to the back of the instrument; to do this two screws are removed while the piano lid is open and then after detaching the braceless back by removing a set of screws, two levers release the entire wooden structure, essential for the arduous task of getting at the piano wires. Comparisons have been made between the minipiano and Pape’s ‘Console Piano’ which had been invented more than a hundred years earlier in 1828. It apparently shared some characteristics and mechanics which were included in the minipiano but not in other pianos. The Eavestaff piano company patented the ‘minipiano’ in the two major forms most widely known today: the ‘Pianette’ and the ‘Royal’. =Eavestaff Ltd. and the Brasted brothers= Eavestaff Ltd. was instituted in 1823; at first the company printed sheet music, but began producing musical instruments after it was taken over in 1925 by the Brasted brothers. Although the Harry and Percy Brasted made pianos before they purchased Eavestaff), they weren't well-known. Purchasing the Eavestaff company name gave prestige to their newly designed instruments, including the Eavestaff grand. The minipiano, patented by Percy Brasted in 1934, did little to enhance the company's reputation. The two major models they produced were the ‘Pianette’ and the ‘Royal’. The ‘Pianette’ was the first minipiano brought onto the market and was popular, fashionable and technically innovative, at a time when people were impressed with technological innovations such as the gramophone. At its year of release up to 7,000 ‘Pianettes’ were sold at prices ranging between 28 and 38 guineas each at major music shops on the High Streets in London. Its construction differs considerably from a standard piano, and had some technical weaknesses. The tuning pins often loosened with time and improper storage, and these parts, as well as the rods leading to the striking pads behind the instrument are difficult to repair or replace. The 'Royal' model resembles and sounds more like an upright piano was brought onto the market in 1958. =The minipiano and the Art Deco era= The minipiano formed part of a ‘fashion’ that was dictated by the Art Deco period, and enjoyed a short period of popularity before dropping into obscurity. The angular frame surrounding the piano pedals of the 'Pianette' model minipiano is clearly influenced by currents of design popular particularly during the later years of what is now called the Art Deco era. Its economical design, sleek finish and sturdy structure, made it an appropriate addition to the Art Deco oeuvre. =The ‘Royal’ minipiano= In 1958 the Brasted brothers brought out another minipiano they called the ‘Royal’ model. The ‘Royal’ minipiano is generally considered a better instrument, although both models are generally ignored in comprehensive music instrument guides (see for example Midgley, R. 1976, in which both the ‘Pianette’ and the ‘Royale’ are completely ignored).Midgley, Ruth (1976), Musical Instruments of the World, Paddington Press Ltd., London, pp. 226-241. =Other appearances of the minipiano= The last public demonstration of a new minipiano to date was at a Frankfurt music fair in 1967. Also produced by Eavestaff, this instrument, known as the ‘minitronic’, resembled more an electric organ, making use of tremolo and electronic amplication. Most reactions to the unusual sounds it produced were rather negative and whether or not it was actually released onto the market is unknown. Design and patent Only after removing the braceless back of the minipiano and the set of metal rods are these words clearly viewable behind the piano wires. In addition to ambiguities about what one can define as a minipiano, there also exist discrepancies among various sources as to who first obtained the patent for the minipiano and whether or not they had the right to do so as it was not, in fact, invented by the Brasted brothers who had by then taken over the Eavestaff piano company. Apart from patenting the design in 1934, Robert Percy Brasted came up with the name 'Minipiano', and therefore there are those that claim that he either invented the piano or stole the invention from someone else and put his name to it. Neither of these facts is true and the whole affair occurred quite amicably. In fact, the Swedish designer Lundholm of Stockholm sold the rights and the minipiano in the form it was patented was produced only in England. Lundholm imported them to Sweden and received royalties for every minipiano sold. Mechanics After removing the piano lid, the braceless back, some screws and a set of 73 metal rods a mechanism pivots outwards to reveal the striking and damper pads as illustrated in this photo. The minipiano, despite its name and the elegant appearance of the 'Pianette' model, is a sturdy and heavy instrument; it appears small only because it differs in appearance from an upright which takes up more room and is more bulky because the chamber in which the strings are held is situated in front of the player and above the keys. On the minipiano, the soundboard and the strings are neatly positioned underneath the keys at the back of the piano, protected by a simple wooden frame to which fabric is attached to prevent dust getting in. When a key is pressed, a long thin metal rod which reaches halfway down the back of the instrument is lifted. This lifting motion causes the piano wires to be struck and then stopped by damper pads when the key is released similar to an upright piano (although on a minipiano, the highest 13 notes do not have dampers). =Keys and soundboard= In this photo the soundboard is clearly visible. It is strung with two sets of piano wires which extend across the back of the instrument. The longer monochord bass strings pass in front of the treble strings, most of which are bichords. There are 73 keys on a minipiano. A metal soundboard extends beneath the keyboard and is hidden behind the set of 73 metal rods which enact the piano action mechanism that produces sound on the instrument. Sound is produced by the striking and stopping of a set of piano wires which are strung to the soundboard. In a minipiano, two types of piano wire are used; bass strings which are all monochords and treble strings which are bichords. Like on an upright piano, an economical use is made of the space within the instrument by crossing different groups of strings. The first 29 keys counting from the lowest note form the first group and as mentioned they are all monochords. The second group consists of 44 keys. The first two keys counting from the lowest notes strike monochords, but the rest of the keys strike bichords. A standard piano consists largely of trichords although the lower notes use bichords and then monochords as the notes get progressively lower. Monochords extend between two pins at opposing sides, whereas bichords extend between two tuning pins one which is a little higher than the other, and the piano wire actually extends down to a nail around which it is tightly strung. The two strings are tightened so that they are tuned at exactly the same pitch. A piano makes use of trichords where three alike tuned strings are struck to produce its well-known rich tones. =Accessing the tuning pins= Viewed from beneath the front of the instrument, a wooden flap drops to reveal the tuning pins. What made most models of the 'Pianette' so innovative was the positioning of the tuning pins. On any other type of piano, tuning pins are pounded into holes which are sufficiently, deliberately and exactly smaller than the pins so that a long-lasting tightness will keep them from sliding, no matter what force is put upon them while stretching the wires into tune. These holes are positioned beneath a metal soundboard and have a specified depth. On many models of the 'Pianette' minipiano, however, these tuning pins have to be longer so that they can emerge at the front of the instrument just below the keyboard. By allowing a wooden flap to fall positioned neatly beneath the keyboard, tuning pins are revealed at the front. These pins can be adjusted with a standard star-shaped piano wrench. The monochords used on the lowest 31 strings are relatively easy to tune. The bichords are somewhat more difficult but if the pins are still tight enough, they can be adjusted with slight movements of the wrench until the desired tone is reached. Unfortunately, however, this system which involved the use of specially made tuning pins specific to the minipiano, has proven to be its greatest problem to people attempting to salvage the instruments today. Although all pianos suffer to some degree from a natural loosening of these pins over time the minipiano is most highly criticized for the tendency of all the pins, especially those belonging to bichords, to loosen and slide much more quickly especially if they are not kept in a warm stable environment. After detaching the piano lid completely and removing the back of the 'Pianette' model minipiano, a large set of metal rods is revealed preventing access to the piano wires. Although it is possible to access the tuning pins from the back as well, it is infinitely prefereable to be able to tune the minipiano from the front because in order to open the back one has to entirely detach the wooden lid, remove a whole set of metal rods, some screws above and across the wooden contraption holding the striking pad mechanism as well as two wooden rods attached to the pedals controlled by the player's feet. This is done to allow the central striking mechanism to pivot outwards on an axis pivoting on two large screws at the bottom of the wooden contraption. But before the wooden structure can pivot on the screws attaching it firmly to the instrument, two curved metallic 'handles' that connect two wooden bars passing horizontally just behind the row of metal rods have to be detached as well by the removing the screws holding them to the higher of the two bars. After this, the whole structure should gracefully pivot outwards, allowing access to both the piano wires and the tuning pins. =Comparison with upright piano= A minipiano differs from an upright piano in many ways. The primary factor that sets it apart from types of piano still manufactured today is the fact that the soundboard, the piano wires and the piano action mechanism which produces sound by striking the wires, are extended beneath the instrument rather than above it (as in an upright piano) or behind it (as in a grand piano). It is also well known for its 'braceless' removable back. Braces are wooden pieces designed to support the structure of the instrument, but are entirely unnecessary when the back consists of a single removable wooden frame with a central support beam. Fabric is firmly stapled to the inside of this removable back to prevent dust getting through. What makes the minipiano exceptional is the way the tuning pins extend from behind the metal soundboard at the back into which the tuning pins are inserted through to the front, allowing the instrument to be tuned without actually having to remove the braceless back. Unfortunately these pins are no longer made making them difficult to replace. Although most pianos have three strings per note, the minipiano ‘Pianette’ model consists of monochords for the lowest 31 keys and bichords for the remaining 42 keys. A bichord is a single piano wire which is tightly wrapped around two metal pins but which is divided into two by a single nail. One of the pins is positioned slightly higher than the other, but the two pins are tuned separately to produce the same tone. The fact that these pins can be tuned at the front of instrument with a piano wrench make many forms of the minipiano unique. With only monochords and bichords, the 'Pianette' model could never have been expected to produce the richness of sound of a standard upright or grand piano. Still, the 'Pianette', after its release in 1934, was enormously popular; apparently people lined up outside of stores to view the sleek new models in London High Street stores, and a large number of the instruments were sold all around the world. In addition the minipiano has fewer keys; pianos made today extend down 8 semitones lower than the minipiano, and 7 semitones higher. As a result a lot of modern piano music is simply unplayable on minipianos. The minipiano’s range is clearly limited if compared to a standard piano. A minipiano has striking contrasts in both design and action to an upright or a grand piano. Unfortunately the metal rods and pins which make up the complex piano action mechanism haven't been made for decades. An instrument that has a smaller tessitura, produces a less impressive sound and that is difficult to tune or repair thanks to irreplaceable parts, is bound to be compared less positively to the forms of piano which are still popular today.

He is the son of Lieutenant General Ding Qiusheng (丁秋生), the founding political commissar of PLAN's North Sea Fleet, and therefore considered a \\"princeling\\". Ding enlisted in the PLA Navy in March 1968, and joined the Communist Party of China in February 1970. He spent most of his career in the North Sea Fleet of the Jinan Military Region, successively serving on the naval ships Kunming, Chengdu, and Changsha. He became captain of Changsha in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, he served as chief of staff of a PLAN minesweeper branch (1983), commander of a frigate branch (1984), deputy commander of a guard command (1987), commander of a destroyer detachment (1989), and chief of staff of a naval base (January 1993). He was appointed President of Guangzhou Naval Academy in July 1993, and promoted to the rank of rear admiral the same month. North Sea Fleet command and submarine accident Ding was appointed chief of staff of the North Sea Fleet in January 1995 and deputy commander in December 1997. In December 2000, he was promoted to Commander of the North Sea Fleet and concurrently Deputy Commander of the Jinan Military Region. He was promoted to the rank of vice- admiral in July 2002. He was elected as an alternate member of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 2002, and re-elected as an alternate member of the 17th Central Committee in 2007. Ding was groomed to be the candidate for Commander of the PLA Navy. He had comparable command experience as Admiral Wu Shengli but was six years younger, and became an alternate Central Committee member five years before Wu. However, Ding was penalized following a fatal accident with the Type 035 Ming-class submarine 361 on April 16, 2003. Its entire crew of 70 men perished, though the submarine was later salvaged. In the accident's aftermath, Ding was demoted by one grade to deputy chief of staff of the Navy, removing him from contention. Wu eventually became the PLAN commander. Later career and retirement In August 2006, Ding was promoted to deputy commander of the PLA Navy. Between December 2006 and February 2009 he concurrently served as chief of staff of the PLAN. In July 2014, Ding retired from active military service after reaching the mandatory retirement age. He was replaced by Du Jingchen. Publications Ding is one of the more prolific writers in the PLA Navy leadership. In 2000, he published the book World Naval History (世界海军史; Beijing: Haichao Press). He was deputy editor of the 2006 book The Science of Naval Training (Beijing: Academy of Military Science Press, 2006). He has also published a number of articles, including one on the importance of civil- military relations in the journal Culture in Barracks (2007).

The first stanniocalcin discovered was from fish and was identified as the principal calcium-reducing (hypocalcaemic) factor. It was isolated from special organs in fish called corpuscles of Stannius, hence the name stanniocalcin. Chemically, stanniocalcins are glycosylated proteins (i.e. proteins containing carbohydrate, or glycoproteins) having a molecular mass of 50 kDa. They exist in molecular pairs (homodimers) and are joined together by disulfide linkage. Stanniocalcins are made up of approximately 250 amino acids. Discovery In 1839, the German anatomist Hermann Friedrich Stannius discovered a pair of novel structures inside the kidneys of sturgeon and bony fishes. He believed that they were a kind of adrenal gland (found in mammals) in these fishes. In 1896, the French physiologist A. Petit demonstrated that removal of one of the structures led to degeneration of the other. He suggested that these structures were endocrine organs. In 1908, the Italian zoologist Ercole Giacomini was the first to describe that these structures were present only in fishes which lack a parathyroid gland. He distinguished and named them \\"posterior interrenal\\" from the anterior portion of the kidney, which he named \\"anterior interrenal\\". A French Physiologist M. Fontaine reported that the corpuscles were responsible for controlling calcium level in the blood. In 1971 Peter K.T. Pang of Yale University showed in the male killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that the corpuscles control calcium metabolism. He found that removal of the corpuscle led to development of kidney stone and increase in serum calcium level. By the mid 1970s, it was confirmed that the corpuscles secrete a factor that can reduce calcium level, similar to calcitonin but completely different. and Pang gave the prospective name \\"hypocalcin\\". The chemical compound was isolated in 1986 from sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and since it was from a teleost, it was called \\"teleocalcin\\". A better isolation was reported in 1988 from different species, including European eel, tilapia, goldfish, and carp. It was realised that both hypocalcin and teleocalcin are the same. It was conclusively shown that the isolated compound was the factor that reduces calcium level in these fishes. In 1990, the exact chemical composition and biosynthesis war worked out, and was given the name \\"stanniocalcin\\" as it was found to be exclusively produced by the corpuscles of Stannius. The complete amino acid sequence was described in 1995. Structure Stanniocalcin is a glycoprotein that exists in a homodimer, i.e. two similar peptide molecules combined. Each single molecule is made up of 179 amino acids. The peptide sequence is characterised by the presence of 11 half-Cys residues and one N-linked glycosylation site. The actual amino acid sequence and total length differ between species, hence, the molecular weight. In most species it is 54 kDa in size. While it is only 44 kDa in Atlantic salmon. In chum salmon, the homodimer in joined by a single intermonomeric disulfide bond at Cys169. Each monomer in turn contains five intramonomeric disulfide bonds formed between Cys12-Cys26, Cys21-Cys41, Cys32-Cys81, Cys65-Cys95, and Cys102-Cys137. Its synthesis is regulated by the expression of STC (stannioclacin) mRNA. The STC mRNA sequence varies from species to species. For example, in salmon it is approximately 2 kilobases in length and encodes a primary translation product of 256 amino acids. The first 33 residues comprise the pre-pro (inactive form) region of the hormone, whereas the remaining 223 residues make up the mature form of the hormone. One N-linked, glycosylation consensus sequence was identified in the protein coding region as well as an odd number of half cysteine residues, the latter of which would allow for interchain bonding or dimerisation of monomeric subunits. Function In bony fishes, stanniocalcin is the principal hormone that regulate calcium level. Even though other calcium-decreasing hormone, calcitonin, is also present, these fishes require more efficient hormone as calcium rapidly enters into their blood through their gills and intestinal wall. Hence, the target sites of stanniocalsin are gill and intestine, where uptake (absorption) of calcium is directly inhibited. Increase in the serum calcium triggers the release of stanniocalcin. Unlike calcitonin, it also regulates phosphate level. It inhibits excretion of phosphate from the kidney. Variation in other animals Stanniocalcin was also detected in mammals. In mammals there are two variant forms, STC1, which is fundamentally similar to fish stanniocalcin, and STC2, which is more different in structure and function. In invertebrates, freshwater leeches are found to contain the hormone. In leeches it is produced in the fat cells (adipocytes). =STC1= STC1 was discovered in 1995 from human kidney. It was demonstrated that human kidney extract produced the same calcium inhibitory action when injected in a fish. The gene that produce STC1, STC1 is located in the short arm of human chromosome 8 (position p21.2). STC1 mRNA is formed in heart, lung, liver, adrenal gland, prostate, and ovary, indicating that these are the sites of synthesis. Ovary contains the highest level of STC1 mRNA. Fish stanniocalcin and mammalian STC1 are closely related, and are about 50% similar in their structure. They are both responsible for calcium and phosphate balance. In mammals the predominant function of STC1 is to activate phosphate reabsorption in the small intestine and proximal tubules of the kidney. =STC2= STC2 was discovered from the human DNA database. In human STC2 is produced by STC2 gene which is located in the long arm of human chromosome 5 (position q35.1). It is very different from STC1 and show only 34% similarity. STC2 mRNA is found in pancreas, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscles. Medical importance Mammalian stanniocalcins are known to be related to cancer development, such as breast and ovarian cancers. In these cancers, both STC1 and STC2 are excessively produced. Their location in chromosomes are the sites of genes for tumour formation. In breast cancer the elevated hormones correspond to increased estrogen receptors. Increased STC1 is specifically linked to other cancer types, including leukemia, colorectal cancer, carcinoma, and lung cancer. STC2 is related to cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer.

They underpinned the majority of statistical machine translation systems for almost twenty years starting in the early 1990s, until neural machine translation began to dominate. These models offer principled probabilistic formulation and (mostly) tractable inference. The original work on statistical machine translation at IBM proposed five models, and a model 6 was proposed later. The sequence of the six models can be summarized as: * Model 1: lexical translation * Model 2: additional absolute alignment model * Model 3: extra fertility model * Model 4: added relative alignment model * Model 5: fixed deficiency problem. * Model 6: Model 4 combined with a HMM alignment model in a log linear way  Model 1  IBM Model 1 is weak in terms of conducting reordering or adding and dropping words. In most cases, words that follow each other in one language would have a different order after translation, but IBM Model 1 treats all kinds of reordering as equally possible. Another problem while aligning is the fertility (the notion that input words would produce a specific number of output words after translation). In most cases one input word will be translated into one single word, but some words will produce multiple words or even get dropped (produce no words at all). The fertility of word models addresses this aspect of translation. While adding additional components increases the complexity of models, the main principles of IBM Model 1 are constant.  Model 2  The IBM Model 2 has an additional model for alignment that is not present in Model 1. For example, using only IBM Model 1 the translation probabilities for these translations would be the same: none The IBM Model 2 addressed this issue by modeling the translation of a foreign input word in position i to a native language word in position j using an alignment probability distribution defined as: :a(i\\\\lor j,l_e,l_f) In the above equation, the length of the input sentence f is denoted as lf, and the length of the translated sentence e as le. The translation done by IBM Model 2 can be presented as a process divided into two steps (lexical translation and alignment). none Assuming t(e\\\\mid f) is the translation probability and a(i\\\\lor j,l_e,l_f) is the alignment probability, IBM Model 2 can be defined as: :p(e,a\\\\mid f)=\\\\in \\\\prod_{j=1}^{l_e} t(e_{j}\\\\lor f_{a\\\\mid j})a(a(j)\\\\lor j,l_e,l_f) In this equation, the alignment function a maps each output word j to a foreign input position a(j).  Model 3  The fertility problem is addressed in IBM Model 3. The fertility is modeled using probability distribution defined as: :n(\\\\phi \\\\lor f) For each foreign word j, such distribution indicates to how many output words \\\\phi it usually translates. This model deals with dropping input words because it allows \\\\phi=0. But there is still an issue when adding words. For example, the English word do is often inserted when negating. This issue generates a special NULL token that can also have its fertility modeled using a conditional distribution defined as: :n(\\\\varnothing \\\\lor NULL) The number of inserted words depends on sentence length. This is why the NULL token insertion is modeled as an additional step: the fertility step. It increases the IBM Model 3 translation process to four steps: none The last step is called distortion instead of alignment because it is possible to produce the same translation with the same alignment in different ways. IBM Model 3 can be mathematically expressed as: :P(S\\\\mid E,A)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^{I} \\\\Phi_i!n(\\\\Phi \\\\mid e_j)*\\\\prod_{j=1}^{J}t(f_j \\\\mid e_{a_j})*\\\\prod_{j:a(j) eq 0}^{J}d(j\\\\mid a_j,I,J)*(\\\\begin{array}{c} J-\\\\Phi_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Phi_0 \\\\end{array})p_0^{\\\\Phi_0}p_1^J where \\\\Phi_i represents the fertility of e_i, each source word s is assigned a fertility distribution n, and I and J refer to the absolute lengths of the target and source sentences, respectively.FERNÁNDEZ, Pablo Malvar. Improving Word-to-word Alignments Using Morphological Information. 2008. PhD Thesis. San Diego State University.  Model 4  In IBM Model 4, each word is dependent on the previously aligned word and on the word classes of the surrounding words. Some words tend to get reordered during translation more than others (e.g. adjective–noun inversion when translating Polish to English). Adjectives often get moved before the noun that precedes them. The word classes introduced in Model 4 solve this problem by conditioning the probability distributions of these classes. The result of such distribution is a lexicalized model. Such a distribution can be defined as follows: For the initial word in the cept: d_1(j-\\\\odot_{[i-1]}\\\\lor A(f_{[i-1]}),B(e_j)) For additional words: d_1(j-\\\\pi_{i,k-1}\\\\lor B(e_j)) where A(f) and B(e) functions map words to their word classes, and e_{j} and f_{[i-1]} are distortion probability distributions of the words. The cept is formed by aligning each input word f_i to at least one output word. Both Model 3 and Model 4 ignore if an input position was chosen and if the probability mass was reserved for the input positions outside the sentence boundaries. It is the reason for the probabilities of all correct alignments not sum up to unity in these two models (deficient models).  Model 5  IBM Model 5 reformulates IBM Model 4 by enhancing the alignment model with more training parameters in order to overcome the model deficiency.KNIGHT, Kevin. A statistical MT tutorial workbook. Manuscript prepared for the 1999 JHU Summer Workshop, 1999. During the translation in Model 3 and Model 4 there are no heuristics that would prohibit the placement of an output word in a position already taken. In Model 5 it is important to place words only in free positions. It is done by tracking the number of free positions and allowing placement only in such positions. The distortion model is similar to IBM Model 4, but it is based on free positions. If v_j denotes the number of free positions in the output, the IBM Model 5 distortion probabilities would be defined as: For the initial word in the cept: d_1(v_j\\\\lor B(e_j),v_{\\\\odot i-1},v_{max}) For additional words: d_1(v_{j}-v_{\\\\pi_{i,k-1}}\\\\lor B(e_j),v_{max'}) The alignment models that use first-order dependencies like the HMM or IBM Models 4 and 5 produce better results than the other alignment methods. The main idea of HMM is to predict the distance between subsequent source language positions. On the other hand, IBM Model 4 tries to predict the distance between subsequent target language positions. Since it was expected to achieve better alignment quality when using both types of such dependencies, HMM and Model 4 were combined in a log-linear manner in Model 6 as follows: :p_6(f,a\\\\lor e)= \\\\frac{p_4(f,a\\\\lor e)^\\\\alpha*p_{HMM}(f,a\\\\lor e)}{\\\\sum_{a',f'} p_4(f',a'\\\\lor e)^\\\\alpha*p_{HMM}(f',a'\\\\lor e)} where the interpolation parameter \\\\alpha is used in order to count the weight of Model 4 relatively to the hidden Markov model. A log-linear combination of several models can be defined as p_k (f, a \\\\mid e) with k=1,2,\\\\dotsc,K as: :p_6(f,a\\\\lor e)=\\\\frac{\\\\prod_{k=1}^{K}p_k(f,a\\\\lor e)^{\\\\alpha_{k}}}{\\\\sum_{a',f'}\\\\prod_{k=1}^{K}p_k(f',a'\\\\mid e)^{\\\\alpha_{k}}} The log-linear combination is used instead of linear combination because the P_r (f, a \\\\mid e) values are typically different in terms of their orders of magnitude for HMM and IBM Model 4.

Typically it would be relation by being a son or a daughter. Many fled China because of war and poverty. Several historical events such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and San Francisco earthquake of 1906 caused the illegal documents to be produced. Background With the Chinese Exclusion Act enacted in 1882, Chinese people were excluded from entering the United States from China unless they were of elite status. It was the only law in American history to deny naturalization in or entry into the United States based upon a specific ethnicity or country of birth, though it was not the only law to deny citizenship based on ethnicity or country of birth (as Native- and African- American, among other Non-White American, people had at various times been denied citizenship based upon ethnicity; and not every American who was born overseas to at least one American parent was granted by-birth citizenship until the passage of the 1952 Immigration and Naturalization Act). It stated that the coming of Chinese laborers would endanger the order of localities. As the American economy plummeted, problems of unemployment arose and blame was placed upon the Chinese for taking over jobs for low pay. In 1892, this act was renewed for another ten years in the form of the Geary Act. It was eventually made permanent in 1902. In 1906, the San Francisco earthquake caused a huge fire that destroyed public birth documents. Suddenly a new opportunity for citizenship arose: Chinese men who were already in the United States could claim that they were born in the United States. Other Chinese men would travel back to China as United States citizens and report that their wives had given birth to a son. Consequently, this made the child eligible to be a United States citizen, for which they would receive a document. These documents could then be used for their actual sons, or sold to friends, neighbors, and strangers. This was termed as a \\"slot\\" and would then be available for purchase to men who had no blood relationships in the United States in order to be eligible to enter the United States. Merchant brokers often acted as middlemen to handle the sale of slots. To truly enforce the Chinese Exclusion Act, an Immigration Station located in Angel Island in 1910, questioned and interrogated immigrants coming from 84 different countries with the majority of immigrants being Asian and Chinese, being the largest ethnic group at the time of establishment. Since official records were often non- existent, an interrogation process was created to determine if the immigrants were related as they had claimed. On average an interrogation process could take up to 2 – 3 weeks, but some immigrants were interrogated for months. Questions could include details of the immigrant's home and village as well as specific knowledge of his or her ancestors. These questions had been anticipated and thus, irrespective of the true nature of the relationship to their sponsor, the applicant had prepared months in advance by committing these details to memory. Their witnesses — usually other family members living in the United States — would be called forward to corroborate these answers. Any deviation from the testimony would prolong questioning or throw the entire case into doubt and put the applicant at risk of deportation, and possibly everyone else in the family connected to the applicant as well. A detention center was in operation for thirty years; however, there were many concerns about the sanitation and safety of the immigrants at Angel Island, which proved to be true in 1940 when the administration building burned down. As a result, all the immigrants were relocated to another facility. The Chinese Exclusion Act was eventually repealed in 1943. After the Chinese Exclusion Act After China became a World War II ally, that vast power over non- citizens was deployed in raids against immigrants of various ethnic groups whose politics were considered suspect. Many paper sons suddenly faced the exposure of their fraudulent documentations. The United States government was tipped off by an informer in Hong Kong as part of a cold war effort to stop illegal immigration. Many Paper Sons were scared of being deported back to China. Only in the 1960s did new legislation broaden immigration from Asia and gave paper sons a chance to tell the truth about who they were and restore their real names in \\"confessional\\" programs. But many chose to stick with their adopted names for fear of retribution and took their true names to their graves. Many Paper sons never told their descendants about their past; leaving them with confusion and disconnecting them from their family history. Some paper sons even went as far as adopting the American lifestyle by not teaching their children their home dialects and forgetting any Chinese cultural aspects such as their cultural foods and rituals.

Isolated corpuscles (middle). Section of a corpuscle (x 1200) showing secretory cells inside the lobules (bottom) The corpuscles of Stannius are special endocrine organs in the kidney in fish and are responsible for maintaining calcium balance. They are found only in bony fishes. They were discovered and described by a German anatomist Hermann Friedrich Stannius in 1839. Stannius considered them as functionally similar to adrenal glands in mammals. But they have later been found to be anatomically different as they are derived from different tissues of the embryo. Structurally the corpuscles are a large number of spherical bodies separated from each other by loose connective tissues. Each body or lobule is in turn composed of several columnar cells, which contain secretory granules and are, thus, secretory in function. Each Secretory granule is spherical in shape and measures 0.5 to 1 μm in diameter. Their possible endocrine nature, i.e. producing hormone, was suspected from the complete anatomical description, and it was believed to be responsible for regulating calcium level in the blood. The hormone was identified as stanniocalcin. Function Bony fishes obtain calcium directly from their aquatic surrounding (unlike other vertebrates which acquire from diet), so that they require separate endocrine organ. The corpuscles of Stannius are the sites of production of the hormone called stanniocalcin (the mammalian homologue is called stanniocalcin-1 or STC1). This hormone is responsible for decreasing the blood circulating level of calcium. Similar to parathyroid hormone and calcitonin that regulate calcium metabolism in mammals, stanniocalcin is influenced by the level of circulating calcium. When calcium level increases, the corpuscles are stimulated to secrete stanniocalcin.

He was a founder of the Jockeys' Guild. After his career ended, Renick became one of television's first racing announcers. Early life Renick was born on May 14, 1910 and grew up in The Bronx. At the age of thirteen he ran away from home and went to New Orleans, where he worked in the stables at the Fair Grounds Race Course. Racing career Renick began his racing career at the age of sixteen. He eventually became a contract rider for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. and Harry Warner; racing for Vanderbilt on the East Coast and Warner on the West Coast. Renick was one of America's leading jockeys during the 1930s and 1940s and won a number of stakes races. =Jockeys' Guild= After Renick broke his leg during a race, he and friend and fellow jockey Eddie Arcaro began discussions that led to the creation of Jockeys' Guild, which aimed to gain some protections for jockeys, who did not have insurance or medical protection, and their families, in case of injury or death. During the early years of the Guild, Renick would usually act as master of ceremonies for the organization's fundraising dances, shows, and dinners. Broadcasting After Renick's career as a jockey ended, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt suggested that he go into broadcasting due to his talkative nature. His first broadcasting job was as Clem McCarthy's color commentator on races from Belmont Park for the NBC television network. In 1952, Renick served as an announcer for the first network television broadcast of the Kentucky Derby. He set the scene for the race, delivered advertising pitches, and performed prerace interviews. In 1954 he called the Preakness Stakes for CBS Television with Fred Capossela and Mel Allen. He also broadcast races from New York and Florida as a color commentator on the \\"Race of the Week\\" and \\"Schaefer Circle of Sports\\" with Capossela and Win Elliot, \\"Racing From Aqueduct\\" with Elliot, and as the host of his own show, \\"Racing with Renick\\".

She taught Christian Education for fourteen years at Drew University, during which time she became passionate about improving the position of women within the Christian faith. She wrote prolifically on religion, spirituality, feminism, intersectionality, and language. In 1985, she published an anthology of essays titled The Journey Is Home.  Early life  Morton was born on January 7, 1905 in Smalling, Tennessee to Jonathan Morrell Morton and Mary Katherine O'Dell Morton. She and her sisters, Inez and Lucille, grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee. In 1925, Morton graduated from Flora MacDonald College in Red Springs, North Carolina. After her graduation, she spent four years teaching public school in her hometown of Kingsport. During these years, Morton began graduate work at The General Assembly Training School in Richmond, Virginia, later moving to New York to attend the New York Theological Seminary. She received her Master's degree in Religious Education in 1931. She went on to continue her studies and research at various institutions, including the Graduate Ecumenical Institute in Cligny, Switzerland, L'Institut de Rousseau in Geneva, and the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.  Career  After receiving her graduate degree, Morton worked as an assistant at the Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn, New York. She left this job in 1935 to become the Director of Religious Education at the First Presbyterian Church in Staunton, Virginia. In 1937, she began working as the Assistant Director of Youth Work for the Board of Christian Education of the Presbyterian Church. During her time there, she worked to organize youth camps and conferences that allowed and encouraged adolescents of all races to attend. From 1945 to 1949, Morton was the General Secretary of the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen, an organization that welcomed religious men and women of varying faiths and races and had by this time become active in leading reform on race issues and reconstruction. Through this work, Morton became close friends with the civil rights organizer and educator Jean E. Fairfax, then the Dean of Women at first Kentucky State College and then Tuskeegee Institute. In 1949, Morton's health required her to move back to Tennessee to live on her family's farm. She spent the next seven years teaching physically and mentally handicapped children. She innovated camping programs for handicapped children, producing a prizewinning film on these programs. She also used this time to focus on her writing, publishing both The Bible and Its Use and The Church We Cannot See. In 1956, Morton moved to Madison, New Jersey to teach Christian Education at the Theological School of Drew University. During this time she taught a course on \\"Women in Church and Society,\\" which is thought to be the first course to address the role of women in this field. This course coincided with her shift toward focusing on the status of women within the Christian church. Both during and after her tenure at Drew University, she spoke widely and sometimes taught courses at other universities. She also spoke at the World Council of Churches Consultation in Berlin in 1974, and at the World Federation of Methodist Women in Dublin in 1976.  Awards and legacy  In 1979, Morton was awarded with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from St. Andrews Presbyterian College. In 1984, Drew University awarded her a Doctor of Humane Letters for her work at the university and for the church. Drew University began hosting an annual Nelle K. Morton lecture in her honor. In 1986, the School of Theology at Claremont began hosting lectures in honor of Morton and Anne Bennett. Morton's work has been cited as influential in increasing the establishment of women's centers and courses on the topic of women and religion at religious and secular schools. Morton has been described by Rosemary Radford Ruether as a \\"foremother\\" for many feminists.

The basin has a semi- elliptical shape that extends on a north–south axis, with roughly length and width. Length, width and depth of Lake Suesca The average depth is . It is located in the Eastern Ranges, on the anticlinal of Nemocón, in the northeast of the department, at an altitude of .CAR, 1993  Description  = Geology and soils = Geologically, the lake is of Pleistocene origin and is linked to the formation of the Eastern Ranges, which had a strong uprising activity during the Pliocene. Because of its location there is a wide distribution of sedimentary rocks, and the Guadalupe Group, Guaduas, Bogotá and Cacho formations are present in the area. The basin is crossed along its axis by the Suesca Fault, uplifting sandstone.Bastidas, 2001Leon et al., 1998 The soils of the basin are classified as alfisols, where erosion areas are classified as \\"bad soils\\". Generally these correspond to cold and dry climates, with corrugated relief and highly evolved soils, where the presence of erosion is common, and most horizons have enrichment with clay. These soils were formed during the Pliocene and Quaternary, containing deposits of volcanic ash from the Cordillera Central, which weathered into clays, currently present in the lower strata. = Vegetation and climate = The original vegetation was composed of encenillo and \\"corono\\" forests, accompanied by more xerophytic Andean communities, which correspond to the Low montane dry forest (bs-MB) according to the Holdridge life zones. The actual land cover is dominated by exotic species, mostly Acacia decurrens, with few remnants of native vegetation in the north and south of the basin. From a climatic point of view, the region has a bimodal rainfall regime, with an annual average of 647 mm, average temperatures of 14 °C, 70% relative humidity and evaporation of 1331 mm/year. The winds are a determinant factor for the vegetation and climate, as they are mainly influenced by Sabana de Bogotá, Magdalena River Valley and the Orinoco Plains, which converge in the area to generate specific characteristics from the point of view of moisture and the feasibility of rainfall. The region is under the jurisdiction of the Corporación Autonoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR) (environmental authority) and its central axis (north–south) serves as the boundary between the municipalities of Cucunubá and Suesca. = Muisca sacred lake = As with various other lakes on the Altiplano, Tota, Siecha, Guatavita and Iguaque, the Muisca who were the original inhabitants of the area before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, performed religious rituals at Lake Suesca.Casilimas & López, 1987, p.135  Environmental issues  The basin has suffered severe deforestation and erosion, which together have negatively affected the lake ecosystem, which added to the impact of climate change have led to a significant reduction of the water surface. Plans for sustainable development are made in recent years.Castellanos Urbina, 2005, p.217 Since 1970, a soil remediation process with Acaia decurrens, Pinus patula and Eucalyptus globulus was started, but due to the lack of management, the problems related with water scarcity due to the reduction of runoff and water contained in the soil increased. Nowadays the entire basin is located within a forest reserve that has little management by the authorities. By oral tradition, it is known that the lake had a great variety of species, such as \\"Guapucha\\" (Grundulus bogotensis) and \\"Capitan de la Sabana\\" (Eremophilus mutisii), now locally extinct due to the desiccation of the water body and the introduction of carp and trout, which also disappeared by the same effect of El Niño in 1998. Fish in Lake Suesca The lake is an important stop-over for many migratory birds, but few counting exercises have been made in the area.

Parrish was fluent in the Mohawk and Delaware languages after having lived among the Munsee and Mohawk nations for six years as a child. Parrish's residence with the Indian nations began when he and his father were kidnapped by members of the Munsee Indian nation on July 5, 1778. Captivity and a new family At the age of eleven, Jasper and his Father, Zebulon Parrish, were kidnapped by the Munsee in southern New York. He was separated from his father, who was returned to the family in a prisoner of war exchange. Jasper remained with the Indians for seven years. In 1780, Jasper was sold to David Hill (Karonghyontye), a Mohawk chief, and formally adopted by his family. In 1784, at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War and after a surrender at Fort Stanwix, he was given the choice to remain with the Hill family or return to his own. He chose to return to his own family. Although he was fluent in the Delaware and Mohawk languages, he had lost his knowledge of English. Reintegration and a job with the US Government Although Jasper Parrish had lost his fluency in English, after he returned to his birth family, he also returned to school for a year and then studied extensively on his own. In 1790 he was asked to serve as an interpreter for the newly formed US Government. In 1792 he relocated to Canandaigua and worked under General Israel Chapin who was Superintendent of the Six Nations. The Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy consisted of the Mohawk (with whom Jasper Parrish had known family relationships), the Oneida, the Cayuga, the Seneca, the Onondaga, and the Tuscarora. Interpreter and Sub Agent Parrish worked for the US Government for almost thirty years. He was involved in the negotiation of treaties and the securing of wampum for the Iroquois. He provided interpretation for The Pickering Treaty, signed at Canandaigua of 1794. This treaty resulted in peace between the Iroquois and the US Government as it gave the Six Nations ownership of their land. Members of the Iroquois were still receiving payment based on this treaty as late as 1941. Appreciation Expressed by the Iroquois Japser Parrish and Horatio Jones, another interpreter, were so appreciated for their services and themselves by the Iroquois, that in 1798 they were given large land grants from the Six Nations. The words of a leader, Farmer's Brother, convey the appreciation they felt. An excerpt is provided below. > You will recollect the late contest between you and your father, the great > King of England.

During his time at the House of Blues, Sterling helped the company expand from 3 venues to over 10, including those in top markets such as Las Vegas, Orlando, and Chicago. Sterling also owned and partnered with House of Blues to open the House of Blues Atlanta inside the Atlanta Baptist Tabernacle building in 1996. He was tasked with getting the space renovated and opened in under 60 days, which was accomplished when the venue opened in July 1996 for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Later when House Of Blues backed away from the Atlanta venue, Sterling put an additional investment into the venue - renaming it The Tabernacle (named by Rolling Stone an USA Today as one of the best venues in the United States) and continuing to run it fully under his own banner. Under Sterling's direction, the Tabernacle hosted Tyler Perry's first successful stage production, \\"I Know I've Been Changed,\\" in 1998. Sterling sold the venue to SFX Entertainment, Inc. in 1999. Sterling is currently the owner of The Canyon Agoura Hills, The Rose in Pasadena and The Canyon Santa Clarita. It has been most recently announced, that Sterling will open a Canyon Inland Empire club by the end of this year. The 1,500-seat club will be in Montclair. He also operates the Saban Theatre concert venue in Beverly Hills, California and produces concerts at the Libbey Bowl in Ojai[1]. Rock, country, jazz and comedy heroes of the baby-boomer generation frequent his venues, as well as ‘80s one-hit wonders and the occasional punk show with a mosh pit of young people[2] Sterling’s venues also host a wide range of private events such as mitzvahs, corporate parties, and weddings. The opening of Sterling's fifth club comes as music becomes more corporate. Large concert operators sometimes have radius clauses in performers contracts that prohibit them from playing at independent venues within a certain distance of the corporate-owned locations. Sterling has countered with a strategy of trying to build up enough venues so he can offer musicians a regional circuit. Since expanding into the Southern California market, approximately 2.5 million people have streamed through the venues doors this year to see notable artists and groups like B.B. King, Willie Nelson, Ray Davies, Etta James, Heart, Pat Benatar, Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, Mary Chapin Carpenter, local boys Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Eddie Money and many, many others.[2] Sterling is also involved in the Fox Sports Grill chain and owned Canyon Club venues in Scottsdale, Arizona and Las Vegas.[3] Recently, Sterling bought the rights to Los Angeles food franchise CaliBurger and opened locations adjacent to The Canyon in Santa Clarita and The Rose in Pasadena. [5] Sterling plans to add a CaliBurger in the rest of his venues as well.

September 23, 2014 He was always into music but didn’t work in the industry until after his college years. He attended the University of Arizona where he studied civil engineering and then worked for several years as a structural engineer for a billboard company. After some time with the company, Sterling learned he could make more money as a concert promoter than as a civil engineer. He then went to work for Loews Hotel Corporation, where he would run the concerts & nightclubs and food & beverage divisions. Sterling got his real start in the music industry in the early 1990s, when he met Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Isaac Tigrett, who was then starting the House of Blues. House of Blues went on to book artists such as Eric Clapton and Aerosmith and became one of the industry's best-known venue chains. In 1996, Sterling was charged with going to Atlanta to build and open the House of Blues Atlanta in time for the 1996 Olympics, a feat which he completed in under 60 days. When the company abandoned plans to continue the location in 1997, Sterling decided to run it independently as the Tabernacle, while continuing his work for House of Blues, travelling between Atlanta and Los Angeles weekly. [1] Sterling Venue Ventures Sterling sold the Tabernacle to SFX Entertainment Inc. in 1999 for $6 million, after turning down a House of Blues offer for $6 million in stock options. He then opened The Canyon in Agoura Hills in 2001, where the opening concert was Pat Benatar. Sterling targets the 30-and-over crowd with legacy acts such as Kenny Rogers, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chris Isaak, Berlin, Styx, and Blue Oyster Cult. His customers are loyal, with the average patron attending nearly 12 shows a year at Sterling’s sub-2,000 seat venues. In 2013, Sterling took over the 1,900-seat Saban Theatre, complete with $5 million in renovations courtesy of billionaire Haim Saban. At the restored Art Deco venue, Sterling faces competition from music industry giants such as AEG and Live Nation Entertainment Inc. Both companies are based in the L.A. area and operate many of the region's most popular live entertainment destinations including Nokia Theatre, Staples Center and House of Blues. Sterling opened The Rose and Caliburger in Pasadena in March 2016. Sterling also produces concerts at The Libbey Bowl, in Ojai, CA. The venue, constructed in 1957, is outdoor and enchanting and has hosted numerous performances from some of the most influential artists in the world. When Sterling is not managing and running venues, or with his family, he is on the hunt scouting opportunities for new locations. In the most recent Sterling Venue Ventures (SVV) project, Sterling opened The Canyon in Santa Clarita, California, which took over a former 25,000-square-foot Red Robin restaurant and will include another CaliBurger location. The club opened in December 2017. Since opening, the Valencia venue has quickly become the second-highest grossing location Sterling operates. SVV ranked at almost $20 million in revenue and, after the launch of the new venues, he hopes to increase this initial revenue, as well as the number of performances for this upcoming year. Personal life Sterling has a wife, Caryn, and five children ranging in age from 14 to 27 years old. The family lives on a luscious 25-acre property in Ventura County, where they have an avocado ranch and sports fields they open up to some student sporting events and city league programs. The avocados Sterling grows have become the Mission Produce avocados that one can find at local grocery stores. Aside from his passions of farming and music, Sterling says he loves football. Sterling’s sons played football, which was a great opportunity for Sterling to take on the role as a coach through Pop Warner. He even started his own Pop Warner kids’ football league in the Conejo Valley with over 200 players form Calabasas to Camarillo. Sterling is also a car hobbyist, having owned over 200 cars in his lifetime. Sterling is also known for his compassion and generosity, toward the community and environment around him. At least once a month, he donates use of The Canyon and The Rose to different charities, usually related to education, and he is known to donate to non-profit organizations like Doctors Without Borders, Wounded Warriors, and more.

The church serves some 9000 parishioners and holds weekly sermons as well as weddings, burials and baptisms. Møllevang Church was constructed on the initiative of pastor Axel Hjeresen who formed a committee when it became apparent it was necessary to split St. Markus Parish. Funds for the church were contributed by the parishioners of the new Møllevang Parish and public funds from the Danish state while Aarhus Municipality contributed the land. The church was raised quickly; construction was initiated 24 June 1958 and on 21 June 1959 the new church was inaugurated. The architect C.F. Møller designed the church to unite traditional Danish church architecture with modernity. The church features a dominating roof which extends almost to the ground and an otherwise simple structure which narrows towards the altar. The only window in the church room is formed in the roof. Originally the church did not have a tower but one was added in 1968, also designed by C.F. Møller. The church and the tower are constructed of red brick. The design is kept simple with few decorations, a decision which is repeated in the interior with white walls and simple symmetry. Møllevang Church is a Green Church (Grøn Kirke).

Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University. In 1971, she co-founded the Antioch School of Law (now the David A. Clarke School of Law at the University of the District of Columbia) with her husband and law associate Edgar Cahn.  Early life  Jean Camper was born on May 26, 1935 in Baltimore, Maryland. Her father, John Emory Toussaint Camper, was a civil rights activist and physician. Her mother, Florine Thompson, was a hairdresser. She grew up in Baltimore with her sister Elizabeth, and her two half-brothers and two half-sisters from her father's first marriage. The Camper household was a regular meeting place for local NAACP figures and national civil rights leaders, such as Thurgood Marshall and her godfather Paul Robeson. Camper's father was known as \\"one of the most formidable men in black Baltimore.\\" She would draw her inspiration from him, and from a series of personal incidents which would force her to confront racial injustice. Camper was deeply effected when her younger brother, John Jr., suffering from a treatable ear infection, was refused treatment by Johns Hopkins University hospital because of his race. The hospital would eventually admitted the boy, but only after the infection had spread, forcing doctors to remove part of his brain. \\"They treated him like a monkey,\\" Camper's mother would recall. In 1950, Jean gained entrance into the prestigious Emma Willard School for Girls in New York on the recommendation of theologian Howard Thurman. Emma Willard would bring its own challenges: Many of the school's white students resisted her presence, some refusing to even live near her dormitory room. One girl told Jean that Jean's mother should be washing the floors of her house. Other similar incidents served only to increase her fury at racial injustice. At a young age, \\"a good part of [Camper's] makeup got to be anger.\\" After graduating, Camper enrolled in Northwestern University, where she would live in an all-white student dormitory. While there, one of her friends enlisted Camper as a ghostwriter for a long-distance romance she was conducting. Jean would write the letters, her friend would copy them into her own hand, and then send them off to a boy at Swarthmore. At the close of her first year, Camper was stricken with rheumatic fever and was forced to leave Northwestern to recuperate in Baltimore. When she recovered, she resumed her studies at Swarthmore College where she tracked down the recipient of her love letters: Her future husband, Edgar S. Cahn.  Marriage and The War on Poverty  Jean and Edgar were married shortly after their graduation from Swarthmore. That same year she began her studies at Yale Law School, while her husband completed a PhD in English. He would also enroll at Yale Law School, finishing in 1963. Jonathan, Jean's first child, was born the day of her first law school examination. Her second child, Reuben, was born while the couple was in England on a Fulbright fellowship. Cahn earned her LLB in 1961, and the next year she and her husband were hired on a Ford Foundation grant to help run antipoverty programs in New Haven, Connecticut. She became associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and staff attorney for the first neighborhood legal services program for the poor. The experience proved pivotal for Cahn herself as well as for the development of legal aid for the poor and for the course of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society antipoverty programs. Based on her experience in New Haven, Cahn and her husband authored their famed 1964 Yale Law Journal essay, \\"The War on Poverty: A Civilian Perspective\\" which would lead to the creation of the Legal Services Corporation, a federally funded program that remained true to Cahn's original vision to \\"promote equal access to justice in our Nation and to provide high quality civil legal assistance to low-income persons\\" (Legal Services Corporation). The Cahns' insistence that the poor be guaranteed legal counsel in civil cases was indeed new and radical. The piece impressed a number of figures in the Lyndon Johnson administration, especially Sargent Shriver, head of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO). In 1963 the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Jean Cahn had taken a position at the African Desk at the State Department and her husband went to work for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Jean Cahn then was hired by Shriver, who gave her responsibility for setting up the legal services program. Cahn quickly secured approval from the American Bar Association (ABA), winning over the ABA president Lewis Powell. Powell's support helped convince the conservative association of the merits of Cahn's approach. The program not only provided legal services to people who would not have had access to the nation's courts but also created critical employment opportunities for minority lawyers. By 1967 the OEO was spending over $40 million on legal services for the poor. However, Jean would become convinced that Shriver was abandoning the mission of legal services. Shriver too soon soured on Jean, preferring to place in her position a white male attorney who he felt would be better equipped to pitch the program to establishment lawyers. Cahn resigned and denounced Shriver before a meeting of the ABA. Her husband however, declined to tender his resignation, arguing that his presence was necessary for the program's survival. This would strain their marriage almost to the breaking point. Tensions became overwhelming when Shriver compelled Edgar Cahn to draft a response to his wife's ABA attack. \\"There should have been a divorce,\\" Jean would later recall. \\"We should never have stayed married after that.\\"  After the OEO  In 1966 Jean Cahn helped found the federally funded Center for Community Action Education (CCAE), directed by former Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) national director James Farmer. The CCAE established literacy programs in churches, schools, and community centers. While working as an adjunct professor at Howard University from 1967 to 1971, Cahn organized the Institute for Political Services to Society, which studied the District of Columbia government's response to civilian grievances, and coupled the CCAE program to a new master's of law program in law and poverty at George Washington University. = Adam Clayton Powell Jr. = Also in 1967, Cahn joined the legal team that defended Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. against corruption charges before a congressional committee. She would argue his case before the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse Congress's vote to expel him. = The Urban Law Institute = The next year Cahn founded the Urban Law Institute (ULI) at George Washington University on an OEO grant, hiring law school students to serve as advocates for the District of Columbia's low-income residents. The ULI intended to \\"make the legal system and the rule of law itself relevant and responsive to the problems of the poor\\" (Waldman). It filed hundreds of lawsuits to halt bus fare increases, compel local television stations to hire African Americans, challenge slum lords, and make the District of Columbia's government more responsive. The ULI's high visibility caused consternation in the new Richard Nixon administration and at George Washington University, which became increasingly uneasy over Cahn's troublemaking clinical law program. Even the faculty voted to end support for the institute. When Donald Rumsfeld (who had opposed the creation of the OEO as a congressman) took over direction of the program under President Nixon, Cahn's ULI was doomed. After nearly three years, the university decided that ULI's provocative work should go, prompting Cahn to declare, \\"Well, I'll just start my own damn law school\\" (Waldman).  Antioch  The Cahns approached Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to found the Antioch Law School in the District of Columbia. The new school would embody the ULI's clinical approach to instruction and its singular commitment to practicing poverty law. The Washington Post enthusiastically supported the school, and Baltimore's U.S. representative Parren J. Mitchell exclaimed that the Antioch idea \\"means that given the courage and commitment of black folks, racism, apathy, bigotry, deceit, hypocrisy—all of these can be beaten into the ground\\" (Washington Post, 31 July 1971). With the Cahns serving as co- deans—making Jean Cahn the first black female founder of a law school and the first black female dean of a law school—the enterprise began admitting an unprecedented number of women and minority students. The Cahns' ideal of \\"a law school organized around a teaching law firm\\" (Smith, 102) proved difficult to implement in practice. A demanding schedule and a requirement that students live with the poor to better understand their needs produced much unhappiness. Facilities were outdated and faculty pay was low. Worse, accusations of chaotic rule destroyed faith in the Cahns. Despite this, in just one year, students at the school filed one thousand cases on behalf of the District of Columbia's poor, making Antioch Law School \\"the largest public-interest law firm in the country\\" (Waldman). By 1977 the school was collapsing. Faculty members publicly rebuked the \\"chaos, turmoil and conflict they [the Cahns] have engendered . . . for five years\\" (Washington Post, 25 May 1977).  Later life and death  In 1976 Cahn suffered a stroke that paralyzed much of her left side for over a year while leaving the burden of running the school on her husband. Eventually, the Cahns had to mortgage their own house to pay the school's bills. Following a financial dispute between the Cahns and Antioch College, the school administration in Yellow Springs fired the couple in January 1980. Jean remained in the District of Columbia, although her husband took a job at the University of Miami Law School. From 1984 to 1986 she served as a distinguished scholar at the London School of Economics and was distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College. The couple reunited, and in 1985 Cahn moved to Miami, where she began to practice law again. In 1989 she was diagnosed with cancer but continued to practice poverty law until her death in Miami.

The Upanishad describes four kinds of sannyasins (Hindu monks), their eating habits and lifestyle. Yoga is the path of spiritual liberation for all four. Of these, the Paramahamsa monks are discussed in this text at greater length, and described as loners who are patient with everyone, free from dualism in their thoughts, and who meditate on their soul and the Brahman. Etymology Bhikshuka means \\"mendicant\\" or \\"monk\\", and is derived from the root word Bhiksu meaning \\"one who subsists entirely on alms\\".Monier Monier Williams (2011 Reprint), Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, , p. 756, see bhikSu Archive History The author of the Bhikshuka Upanishad is unknown, as is its date of composition. It was probably composed in the late medieval to modern era, most likely in the 14th or 15th century. The text has ancient roots, as its contents are identical in key details to chapter 4 of the Ashrama Upanishad, which is dated to about the 3rd century CE.Joachim Friedrich Sprockhoff (1976), \\"Saṃnyāsa: Quellenstudien zur Askese im Hinduismus\\", Volume 42, Issue 1, Deutsche Morgenländische, , pp. 117–132 (in German) Both texts mention four types of mendicants with nearly identical life styles. The two texts have a few minor differences. The much older Ashrama Upanishad, for example, mentions that each type aspires to know their self (Atman) for liberation, while the Bhikshuka specifies that they seek this liberation through a yogic path. The Bhikshuka Upanishad is a minor Upanishad attached to the Shukla Yajurveda. It is classified as one of the Sannyasa (renunciation) Upanishads of Hinduism. The text is listed at number 60 in the serial order in the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman, in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. Some surviving manuscripts of the text are titled Bhikshukopanishad ().Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, page 492 Contents Bhikshuka Upanishad consists of a single chapter of five verses. The first verse states that four types of mendicants seek liberation, and these are Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa. The text describes the frugal lifestyle of all four, and asserts that they all pursue their goal of attaining moksha only through yoga practice. The first three mendicant types are mentioned briefly, while the majority of the text describes the fourth type: Paramahamsa mendicants.॥ भिक्षुकोपनिषत् ॥ Sanskrit text of Bhiksuka Upanishad, SanskritDocuments Archives (2009) =Kutichaka, Bahudaka and Hamsa monks= The Upanishad states that Kutichaka monks eat eight mouthfuls of food a day. Prominent ancient Rishis (sages) who illustrate the Kutichaka group are Gotama, Bharadwaja, Yajnavalkya, and Vasishta. The Bahudaka mendicants carry a water pot and a triple staff walking stick. They wear a topknot hair style and ochre-coloured garments, and wear a sacrificial thread. The Bahudaka do not eat meat or honey, and beg for their eight mouthfuls of food a day. The Hamsa mendicants are constantly on the move, staying in villages for just one night, in towns no more than five nights, and in sacred places for no more than seven nights. The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow. The Hamsa monks practice the Chandrayana cycle in their food eating habit, wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle. They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.KN Aiyar, Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , p. 132 footnote 3 =Paramahamsa monks= The Bhikshuka Upanishad illustrates the Paramahamsa (literally, \\"highest wandering birds\\") mendicants with a list of names. The list includes Samvartaka, Aruni, Svetaketu, Jadabharata, Dattatreya, Shuka, Vamadeva, and Haritaka.KN Aiyar, Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , pp. 132–133 They eat only eight mouthfuls of food a day and prefer a life away from others. They live clothed, naked or in rags. The Upanishad dedicates the rest of the verses to describing the beliefs of the Paramhamsa monks. For example, The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to be found in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting under a tree, on sand beds near rivers, in mountain caves, near waterfalls, in hollows inside trees, or in wide open fields. The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind, they are the Paramahamsas. Influence The classification of mendicants in the Bhikshuka Upanishad, their moderate eating habits and their simple lifestyles, is found in many Indian texts such as the Mahabharata sections 1.7.86–87 and 13.129.J. A. B. van Buitenen (1980), The Mahabharata, Volume 1, Book 1, University of Chicago Press, , pp. 195, 204–207 Gananath Obeyesekere, an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the Princeton University, states that the beliefs championed and attributed in Bhikshuka Upanishad are traceable to Vedic literature such as Jaiminiya Brahmana. These views are also found in other Upanishads such as the Narada- parivrajakopanishad and Brhat-Sannyasa Upanishad. In all these texts, the renouncer is accepted to be one who, in pursuit of spirituality, was \\"no longer part of the social world and is indifferent to its mores\\". A test or marker of this state of existence is where \\"right and wrong\\", socially popular \\"truths or untruths\\", everyday morality, and whatever is happening in the world makes no difference to the monk, where after abandoning the \\"truths and untruths, one abandons that by which one abandons\\". The individual is entirely driven by his soul, which he sees to be the Brahman.Gananath Obeyesekere (2005), Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 99–102Oliver Freiberger (2009), Der Askesediskurs in der Religionsgeschichte, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , p. 124 with footnote 136, 101–104 with footnote 6 (in German) See also *Asceticism *Jabala Upanishad *Paramahamsa Upanishad References Bibliography  * * Category:Upanishads Category:Sanskrit texts ","title":"Bhikshuka Upanishad"},{"id":"48381432","text":"The 2011 Solomon Islands Champions League Playoff was a two-legged playoff for one spot in the 2011–12 OFC Champions League.

History  Legend has it that Denglong is one of the sons of the Dragon King, and has the habit of guarding. Used on Huabiaos, it symbolises sending the will of heaven to humans, and delivering the conditions of the people to the heavens. There is also legend that says Avalokiteśvara rides on a Denglong, thus the name Chaotianhou. In Accounts of Marvels (), it recounts Denglong as a creature from East China Sea, it can eat the brains of dragons, hover in mid-air, and is very fierce. When it is in a fight with a dragon, it spews flames for few dozens of feet, and defeats the dragon. In the 25th year of Kangxi, during the summer, 3 Jiaolong and 2 dragons were sighted fighting one Denglong, and after killing a dragon and two Jiaolong, the Denglong was killed and fell to a valley. It was ten or twenty feet long, resembled a horse, and had scales. After it died, the scales went up in flames, and thus was a Denglong.  Characteristics  The Denglong has ten characteristics that resembles animals: horns like a deer, head like a camel, ears like a cat, eyes like a shrimp, mouth like a donkey, hair like a lion, neck like a snake, belly like a Shen, scales like a koi, front paws like an eagle, and rear paws like a tiger.  Symbolism  For status, Denglong resides up on the centre of the universe, where there is two lotuses, right- side-up and upside down, where there are Sumeru with Buddhist prayers beads, thus Denglong is consider the master of all. For righteousness, Denglong brings celestial phenomena portending peace and prosperity, thus is paid service by many Emperors in history. By having Denglong at their side, Kings can be helped distinguish the righteous and the evil, ensure the country is prosperous, and the kingdom long-lasting. After the Emperor has past away, Denglong stays by his side and helps the communication between the living and the dead, helping the Emperor to past on to another reincarnation. Therefore, Denglong is consider a model for the righteousness and moral. For function, Denglong is worship as the greatest creature in China because it helps to drive away evil from its master, defend against ill-meaning wishes, takes away bad fortune, gathers and guards money.

The case of Daniel and Provided Southwick was presented to the General Court at Boston, which issued an order signed by Edward Rawson empowering the treasurer of Essex County \\"to sell the said persons to any of the English nation at Virginia or Barbadoes [sic] to answer said fines.\\" An attempt was made to sell Daniel and Provided at auction, but none of the shipmasters present were willing to take them to the West Indies. Characterizations Whittier characterized Massachusetts Governor John Endecott as \\"dark and haughty\\" and exhibiting \\"bitter hate and scorn\\" for the Quakers. Secretary Rawson is characterized as Endecott's willing minion.

She was runner up in the 2014 Republican Primary against Greg Abbott for Governor of Texas. She has written three books on politics and social change, one of which, Obama Tea Parties and God, was a local bestseller. She is the CEO of LisaServes, LLC. Fritsch is Executive Director of Team Austin Scholarship Foundation, a non-profit scholarship initiative founded by Reza Piri of Team Austin to provide underserved students scholarships to coding academies. After losing in the Republican Primary for Governor of Texas, Fritsch changed her political affiliation to independent and directed her work and activism towards representing the underrepresented, building diversity and equity for females and women of color as well as minorities. She was a 2015 TEDx presenter for TEDxGreatHillsWomen presenting “The Freedom to be The Angry Black Woman.”  Early life  Fritsch was born in Tyler, Texas and raised by her single mother. Her parents divorced when she was five. As an only child and only grandchild on her paternal side, she was surrounded and heavily engaged and influenced by African-American civic and academic leaders in her community. In her youth she studied piano, dance, and was trained and received instruction in etiquette and foreign cultures and martial arts. Fritsch is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a BA Asian Studies: Japanese Language and Literature. She also studied Japanese at Obirin University in Tokyo, Japan.  Career  Fritsch began her technology career in Silicon Valley as the only African-American woman at her tech company. Here she developed an admiration for tech and for coaching and developing techies. Her passion for solving inequity began her career in television and media where she was a talk radio show host on KLBJ for ten years. Fristch was the founder and president of ACTS Alive (Americans for Christian Conservative Truth), a \\"think tank that seeks to define the truth about conservative ideas in all forms of media.\\" Fritsch has also lent a dynamic voice as a consultant and strategist for political campaigns and fundraising efforts. As a writer, Fritsch contributed to Breitbart News and wrote for The Tea Party Review, Freedom’s Journal, GOP USA, American Thinker, Townhall, and The Daily Caller.  Television and radio  Fritsch was a member of the national advisory council for Project 21 and acted as their spokeswoman, garnering national attention for her willingness to stand up to the NAACP when the group accused the Tea Party movement of harboring racist views. Fritsch has appeared as a commentator locally on Fox7 and nationally on Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and CNN. Show appearances include The Glenn Beck Program, Your World With Neil Cavuto, The O'Reilly Factor, The Reid Report, and Erin Burnett Outfront. Fritsch began radio hosting as a fill- in host on 590 KLBJ’s “Morning Show.” She then hosted “Your Sunday Best with Lisa Fritsch” from 2006-2010.  2014 gubernatorial race  Fritsch announced her decision to run for governor to her friends and supporters at Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes. After her announcement, she followed it by interviewing in Spanish with a Spanish-language television network. Her tag line during the race was \\"I'm not your father's conservative,\\" referencing her position as the first black woman to run for governor in Texas. Fritsch received endorsements from groups such as BAMPAC, the Bastrop County Young Republicans, Texans Uniting for Reform and Freedom (TURF), BlakPAC, and the Central Texas Coalition for Life. Fritsch called on one million citizens to contribute one dollar to her campaign so she could get her message out. Fritsch often warned the Texas GOP that the state could turn Democratic if they refused to reach out to changing demographics. Fritsch also noted that she was financially the most charitable candidate in the race. She was one of three candidates running against Greg Abbott, the party favorite, and she was described as the most serious of Abbott's rivals. Fritsch finished second in a four-way primary race, behind Abbott, with 4.4% of the vote.  Political views  During her candidacy for governor in 2014, Fritsch laid out nine branches of what her vision for Texas would look like under her leadership: Education Reform: Prepare the Child, Not the Path Life is a Terrible Thing to Waste A New Day In The Republican Party Immigration Reform Policy The Second Amendment Dignity for our Veterans Texans with Disabilities Transparency States Rights Fritsch later changed political affiliations from Republican to Independent following her run for governor. She writes about this in her book Politically Corrected. Fritsch provided an analysis of the 2016 Republican Presidential candidates and provided five tips of advice to the GOP in November 2015. Recognizing herself as an \\"unlikely defender\\", Fritsch went through in expressing her support for Donald J. Trump's candidacy for president during the 2016 Republican Presidential Primary on April 28, 2016, stating that she was once a \\"state level\\" version of him in the sense that they were both 'outsiders.'  Personal life  Fritsch is a 7th generation Texan born and raised in East Texas. She was raised by her single divorced mother who worked three jobs to avoid welfare assistance and provide herself with extracurricular and educational opportunities. Fritsch went on to study at the University of Texas at Austin where she majored in Asian studies and studied abroad in Japan. Her single mother, Debra played a huge role in her political beliefs. Fritsch often recalled a moment between the two of them when she ran for governor in 2014. Her mother had abruptly stopped the Vega: \\"She looked me in the eye and said, ‘I would rather us both starve than for me to put you on a path where you didn’t have dignity and you would feel like a victim,’” Fritsch said. “At that moment, I was transformed.” While at the University of Texas, she attended a meeting for Republican students and felt that their political views mirrored those of her mother, beginning her interest in politics and activism. In 2000, Fritsch (then Delley) married Michael Fritsch. They have two children and divorced in 2017.

It feeds on Fuchsia plants, causing distortion of growing shoots and flowers. It is regarded as a horticultural pest. Description Aculops fuchsiae is too small to be seen with the naked eye; female adult mites are between long and wide, with males slightly smaller. It is white or pale yellow in colour and has a wormlike or spindle-like body shape, with two anterior (front) pairs of legs. Biology Aculops fuchsiae is host specific and the only eriophyid mite known to attack Fuchsia. It feeds on the shoot tips, where it sucks sap. It produces chemicals that interfere with the plant's normal growth, which instead becomes a distorted mass of reddish-pink or yellowish green tissue. There are several generations between late spring and autumn; the life cycle takes about 21 days at 18°C. There are four life stages: egg, larva, nymph and adult. Eggs take between 4 and 7 days to hatch at 18°C, and females lay up to 50 eggs at one time. The mite's cold tolerance is not known; it may remain active over winter if temperatures are high enough, though in cooler areas overwintering occurs beneath bud scales. The Northwest Fuchsia Society states that mites in the Pacific Northwest of the USA may have been killed by occurring over 3 to 4 nights, though outdoor mite populations in southern England appear to have survived winters with prolonged periods below . Colonization of new Fuchsia plants occurs either by the mites being blown by wind or via hitching rides on insects and other animals travelling between plants. Distribution This mite was discovered in 1971 on Fuchsia species in São Paulo, Brazil, and was first described the following year. It was introduced into California in 1981 and quickly colonised the south of the state from its introduction site near San Francisco. According to the United Kingdom's Food and Environment Research Agency, it is likely the mite was introduced into Europe in 2001/2002 on Fuchsia cuttings illegally brought from South America by a Jersey-based Fuchsia enthusiast. In 2002 it was seen at the Festival de Trévarez in Brittany, on a plant brought in by a private collector of Fuchsia, and in December 2003 it was identified at eight sites in Brittany. In 2006 the mite was identified as present on the Channel Islands, and in 2007 it was found in two private gardens in southern England, where it has since been discovered in several locations. Ecology Fuchsia species and cultivars vary in their susceptibility to gall mite infestation; although all Fuchsia can host the mite, some appear to show less damage as a result. Trials and prevalence of the mite so far suggest that species and cultivars in the Schufia and Encliandra taxonomic Fuchsia groups, native to Central America, appear to be resistant, whereas those in the Quelusia and Procumbentes groups appear to be susceptible. The most susceptible species include Fuchsia magellanica, F. coccinea and F. procumbens. Slightly less susceptible are F. denticulata, F. gehrigeri, F. macrophylla and F. triphylla. Resistant species include F. microphylla (and F. microphylla subsp. hidalgensis), F. thymifolia, F. venusta, F. boliviana, F. minutiflora, F. radicans and F. tincta. Sources disagree about the status of F. arborescens; it is considered either very susceptible, fairly susceptible or resistant. Horticultural pest Fuchsia tissue becomes so distorted as a result of gall mite infestation that affected plants fail to produce normal growth and flowers, which seriously impacts their horticultural amenity value. The mites are resistant to chemical treatments, because once symptoms are visible, the mites have already entered leaf and flower buds, which afford them protection. Products that contain abamectin or spirodiclofen provide some control, though repeated applications at four-day intervals may be necessary to break the mite life cycle. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oils can also be used, and acephate may provide control on susceptible Fuchsia cultivars. Some mites can be removed from plants by cutting off distorted tissue, though regrowth is likely to be recolonised. Trials in California showed that the best control was achieved by combining the removal of tissue with pesticide application. The options for biological control are also limited, though the predatory mite Amblyseius californicus might depress fuchsia gall mite populations. Fuchsia cultivars that have been listed as being resistant or less susceptible to gall mite damage include 'Baby Chang', 'Chance Encounter', 'Cinnabarina', 'Englander', 'Golden West', 'Isis', 'Mendocino'/'Mendocino Mini', 'Miniature Jewels', 'Ocean Mist', 'Space Shuttle' and 'Voodoo'. Resistant species are listed in the ecology section above.

She was an early member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and she edited a column covering women's suffrage issues for the socialist newspaper Forward. Suffragette movement In May 1902, Allan was instrumental in re-founding the Glasgow branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage as the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage (GWSAWS), and was a member of its executive committee.Crawford (2001), p. 246 She was a significant financial supporter, and as one of the GWSAWS vice-presidents she took up a position on the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) committee in 1903, in order to represent the association following their affiliation.Crawford (2001), p. 7 In 1906, Allan was among the audience when Teresa Billington (who had been arrested and jailed following a protest in London earlier in the year) toured Scotland, although the GWSAWS themselves refused to invite Billington to speak. In December of that year she attended a lecture by Helen Fraser as she expounded the militant principles of the newly formed Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In 1907, concerned that the non-violent GWSAWS was not being as effective as it should have been, Allan resigned from their executive committee and joined the WSPU,Crawford (2001), p. 244 although she maintained her subscription to GWSAWS until 1909. Over the following few years, Allan provided at least £350 (approximately ) in funds to the WSPU, as well as donating some funding for the Women's Freedom League (WFL) following their split from the WSPU. In addition to her monetary contributions, Allan was an active participant in the WSPU's militant activism. =Imprisonment and forced-feeding= In early March 1912, along with over 100 others Allan participated in a window smashing protest in central London. The women secreted large stones and hammers under their skirts and, once in position, in a coordinated action they destroyed shop windows in Regent Street, Oxford Street, and the vicinity. Following this, the women patiently and calmly waited for the police to arrive. While police attention was diverted elsewhere by the protests, Emmeline Pankhurst and three others managed to get close enough to 10 Downing Street to throw stones through four of its windows. In the aftermath, along with many of her associates Allan was arrested, tried, and sentenced to four months in Holloway Prison. Her imprisonment was widely publicised, and around 10,500 people from Glasgow signed a petition to protest for her freedom. Her fellow suffragette, Margaret McPhun – who was herself imprisoned in Holloway for two months in 1912 after breaking a government office window – composed a poem entitled \\"To A Fellow Prisoner (Miss Janie Allan)\\", that was included in the anthology Holloway Jingles published by the Glasgow branch of the WSPU later that year.Norquay (1995), p. 176 While in prison Allan used her privileged position to improve the levels of comfort for her inmates, including distributing confectionery and fruit to fellow suffragettes. Two months into her sentence, she barricaded the door to her cell, and it reportedly took three men with tools around three quarters of an hour to break into the room. Following this action, Allan started a hunger strike, a form of protest that had been pioneered amongst the suffragette movement by Marion Dunlop in 1909. However, following Dunlop having thus successfully forced the authorities to release her on health grounds, the British government introduced a policy of forced-feeding of imprisoned suffragettes who refused food. In accordance with this policy, Allan was force-fed for a full week. Forcible feeding was an ordeal described by Pankhurst as a \\"horrible outrage\\", and has been likened by women's history scholar June Purvis to a form of rape.Purvis (2002), p. 134 In a later letter to a friend, Allan herself stated that \\"I did not resist at all ... yet the effect on my health was most disastrous. I am a very strong woman and absolutely sound in heart and lungs, but it was not till 5 months after, that I was able to take any exercise or begin to feel in my usual health again – the nerves of my heart were affected and I was fit for nothing in the way of exertion ... There can be no doubt that it simply ruins the health.\\"Allan (1914) In February 1914, forcible feeding was implemented in Scotland during Ethel Moorhead's imprisonment for violently resisting arrest after being spotted behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of Traquair House. Allan was a key part of the campaign against this action, and as well as publicly protesting met with the Medical Prison Commissioner, Dr James Devon, to advocate against the use of a method that she regarded as likely to \\"injure permanently a woman's health.\\"Leneman (1993), p. 18 In June that year, Allan wrote to prison authorities that the burning of Whitekirk Parish Church near Edinburgh was due to the treatment of Moorhead and if other suffragettes in Perth, Arabella Scott and the woman known as 'Frances Gordon' were force fed, threatened the upcoming royal visit to Scotland could see 'disastrous' protests. And in July, Allan again intervened at the highest level, in support of Frances Parker following her imprisonment for attempted arson on Burns Cottage.Leneman (1993), p. 31 =Taxation protests= Allan was taken to court in 1913. In addition to direct suffragette action, she was involved with and supported the Women's Tax Resistance League, which argued that as women could not vote and therefore were not represented in parliament, they should not be subject to taxation.Mackintosh Architecture These beliefs led to her refusal to pay super tax on her income and investments for the financial year ending April 1912. At her trial on 1 March 1913, Allan defended herself and argued that as women were not considered 'persons' under the Franchise Act, they should not be considered 'persons' under the Finance Act either. The judge, Lord Cullen, found against her and stated that \\"it being clear on a construction of these [tax] statutes that women are not excluded from their scope.\\"The Vote (1913) =The St. Andrew's Halls incident= By early 1914, Allan had become one of the principal organizers for the WSPU in western Scotland, based in Glasgow. On 9 March 1914, Emmeline Pankhurst, the WSPU national leader, was to address a public meeting at St Andrew's Halls in the city, and Allan was in attendance. Ethel Moorhead said Allan had a presence due to her height, beauty and quietness. The event took place when Pankhurst had recently been released from prison under the terms of the new, so-called 'Cat and Mouse Act', introduced by the government to counter the suffragette hunger strikes. In accordance with the Act, once Pankhurst was returned to full health she was due to be rearrested and re-incarcerated.National Library of Scotland (2009) Glasgow police decided to use the occasion of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage.The Glasgow Herald (1914) A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges toward the ceiling. The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Despite not being positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Allan was the woman with the revolver although she tried in vain for six months afterwards to get a public enquiry into police behaviour. = Buckingham Palace incident = In May 1914, Allan was describing in The Suffragette, what she had heard of the bravery of women in the face of police brutality at the Palace in London on 21 May and how the rough treatment continued afterwards inside Hyde Park police station. Later life At the outbreak of World War I later in 1914, the WSPU suspended their suffragette activities and threw their weight behind a concerted national effort in the conflict. Allan donated in 1914, a large sum of money to Dr Flora Murray and Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson that enabled the founding of the Women's Hospital Corps.Crawford (2001), p. 8 in 1923 she chaired the Women's Watch Committee, continuing to report on public authority attitudes to women, and she was involved in the Scottish Council for Women's Trades for 20 years. Allan died in April 1968 at her home in Invergloy, near Spean Bridge in the Scottish Highlands, one month after her 100th birthday. References ;Citations ;Bibliography *Allan, Janie (1914).

Early years Kris Kaspersky was born on November 2, 1976 in the village of Uspenskoye, Krasnodar Krai, and at birth was named Nikolay. Being just a few weeks old he suffered a brain stroke, which came as a result of injection of calcium chloride, mistakenly made by a doctor. Brain tissue was partly damaged leading to minor autism. At the age of seven he made his first working radio. While studying at the elementary school he owned his first computer – Pravetz 8D, Bulgarian clone of British Oric Atmos with the documentation in Bulgarian language. The computer required connection to a tape recorder and a color TV set. For this computer Nikolay developed his first computer game. His next computer, Electronika BK-0010, helped Kris to master assembly. The third computer was ZX Spectrum, the fourth one was Agat. Except for his birthday, Kris does not remember exact dates and chronology of events, he reconstructs them based on computer models he had at various periods of his life. He graduated from high school with a silver medal. Kris was a good student, and there were only excellent marks in his certificate, however, according to Kris, to get a gold medal one needed to give bribes to local officials. He entered Taganrog University of Radio Engineering with a specialization in \\"Design of microcontrollers\\" without entrance exam. Although he went down without taking even first end-of-semester exams because \\"students hardly had a possibility to program\\" and returned to his native village. In the next year, he entered the university again \\"to calm mom\\" and again he went down. In those years Kris had IBM PC with 20 mb disk and color monitor. In cooperation with student Shurik, they organized a service of system administration in Taganrog. Some time later his companion absconded with the money. Kris Kaspersky had to give the remaining money and the computer to racketeers and returned to the native village to his parents. Then Kris made attempts to reopen the business with a trader from Armavir, took trips to Krasnodar and Rostov. Finally, Kris ended up in the capital. Publications The first article written by Kris was published when he was still in school. It was published by \\"Astrologer” magazine, and the article itself was devoted to astronomy. In 1998 Kris began to contribute actively to conferences of FidoNet RU.HACKER. Dmitry Sadchenko noted his posts and arranged him a meeting with the representatives of publishing house \\"Solon-Press\\". In 1999 \\"Solon-Press\\" published the first book of Kris Kaspersky \\"Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks\\" with 50 000 rubles of author's fee. Desktop publisher specialist Sergey Tarasov recalls: A total of 16 books had been published by 2008, including several translations into English. The books were dedicated to data protection and program optimization, computer virus and disassembling. Among these books there's also \\"Weatherlore Encyclopedia\\". Kris's interest lies in the field of computers and astronomy. Some of his articles and forum topics concern telescopes and observation of the starry sky. Along with the books Kris contributes to such magazines as \\"System administrator\\", \\"Byte\\", \\"Astrologer\\", \\"Hacker\\". The chief editor of \\"Hacker\\" magazine Nikita Kislitsin said: Recently Kris Kaspersky expressed the idea to leave Russia. And, in order to increase the audience, to start writing books originally in English. Besides Kris Kaspersky had started his English blog. In late October 2008 he made a presentation on a fundamentally new holes in Intel processors, suitable for remote capture of multiple servers at a conference Hack in the Box in Kuala Lumpur. Endeavor Security and McAfee Until recently Kris Kaspersky lived an isolated way of life in his native village. Since June 2008, he worked remotely on Endeavor Security, engaged in security of computers and networks. In 2009, McAfee acquired Endeavor Security. Since 2008 Kris has been living and working in the United States.«Migration of IT-specialists from midland: Where and how these people live abroad», Article in \\"Hacker\\" magazine. He worked for Check Point as a security expert. Some facts In order to avoid any confusion with antivirus creator Eugene Kaspersky, he spells his penname differently in Russian. His penname \\"myschh\\" was chosen owing to the novel \\"Dune\\" which is a great favorite of his (Kris often used quotations from the novel, in particular, in his first book \\"Technique and philosophy of hacker attacks\\"). The name of the protagonist of the novel is Muad'Dib, which stands for a desert mouse. Kris Kaspersky penname is not a derivative from any other word and it has no relevance to Eugene Kaspersky. Kris named himself after Casper the friendly ghost from his favorite cartoon and Kris Kelmi, whose music, nevertheless, myschh never listened to.«Good hacker» — Kris’ biography in «Big city» magazine. Kris is also known under the following pseudonyms: myschh, nezumi (jap. 鼠, mouse), n2k, elraton, souriz, tikus, muss, farah, jardon, KPNC. Kris was very lean. He spoke with a southern accent, sometimes swallowed and distorted words, softened endings of the verbs. He wore long hair and beard. He was not fussed about clothing. Kaspersky described his native village this way: \\"Dedicated ten megabits internet channel\\".  Injury and death  On February 10, 2017, Kris Kaspersky (Nikolay Likhachev) was critically injured in a hard landing after sky diving: \\"A sky diver who took a hard landing at Skydive DeLand remains in intensive care and is unable to communicate, a nurse at Halifax Health Medical Center said Monday.

The Ferguson effect was first proposed after police saw an increase in violence following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The term was coined by Doyle Sam Dotson III, the chief of the St. Louis police, to account for an increased murder rate in some U.S. cities following the Ferguson unrest. Whether this effect really exists is subject of discussions. Background Ferguson, Missouri, August 17, 2014 The term was coined by St. Louis police chief Sam Dotson in a 2014 column in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Dotson said in the column that, after the protests in Ferguson caused by the shooting of Michael Brown that August, his officers had been hesitant to enforce the law due to fears of being charged, and that \\"the criminal element is feeling empowered\\" as a result. The term became popular after Heather Mac Donald used it in a May 29, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed. The op-ed stated the rise in crime rates in some U.S. cities was due to \\"agitation\\" against police forces. She also argued \\"Unless the demonization of law enforcement ends, the liberating gains in urban safety will be lost\\", quoting a number of police officers who said police morale was at an all-time low. In 2015, Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, suggested nationwide backlash against police brutality led to officers disengaging, which, in turn, led to violent crime increasing. Black Lives Matter protest showing posters in favor of defunding the police and anti-police sentiments. In May 2016, FBI Director James Comey used the term \\"viral video effect\\" when commenting on significant increases in homicide rates in many large U.S. cities in the first half of the year. Comey specifically singled out the cities of Chicago (where murders were up 54 percent from 2015) and Las Vegas. The term was also used by Chuck Rosenberg, director of the DEA. In October 2016, the Ferguson effect was cited in a case in which a Chicago police officer was beaten for several minutes by a suspect but chose not to draw her service weapon, worried of the media attention that would come if she were to shoot the suspect.  Research  = Crime = * A February 2016 University of Colorado Boulder study looked at crime statistics from 81 U.S. cities and found no evidence of a Ferguson effect with respect to overall, violent, or property crime, but identified an increase in robbery rates after the shooting of Michael Brown (while these rates decreased before this shooting). The study concluded that \\"any Ferguson Effect is constrained largely to cities with historically high levels of violence, a large composition of black residents, and socioeconomic disadvantages.\\" * A March 2016 study by Johns Hopkins University researchers Stephen L. Morgan and Joel Pally noted a large decline in arrests and a spike in violent crime in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, consistent with a Ferguson effect. However, they highlighted certain qualifications and caveats that made it unclear whether the crime spike should be regarded as evidence of a Ferguson effect. * A June 2016 University of Missouri study by Rosenfeld, published by the National Institute of Justice found there was an \\"unprecedented\\" 16.8% increase in homicides in 56 large cities over the course of 2015, and examined the Ferguson effect as one of three plausible explanations recommended for further research. Rosenfeld stated that \\"the only explanation that gets the timing right is a version of the Ferguson effect\\" and that it is his \\"leading hypothesis\\". * A 2017 study found that violent crime was elevated and rose more in cities where concern about police violence was greatest. * Another 2017 study showed that after the shooting of Michael Brown, police traffic stops declined while hit rates went up on police searches in the state of Missouri. The study found no relationship between changes in police activity and crime rates. * In 2018, USA Today reported a sharp increase in Baltimore homicides after the local death of Freddie Grey in April 2015, showing 527 occurring in the three years prior, versus 859 in the three years following. This was accompanied by police taking an apparent blind eye to ordinary street crime, with a nearly 50% reduction in police reports of spotting potential violations themselves. * In June 2020, Harvard economist Roland Fryer and Tanaya Devi released a paper showing evidence of the Ferguson effect. Across five cities where a deadly shooting that went viralpreceded an investigation into crime and policing, they found that the violent crime rate increased, resulting in an additional 900 homicides and 34,000 excess felonies across two years. They suggest that this was caused by changes in the quantity of policing. Other theories, such as changes in community trust, were not supported by the data.https://www.nber.org/papers/w27324.pdf = Negative publicity of police = * According to Vox, \\"a 1999 study by criminologist Robert Ankony found that when police feel more alienated from, and negatively toward, members of the community, they're more likely to retreat from 'proactive' policing and do only what they need to do to respond to crimes.\\" * A 2015 study found \\"there may also be a Ferguson Effect on other aspects of police officers’ jobs\\" that made police officers less willing to engage in community partnership. The study also suggested that officers who have confidence in their authority and perceive their police department as fair are more willing to partner with their communities, \\"regardless of the effects of negative publicity\\". * A 2016 study by sociologists Matthew Desmond and Andrew V. Papachristos concluded that black people were afraid to call 911 after a heavily publicized violent beating of an unarmed black man by white police officers. After the police beating of Frank Jude in October 2004 was reported in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, there was a 17% drop in 911 calls, and a 32% increase in homicides. \\"Our research suggests that this happened not because the police 'got fetal' but because many members of the black community stopped calling 911, their trust in the justice system in tatters,\\" they wrote.Why Don’t You Just Call the Cops? By Matthew Desmond and Andrew V. Papachristos. New York Times, Sep. 30, 2016 * A December 2016 study found that police deputies who thought their supervisors were more fair were less likely to perceive danger, be unmotivated, or think that civilian attitudes toward the police have become more cynical since the shooting of Michael Brown. * A 2017 study surveyed officers in a police department in the southeastern U.S., and found that they believed negative publicity of police negatively affects civilians enough to increase crime rates. The study also found negative publicity increases officers' perceptions of a police legitimacy crisis and fear of being falsely accused of misconduct. * Criticism William Bratton, the then-New York City Police Commissioner, said in 2015 that he had seen no evidence of a \\"Ferguson effect\\" in his city. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch testified before Congress on November 17, 2015, that there was \\"no data\\" to support claims that the Ferguson effect existed. According to Slate, Ronald L. Davis, a former police chief and the executive director of President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, testified at the same hearing that the notion that police would fail to do their jobs because they were scared was \\"an insult to the profession\\".In December 2015, Edward A. Flynn, police chief of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said that although police were unnerved due to anti-police protests, this was not solely responsible for the increase in violent crime observed in his city recently, because rates of such crimes there started increasing before Michael Brown was shot. President Obama also said in a 2015 speech to the International Association of Chiefs of Police that although gun violence and homicides had spiked in some U.S. cities, \\"so far at least across the nation, the data shows that we are still enjoying historically low rates of violent crime\\", and \\"What we can't do is cherry-pick data or use anecdotal evidence to drive policy or to feed political agendas.\\" References Category:Shooting of Michael Brown Category:Crime rates in the United States Category:Race and crime in the United States Category:Law enforcement theory Category:Crowd psychology ","title":"Ferguson effect"},{"id":"48382273","text":"Abolnasr Sam Mirza Safavi (16 October 1517 – 1566) was a Safavid prince, a son of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501–1514).

While it is proven that the nearby port of Lagos was the starting point for numerous expeditions of exploration and colonization along the African coast and Atlantic islands, the existence of the School of Sagres has been questioned by some historians, All historians agree that at least since the death of Prince Henry (1460), the driver of the Portuguese discoveries center was Lisbon . The first written mention of the concept of School of Sagres dating from the seventeenth century by the English Samuel Purchas, although in the sixteenth century Damião de Gois pointed out a similar idea. Portuguese and English historians settled and popularized the term later on.  Controversy  = Romantic view = In the nineteenth century began to spread a version of the biography of Prince Henry whereby he would have installed his court in Sagres in 1418, shortly after the capture of Ceuta by the Portuguese. There would be formed around him the best of \\"science and navigation\\" and building a shipyard and a palace with the first observatory in Portugal. They even wrote that Sagres represented modern refounding \\"the systematic study of applied science\\" in Christendom\\". Others nuanced that, more than a nautical school in the modern concept of the word, Sagres was a meeting place for sailors and scientists to exchange information and techniques, designing maps, shipbuilding and organize expeditions. The diverse religious status (Jews, Muslims, Christians) of the members of the alleged Sagres school, and even the ability to remotely connect them with the Templars given the fact that Prince Henry was the commander of the Order of Christ, have increased the romantic halo that sometimes appears. = Critical view = According to the critical view, the Portuguese learned navigation in a practical way, on the decks of the ships, and not being able to find archaeological and documentary support for the \\"Escola de Sagres\\", they consider it a myth of Portuguese history.  Majorcan school influence The majorcan school influence on the Portuguese \\"navigation know how\\" is asserted by Julio Rey Pastor who says in his book La Cartografía Mallorquina (citing João de Barros and Pacheco Pereira).. \\"..That Jehuda Cresques (c. 1415) acted as founder and director of the Escola de Sagres, was known to historians for over a century, with doubts on which mestre Jacome from Majorca corresponded to the mestre Jacome contracted by Prince Henry, (although he was the only cartographer with that name). But it's unforgivable some scholars arrived to the point (based in a high cartographic ignorance), to attribute the invention of portolans to the school of the Infante, if not to him personally .. but how could that make sense, being the school founded by the emigrated Cresques (about 1400), when at his seventies he was tired of manufacturing planispheres, during half a century, for the insatiable Peter the Ceremonious and for his son, the also map-maniac DON JOAN. On top of that one should not forget to include the testimony of Pacheco Pereira...: And he continues.. It's unforgivable as well, that those scholars, could dare to write on the subject without reading João de Barros, which clearly states: \\"..mándou vir da ilha de Mallorca um mestre Jacome, hornera mui douto na arte de navegar, que fasia e instrumentos náuticos e que Ihe custou muito pelo trazer a este reino para ensinar sua sciencia aos officiaes portuguezes d'aquella mester..\\"  First results João Gonçalves Zarco arrived at Porto Santo (1419) and Madeira (1420), and on the other part Diogo de Silves found the island of Santa Maria at Azores (1427). In 1434 Gil Eanes doubled Cape Bojador, the westernmost point of Africa. This meant a period of twelve years to navigate across two hundred miles that separate the Cape Não from Cape Bojador. From this point, the Dark Sea was feared by Arab geographers for the difficulty of the return trip, sailing against the prevailing winds. This problem could be sorted out at the end, by means of high sea sailing, returning by a route far away from the coast. This breakthrough was achieved in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. The suitable vessel was the Caravel, used for fishing and characterized for its robustness and shallowness, with a tonnage from 50 to 160 tonnes, with 1, 2 or 3 masts with triangular Latin sails.

Recent conferences The 25th Conference, held in 2007 in cooperation with UNESCO, dealt with the subject of Women’s Leadership for Sustainable Development. In 2009, The Global Financial Crisis – Implications for Women was the topic of the joint conference with the UN’s Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI; later merged into UN Women). MCTC’s Jubilee Conference in 2011 on Science, Technology and Innovation: Education and Training for Women and Girls was, once again, held in cooperation with UNESCO. In 2013 MCTC hosted the 28th Conference in the series, this time on the subject of The Post-2015 and Sustainable Development Goals Agenda: Ensuring the Centrality of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in the Next Framework, in cooperation with UN-Women and UNDP. The 29th International Conference for Women Leaders will be held in October 2015, addressing the issue of Promoting Gender Equality through Economic Empowerment: Implementing the Post-2015 Development Agenda. It will be the first conference to take place after the United Nations Summit in September, in which the post-2015 development agenda was adopted, and will address the measurable targets and indicators needed to be developed in order to promote economic growth and employment.

Dutch is the mother tongue of about 60% of the population in Belgium, spoken by approximately 6.5 million out of a population 11 million people. It is the only official language in Flanders, that is to say the provinces of Antwerp, Flemish Brabant, Limburg, and East Flanders and West Flanders. Next to French, it is also an official language of Brussels. However, in the Brussels Capital Region and in the adjacent Flemish-Brabant municipalities, Dutch has been largely displaced by French as an everyday language.Harbert, The Germanic Languages, CUP, 2007Jan Kooij, \\"Dutch\\", in Comrie, ed., The World's Major Languages, 2nd ed. 2009 Belgian Dutch differs from Standard Dutch in terms of accent and vocabulary. The most spoken Dutch dialects in Belgium are West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish.Leidraad van de Taaltelefoon. Dienst Taaladvies van de Vlaamse Overheid (Department for Language advice of the Flemish government). Although the Brabant dialect of the Brussels working-class neighborhoods, in particular the Marolles, with their population has virtually disappeared, linguistic variants exist in a diminishing degree in which an influence of the Brabant can be discerned.  Changes and conflicts  Brussels is a bilingual area where both Dutch and French have an official status. The position of Dutch in Belgium has improved considerably over the past 50 years at the expense of French, which once dominated strongly in political, economic and cultural life. The main reasons for this are the strengthened economic position of Flanders and the problematic situation of heavy industry in Wallonia since the 1960s. The position of Standard Dutch as a general language has been reinforced at the expense of the previously almost exclusive use of the dialects as spoken languages. Incidentally, the status of the spoken Dutch standard is floating, which means that they are used at the socially higher level according to the rules that are also applicable in the Netherlands, but at the lower levels and especially in the local communication in many gradations to a dialect. For a long time a Flemish standard has existed as a close variant of Standard Dutch existence, the so-called Schoonvlaams. The spoken standard was also under the influence of Antwerp for a long time as a dialect with high status, which also applied outside this city. The high quality of the Dutch-speaking schools is an explanation for the growing success of the Dutch-speaking educational network in Brussels. On the other hand, French-speaking education has lacked to status due to the massive influx of non-French-speaking children. The knowledge of French as a second language among Dutch speakers in Flanders decreases, especially for the benefit of English. In Flemish education, French is no longer a compulsory second language. Such a situation already existed in French-speaking Belgium with regard to Dutch. In schools in Wallonia, Dutch is often taught as an elective, and as such it must compete against English. There are also Walloon educational institutions where several subjects are taught in Dutch as a form of Language immersion. Despite its name, Brabantian is the dominant contributor to the Flemish Dutch tussentaal. The combined region, culture, and people of Dutch-speaking Belgium has come to be known as \\"Flemish\\". Flemish is also used to refer to one of the historical languages spoken in the former County of Flanders.König & Auwera, eds, The Germanic Languages, Routledge, 1994 Linguistically and formally, \\"Flemish\\" refers to the region, culture and people of (North) Belgium or Flanders. Flemish people speak (Belgian) Dutch in Flanders, the Flemish part of Belgium.  By region  = Brussels = Number of registered voters with a Dutch address per Brussels municipality at the municipal elections of 14 October 2018. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual French–Dutch. This means that Dutch should be on an equal footing with French, which is often not the case at local Brussels level: in many municipal and regional services, hospitals, public transport, and also in shops and offices, Dutch is little used. On the other hand, Dutch in Brussels is important because the Flemish government resides there, alongside the federal government services, and especially because many Flemish people work in Brussels, but do not live there. The last official census count in Brussels dates from 1947. At that time, the proportions were 24.24% Dutch-speaking and 70.61% French-speaking. Since then no official census have been carried out. These were abolished under Flemish political pressure because they were often performed unreliable and could not be an argument for further 'minorizing' Dutch. Since then, it has been necessary to rely on other sources to get an idea of the number of Dutch and French speakers in Brussels. Dutch speakers tend to congregate in the city's northern municipalities. Languages spoken at home as determined by a 2013 survey are: , BRIO-taalbarometer 3: diversiteit als norm (pdf), Brussels Informatie-, Documentatie- en Onderzoekscentrum, 2013. * French: 38.1% * French and other language: 23.2% * Dutch and French: 17.0% * Neither Dutch nor French: 16.5% * Dutch: 5.2% In the last decade Dutch seems to be used more, both in education, where this development has been going on for some time, and in economic and social life. In 2012, 35% of the higher education institutions in Brussels were Dutch-speaking. The percentage of participants in nursery and primary education who received Dutch lessons approached 25% in 2013. The percentage of participants in secondary and higher education who received Dutch lessons was also on the rise and in 2013 reached 17%. Among foreign inhabitants of Brussels, there is also a clear increase in both the number and percentage of children and adults choosing Dutch-speaking education. = Flanders = Dutch is the official language in Flanders, but there are a number of Flemish municipalities in the Brussels Periphery with a French-speaking majority, which are officially Dutch-speaking with French- language facilities. The number of people in Flanders who submitted their vehicle registration in French in 2010 is six times higher than the number of Dutch-language applications in Wallonia. = Wallonia = To the east of the Flemish counties Voeren, in the Low Dietsch region in the Liège province, where a transitional dialect between Dutch and German is still being spoken. This regional language is closely related to that of Dutch South Limburgish, the dialect of Eupen and of the adjacent Aachen. These rural municipalities, which have been able to preserve their 'Platdietse' character despite two centuries of French-speaking administration, remained officially monolingual French after the establishment of the language border in 1963, although there is a legal possibility for facilities for Dutch or German. In the last three decades more and more Germans working in Aachen have settled in this region. They do not reinforce the Dutch language but a German language element. There has also been a considerable linguistic deviation of Flemish workers with their families to the Borinage and the Liège industrial areas. This immigration took place from the 19th to the middle of the 20th century. These were mostly dialect speakers who had little or no knowledge of Standard Dutch and became French-speaking quite quickly. The conservative Belgian government and especially the Catholic clergy also saw such 'social risks' for Flanders in the rise of socialism in these industrial areas, and therefore stimulated train and tram traffic, which allowed the Flemish to continue to live in their own environment. In the years after the Second World War, many Flemish farmers also moved to Wallonia, often because of the size of the farms and the attractive price of agricultural land. Dutch has also become more important in tourism, especially in the Ardennes. The Flemish and Dutch are increasingly serviced at campsites, hotels and attractions in their own language by Dutch- speaking staff. There are also more Flemish families now living across the language border because it is cheaper to build, buy or rent. These developments do not yet lead to legal facilities for Dutch speakers.  Characteristics  Dutch is the majority language in northern Belgium, being spoken natively by three-fifths of the population of Belgium. It is one of the three national languages of Belgium, together with French and German, and is the only official language of the Flemish Region. The various Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium contain a number of lexical and a few grammatical features which distinguish them from the standard Dutch.G. Janssens and A. Marynissen, Het Nederlands vroeger en nu (Leuven/Voorburg 2005), 155 ff. As in the Netherlands, the pronunciation of Standard Dutch is affected by the native dialect of the speaker. All Dutch dialect groups spoken in Belgium are spoken in adjacent areas of the Netherlands as well. East Flemish forms a continuum with both Brabantic and West Flemish. Standard Dutch is primarily based on the Hollandic dialect (spoken in the Western provinces of the Netherlands) and to a lesser extent on Brabantian, which is the dominant dialect in Flanders, as well as in the south of the Netherlands. The supra-regional, semi-standardized colloquial form of Dutch spoken in Belgium uses the vocabulary and the sound inventory of the Brabantic dialects. It is often called Tussentaal (\\"in- between-language\\" or \\"intermediate language\\", intermediate between dialects and standard Dutch).

It aired from 1932-1936, 1939, 1940 and 1946-1947, and it was notable for being the first science fiction radio show. Broadcasting history Buck Rogers was initially broadcast as a 15-minute show on CBS Radio, from Monday through Thursday. It first ran from November 7, 1932, until May 22, 1936 . In 1936, it moved to a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule and went off the air the same year (720 episodes, 180 hours). Mutual Broadcasting System brought the show back and broadcast it three days a week from April 5 to July 31, 1939 (51 episodes, 12.75 hours), and from May 18 to July 27, 1940, a 30-minute version was broadcast on Saturdays (11 episodes, 5.5 hours). From September 30, 1946, to March 28, 1947, Mutual aired a 15-minute version on weekdays (78 episodes 19.5 hours). The show was directed by Carlo De Angelo and Jack Johnstone. De Angelo also produced it. Sound effects were provided by Ora Daigle Nichols. In 1988, Johnstone recalled how he worked with the sound effects of Ora Nichols to produce the sound of the rockets by using an air-conditioning vent. Dick Calkins, who also made the comic strip, wrote the scripts. Actors Matt Crowley, Curtis Arnall, Carl Frank and John Larkin all voiced Buck Rogers at various times. Wilma Deering was portrayed by Adele Ronson, and the brilliant scientist-inventor Dr. Huer was played by Edgar Stehli.

(A) Pancreatic tissues are scattered in the mesentery (black arrows). (B) The Brockmann body is indicated with an arrow. Brockmann body is an endocrine organ in some teleost fish, and is composed of a collection of islet tissues. The islet tissues are in turn composed of endocrine cells which are the principal sites of insulin synthesis. They are distributed around the spleen and the large intestine. They also secrete other hormones such as glucagon and somatostatin. Hence, Brochmann body is the centre of control of blood glucose level in these fishes. Glucagon is also produced from the intestine, but Brockmann body is the major source. Increased level of glucose stimulate the Brockmann body to release insulin, while inhibiting glucagon. Somatostatin released from Brockmann body inhibits cells to produce insulin and glucagon. In addition it inhibits release of growth hormone from the pituitary. It is named after a German physician Heinrich Brochmann who discovered it in 1848. Brochmann body has gained a new attention in medical research, specifically in the management of type I diabetes mellitus. This is because the tissue is easy to harvest, and its insulin can be easily extracted. In addition, the teleost fishes can regenerate their endocrine tissues after harvest, the property of which has challenging implication in human diabetes. Structure A typical Brochmann body is mass of whitish nodules of variable sizes, ranging from 1 to 8 mm in diameter. The nodules are composed of polygonal and elongated cells. The cells are enveloped with connective tissues. They are separated into two major islets: one is found near the spleen and the other is located inside the wall of the duodenum, at the pyloric junction. Both islet groups contain insulin, glucagon, peptide YY and somatostatin, but these proteins are secreted only in the pyloric Brockmann bodies. The amino acid sequence and primary structure of the hormones are slightly different from their counterparts in higher vertebrates. For example, tilapia and human insulin differs by 17 amino acids. There are also amino acid variation among different species; for example, glutamine residue, at position 5 in the A-chain of insulin in most teleosts, is replaced by glutamic acid in tilapia. Medical significance Brochmann body shows medical benefits in the management of endocrine and immunological disorders. An advantage of using teleost fish over other animals, such as pigs, in the studies of diabetes mellitus is that its endocrine cells are separated from the pancreatic exocrine tissue and can be easily isolated and harvested. While mammalian pancreas is expensive and laborious to collect. Further, fish tissue can be preserved in better condition for longer period. Moreover, the teleost fishes can regenerate their endocrine tissues after harvest, implying that the property could be beneficial in type I diabetes mellitus. The Brockmann body of the tilapia (Oreochromis nilotica) is investigated as a potential xenograft tissue for patients with type 1 diabetes. The transplantation of tilapia Brockmann bodies into a diabetic mice model has been shown to promote long-term normal blood glucose level. The tilapia islet grafts give better blood glucose level than rat or mouse islet grafts. But as in mammalian transplant, tissue rejection is a problem. An attempt to solve this is creation of a transgenic tilapia that contain a human insulin gene. These transgenic tilapia produce stable amount of human insulin, and are now undergoing selective breeding.

It was published on 5 January 2012 by Oxford University Press, and contains 31 academic papers. Oakley defines pathological altruism as \\"altruism in which attempts to promote the welfare of others instead result in unanticipated harm.\\" Overview The book comprises a collection of essays which discuss negative aspects of altruism and empathy towards others, such as when altruism hurts the altruist, is taken to an unhealthy extreme, or causes more harm than good. Examples given include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid. It is considered the first book to explore negative aspects of altruism and empathy. According to Oakley, anorexia, supporting addictions of other people (codependency), animal hoarding, depression, guilt and self-righteousness can be pathological altruism. Oakley has also stated that suicide bombings and genocides can be caused by pathological altruism, when perpetrators of these acts believe they are behaving altruistically towards those who share their ideology. Oakley further states that some people are naturally \\"hypersensitive\\" or they have an excessive desire to \\"help\\" others. According to Oakley, such people are convinced that they are helping others without considering the practical results of their \\"help\\".

Nursing Standard said \\"I recommend this book to health professionals looking for a deeper understanding of altruism and its motivation. The arguments are clear and scholarly, and supported by a wealth of references.\\" Writing in The New York Times, Natalie Angier called the book a \\"scholarly yet surprisingly sprightly volume.\\" She wrote, > pathological altruism is not limited to showcase acts of self-sacrifice... > The book is the first comprehensive treatment of the idea that when > ostensibly generous 'how can I help you?' behavior is taken to extremes, > misapplied or stridently rhapsodized, it can become unhelpful, unproductive > and even destructive.

Their report states: “Having examined the Programmes and qualifications of ICMA, the Committee observed that they compare favorably with those of similar recognized accounting Bodies. It was therefore recommended that holders of ICMA qualifications be placed at par with their counterparts holding qualifications of similar Accounting Bodies such as Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) and Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN). In June, 2006 CICMA established an offshoot known as the Association of Cost and Management Accountants.

Its purpose was to raise awareness of Indian issues to the public in Britain, to whom the Government of India was responsible. It followed the work of W.C. Bonnerjee and Dadabhoi Naoroji, who raised India related issues in the British parliament through the support of radical MPs like Charles Bradlaugh. William Wedderburn served as the first chairmanship and William Digby as secretary. History The decades following the 1857 rebellion were a period of growing political awareness in India, moulding of Indian public opinion for self-governance, and emergence of Indian leadership at both national and provincial levels. Dadabhai Naoroji formed the East India Association in 1867 and Surendranath Banerjee founded the Indian National Association in 1876. The Congress was founded in 1885 by Indian and British members of the Theosophical Society movement, including Scotsman Allan Octavian Hume. Its objective was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between educated Indians and the British Raj. From its inception, the organisation met annually to express its loyalty to the British Raj and passed numerous resolutions on less controversial issues such as civil rights or opportunities in government (especially in the civil service). These resolutions were submitted to the Viceroy's government. Alan Octavian Hume left India in 1894 to return to Britain. At the time of his departure, Hume held the opinion that to implement political change and self-governance in India, political work was required in Britain to raise awareness of Indian issues among the British public. William Wedderburn held the same train of thought, since the Government of India was constitutionally responsible to the British electorate. Congress leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji and W.C. Bonnerjee had been able to enlist the support of radical MP Charles Bradlaugh to take up Indian issues in the British Parliament. In 1888 the Congress recruited an agency in Britain to publicise Indian issues to the British public. Headed by Digby, this organisation arranged public lectures in England and began public distribution of pamphlets highlighting issues in India. In July 1889, a permanent committee was established with Wedderburn as chairman and Digby as secretary. Bradlaugh died in 1891, but the British committee of the Congress had been able to establish an Indian Parliamentary Committee pressure group. In 1903, Henry Cotton, a radical politician, joined the committee and rapidly became the leading member of Labour party MPs who formed the core group of the parliamentary committee. Cotton's efforts championed, among others, the labour-rights of tea-plantation workers in Assam. Among other notable members of the committee was Keir Hardie. The British Committee of the Congress continued to function up to 1920, when it lost its support in the Congress due to a decline in moderatist membership, and it was abolished. Activities The British Committee published the journal India as an organ for the Congress' views. It also organised public meetings. The influence of its early works resulted in the Indian Councils Act 1892. However, its moderatist approach came in for criticism by politicians like Henry Hyndman, who advocated more radical approaches including \\"insurrection\\" and violence. Indian nationalists like Shyamji Krishna Varma castigated what he saw as the timid approach of the Congress' British committee. Krishna Varma later founded India House with the support of Hyndman and other radical Indian nationalists. To counter the India, he began publishing his own radical journal called The Indian Sociologist. See also *History of the Indian National Congress References Sources * *.

It was a failed initiative to capture the northwestern Greek town of Konitsa, in order to establish a capital for the Provisional Democratic Government; a rival authority to the recognized government in Athens. This was part of the communist \\"Operation Limnes\\" (Lakes) which aimed the capture of a major Greek town. Background In March 1947, one year after the start of the Greek Civil War, the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE), founded and mainly supported by the Greek Communist Party, mainly controlled some mountainous pockets in Northern Greece and Peloponnese. It commanded an army of 13,000 troops with limited support by former ELAS fighters and an unknown network of civilians mainly in towns and villages throughout Greece. At the same time, the spearhead of the former People's Greek Liberation Army (ELAS), ca. 100.000 people were imprisoned or exiled in small islands. By mide-1947, the force of DSE had grown to 23,000 in battalions, regiments and brigades formed after the ex-ELAS structure with 1 General HQ in the North and 3 Regional HQs in the rest of the country. A provisional government was founded as the counterpart of the recognized government of Athens, and gain the silent support of the Socialist governments in Bulgaria, Albania and Yugoslavia. However, DSE did not manage to control any major cities, and DSE High Staff, decided to make the town of Konitsa, 8 miles from the Albanian border, the capital of the Democratic Provisional Government. If DSE could control a major city with a considerable area, they could still hope for the recognition of a northern Greek Communist State by the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Battle The townspeople of Konitsa, contrary to Vafiadis' expectations, sided with the Athens government and fortified their town against DSE, fighting alongside the government army. To this, helped also the \\"scorched earth\\" policy of the Governmental Army in the areas around major towns, that was emptying all villages from their inhabitants, bringing them into fortified towns and calling them \\"refugees due to guerilla activity\\" (συμμοριόπληκτοι). DSE attacked the bridge of Bourazani spanning the Aoos River, to cut off government forces in the regional capital Ioannina from the town. The government flew in troops in DC-3s provided by civilian airliners. Despite the assistance of 105mm artillery provided by Albania, the communists were defeated. During the battle, Queen Frederica visited the town, welcomed by colonel Dovas. Aftermath The government army, totaling 200,000 strong (8 divisions and 3 independent brigades), with artillery, armor, aircraft and Anglo-American assistance, far outnumbered DSE forces.

Biography  Born in Rotorua in 1945, to parents Richard and Bebe Lord. He has an older brother. His fathers job took the family around the country and they lived in various cities in New Zealand while he was growing up including Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Invercargill. Lord attended schools in Auckland, Hamilton and Southland Boys' High School in Invercargill. Lord was educated at three tertiary institutions. First the University of Otago, then Victoria University of Wellington (1965 - 68) and after that he gained his teaching qualification at Wellington Teachers College. In 1969, he won the Katherine Mansfield Young Writers Award. At this time in New Zealand professional theatre in New Zealand was just beginning, and in Wellington where Lord was, Downstage Theatre had opened in 1964 and Unity Theatre was active. Victoria University started a Drama Department in 1970 which Lord attended at age 25, the professor recounts meeting Lord for the first time: > \\"an imposingly tall man - well over six feet, with light brown hair, a > slight stoop and a manner that could switch from being serious and earnest > to riotously funny in the course of a single sentence.\\" Philip Mann For a period of time Lord worked backstage at Downstage Theatre, was teaching school, studying drama and writing plays at night. Lord's first full-length play was It Isn’t Cricket (1971) and it was selected for the inaugural Australian National Playwrights' Conference in 1973 which he attended. Following up from that event alongside Nonnita Rees, Judy Russell and Ian Fraser he formed Playmarket to increase the number of plays by New Zealand writers available for New Zealand theatres. In 1974 Lord travelled to New York City on an Arts Council travel bursary, and he stayed for several years. He signed with the New York agent Gilbert Parker from the William Morris Agency. Plays from the 1980s include Country Cops, this is revision of Well Hung (1985) and was presented at Trinity Square Repertory in New York. Unfamiliar Steps (1983) was later called Bert and Maisie and was adapted for television in 1988. His play The Travelling Squirrel is based in New York and was written in 1987 although not performed in New Zealand until 2015. In 1987 he returned to New Zealand to take up the Robert Burns Fellowship in Dunedin. He was involved with several New Zealand theatres: Mercury Theatre, Auckland (writer- in-residence, 1974); Circa Theatre and Downstage Theatre, Wellington; and Fortune Theatre, Dunedin (writer-in-residence, 1990). The play Joyful and Triumphant was commissioned by Circa Theatre and premiered there as part of the New Zealand Festival programme in 1992, following which it toured Australia. Lord died just before it opened so never got to see it on stage. In 1992 Joyful and Triumphant received the following Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards: Production of the Year, Director of the Year, and New Zealand Playwright of the Year. The play tells a story about a small-town New Zealand family over 40 years in a series of Christmas Day scenes. Circa Theatre chose Joyful and Triumpant as part of their 40th anniversary celebrations. He also wrote one-act plays, radio plays and screenplays. His plays have been produced or published in New Zealand, Australia and the United States. Lord died in 1992, aged 46, from cancer and HIV/AIDS complications.

It was presented by Belgian cartoonists Kamagurka and Herr Seele http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php and aired each Sunday afternoon between 13.00 and 14.00 p.m. Historical background Kamagurka and Herr Seele were well known cartoonists in the Flemish magazine Humo, who had already made stage shows, novelty singles and television series during the 1980s and 1990s before their own radio show on Studio Brussel aired. Just like these past endeavours Studio Kafka was full with absurd comedy sketches, some of them based on earlier material. Kamagurka intercut these sketches with songs and atmospheric music from his personal record collection. Some of their assistants, Gunter Lamoot, Piet De Praitere http://comedyinvlaanderen.be/wb/pages/comedians/piet-de-praitere.php and Bart Vanneste had previously won the Grote Prijs W.P. Stutjens, a contest for new comedy talent. Kamagurka was one of the jury members and hired them as co- actors on the show. In 1999 Flemish singer Eddy Wally was co-host. Recurring items The show was notable for several recurring segments, among them Kamiel Kafka, an absurd philosopher and poet whom Kamagurka had already played during stage and television shows. Kamagurka also narrated the adventures of Cowboy Henk, while Herr Seele did the voice of Henk. Piet de Praitere presented a segment called \\"Etienne met het Open Verhemelte\\" (\\"Etienne with the Open Palate\\"), in which the character Etienne is unable to make himself understandable to listeners due to his condition.http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php Another recurring item was De Tactloze Top 100 (\\"The Tactless Top 100\\"), a parody on hitparade music, where Kamagurka played bizarre music by acts like Frank Zappa, The Residents, Barnes & Barnes and his own novelty singles. In 2000 a compilation CD with Kama's music from \\"De Tactloze Top 100\\" was released.http://houbi.com/belpop/albums/kamagurka.htm Spin-offs The 2002 radio program Kamagurkistan was a similar show.

The film is a fantastical social tragicomedy. Plot The movie is set in against the dusk of the Soviet Union and associated changes in economical and social life. Near one of Moscow's train stations, on a landfill site, a group of vagrants lives. Due to a variety of reasons, once prosperous people have lost their jobs, homes, loved ones and began living at a landfill. Among them are: Anthemia, a talented artist; her brother Fedor Yelistratov, who was repressed in the days of Stalinism; Solomon, a former engineer, who lost his job because his family emigrated to Israel; and former cook and housemaid Katya, who was beaten and kicked out of her house by her drunkard son. The head of those unfortunate people is \\"President\\" - a former party worker Dmitry Loginov, who like his friend Fedor, was in Stalin's camps. One night the President tells his friends incredible news. He allegedly had contact with aliens, who promised to take all those people to their planet - to the place where happiness, joy and peace rule. At the right day and hour of the homeless are supposed to receive the signal from the \\"visitors from the sky\\": blue snow shall fall. They prepare for a long trip, but authorities are going to liquidate the landfill site to build a condom factory. The President and other inhabitants of the landfill are trying to protect their home, but the authorities in their pursuit to liquidate the camp of homeless people are ready to do anything. At a winter night, \\"blue\\" snow begins to fall from the sky. The President and his \\"fellow citizens\\" go out to meet the good aliens, but they see heavily armed police squads and tanks approaching them that should raze vagrants' shacks to the ground. Desperate people load on the old steam train, power it up and as it gains speed, it takes off the ground, to the Promised Heavens.

Early life He was born in Edinburgh. His father, also James Russell (d 1773), was a surgeon who became Deacon (President) of the Incorporation of Surgeons in 1752. He gave up his surgical career to take up the Chair of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1764 succeeding Adam Ferguson who had become Professor of Moral Philosophy.Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. (1874). List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873. Edinburgh: R.C.S.E. James Russell senior was a cousin of the chemist Joseph Black. He married Margaret Balfour of Pilrig, great aunt to Robert Louis Stevenson. Their son, James Russell, was educated at the Royal High School from 1761 to 1764 and then studied medicine at Edinburgh University. Surgical career James Russell followed his father into a surgical career. He became a Fellow of the Incorporation of Surgeons in 1777, a year before it became the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. From 1780-1792 he served as College Librarian and in 1796 was elected President of the College. From 1800 he was appointed one of six surgeons-in-ordinary on the staff of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1803 he published an article \\"Singular variety of Hernia\\" in which he gave a clear description of direct inguinal hernia, one of the earliest published accounts of the difference between the direct and indirect varieties.Russell J. (1805) A singular variety of hernia Ed. Med. and Surg.

Russell had been giving a private surgery lecture course since 1786 and his lectures appear to have been well received. In an effort to expand this aspect of his career, he was drawn into the controversy over the establishment of a Chair of Clinical Surgery at the University of Edinburgh. Founding of a Chair of Clinical Surgery For many years the Incorporation of Surgeons had lobbied the Town Council for a chair of Clinical Surgery to be established in the University. This had been successfully resisted by Alexander Monro secundus and his son Monro tertius who had both taken the titles of Professor of Anatomy and Surgery although neither had ever been a practising surgeon.Wright-Saint, C. R. E. (1964). Doctors Monro: A medical saga, by Rex E. Wright-St Clair. London: Wellcome historical medical library. In 1802 Russell petitioned the Town Council to be appointed the first Professor of Clinical Surgery and the Professors Monro withdrew their opposition. Russell was appointed to the new chair in 1804 on a salary of £50 per year, obtained from the Crown, making this a regius chair.http://www.ed.ac.uk/files/imports/fileManager/History%20of%20the%20School%20of%20Surgery.pdf Russell continued in the chair until the age of 78 and when he retired in 1833 he made it a condition that his successor should pay him a salary of £300 per year for his lifetime. Robert Liston, a strong contender for the chair, refused \\"in rather coarse terms\\" to pay this sum and James Syme was appointed as Russell's successor.Miles, A. (1918).

An anonymous birth is a birth where the mother gives birth to a child without disclosing her identity, or where her identity remains unregistered. In many countries, anonymous births have been legalized for centuries in order to prevent formerly frequent killings of newborn children, particularly outside of marriage. In an anonymous birth, the mother's right of informational self-determination severely curtails the children's right to know about their biological ancestry, therefore going beyond the concept of a confidential birth, where the identity of the mother is registered but remains undisclosed, unless the grown up child requests disclosure at a later point.  History  = Background = High rates of infant abandonment, child neglect, and neonaticide created the preventative systems of baby hatches, anonymous birth, confidential birth, which are forms of giving birth without personal information or privately disclosing information.최예니 . “Study on Confidential Birth and Safety Measures of Infants from Unmarried Mothers.” SNU Open Repository and Archive: Study on Confidential Birth and Safety Measures of Infants from Unmarried Mothers, 서울대학교 대학원, Aug. 2018, s-space.snu.ac.kr/handle/10371/137993#export_btn Infant abandonment is a form of child abandonment where a parent leaves their infant in attempt to end their guardianship. Child neglect is the lack of care given to a child. Neonaticide is a form of infanticide where babies are killed within 24 hours of their birth.Tanaka, Cintia T et al \\"The Worldwide Incidence of Neonaticide: a Systematic Review.\\" Archives of Women's Mental Health : Official Journal of the Section on Women's Health of the World Psychiatric Association. 20.2 (2017): 249-256. Print. Particularly with neonaticide, women are predominantly young, unmarried, with unintended pregnancies. They also typically do not have a mental disorder. These women often hide their pregnancy and do not receive pre-natal care.Hatters Friedman, Susan, Resnick, Phillip J. Neonaticide: Phenomenology and considerations for prevention, International Journal of Law and Psychiatry, Volume 32, Issue 1, 2009, Pages 43-47, ISSN 0160-2527, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2008.11.006. Prevention of neonaticide, as well as, the other forms of child neglect, are through the anonymous and secretive measures of anonymous birth, confidential birth, and baby hatches. Early systems of anonymous birth can be found in France and Sweden in the 1600s and 1700s. Within beginning of the 21st century, nations proposing the policy of anonymous birth, along with baby hatches, have been Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. In addition, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Russia, and Ukraine, allow mothers to keep their identity private.Simmonds, Claire. \\"An Unbalanced Scale: Anonymous Birth and the European Court of Human Rights.\\" Cambridge Law Journal. 72.2 (2013). Print. Alternatively, a form of anonymous birth and confidential birth occurs in the U.S. through Safe-haven laws. Early anonymous birth legislation can be found in Sweden where the Infanticide Act of 1778 granted mothers both the right and all means to give birth to their child anonymously.Beljestrand, Maria. \\"EN FÖRÄLDER BLIR TILL: Om fastställande och upphävande av föräldraskap och förhållandet till barnets bästa.\\" (2011). = Countries= France In France the tradition of anonymous births can be traced to 1638 when Vincent de Paul who instituted the tour, a form of baby hatch. During the French Revolution anonymous births were legalized in 1793, when Article 326 of the Code Civil introduced both the concepts of anonymous and confidential births. The decree provided for the creation of safe spaces for women to give birth safely. In 1811 the assistance was replaced with a system of baby hatches. This however caused a surge in abandoned babies and was never fully implemented. By 1860 the system of baby hatches called tours were all closed, and the practice was officially abolished in 1904 in favor of other pro-birth policies between 1870 to 1945. The pro-birth policies developed out of historical events of war and revolution. Anonymous birth still continued from the 1870s to 1940s with approximately 1000 children every year ending up in the system. Public hospitals, by 1941 are required to allow women to give birth anonymously if requested. In the 1940s, the official birth certificates in France say \\"sous X\\" meaning born under X in the place of their birth- giver.Margaria, Alice. \\"Anonymous Birth.\\" The International Journal of Children's Rights. 22.3 (2014): 552-580. Print. In 1943 there is a waiting period of a month where mothers are able to still retain custody of their child if they give them up. In 1960s waiting periods are extended to three months, health and social aid offices open, and birth control is publicized by law. In 1978 a law allows citizens access to personal documents, which for those born under X brought them to protest for their origins. In the 1990s conversation of the mother's right to a privacy against the right of a child to know origins is discussed with the mother's right continuing to be upheld. In the 1990s there is also discussion of creating an organization to aid in information holding if a mother changes the decision to be anonymous which is created in the early 2000s. In 2002 a 'national council for access to personal origins' (CNAOP) is created to mediate between the anonymous mothers and children. The birth mother is asked to leave information about their identity behind in a sealed envelope that can be opened by the CNAOP if the child ever asks so that the birth mother can be contacted. However, the information will not be given to the child without consent.Lefaucheur, Nadine. \\"The French 'tradition' of Anonymous Birth: the Lines of Argument.\\" International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family. vol. 18, no. 3, Dec. 2004, pp. 319–342.

Sweden Early anonymous birth legislation can be found in Sweden where the Infanticide Act of 1778 granted mothers both the right and all means to give birth to their child anonymously. Children born were documented with an unknown mother and would become a foster child. The measure lasted through the 1800s as infant deaths decreased. During this time other factors that contributed to child death as premarital intercourse and unmarried childbearing was punishable by fines to prison time between 1734 and 1865. The system of anonymous birth lasted in Sweden until 1917 when the child right to know and be supported by mother was decided. After 1917 there were increased legislation on familial bonds and systems that still continue today. In 1998 Swedish legislation added a section of law to provide what is best for a child in custody. A social welfare committee investigates cases where children have been left anonymously to establish guardianship. Currently, there is no legislation allowing mothers to give birth anonymously. Austria From 1784 to 1910 at the General Hospital of Vienna mothers could give birth anonymously and leave their child with the hospital. The hospital was created by Emperor Joseph II and nearly 100 births a month were recorded in this practice. The children left had a high mortality rate, nearly all the children died in placement at a nursery or foster home, but this changed over time.Grylli, Chryssa et all\\"Anonymous Birth Law Saves Babies- Optimization, Sustainability and Public Awareness.\\" Archives of Women's Mental Health. 19.2 (2016): 291-297. Print. In 1974 Austria identified neonaticide as a major issue making it a specific crime. In 2002 Austria implicated the systems of anonymous birth and baby hatches legislation. From 2002 to 2004 Austria ran a campaign along with the preventive measures to lower neonaticide rates, but after 2004 neonaticide has been on the rise to rates comparable to pre-anonymous birth legislation in the late 1990s to early 2000s. Germany In late 1990s and early 2000s the proposal of legal legislation for the system of anonymous birth in Germany was brought. Groups outside of the German government attempted to push for the policy three times in the early 2000s they each failed.Willenbacher, Barbara. \\"Legal Transfer of French Traditions? German and Austrian Initiatives to Introduce Anonymous Birth.\\" International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family. 18.3 (2004): 343. Print. An anonymous birth policy was passed in 2013 in Germany. Legal situation In 2003 the European Court of Human Rights ruled in a case involving anonymous birth in Odièvre v. France.Odièvre v. France [GC], no. 42326/98, ECHR 2003-III, The applicant's mother had given birth anonymously; when the applicant later asked for more information, she was only given non- identifying information. The applicant appealed to the Court citing Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that it was a violation to the right to a family life. The Court noted that the case could not simply be viewed as a conflict between the rights of the birth mother and the child, because it also affected the rights of the adoptive parents and any family of the birth mother. The Court ruled that, given that the recently created National Council on Access to Information about Personal Origins presented an avenue to contact the birth mother in a controlled way, the state had attempted to strike a sufficient balance between the competing rights; the application was therefore denied.

It is approximately long and flows through Tunkhannock Township and Tunkhannock. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is not designated as an impaired waterbody. The surficial geology near it consists of alluvium, alluvial terrace, Wisconsinan Outwash, Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, fill, and a wetland. There are several road crossings and a railroad bridge crossing over Swale Brook. A number of industries also historically operated near the stream. The stream's watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and the stream itself has a high level of fish diversity. Course Swale Brook in Tunkhannock Swale Brook begins in Cruver Pond in Tunkhannock Township. It flows mostly south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before receiving an unnamed tributary from the right. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns east-southeast for more than a mile, entering Tunkhannock and receiving an unnamed tributary from the left. It then crosses Pennsylvania Route 29 and then turns south-southeast. A short distance further downstream, the stream crosses US Route 6 and reaches its confluence with Tunkhannock Creek. Swale Brook joins Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Swale Brook is not designated as an impaired waterbody. The Tunkhannock Area School District once applied for and/or received a permit to discharge stormwater into the stream during construction activities. Swale Brook was once described as a stream of \\"pure, cold water\\". Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Swale Brook is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. The stream has been described as \\"small enough to step across\\". The surficial geology in the vicinity of the lower and middle reaches of Swale Brook consists of alluvium, Wisconsinan Outwash, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and alluvial terrace. In the upper reaches, the surficial geology near the stream consists of a till known as Wisconsinan Till. Watershed The watershed of Swale Brook has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Tunkhannock. Its mouth is located at Tunkhannock. A pond known as Cruver Pond is located at the headwaters of Swale Brook. There are several road crossings along the stream's course. Additionally, the stream crosses a railroad bridge. History Swale Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1189122. The stream is also known as Quaker Swamp Brook. This variant name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland. By the middle of the 19th century, a tannery had been built on Swale Brook. By 1888, a mill had been constructed on the stream in Tunkhannock. It produced wooden butter pails and tubs, shingles, and cider. In 1902, wood from a covered bridge damaged by flooding was processed at the mill. A steam-powered electric plant operated in the vicinity of Swale Brook until 1903. Shortly before 1906, a canning factory on the stream closed; in that year the Pennsylvania Witch Hazel Company opened at the site. Swale Brook was impacted by flooding during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. It also experienced flooding in 2011. The Federal Emergency Management Agency once purchased some homes along the stream as part of a buyout program. Biology The drainage basin of Swale Brook is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. The stream has a very high level of fish diversity and has been described as \\"packed with fish diversity\\". At least ten fish species of fish have been observed in the stream, including eastern blacknose dace, common shiners, yellow bullheads, and the rare brook stickleback. The riparian buffer of Swale Brook is densely vegetated in some reaches.

In many countries, confidential births have been legalized for centuries in order to prevent formerly frequent killings of newborn children, particularly outside of marriage. The mother's right of informational self-determination suspends the child's right to know about their biological ancestry until she changes her mind or until the adult child requests disclosure at a later point. The alternative concept of an anonymous birth, where the mother does not disclose her identity to the authorities at all, or where her identity remains infinitely undisclosed, goes beyond this.  History  An early forerunner of confidential birth legislation can be found in Sweden, where the Infanticide Act of 1778 granted mothers both the right and means to give birth to a child anonymously. The act's 1856 amendment, however, restricted this legislation to confidential births, where the midwife was ordered to keep the mother's name in a sealed envelope. In France, confidential births were legalized in 1793, when Article 326 of the Code Civil introduced both the concepts of anonymous and confidential births. = Infanticide = Infanticide by definition is a person deliberately killing a child who had yet to reach the age of discretion, which varies by location, but is generally considered to be nine years old, though in the Catholic Church, this age is seven. If a mother kills her child and is married, then the case would not be tried as infanticide but as common law under murder. If the child was stillborn, the mother was to prove it by one witness and documentation by an official of the newborn's death. In western society Christianity, the reaction to infanticide is disgust, being considered against nature and reason, and a denial of life to the offspring. Infanticide can be seen as a coverup for sexual misconduct, or in more dramatic terms denial of social order. Infanticide was common in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries due to the difficulty of prosecution and the nature of the offense. In most places, a humanitarian view led to those prosecuting to consider that when newborns were killed by unmarried adolescents, that punishment should be less harsh. Infanticide decreased as resolutions came about which changed the perceptions of females to themselves and others. Some societies came to realize that oppressive behavior towards women often led to the death of their children. This encouraged society to reconsider the patterns and roles that they play. Legal situation in the United States = The Right to Privacy = This section gives historical background on privacy in the United States and how it came into play for the right of sealed birth records and confidential birth in the US. The growth of privacy in America was a slow development. In the Constitution of the United States and its Bill of Rights, the term \\"private\\" is used, such as private property, but the term \\"privacy\\" is not used, and the concept of a personal right to privacy was not emphasized except in the Fourth Amendment, which states \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\\", and in the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against self-incrimination. Other rights to privacy were implied through the language of the laws, but were not explicitly governmentally protected. It was not until the 1850s that a more broad concept of privacy began to be sought as a right, beginning with the invention of the telegraph, due to instances of illegal transcription of messages. Sealed records law was installed in 1917, allowing both parties to benefit from confidentiality, mainly the state and whoever else was involved. Birth certificates are sealed for those adopted, so that the adoptive parents feel autonomy from the biological parents and receive the privacy that birth parents have. The sealed records law allows anyone adopted to create their own fate without influence from biological parents and their origins. A greater expansion of governmentally-protected rights to privacy eventually came in the 1965 US Supreme Court case of Griswold v. Connecticut, in which it was argued that there should be a broader, stronger constitutional and legal basis for those seeking privacy in general. Griswold v. Connecticut began as the State of Connecticut v. Estelle T. Griswold and C. Lee Buxton, in which Connecticut sought to enforce its 1879 Comstock law against providing birth control or giving advice about it. Estelle Griswold was Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, who with Buxton, Medical Director for the League, operated a birth control clinic in New Haven. Griswold felt that medically prescribed methods of birth control should be offered and available to married women, for the health of mothers and their economic and emotional stability. Dr. Buxton testified that he advised married women regarding certain methods of birth control to preserve the lives and health of women with certain medical conditions. In Connecticut, devices such as condoms were widely available for preventing the transmission of venereal diseases, and the appellants argued that advice on the use of these devices for birth control for medical purposes should also be permitted. Connecticut argued that a physician must abide by the law's anti-contraception statute. Griswold and Buxton were found guilty under the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut because they assisted women for the purpose of preventing conception rather than for medical reasons. Griswold appealed her conviction to the US Supreme Court, on the grounds that her clients' right to privacy was being violated. The case was argued by the lawyer for Griswold and Buxton, Thomas Emerson. The Court voted seven to two in favor of the appellants, and in its decision, expanded privacy protections to peripheral activities as well, citing the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. = Reasons for Confidential Birth and Birth Records not being of Public Matter = Some women choose not to give their personal information when giving birth to a child as a matter of personal privacy. They feel that the information asked is too personal and is not useful for medical records. Questions asked include: What is the highest level of education reached by both parents? What is the standing employment for parents? How many times has the mother terminated pregnancies? Did the mother smoke during pregnancy, before, or after?\\"Mom Won't Fill Out Form; Kids Denied Birth Certificates.\\" Milwaukee Journal, 16 January 1995, pp. 1A', https://search.proquest.com/docview/333665338 How many cigarettes per day? What was the alcohol use per day before and during pregnancy? To be able to receive a birth certificate, the mother must fill out the questionnaire, and her answers are stored by the National Center for Health Statistics in a confidential data set, but the data is saved with the mother's name attached. It is often adolescents who decide to have confidential births and confidential adoptions. Some have unresolved issues with their family and in other aspects of their life, having not yet reached the age at which they can fully link their actions to possible consequences. Without the psychological maturity of adulthood, it can be difficult for an adolescent to take on the task of parenting an infant. Pregnant adolescents can have various difficult reactions, including denial and self-blame, or seeing the pregnancy as a way to solve depression or to affirm femininity. Relinquishing responsibility often leads to adoption, in hopes to give the child a better life and to allow one or both parents to retain their freedom. The mother is asked whether she wants to relinquish her parental rights, but also whether she wants to keep in contact with the child. Birth record statistics are affected by problems in acquiring records regarding children who are born out of wedlock, of unknown parentage, are legitimated, or are adopted. The American Association of Registration Executives and the Council on Vital Records and Statistics released a statement on the need for a nationwide policy on the confidential nature of birth records which will (1) assure the confidentiality of all birth records; (2) regulate the completeness and accuracy of all information given in birth reports, adoptions, and legitimations; (3) allow the individual to secure information regarding their birth or family relationships; (4) protect individuals (both the child and others) from the release of information that is undesired. This policy of secured birth records requires that the data be complete and accurate since individuals need certification of their birth for various official needs. Also, health and social agencies need this information for statistical and administrative purposes, while not allowing the information to be available to the general public. = Change from Traditional Confidential Adoption to Open Adoption = Confidential adoption: non- identifying information is made available, or those who keep the confidential records still exchange, through an agency, the biological parents' medical data to the adoptive parents. Open Adoption: identifying data is exchanged through contact between the adoptive parents and biological parents, and is encouraged. Contact continues throughout the life of the child via letters, gifts, photographs, etc., or even visits between both sets of parents and the child. Some families put limits on meetings between the biological parents and their child, while others maintain more open relationships.

History The Hôtel was designed as a hôtel particulier for the brothers, royal moneylenders François- Marie Gayot and Félix-Anne Gayot and built in 1754-55 featuring a courtyard, two ornate façades, a grand portal and a French garden. In 1770, it was sold by François-Marie Gayot to count palatine Christian IV of Zweibrücken ( = = ).

He promoted liberal and humanistic policies, and thought it important to have deep understanding of the local people and respect for their civilization. He saw the role of the administration as being the economic and human development of the people. During World War II (1939–45) he was Minister of Overseas France and the Colonies from April 1942 to March 1943. As a result of his participation in the Vichy government he was deprived of his rank and pension after the war. Life =Early years (1880–1930)= Joseph-Jules Brévié was born on 12 March 1880 in Bagnères-de-Luchon, Haute-Garonne. He graduated from the École coloniale (Colonial School) and was appointed a trainee administrator in 1902. He served in the Finance department of the government general at Dakar from January to April 1903. Brévié was involved in the occupation and organization of the colony of Upper Senegal and Niger. He served in Bamako, Niafunké and Bougouni in 1903–06, 1907–09 and 1910–12. In 1904 Brévié discovered a site near Tondidarou in what is now Mali that contained a remarkable group of phalliform stone monuments. Monolith found by Brévié in Mali, now in the Musée du quai Branly Brévié served in Guinea from 1913 to 1919. In November 1915 there was a revolt in the Black Volta bend against the French. Brévié arrived at the end of the month to review the situation. He was present at the battle of Yankasso on 23 December 1915 in which the French were checked. After a series of engagements, most of Burkina Faso was at peace by the end of July 1916. In 1915 Brévié was visiting the village of Massantola in the Beledougou region of Mali when he heard a woman singing a lamentation she had composed in the Bamana language about her son, who had been killed in a rebellion against the French. In 1918 Brévié published the original and a translation with notes and commentary in Dakar as A propos d'une chanson bambara (About a Bambara Song). He explained that the rebellion had been led by two local chiefs after the imposition of direct rule by the French, which had decreased their power. After their defeat, they had retreated to a fort. The French lost many men before forcing their way in. One chief had killed himself and his followers while the other had escaped in the hope of fighting again. Brévié explained that the local people saw the affairs as a tragedy while the French saw it as a victory. After World War I (1914–18) Brévié was in charge of the economy in Guinea. In 1920 he joined the Office of Political Affairs in Dakar. He served in Niger in 1920–23, 1925–27 and 1928–29. He was lieutenant governor of Niger from 1922 to 1929. He followed Maurice Delafosse in his hostility to Islam as a disruptive force and in support for traditional authority, a position he explained in his 1923 book L'Islamisme contre 'Naturisme'. =Governor of French West Africa (1930–36)= Brévié was governor-general of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale française, AOF) from 15 October 1930 to 27 September 1936. As governor of AOF, he promoted scientific and humanist administrative policies. He felt that a successful native policy required detailed understanding of the local people. He saw the value of indigenous religious practices when compared to the imported Islamic religion. He believed that French colonial policy should try to preserve the essentially collectivist character of African civilizations. As soon as he took office Brévié announced that the phase of exploration and conquest was ended, and a new phase was starting in which economic and human development would be the main concerns. He told the colonial governors, \\"it is not in offices and through intermediaries that we exercise our control over the indigenous milieu ... it is by making ourselves seen and heard, by tirelessly circulating ... always in movement ... constant, thoughtful and always attentive. ... It is not sufficient to be strong and just; we must also know how to bring, in our relations with natives, untiring kindness, concern at all times, and well-informed indulgence.\\" In 1935 Brévié sent a circular to the West African administrators asking them to collect oral material, verbal art, since that would help them better understand the people of the colonies. Brévié wrote, \\"colonization is becoming a question of method, of calculation, or predictions and, we should say, of science, It remains without a doubt and first of all a political and psychological art, but one that must be guided and clarified by exact scientific data.\\". Brévié wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research. He wrote that \\"colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. After much planning and preparation the Institut Français d'Afrique Noire (French Institute of Black Africa) was established in 1938 in Dakar. Brévié took office at the start of the Great Depression and a slump in the local economy. He partly blamed colonial capitalists for the problems and obtained large loans from the French government to support African producers. However, by 1932 the value of export crops was dropping despite increased yields, and Africans were starting to return to food crops. Brévié responded by measures such as reducing rail tariffs, subsidizing the movement of laborers in Senegal, creating foods banks and programs to increase agricultural productivity. An inquiry found that the results did not justify the costs. Brévié promoted public works, health and education in the belief that the colonial subjects must see \\"proof that the whole colonial enterprise works to make him happier.\\" He was concerned that the drop in living standards would cause the people to lose confidence in French rule and to be vulnerable to communist propaganda. The status of people of mixed blood was an issue. In 1934 Brévié wrote to the governor-general of French Indochina asking him for information on \\"what has been done in Indochina to assist and educate children of mixed blood ... any information you are willing to share will serve as an inspiration.\\" In 1935 Brévié issued a circular of the status of African Christians. He said that the moral development of the \\"natives\\" would benefit from conversion to Christianity, and they must be give freedom to convert. However, a minor could not be baptized without the consent of the head of the family. Christian Africans must not become marginalized. The legal status of the convert was awkward. They could not be judged under traditional local law, which they had rejected, nor under European law since they were not citizens. Brévié proposed a compromise law that would reconcile Catholic principles with local customs. =Governor of French Indochina (1936–39)= Brévié was appointed governor-general of French Indochina in 1936 by the Popular Front government led by Léon Blum. He replaced René Robin as governor general. While Brévié was being received in a ceremony at the landing stage in Saigon in January 1937 the colonial police were engaged nearby in a violent clash with several thousand communist workers from Saigon and the vicinity. When Brévié arrived in Hanoi there was a ban on processions and banners. Brévié was liberal-minded, and tried to defuse an extremely tense political situation by making concessions such as granting amnesties to political prisoners, giving greater freedom to the press and removing restrictions on nationalist political parties. Brévié, a socialist, made concessions to the trade unions in Saigon. In late August 1937 there were floods that ruined the rice harvest in Cochinchina and Cambodia. China contributed $50,000 Shanghai dollars for relief, which Brévié called \\"a gesture of great humanity.\\" Brévié's administration stepped up public works projects and took measures to provide rice for replanting and to build up seed stocks. The motive in part was to stave off anti-colonial discontent. In 1937 Brévié spoke at the inauguration of the Do Luong barrage in Nghệ An Province, which was also attended by the emperor Bảo Đại. He noted that the barrage enabled irrigation in a \\"particularly disadvantaged\\" area that had been the \\"theater of serious and prolonged troubles in 1930.\\" In 1938 Brévié announced plans to build the capacity to irrigate in the Red River Delta delta to boost rice production. The plan would use modern technology to create food security and would maintain political control. Missionaries found that Brévié treated them sympathetically. In 1938 Brévié called a meeting on the métis question attended by the head of the military, the heads of the departments of schools, law, health, welfare and economics, and the president of the Société d'assistance aux enfants franco-indochinois. The group decided to expand the framework that charities had established, to increase their budgets and provide administrative support. Efforts would be made to find children of mixed blood, who would be accommodated by the charities, or given to nuns to raise until they were 5 years old, particularly to the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres. The Jules Brévié Federation was founded in July 1939. The Federation distributed financing and directed efforts to handle issues concerning the métis. It coordinated charities, both secular and religious, that provided \\"education and placement of children of mixed Franco-Indochinese blood.\\" The hill station of Da Lat had boarding schools that served all of Vietnam. It had been seen as a possible center of government that would be hygienic and segregated between Europeans and Vietnamese. However, the proliferation of the Vietnamese elite in the town made it increasingly impracticable to practice segregation. When Brévié visited Da Lat he told a racially mixed set of students at the Lycée Yersin on 12 July 1938, Brévié came into conflict with Admiral Victor Petit, who commanded the navy in Indochina, over occupation of the Paracel Islands. The islands would provide protection to the peninsula, but the navy refused to occupy them. Brévié had to buy some old merchant vessels for the task. In 1939 Brévié's administration defined the \\"Brévié Line\\", which defined the border between the waters of Cambodia and Cochin China. This was the subject of post-colonial disputes between Vietnam and Cambodia. The reform program he instituted came to a halt when the Popular Front left office in France, followed by the start of World War II. Brévié was succeeded by Georges Catroux (1877–1969) in August 1939. Brévié wrote the prefaces to two charming books by Tran Van Tung, Sourvenirs d'un enfant de campagne (1939) and Rêves d'un campagnard annamite (1940). =Later career (1939–64)= Brévié was retired by decree on 13 March 1940. In 1941 he chaired the group of colonial professionals while serving as a member of the constitutional committee of the National Council. He was elected a member of the Academy of Colonial Sciences on 19 December 1941. The Vichy government appointed him Minister of Overseas France and the Colonies when Pierre Laval became prime minister in April 1942. He held office from 18 April 1942 to 26 March 1943, replacing Charles Platon. As minister he set up the Colonial Scientific Research Office to further develop his concept of scientific colonization. The former minister Henry Lémery proposed to Laval in August 1942 that the French West Indies should have a Conseil Local and that Guadeloupe and Martinique should be made standard departments of France. Laval and Brévié accepted the first proposal but rejected the second, creating an administrative anomaly. Brévié was stripped of his honorary rank of governor- general of colonies in January 1945. In March 1945 he was permanently deprived of his pension and of the right to wear any French or foreign decoration. Jules Brévié died at the age of 84 on 28 July 1964 in the village of Pierrefitte near Talizat, Cantal. As of 2012 a street in the administrative quarter of Niamey still bore his name.

Nayantara won Filmfare Award for Best Actress - Malayalam for her performance in the movie as Vasuki Iyer Louis . The film explores the drug fueled crimes and consumption of substances like marijuana and LSD by the youth. The film was dubbed into Tamil and Telugu as the title Vasuki. Plot Louis Pothen is a popular part-time television film critic, an artist, and a divorce lawyer who also participates in a live TV channel named \\"Kathrika\\". His wife Vasuki Iyer is a Kathakali artist, and they live together along with their school going daughter Chintha. They live away from their parents since their marriage was an inter-religious one. One day, Vasuki is raped by her two neighbours, Aryan and Sudeep, who are engineering students, and Pachai, a man who irons clothes at her building. Vasuki goes into shock after the rape. She does not confide in anyone and becomes withdrawn. Her demeanour changes as she becomes irritable and lax in her household work. She even contemplates suicide, but better sense prevails when she realises that it is her rapists who should die and not her. After a Kathakali performance, she is complemented by Jeena Bhai, the new police commissioner. Vasuki finds Jeena's phone number from Louis's mobile and calls her and narrates her ordeal. Jeena Bhai's telephonic assistance helps her kills her rapists one by one. After the deed is done, Jeena tells Vasuki that their brief friendship over the phone was over and Vasuki should never contact her again. It is later revealed that Louis was informed by Swami, a resident of a neighbouring apartment building, of his wife being raped. Swami had witnessed Vasuki being raped from his house but was old and too far away to help. He informs Louis about what he saw. Louis, through a mobile software (which can transform a male voice to a female voice), mimics Jeena and guides Vasuki to murder her rapists. He realizes that this was the only way that she would get absolution. Louis never reveals the truth to Vasuki and decides to keep it as a secret so that they could lead a happy married life.

It was also reported that Sajan initially wrote the script with Renji Panicker in mind for the lead role, with Muthumani as heroine. But after hearing the script, Renji noted that the script demands a \\"larger scale\\" production and suggested Mammootty for the lead role. As per Ranji's suggestion when Sajan approached Mammootty, the offer was immediately accepted by him. Regarding the characters, A. K. Sajan says, \\"Mammootty's character in the film, Louis Pothen, almost mirrors his real life personality. He's an easy-going lawyer, who is also a film critic and has a socialist leaning. However, Nayanthara's character Vasuki is diametrically opposite.\\" =Filming and post-production= Principal photography commenced on 21 August. The film was initially titled Solomonte Koodaram, but later changed to Puthiya Niyamam. The title was revealed through its first look poster on 27 October 2015. The filming was completed by October 2015 in Ernakulam and Thrissur. The costumes that Mammootty's character Louis Pothen has to don in film were purchased from Dubai by Mammootty himself. Roby Varghese Raj who was an assistant of cinematographers Rajeev Menon and Jomon T. John debuted as an independent cinematographer in the film.

The story focuses on young Everard, a young teenager who is groomed to be the Sire of Vaumartin, a fictional kingdom set in northwestern France.  Plot  Set in 1346, the Hundred Years' War is almost ready to erupt. Everard, a boy of fourteen, is the Sire of Vaumartin. However, he has none of the love for chivalry his two uncles have. As caretakers, they see it necessary to have see a knight out of the future heir, who is described as \\"a feeble enough creature, always dreaming like a girl, or bent over a book.\\" by the wife of one uncle. At the battle of Crecy, Everard gets lost and is presumed dead. Slowly he makes his way to Paris where he becomes a noted scholar. In the aftermath, Everard's uncle Yvain is given a funeral by his other uncle Josseran (all are brothers). Later, he finds out that Everard is still alive and sets out to find Everard so he can claim his rightful inheritance. It is revealed that he holds great contempt for the new King John (ascends in 1350). Josseran defects his loyalty first to the king of Navarre and ultimately the King of England. When Evarard arrives in Paris, he is left destitute but leads a semi rags-to-riches story. He slowly works while pegging himself as a student of the best scholar.

Hill House, also formerly known as the Grand Army Memorial Home, is a historic house at 159 Union Street in Bangor, Maine. Now housing the collections of the Bangor Historical Society and an American Civil War collection, the house was built in 1836 to a design by Richard Upjohn. The house has been home to two of Bangor's mayors, and became a museum in 1944. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Hill House is located just southwest of downtown Bangor, at the northwest corner of Union and High Streets. Standing across Union Street is the Isaac Farrar Mansion, like the Hill House a brick Greek Revival house designed by Richard Upjohn. The Hill House is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a side gable roof, four end chimneys, and a granite foundation. A single-story shed-roof porch extends across the two street-facing facades, supported by fluted Ionic columns on short granite bases. The second story is set in a monitor, with small square diamond-pane windows, and elaborate three-window dormers projecting from the roof below the monitor section. The interior's historic integrity has been partially compromised by the conversion of the property for use as a museum. The house was commissioned from Richard Upjohn by Thomas A. Hill, a prominent local businessman, and was completed in 1836. Hill suffered financial reverses in the Panic of 1837, and was compelled to sell the property to Samuel and Matilda Dale. Dale, also a prominent businessman, served several terms as mayor of Bangor, entertaining President Ulysses S. Grant here in 1871. Other prominent residents include Bangor's first mayor, Allan Gilman, and Dr. James F. Cox, who held his medical practice here. The house was acquired in 1944 by the local chapter of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, who established it as the Grand Army of the Republic Home. In 1952 the Sons allowed the Bangor Historical Society to store its collection on the second floor, resulting in alterations that included removal of a circular staircase and changes in the decor. The historical society took ownership of the property in 1974.

Its clearance and reconstruction was completed during the French Mandate. After the Lebanese Civil War, conservation efforts restored many of its surviving buildings within a pedestrian setting. Construction The Foch-Allenby district is the former harbor district of Beirut, accommodating port-related activities. Named Foch and Allenby in 1919, the two main north-south avenues were perceived as gateways to the city for visitors arriving by sea. Along with Weygand street, they formed the new business district of Beirut. The Foch-Allenby district was planned as the architectural showcase of the city. Influence of classical Haussmanian architecture was palpable on the majority of buildings in the district. Architectural expression had also moved towards a more regional identity which featured arched forms and eclectic regional detailing in the stonework. Post-war conservation efforts that began in 1994 restored many surviving buildings in the Foch-Allenby district within a pedestrian setting. Extended to the sea, Foch and Allenby Streets are the origin of the orthogonal grid of Beirut’s new waterfront district. History The Foch-Allenby district is the former harbor district of Beirut. Known as ‘the lower town,’ it accommodated port- related activities. During World War I, the Ottoman plan to link the city center to the waterfront required the demolition of this part of the city. The clearance and reconstruction of the harbor district was completed during the French Mandate. Named Foch and Allenby in 1919, the two main north-south avenues were perceived as gateways to the city for visitors arriving by sea. With Weygand Street, they defined the boundaries of the new business district. In the 1920s, the Foch-Allenby district was planned as the architectural showcase of the city. The majority of buildings show the influence of classical Haussmanian architecture, characterized by elaborate ornamentation borrowed from Greek, Renaissance and 18th century styles. Wrought iron and ceramic roof tiles were imported from France; mechanically sawn timber from Romania, cast iron balustrades came from Great Britain, and Italy provided marble balcony slabs. In the 1930s, the use of reinforced concrete, cast in moulds, allowed builders to emulate complex stonework detail. Architectural expression moved towards a more regional identity featuring arched forms and eclectic regional detailing in the stonework. Examples of this in the business district include the two Municipality offices and several buildings in Allenby, Moutrane, Abdul Malak and Saad Zaghloul streets. Post-war conservation efforts that began in 1994 restored many surviving buildings in the Foch-Allenby district within a pedestrian setting. Extended to the sea, Foch and Allenby Streets are the origin of the orthogonal grid of Beirut’s new waterfront district.

It has smooth bark, glossy green, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, white flowers and hemispherical to bell-shaped fruit. It is similar to E. johnstonii, E. vernicosa and E. urnigera. Description Eucalyptus subcrenulata is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes a tall, straight tree to , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, pale grey to brown or yellowish bark, often with horizontal black scars. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section, sometimes with a wing on each corner and sessile leaves, arranged in opposite pairs. These leaves are egg-shaped to round, glossy green, long and wide with small teeth on the edge. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide, tapering at the base to a petiole long. The edge of the leaves sometimes have small teeth, the veins are at an angle greater than 45° to midrib and the leaves have a strong spicy aroma when crushed. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to beaked operculum. Flowering occurs from November to May, peaking between January and March, and the flowers are white. The fruit is a sessile, woody, hemispherical to bell-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves at rim level or slightly above. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus subcrenulata was first formally described in 1929 by Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in Maiden's book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus, from specimens he collected near Mount Field East in 1906. The specific epithet (subcrenulata) is derived from the Latin sub- meaning \\"somewhat\\" or \\"not completely\\" and crenulatus meaning \\"having small, rounded teeth\\", referring to the leaf edges. This eucalypt is in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus, section Maidenaria, series Semiunicolores along with two other Tasmanian species, Tasmanian yellow gum (E. johnstonii), varnished gum (E. vernicosa) and two mainland species, Mt Imlay mallee (E. imlayensis) and Nunniong gum (E. elaeophloia. Eucalypts in section Maidenaria have cotyledons with two lobes, flower buds in leaf axils and with two opercula, stamens with versatile anthers and flattened seeds with a ventral hilum. The species in the series Semiunicoloreshave smooth bark, juvenile leaves mostly arranged in opposite pairs and with toothed margins, glossy green crown leaves, flower buds in threes and sessile fruit. Eucalyptus johnstonii tends to occur at lower altitudes than E. subcrenulata and E. vernicosa, usually a small-leaved shrub, at the highest. It is also similar to urn gum (E. urnigera) in series Orbiculares but that species is distinguished by its urn-shaped fruit. The mainland species have more greyish leaves. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus subcrenulata grows on exposed ridges, plateaus and slopes in subalpine woodland on the central and western highlands of Tasmania, including in the Mount Field National Park and Great Western Tiers. It also occurs with E. coccifera in the more exposed subalpine woodlands. Use in horticulture Tasmanian alpine yellow gum grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny location. It is frost resistant but must be kept watered. It is recognised as being very cold-tolerant in both New Zealand and Britain. Evans (1986) even identified E. subcrenulata as being a promising species for planting in milder areas of the United Kingdom.

Construction In 1993, 291 buildings were identified as buildings to be preserved and restored. Mainly concentrated in the Etoile and Foch-Allenby districts, Saifi Village and Wadi Abu Jamil, the retained buildings were to be restored following the Master Plan guidelines. The Master Plan was completed and approved in 1994 by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers. Retained buildings were divided into three categories: governmental and religious, buildings of heritage and architectural value (to be restored without external alteration) and ‘other category’ buildings (only limited alterations and additions were permitted). While buildings of heritage value had to be restored without external alteration, only limited alterations and additions were permitted for the ‘other category’ buildings. History In 1993, 291 buildings were identified as buildings to be preserved and restored out of nearly 900 buildings left standing after the war. Many of the surviving heritage buildings were in a hazardous and dilapidated state mainly due to small arms fire and subsequent deterioration. The main concentrations of retained buildings were in the Etoile and Foch-Allenby districts of Beirut’s historic core, Saifi Village and Wadi Abu Jamil. The Master Plan, completed and approved by a decree emanating from the Council of Ministers in March 1994, outlined the restoration of the retained buildings. Buildings identified for preservation were divided into three categories: governmental and religious, buildings of heritage and architectural value and ‘other category’ buildings. These were mainly modern structures in salvageable state. Buildings of heritage value had to be restored without external alteration, while limited alterations and additions were permitted for ‘other category’ buildings. Considerable local stonemasonry skills were required to complete the restoration of these buildings, especially with regard to the hand-carving of decorative features, copied from surviving fragments. An important aspect of restoration in the historic core was the parallel implementation of a pedestrian zone using basalt setts, salvaged from beneath existing streets, together with a unique vocabulary of street furniture. This included the re-creation of the original lighting poles and brackets designed for Beirut in the 1920s. This type of high quality restoration in a pedestrian setting makes Beirut’s Conservation Area a landmark historical district.

It starts at Clifton Suspension Bridge on the Avon Gorge in Bristol, and continues across the Chew Valley with its lakes, over the Mendip Hills to Cheddar Gorge and Cheddar, along the Somerset Levels to Glastonbury and Street and on through Bridgwater and Goathurst to the Quantock Hills with a scenic ridge walk passing through the villages Crowcombe and Stogumber and around the Brendon Hills. The route then crosses Exmoor through the villages of Monksilver, Luxborough, Winsford and Exford to the Doone Valley, Badgworthy Water and Malmsmead to Brendon following the East Lyn River and climbs Myrtleberry Cleaves to Lynton and Lynmouth.

Overview Beirut Port originated as a natural harbor, protected by the Ras Beirut promontory. The harbor developed in Ottoman times, and was enlarged during the French Mandate and Independence era. Construction Beirut Port originated as a natural harbor, protected by the Ras Beirut promontory. From about 2500 B.C., inhabitants of the Tell worked the bedrock to create the first harbor facilities, allowing small boats to be pulled ashore, while larger ships anchored in relative safety. Over the years, the harbor slowly developed until the 1830s, when Ibrahim Pasha initiated the first harbor project by creating an enclosed basin for lighters. Although the inauguration of Khan Antoun Bey in 1853 led to some modernization of Beirut Port, the rapid expansion of maritime trade following the construction of the Suez Canal (1859-1871) called for a more ambitious response. In 1887, after years of negotiations and with the backing of French investors, permission was granted for the enlargement and modernization of the harbor. In 1888, the ‘Compagnie impériale ottomane du Port, des Quais et des Entrepôts de Beyrouth’ was founded in Paris. The resulting Ottoman Wall was a significant engineering feat in its day. Under the French Mandate, a new jetty extended the Ottoman Wall another 800 meters into the sea, thus creating the largest harbor in the Eastern Mediterranean. Throughout the 20th century, Beirut kept its monopoly over maritime transit trade, while two more basins were added to the harbor complex. History Beirut Port originated as a natural harbor, protected by the Ras Beirut promontory. This setting provided sailing ships with easy access and shelter from southwesterly winds. From about 2500 B.C., inhabitants of the Tell worked the bedrock to create the first harbor facilities, allowing small boats to be pulled ashore, while larger ships anchored in relative safety. In the Canaanite and Phoenician periods, two harbors were formed from rocky inlets near the ancient Tell. A well-protected harbor to the northeast and a sheltered natural basin southwest of the castle's cliff offered safe anchorage in almost any wind conditions. Both still existed in Hellenistic times. Roman engineers enlarged the western basin with concrete seawalls, and the harbor extended halfway into the modern Foch-Allenby District. Later, in the 17th century, larger vessels were not able to enter the basin. They had to have their cargoes shipped ashore in lighters or small barges. In the 1830s, Ibrahim Pasha initiated the first harbor project by creating an enclosed basin for lighters, next to the harbor's southern quay. Although the inauguration of Khan Antoun Bey in 1853 led to some modernization of Beirut Port, the rapid expansion of maritime trade following the construction of the Suez Canal (1859-1871) called for a more ambitious response. In 1879, the Beirut Municipality sought a special decree from the Ottoman authorities in Istanbul to enlarge and modernize the harbor. In 1887, after years of negotiations and with the backing of French investors, permission was granted. In 1888, the ‘Compagnie impériale ottomane du Port, des Quais et des Entrepôts de Beyrouth’ was founded in Paris. The resulting Ottoman Wall that enclosed the First Basin and the previous harbors was a significant engineering feat in its day. Under the French Mandate, a new jetty extended the Ottoman Wall another 800 meters into the sea, thus creating the largest harbor in the Eastern Mediterranean. Throughout the 20th century, Beirut kept its monopoly over maritime transit trade, while two more basins were added to the harbor complex.

At that time there was a shelter for passengers and pilgrims for taking rest and refreshing while travelling long distance on foot. From there the pilgrims and other passers by were served with sambharam, a term for spiced butter milk in Malayalam language. The sambharam was given as dharmam, free of cost. So the shelter (shala in Malayalam language) from where this was given was called as Dharma Shala, then Dharmashala. This facility to passers-by was arranged by the Parassinikadavu Sree Muthappan temple authorities and can still be seen as a small building about 100 m south of the present Dharmashala junction near the national highway.

Phoenician towns were experiencing a renaissance in those times, since Persian kings relied on Phoenician ships to establish commercial links with the Eastern Mediterranean cities and beyond.

Life Thoden van Velzen was born on 5 April 1933 in Vlissingen. His father was a coxswain in the merchant navy and teacher at the Rijksnormaalschool in the city of Deventer. His ancestors are Protestant pastors from the neighbourhood of Emden in East- Frisia, which is now part of the German federal state of Low Saxony. In the Second World War he moved together with his parents and siblings to Utrecht because of the German Heer declaring the city of Vlissingen and its surrounds as Sperrgebiet. He finished his secondary school in the Indonesian city of Batavia (now: Jakarta) and later in Vlissingen. After three years of military service, he began his study of sociology at the University of Amsterdam in 1955. During his study he met his life partner Ineke van Wetering, with whom he set off to Suriname for graduate studies at the Maroon society after his first graduation. He has been in field for the first time from May 1961 to November 1962, studying the Ndyuka, the biggest group of the Maroons. In 1966, he obtained his doctorate under professor A.J.F. Köbben with a thesis titled: \\"Politieke beheersing in de Djuka maatschappij. Een studie van een onvolledig machtsoverwicht\\". The same year he became employee of the Afrika-Studiecentrum Leiden, and he spent three years in Tanzania. In 1971, he became professor of cultural anthropology at Utrecht University, and succeeded the seventy-year- old professor Fischer. He wrote his last article about Tanzania in 1977, whereupon he dedicated his work to the Ndyuka society of Suriname. Thoden van Velzen left Utrecht University in 1991, when his position was lost in a reorganization. From 1991 until his retirement in 1999, Thoden van Velzen was professor at the Amsterdam School for Social Science Research. He was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990. Thoden van Velzen wrote his last article in cooperation with his wife Wilhelmina van Wetering. The book, called Een Zwarte Vrijstaat in Suriname was published in 2013. Near the end of his life, he was working on Prophets of Doom: A History of the Aukan Maroons which will be published by Brill Publishers. He died on 26 May 2020.

Overview A commercial street with numbered shops, dating to the Byzantine period, was unearthed during the mid-1990s excavations. In 1996 was made the discovery of 700 sqm of Byzantine mosaics in the Souks area of Beirut, most dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries AD. They were recovered from five large villas and a colonnaded street with its shops. The colonnades had mosaic pavements with Greek letters marking the address of each shop.

His vehicle was featured on the cover of the magazine National Dragster. In October 2015, Brandon Beach was announced to be participating in the National Hot Rod Association's Toyota Nationals in Las Vegas, Nevada, for which Beal has constructed a car for him to compete. He spent about 15 years as a crew member for Chuck Beal Racing before he was entered into a competition. Chuck Beal and his Funny Car have received positive reception from editors in drag racing magazines. His vehicle was called \\"one of the most recognizable of the time\\" for Funny Car racing by National Dragster magazine in 1984, and an editor for the National Hot Rod Association's website recounted meeting Beal and remembering it fondly decades afterward. At the 2015 NHRA Toyota Nationals at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Brandon Welch made a full pass of 4.30 seconds in the 3rd qualifying session.  History  Chuck Beal received a license to drag race in 1966. He started out racing in front- and rear-engine vehicles, and then switched to the alcohol funny car class. He would later move onto nitro-class cars after he rolled over in his alcohol car. He attempted to make his racing into a business throughout his career. The Chuck Beal Racing company is located in San Diego, California. In 2006, it was announced that Chuck Beal's grandson Brandon Welch would be driving the Beal Racing Nitro Funny Car in the 2007 NHRA competition. Beal and his company hosted an event called \\"Salute to Our Armed Forces\\", an open house dedicated to former and present members of the United States Navy and Marine Corps and the \\"Wounded Warriors Thursday\\". At the event, the members of the military and their families were able to see one of Beal's drag race cars and meet the staff. Several drag racers have driven funny cars for Chuck Beal, including Jeff Arend (who now drag races for Jim Dunn Racing). One of Chuck Beal's racers, Jeff Diehl, was in an explosion while driving in Beal's nitro Funny Car during the Firebird Raceway NHRA National Time Trials event. Beal was quoted as saying \\" \\"It's a big, big dent in my pocketbook ... It was pretty devastating. It took out a brand-new TFX block. It may be salvageable, but it took out the crank and one head. The blower, obviously, is junk, but all of the safety equipment -- the blower and valve-cover restraints--did their job, so my hat is off to Deist. The body is cracked and will need to be repaired, but I've got a spare.\\" In 2009, Beal and his crew finished work on a new car that was intended to help get Welch his competitive license.

Founded in February 1948, by Jose Salvania, Parish Priest of St. Peter the Apostle Parish, it is one of the town's oldest schools. History In 1948, Jose Salvania established the Holy Child Jesus Institute of Gumaca, Quezon. Its main aim was to give hope to young boys and girls as they started their formal education. During that time, no local schools offered a secondary education. This encouraged Father Salvania to open an extension of the Holy Child Jesus Institute in Unisan, Quezon, with the aim to help them prepare for their destiny, which he believed was a union with God. Mayor Arturo Constantino’s residence in the town served as grounds for the school. Armando Altea became the Administrator, and Poiquinta Vargas worked as Registrar and Treasurer. Salvania purchased a lot at Brgy, Rajah Soliman, in 1952, and built a two-story building. Cecilio Putong, then Secretary of the Department of Education, signed an award, Government Recognition #189, for the Holy Child Jesus Institute on March 19, 1953. In 1957, Fr. Jose Salvania turned over the administration of the institution to the Religious Missionaries of St. Dominic. Sr. Ma. Lourdes Moraleda, O.P., stood as the school's first Dominican Director. In 1968 the Holy Child Jesus Institute was renamed the Dominican Academy in honor of its founder, St. Dominic de Guzman. Sr. Immaculada Resultan, O.P., served as the Director.

Lyman Saÿen (sometimes also spelled Sayen) was an American pioneer in the design of x-ray tubes who also distinguished himself as an abstract artist. Biography =Early years= Primitive Agriculture by Henry Lyman Saÿen located in Room H-143 of the US Capitol. Photo courtesy of the Architect of the Capitol. Saÿen was born in Philadelphia on 25 April 1875 to Edward M. Saÿen and Annie T. Saÿen (née Thomas). Soon after graduating from Central Manual Training School in 1891, he went to work for James W. Queen & Company, a large manufacturer of scientific equipment. He distinguished himself at the age of 18 by designing a large induction coil that was cited at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. In 1897 he received a patent for a self- regulating x-ray tube. This tube was the first of its kind to solve the problem of an unstable output caused by a drop in tube gas pressure. At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, he volunteered for military service and was assigned to Fort McPherson, Georgia where he was put in charge of the medical x-ray laboratory. After contracting typhoid fever he was discharged from the army in 1898 and returned to Philadelphia where he resumed his work with James W. Queen & Company. The following year he enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Thomas Anshutz. In 1903 he married Jeannette Hope, also a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In 1903 he was awarded a commission for the design of four lunettes to be hung in the United States Capitol. These lunettes, titled Rule of Tyranny, Rule of Justice, Primitive Agriculture, and Good Government were installed in Room H-143 between 1904 and 1905 =Paris= In 1906, Saÿen and his wife moved to Paris. She had been hired to report on French fashions for The North American, a newspaper owned by Thomas Wanamaker; Saÿen was to contribute art for the printing of catalogs and posters for the Wanamakers department stores owned by Rodman Wanamaker. Soon after arriving in Paris, the couple met Leo Stein at Le Dôme Café, a restaurant known at the time as a gathering place for Anglo-American intellectuals. They lived on the Boulevard Raspail, across from the photo studio of Edward Steichen. They soon developed friendships with many important figures in the art world including Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. The couple also became frequent members of Gertrude Stein's Saturday night salon. In fact, Saÿen is mentioned by name three times in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. One example that acknowledges his technical skill: > ... gas had just been put in and an ingenious American painter named Sayen, > to divert his mind from the birth of his first child, was arranging some > mechanical contrivance that would light the high fixtures by themselves. Their only child, Ann, was born in 1912. With the beginning of the World War I, the young family was forced to return to Philadelphia in August 1914. =Philadelphia= After returning to the United States, Saÿen terminated his part of the contract with Wannamakers to focus on his art while his wife, Jeannette, was welcomed back to The North American as a fashion journalist. Saÿen became heavily involved with the emerging American modern art movement while staying engaged with technical issues. He held one-man exhibitions at the Philadelphia Sketch Club in 1914 and again in 1916. He died in his home in 1918 at the very early age of 43. Self-regulating x-ray tube An example of the X-ray tube designed and patented by Saÿen while he was working for the James W. Queen & Company. Photo courtesy of the National Museum of American History.Artwork appearing in several James W. Queen & Co. catalogs in the early 1900s. The drawing is probably by Saÿen. Photo courtesy of the National Museum of American History. X-rays are generated when high energy electrons are stopped by a hard target. In the earliest tubes, the electrons were generated by the collision of positive ions with the cathode. To produce the ions, a low pressure gas had to be maintained inside the tube. Unfortunately, as this type of tube is used, the low pressure gas is gradually depleted causing the tube current and therefore the x-ray output to fall. The operator could compensate for this by increasing the voltage on the tube, but this would produce \\"harder\\" or more penetrating x-rays. In many cases this degraded the image quality. One early solution was to introduce a small amount of gas back into the tube. Unfortunately this procedure was difficult to control and it only provided a temporary solution. Saÿen's design solved this problem by a clever strategy that ensured a constant gas pressure in the tube. As the gas in the main part of the Saÿen tube (see photo) is depleted, the electrical resistance in the tube would increase causing the current to take a lower resistance path: a spark through the air gap to the wire leading to the smaller bulb. That current would heat the material in the small bulb and cause it to release gas back into the main tube. Once the gas pressure rose in the main tube, its electrical resistance would drop back into normal operating range. The gas pressure in the tube could be adjusted by controlling the size of the air gap: a larger gap meant that the tube would operate at a higher voltage with harder (higher energy, more penetrating) x-rays. Saÿen used potash (potassium hydroxide, KOH) in the side bulb but other chemicals that would outgas when heated were also used. James W. Queen & Company manufactured and sold the \\"Queen Self Regulating X-Ray Tube\\" for several years. Mobile x-ray ambulance Henry Lyman Saÿen's drawing of his proposed X-ray ambulance. The ambulance was to be used by American volunteers in France. Photo courtesy of the National Museum of American History. During the Spanish–American War, Saÿen was assigned to the army hospital at Ft McPherson, Georgia. In a brief article published at the end of that war, Saÿen described his military service, the status of medical x-rays in the Army at that time, and also proposed the construction of a mule-driven x-ray laboratory for field use. This proposal was never implemented. In 1917, as the United States drifted towards war once again, Saÿen updated his 1898 concept to an \\"Automobile X-Ray Unit\\". He wrote a detailed proposal for five fully outfitted x-ray ambulances at an estimated cost of $2,000 apiece. They were to be sent to France in support of the volunteer force that was being organized under former president Theodore Roosevelt. The vehicles were to be privately financed and Saÿen had recruited artists from the Philadelphia Sketch Club to staff the ambulance teams. A drawing of the vehicle by Saÿen is attached (NMAH Accession file 267872). It is clear from his proposal that Saÿen had stayed up-to-date with x-ray technology because he recommended the use of the new Coolidge x-ray tube which had made the early tubes, including his own design, obsolete. Preferring to field an expeditionary force of regular army units, President Wilson declined to deploy Roosevelt's army and it was subsequently disbanded. Although Saÿen's plan for mobile military x-ray units was never realized, mobile x-ray units were designed and deployed by England, France and the United States. See also The National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution holds four examples of the Queen Self-Regulating tube. The Oak Ridge Associated University website has an excellent description of the tube and also excellent photos. There is also a brief blog posting about Sayen and his x-ray ambulance on the National Museum of American History website.

A vaulted entrance led to the shrine by way of a tiny intervening room. Sayyidat al-Nouriyyeh (Our Lady of Light) was believed to be a light that guided sailors and fishermen to safety. The shrine was adorned with three icons: one of Christ, one of all the saints, and one of the Virgin Mary, reputed to be miraculous.

Marked out by bronze medallions grouted into the sidewalk, the trail will link archeological sites, historic public spaces and heritage buildings over a 2.5 km walking circuit in the historic core of Beirut. History The Beirut Heritage Trail is a project undertaken by Solidere and will be launched in the Spring of 2016. Marked out by bronze medallions grouted into the sidewalk, the trail will link archeological sites, historic public spaces and heritage buildings over a 2.5 km walking circuit in the historic core, revealing many layers of Beirut's history and development. Large district panels and smaller monument panels are made from glazed lava-stone tiles mounted on stainless steel stands. With texts prepared in three languages (Arabic, French and English) these panels are illustrated with historic maps, photographs and drawings. The circuit will start at the Beirut Souks, which retain the 2,500-year-old ancient street grid and Ottoman access gates, and incorporate several archeological remains including the Phoenico-Persian Quarter, the City Wall and Moat, the restored Mamluk Zawiyat Ibn Arraq and Al-Majidiyyeh Mosque. Many Byzantine mosaics were salvaged during archeological excavations there. One has been reconstructed and laid in the modern souks close to its original alignment within the colonnade of the Roman street that once led through Bab Idriss Square, gateway to the Hippodrome in Wadi Abou Jamil. Leaving Beirut Souks, the trail leads south past Emir Munzer Mosque and onto the Roman Baths Garden and public space, through Riad Al Solh Square to the Grand Theatre, Lebanon and the southern end of the colonnaded Maarad Street (Rue Maarad). Between this street and Saint George Maronite Cathedral, there is an overlook to the Roman Cardo Maximus. The trail then leads to Nejmeh Square, the French Mandate Etoile, Parliament building as well as the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and St Elie Greek Catholic Cathedral. Behind these lies the Nouriya chapel (Sayyidat al-Nouriyyeh) at a focal overlook to the planned Hadiqat As- Samah (Garden of Forgiveness). The trail continues to the restored Al-Omari Grand Mosque. It passes by the Municipality of Beirut building of 1925 and the 16th century Emir Assaf Mosque to Martyrs’ Square, the Canaanite Tell and site of the Beirut City History Museum. By way of Castle Square, historic Foch Street and Harbor Square, site of Beirut's ancient port, the trail traverses the Foch-Allenby District to regain Beirut Souks on Trablos Street, at the site museum of the Phoenico-Persian Quarter.

History  The Hirosaki Tōshō-gū was founded by the 2nd daimyō of Hirosaki Domain, Tsugaru Nobumasa, to worship the deified Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1617. It was the first Tōshō-gū to be established by a daimyō not of the Tokugawa clan. Permission to build the shrine was granted as Tsugaru Nobumasa's official wife, Manten-hime, was an adopted daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1624, the shrine was relocated to its present site, and in 1628, the present Honden was constructed. During the Edo period, due to the Shinbutsu-shūgō system, it was regarded as a Tendai sect Buddhist temple and had several subsidiary chapels and estates for its upkeep. However, with the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and the separation of Buddhism from Shinto it was almost destroyed. It was revived in 1872 by efforts of local inhabitants, and in 1881 was classed as a Prefectural Shrine under the Modern system of ranked Shinto shrines. In 1953, the Irimoya-style Honden was protected by the government as an Important Cultural Property. In the early 2000s, the shrine faced severe economic difficulties due to the expansion of a wedding chapel and by 2007 was forced to cease operations and declare bankruptcy. In 2012, the Aomori District Court ordered that all of the properties of the shrine be auctioned off. In 2015, the kami of the shrine was transferred to the Kuroishi Jinja in neighboring Kuroishi, Aomori.

Alan C Gow was a voyage broker, James McGregor organised the freight to fill the ships and by 1860 they were in partnership. In 1867 Alan Gow had the sailing ship Estrella de Chile built to ply the route between Glasgow, Liverpool, and Chile via Cape Horn. She was wrecked in 1888. In 1868 the partners bought the barque Glenavon. She was the first of their ships to have the Glen- prefix in her name. In 1881 the firm had the iron-hulled steamship Glenavon built. She was wrecked off the coast of China in 1898, killing 53 people. In 1911, Elder Dempster and Co acquired The Glen Line.

The property has an agricultural history dating to the early 19th century, although most of its buildings are now of mid-20th century origin. The property is now owned by the Brunswick-Topsham Land Trust, and is operated as a community farm. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history Crystal Spring Farm is located in a rural area of southwestern Brunswick, its building complex set southeast of the junction of Pleasant Hill and Woodside Roads. The associated farmland consists of two large parcels south of Pleasant Hill Road and on either side of Woodside. The land is predominantly open fields, with some woodlots. The farm complex includes ten buildings, organized roughly in a U shape, with the main house at the eastern end. The house is a 19th-century agglomeration of several residential structures that have been stitched together. To its northwest stands an early 20th-century slaughterhouse. The remaining buildings all date to a building program prompted by a fire in 1946 that destroyed the rest of the original complex. These buildings include concrete barns for housing dairy cattle and processing their milk, a Quonset hut for the storage of hay, equipment sheds and workshops, and a silo. The area is first documented to have been farmed by the Woodside family, which worked land that included this farm's property for about 120 years beginning in 1783. New owners converted it to principally dairy farming in the early 20th century, and in 1941 it was purchased by Maurice Dionne, whose brother Bert, a veterinarian, took over its operation. He greatly expanded its capacity and production, set back by the 1946 fire. It is possible that the Quonset structures now in use were surplus military materials from the nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station. Its business in decline, the Dionnes sold to the Oakhurst Dairy, a major regional dairy processor. In 1970 the farm's activity was shifted to beef production. In 1997 the Brunswick-Topsham Land Trust purchased 160 acres (since expanded to more than 300), with the aim of preserving the farm as open space and a working agricultural area. It is now used for community-supported agriculture, and the property has walking trails open to the public.

Early life Verney was the son of Sir Harry Verney, 4th Baronet and Lady Rachel Catherine Bruce, the daughter of Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin. He was educated at Canford School and Balliol College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1937. He then began his training as an accountant. Military career Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in 1940 he was commissioned into the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry. He served as an instructor at Catterick Garrison and was later deployed to India with the Berkshire Yeomanry. He saw active service in the liberation of British Malaya in 1945. He ended the war with the rank of Major. Conservation and public work After returning from the Far East, Verney began a major restoration project on his family seat, Claydon House, which had been occupied by schools during the war. In 1957 he gifted the house and 7,000-acre estate to the National Trust, on the understanding that he and his family would always be able to live at the property. Between 1960 and 1996 Verney was Chairman of the Radcliffe Trust. In 1980 he became Chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council, and used the NCC to promote the designation of some 4,000 locations as \\"sites of special scientific interest\\" under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, often against opposition from farmers and other interested parties. Verney's unpopularity among some in the landed element of the Conservative Party led to him not being reappointed by the government when his term expired in 1983. For 30 years Verney was a trustee of the Ernest Cook Trust. He was a member of Buckinghamshire County Council and was closely involved both in the planning of the new town of Milton Keynes and the creation of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the Chilterns. He served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1957, was a Deputy Lieutenant for the county from 1960 to 1965, and held the office of Vice-Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire between 1965 and 1984. He was High Steward of Buckingham in 1966, and was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1974. That same year he succeeded to his father's baronetcy. Personal life He married Mary Vestey, daughter of Percy Charles Vestey and Dorothy Emmeline Johnston, on 7 July 1948. Together they had four children.

It was first published in the American magazine Astounding Science Fiction in September 1948. It is an early example of what later came to be called a \\"virtual reality\\" story, in which one person enters a dream or hallucination that is being experienced by another. Plot Pete Parnell is a cynical sports reporter. Early in his childhood, he was cured of frequent nightmares by being taught how to shoot a Colt 45 revolver on the farm where he lived. He was then able to imagine the gun in his dreams and use it to \\"kill\\" the monsters. He went on to serve in the army before becoming a reporter. Parnell is called by a friend, Steve Blakiston, who is a psychiatrist using experimental equipment. A patient called Marsham Craswell, a famous writer of \\"sword and sorcery\\" fantasy novels, has retreated into a state where he is living a dream in the fantasy world he created. Pete is asked to enter that dream using the new device and bring Craswell back to reality. Doing this requires somebody who is totally immune, and indeed hostile, to the fantasy. Blakiston confesses that he is a fan of Craswell's work and would almost certainly suffer the same fate as the author. Entering the dream, Parnell finds himself dressed in ordinary clothes, standing in a hot desert under two suns, facing Craswell who has imagined himself into the hero role, calling himself \\"Multan\\". He quickly starts altering the dream, eliminating one of the suns to cool off. Craswell accuses him of being \\"Garor\\", apparently the evil antagonist of the story, and attacks him with a sword. Fortunately Parnell imagines his army helmet on his head and deflects the blow. Craswell adapts to make him an ally in his quest, calling him \\"Nelpar Retrep of the Seven Moons\\". They are attacked by an army of Garor's warriors, but Parnell conjures up one of his friends, an Irish cop, who brings in car loads of tough police officers that rout the army. Craswell announces that they must make a long journey to the fortress of Garor, so Parnell conjures up a New York taxicab, along with the same driver who took him to Blakiston's lab. After a short trip the driver tries to overcharge them, so Parnell tells him to \\"Go to Hell\\" and has the desert sand swallow up the taxi. They gain entry to the fortress when Parnell conjures up a doorbell. Attacked by a living gas, they escape when Parnell remembers his Army gas mask and turns a flamethrower on the cloud. He counters \\"music that drives men mad\\" with his own performance of \\"Tiger Rag\\" on the harmonica, with amplification. Finally they encounter the evil sorceress Garor, who is a beauty imagined in such detail that Parnell concludes she must be based on somebody real. She is dressed in classic fantasy style, in a skimpy breastplate and short filmy skirt. To irritate Craswell, Parnell lengthens the skirt, only to have Craswell revert it. They do this repeatedly until Craswell abruptly switches them into an arena where Parnell is left to face a fearsome beast. At this point Parnell begins to feel genuine fear, but he quickly remembers his childhood and produces the gun, with which he kills the beast. Craswell, unable to maintain the fantasy, collapses the dream. Parnell awakes and is quickly removed from the equipment, as patients are likely to be angry when woken from the treatment. Later Parnell meets his friend, the Irish cop, who remembers dreaming about him. He also sees the taxi driver again, and gets the same reaction. Calling Blakiston, he is told that perhaps the apparatus turned into a transmitter while he was in the dream with Craswell. Blakiston invites him to try it again, but Parnell declines. At a bar he sees a singer who is obviously the woman on whom Craswell based the Garor character. She seems to recognize him and admits to knowing Craswell, but says she was not asleep when he was at the lab. Still, she takes a dislike to him, as if she experienced the business with Garor's costume. Parnell decides to go back to the lab to see if he can work on improving their relationship. In other media The story was adapted as \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" (1969) an episode of Out of the Unknown, a BBC television series featuring stories taken, initially, from science fiction magazines. Out of the Unknown featured similar techniques, settings and costumes to other BBC sci-fi productions of the time. In particular, in \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" three Daleks and their operators from Doctor Who were used to represent the monsters in young Pete's nightmares, with their voices provided by Dalek voice actor Peter Hawkins. The production cast actors well-known to BBC viewers, including Peter Barkworth as Stephen, the psychiatrist, and Peter Jeffrey as Craswell.

Its architecture allows users to query a variety of data sources such as Hadoop, AWS S3, Alluxio, MySQL, Cassandra, Kafka, and MongoDB. One can even query data from multiple data sources within a single query. Presto is community driven open-source software released under the Apache License.  History  Presto was originally designed and developed at Facebook for their data analysts to run interactive queries on its large data warehouse in Apache Hadoop. Before Presto, the data analysts at Facebook relied on Apache Hive for running SQL analytics on their multi petabyte data warehouse. Hive was deemed too slow for Facebook's scale and Presto was invented to fill the gap to run fast queries. Original development started in 2012 and deployed at Facebook later that year. In November 2013, Facebook announced its release as open source 2013. In 2014, Netflix disclosed they used Presto on 10 petabytes of data stored in the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). In January 2019, the Presto Software Foundation was announced. The foundation is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of the Presto open source distributed SQL query engine. Development of Presto continues independently with PrestoDB maintained by Facebook and PrestoSQL maintained by the Presto Software Foundation with some cross pollination of code. In September 2019, Facebook donated PrestoDB to the Linux Foundation establishing the Presto Foundation. Neither the creators of Presto, nor the top contributors and committers, were invited to join this foundation. The foundation has an open and neutral governance model to enable Presto to scale and diversify its community.  Architecture  Presto’s architecture is very similar to a classic database management system using cluster computing (MPP). It can be visualized as one coordinator node working in sync with multiple worker nodes. Clients submit SQL statements that get parsed and planned following which parallel tasks are scheduled to workers. Workers jointly process rows from the data sources and produce results that are returned to the client. Compared to the original Apache Hive execution model which used the Hadoop MapReduce mechanism on each query, Presto does not write intermediate results to disk resulting in a significant speed improvement. Presto is written in the Java programming language. A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources. Presto offers connectors to data sources including files in Alluxio, Hadoop Distributed File System, Amazon S3, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, Apache Kudu, Apache Phoenix, Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, Apache Accumulo, MongoDB and Redis. Unlike other Hadoop distribution-specific tools, such as Apache Impala, Presto can work with any flavor of Hadoop or without it. Presto supports separation of compute and storage and may be deployed both on premises and in the cloud.

The vessel was struck by a breaking wave over the reefs and its sinking resulted in the deaths of 6 of its 27 passengers The dead were identified as five men and one woman ranging in age between 18 and 76. Five were British citizens, though two were also Canadian residents, and the sixth was an Australian citizen. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) said a wave flipped the ship when most of the passengers and crew were on the top deck, raising the center of gravity and making it easier to capsize. The TSB released its final report in June 2017 recommending changes to emergency safety practices. The TSB's recommendations included 1) better precautions from tour boat operators to identify and avoid hazardous waves, 2) that Transport Canada implement and oversee risk management guidelines, and 3) mandatory emergency beacons on seafaring vessels.

Early life and education Katherine Cutler was born March 3, 1911, to Howard Wright Cutler and Marie Katherine (Zahn) Cutler in Rochester, New York. Her father was an architect who designed military hospitals during World War I and later specialized in schools and government buildings. After the war, when Katherine was eight, her family moved to Washington, D.C. and then to Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1934, Ficken graduated with a B.A. in architecture from George Washington University. During her college summers, she worked part-time as a draftsperson for her father's practice and also for the federal government. Career Ficken established her own practice in 1934, but continued to work as an associate in her father's firm for several years. Projects on which she assisted her father included about a dozen high schools and elementary schools in Montgomery County and elsewhere, and several University of Maryland (UMD) buildings. One of their joint projects, the Rock Creek Field House (a wood and stone rest station in Rock Creek Stream Valley Park), was nominated in 2013 for inclusion in Montgomery County's Master Plan for Historic Preservation. She obtained her architect's license in Maryland in 1936, and two years later was still the only woman licensed in the state. One of Ficken's first major projects was a farming estate for a wealthy Maryland woman, Clara Hyatt, that she began work on in 1940. For Hyatt she designed not only a brick main house (now known as \\"Redwall\\") and farm outbuildings but also a watering system for the fields. The overall design program was predicated on the idea that the farm could be run by one woman alone during the war, when the draft drew away many male farmhands. A slightly later project was an award-winning restaurant reconstruction whose success helped her to secure a large postwar commission from UMD. In 1947, she married Rudolph William Ficken, thereafter using Katherine Cutler Ficken as her professional name. In 1956, they adopted a son, Rudolph Ficken, Jr. Ficken became a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1950. She died of cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, on October 14, 1968. Legacy Ficken was one of 12 architects featured in \\"Early Women of Architecture in Maryland,\\" a traveling exhibition organized by the AIA that opened in June 2015.

He served as the second Chief Scientist of the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1952. Early life David Griggs was born in Columbus, Ohio. His father was Robert Fiske Griggs, who discovered the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes near Mount Katmai in Alaska. The highest area in this area was officially named Mount Griggs in his honor. David accompanied his father on an expedition to that area in 1930. At age 24, Griggs had an accident while mountain climbing in the Caucasus Mountains, located between the Caspian and Black Seas. He suffered compound fractures in both legs and a dislocated knee; this rendered him physically ineligible for military service during World War II. Public service David Griggs helped form the RAND corporation in 1947. As the Air Force chief scientist from 1951 to 1952, he supported development of the thermonuclear (or fusion) bomb, with other scientists such as Edward Teller and Luis Walter Alvarez. During that time, the chairman of the General Advisory Committee, J. Robert Oppenheimer, opposed it, hoping to restrain a predicted worldwide nuclear proliferation. Griggs was one of those whose testimony caused the Personnel Security Board's vote to suspend Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954, which caused several physicists to consider Griggs as the \\"Judas who had betrayed their god.\\" Griggs accompanied US Army General William Westmoreland through three extended trips to Vietnam in the mid 1960s. Awards Griggs was a civilian non-combatant in a tactical mission over northern Italy during World War II. He was hit by a 20-mm shell from an enemy plane. After recovering from the wound, he received a Purple Heart . For his contributions during the war, President Harry S. Truman presented him a Medal for Merit, the citation reading: > DR. DAVID GRIGGS, For exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance > of outstanding services as H2X Project Officer in the Eighth Air Force > during the period 1 May 1943 to 1 April 1944. Dr. Griggs rendered invaluable > service in connection with H2X equipment and instructing personnel to > operate this equipment. Through his tireless efforts and outstanding > leadership he made a substantial contribution to the heavy bombardment > operations performed by the Eighth Air Force. The professional skill and the > devotion to duty displayed by Dr. Griggs reflect the highest credit upon > himself and the Armed Forces of the United States. Griggs received the Walter H. Bucher Medal of the American Geophysical Union in 1970. He received the Arthur L. Day Medal of the Geological Society of America in 1973. Griggs was awarded two UD Air Force Exceptional Service Awards (1953, 1972). Death Griggs suffered a heart attack during a skiing trip to Snowmass, Colorado. His daughter, Nicola Andron, died a few months later while giving birth. Her brother, Stephen, buried the ashes of Griggs and Nicola and buried them (at the site of where Griggs' parents' ashes are also buried) on Mount Griggs in Alaska - the mount named after his father, Robert Fiske Griggs.

Like every other Tōshō-gū shrine, it is characterized by enshrining the first shōgun of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu with the name Tōshō Daigongen (東照大権現). The seated wooden statue of Tokugawa enshrined there has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Located inside Shiba Park, just beside the Buddhist temple Zōjō- ji, an important Jōdo-shū temple and popular attraction, and close to Tokyo Tower, Shiba Tōshō-gū can be included in the same visiting course. Shiba Tōshō-gū is notable for its giant ginkgo tree, one of the biggest in Tokyo, with a height of 21.5 m and a trunk circumference of 6.5 m. It is believed that Tokugawa Iemitsu, the third Tokugawa shōgun, planted the tree himself, when the Tōshō-gū shrine was rebuilt in 1641. Although slightly damaged on the branches and the tip of the trunk, it was designated Natural Monument in 1956. Another giant ginkgo tree of similar characteristics in Tokyo is located in the grounds of Oji Shrine.  Access  There is no admission fee for visitors to enter the temple complex. It opens every day from 7 AM to 7 PM. The entrance is a 2-minute walk from the Shibakoen Station on the Toei Mita Line, and a 7-minute walk from Akabanebashi Station in the Toei Oedo Line.

She was taken as a prize and her new owners renamed her Alexander. She made one voyage for the British East India Company (EIC), and then became a slave ship, making four voyages between 1798 and 1807. After 1807 she sailed between Liverpool and Demerara. She is last listed in 1811. Career It is currently not possible to identify Alexanders name before she became an English prize. Alexander appeared in Lloyd's Register for 1794 with Js. Boulton, master, Thompson, owner, and trade London-Ostend. Her burthen is given as 257 tons (bm),Lloyd's Register (1794). but that was corrected to 357 tons the next year.Lloyd's Register (1795). In 1796, Lloyd's Register showed a change in ownership to Connick & Co. Modifications to the entry showed the master as changing to W. Wallace, and her trade to London-Botany Bay.Lloyd's Register (1796). However, Alexander's next voyage was for the EIC as an \\"extra ship\\", i.e., under contract. Captain William Wallace left Portsmouth 12 August 1796, bound for Bengal. Alexander reached Saugor on 23 January 1797, and Calcutta six days later. She left Culpee on 27 March 1797. She reached the Cape on 12 July, St Helena on 17 September, and Long Reach on 18 December. Alexander then was sold into the Africa and West Indies slave trade. Lloyd's Register (LR) for 1798 shows Alexander, French-built in 1791, of 357 tons, with master Wallace and owner Connick, as being on the London-East Indies trade. A later amendment to the entry shows a new master, W. Cockerill, a new owner, B. Smith, and a new trade, Liverpool-Africa.Lloyd's Register (1798). Lloyd's Register for 1799 gave the names of her master and her owner as William Cockerel, and Smith & Co.Lloyd's Register 1799. Cockerel had received a letter of marque for Alexander on 6 September 1798. A database of slave voyages shows Alexander, under the command of William Cockerell, sailing to West Central Africa and St Helena. She left Liverpool on 23 October 1798 and arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on 12 September 1799. She landed 516 slaves. She left Kingston on 30 October and arrived back at Liverpool on 16 January 1800. She had left Liverpool with 49 crew members and had four deaths en route.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database – Alexander voyage #80170. A later amendment to the entry for Alexander in the 1800 issue of Lloyd's Register shows a change of master to G. Farquhar.Lloyd's Register (1800) - accessed 27 October 2015. George Farquhar received a letter of marque on 22 April 1800. He also became a partner in Smith & Co. Farquhar sailed Alexander to West Central Africa and St Helena, leaving Liverpool on 21 May 1800. He gathered slaves at Anomabu and the Rio Dande. Alexander arrived at Kingston on 29 April 1801. She arrived with 347 slaves. She left Kingston on 22 July and arrived back at Liverpool on 26 September. She had left with 54 crew members and had 40 when she arrived at Kingston. She had 11 crew men die on the voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database – Alexander voyage #80171. It is not clear what Alexander did between 1801 and 1805. Both Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping carry stale information. An amendment to the entry for Alexander in the 1805 issue of Lloyd's Register showed a change of master to V. May, and a change of owner to \\"Ti[undeceipherable]\\".Lloyd's Register (1805). Vincent May received a letter of marque on 19 October 1805. The database of slave voyages shows the master as Vincent May and the owner as John Titherington. Alexander sailed from Liverpool on 9 October 1805, but returned without having gathered any slaves. It is not clear why May aborted the voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database – Alexander voyage #80172.> Lloyd's Register for 1807 showed the owner as Titherton; an amendment to the entry gave a new master by the name of Smith.Lloyd's Register (1807). John Smith received a letter of marque on 13 December 1806. The database of slave voyages has the master's name as John Smith, and the voyage as being from the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands to Jamaica. Captain Smith departed Liverpool on 1 January 1807 and arrived at Kingston on 12 June. Alexander landed 296. she left Kingston on 29 September and arrived back at Liverpool on 1 January 1808. She had sailed from Liverpool with 45 men; ten died during the voyage.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database – Alexander voyage #80173. The entries in Lloyd's Register did not change until 1809, even though the Slave Trade Act 1807 had abolished the trade for British vessels. An amendment to the entry in the 1809 Lloyd's Register showed a change of master to J. Towers.Lloyd's Register (1809). However, this appears to be an error. Alexander, French prize, launched 1791 and of 383 tons (bm), appeared in the Register of Shipping in 1809 with J. Bailey, master, Fotheringham, owner, and trade Liverpool—Demerara.Register of Shipping (1809), Seq. №397. Fate The entries in the Register of Shipping continued unchanged through 1811.

Implementation By September 7, 1950, one day after the adoption of a national building law, the demolition of the heavily damaged Berlin City Palace began. The plan was to build a 90-meter wide stretch of road from the Frankfurter Straße via Alexanderplatz, Königstraße (now Rathausstraße) and the street Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate. The \\"central axis\\" was to create a new representation Magistrale arise between the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, the center of the monumental height dominant – should be in place of the castle, the central government building – as a \\"city crown\\" the Marx-Engels-Platz. In 1951, Stalinallee emerged as the first Socialist avenue in the GDR. The first stages of construction was from 1952 to 1958, designed by Hermann Henselmann, architect of Hochhaus an der Weberwiese. When the work at Frankfurter Tor was completed in 1960, the historicist style of the avenue was already outdated and perceived almost bashfully. Other major projects were in Dresden at the Altmarkt, in Leipzig on Roßplatz and at the Long Street realized in Rostock. From 1955 a new phase of urban development in the GDR took place after the Soviet Union adopted new directives for 1954 architecture, which called for greater standardization and the waiving of expensive ornamentation. The second phase of Stalinallee-between Strausberger Platz and Alexander Platz-was therefore built in an industrial aesthetic.

The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Iko Uwais, John Malkovich, Lauren Cohan, and Ronda Rousey. It follows an elite CIA task force composed of paramilitary officers from the Special Activities Division's Ground Branch, that has to escort a high-priority asset 22 miles to an extraction point while being hunted by the government. The film marks the fourth collaboration between Berg and Wahlberg, following Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. The film was released in the United States on August 17, 2018, and grossed $66 million worldwide. It received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, who called it \\"confusing and a chaotic mess,\\" alongside criticizing the cinematography and editing in the action sequences, although the performance of Uwais received praise. Plot CIA SAC/SOG officer James Silva leads a deniable strike team code-named Overwatch to infiltrate a Russian FSB safe house in the United States. Under the supervision of James Bishop, Overwatch's mission is to locate and destroy shipments of cesium before the highly toxic substance can be weaponized to kill thousands. The team successfully kills the occupants, while Overwatch member Alice Kerr is wounded. One of the boys falls out of an explosion after unsuccessfully trying to save all the cesium. Silva executes the boy who pleads not to be killed, and everyone escapes. 16 months later, Indocarr (fictional country loosely based on Indonesia) police officer Li Noor surrenders himself at the U.S. embassy to negotiate for passage out of the country in exchange for information. Noor is revealed to be Alice's asset and reveals that the disc contains the information regarding the last cesium, but he negotiates for passage out of the country in exchange for the code. The information in the disc is destroying itself and will be rendered useless in a few hours. While Noor is being tested, Alice tries to come to the terms of her family issues. Axel, leading a team from the Indocarr State Intelligence Agency, arrives at the embassy and demands that Noor be handed over. Meanwhile, Noor fends off an assassination attempt by Indocarr agents. Overwatch operative Sam Snow and Alice arrive, shocked at his combat prowess, learning that Noor used to be Indocarr Special Forces. Silva agrees to take Noor to an airplane, where it is 22 miles away. While driving, Noor reveals his reasons for turning on the Indocarr government: The government had been corrupt and killed his family. While driving, the camera Bishop was looking at blacks out, then comes on again. During the camera blackout, Axel has his men put bombs on the car, making it explode. While Silva's team helps fend off Axel's men, Sam is mortally injured. After defeating most of Axel's men, Silva gives Sam two grenades, and leaves her, letting her suicide-attack the remaining henchmen. Silva, Noor, Alice, and Douglas enter a restaurant. Silva sees Axel, and walks toward him, even though Bishop tells him not to. Axel tells James to give up Noor, but James refuses, and walks away. He brushes past two girls, and realizes that there is a grenade in the restaurant, and tackles down civilians before it explodes. When the dust clears, Douglas is severely wounded, and James is attacked by the same girls, only Noor to save Silva by killing them. While going to a safe house, Douglas dies while holding off Axel's men. While entering an apartment complex, Alice is separated and meets a girl in an apartment. Alice and the girl escape harm by using booby- trapped grenades. Meanwhile, Silva and Noor split up, fighting Axel and his henchmen respectively. Silva and Noor meet up again, and meet the girl Alice saved. She leads them to Alice, where Alice is losing against a henchman, but Noor kills the henchman by shooting him in the head. On the way to the air strip, the remaining team members are briefly confronted by Axel. Silva, having had enough, has Overwatch kill Axel by destroying his car with a drone strike. The team barely makes it to the airplane, where Li Noor and Alice board the airplane to meet her family once again. While on the airplane, Bishop notices Noor's heart rate is accelerating and it is revealed that Li Noor isn't a double agent, but a triple agent working for the Russian government, and the boy Silva killed was the son of a high-ranking official within the Russian government. The official hired Noor to give Alice the wrong information, so they would trust him, and just as Alice realizes this, Overwatch is ambushed, and the entire team is shot. Bishop barely escapes, and rests outside while Alice's fate is left unknown. Silva realizes this too late and tells his experience during a post-mission debriefing. Back at home, Silva puts up Li Noor's picture, vowing revenge. It should be added here that the hard disk that has been handed over by Noor is a Trojan horse that the moment that Noor gave up the password, it hacks the system of Overwatch personnel's profile which is the main objective, punished them all for the death of the high-ranking Russian official's son.  Cast   Production  On March 2, 2015, it was announced that Ronda Rousey and Iko Uwais were set to star in the action-thriller film Mile 22 scripted by Graham Roland, with Peter Berg attached as producer. WME Global was in talks to finance the film. On July 2, 2015, Mark Wahlberg was cast in the film to play the male lead role, while Berg was also confirmed to direct the film for STX Entertainment. Berg would also produce the film along with Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson. On March 28, 2017, Wahlberg and Berg announced that they are moving ahead with Mile 22 as a trilogy of films. On November 7, 2017, Lauren Cohan was cast in the film. Principal photography on the film was shot in Atlanta, Georgia in November and December 2017 under the working title Ground Branch Triple, and in Colombia in the capital city Bogotá and its surroundings in January and February 2018. On February 5, 2018, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos showed up during filming at one of the locations in Colombia. Director Peter Berg even had President Santos try to shoot one of the action sequences of the film.  Release  The final trailer was released online on July 26, 2018. The film was originally going to be released on August 3, 2018, but was pushed back two weeks to August 17, 2018. Reception =Box office= Mile 22 grossed $37.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $28.7 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $66.3 million. In the United States and Canada, Mile 22 was released alongside Alpha, and was projected to gross around $17 million from 3,520 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $5.3 million on its first day, including $1 million from Thursday night previews at 2,600 theaters. It went on to debut to $13.6 million, finishing third at the box office. In its second weekend the film dropped to sixth place, making $6 million. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 4.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Mile 22 lets the bullets fly—and not much else—in a thrill-deficient action thriller whose title proves sadly fitting for a film that feels close to a marathon endurance test.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B−\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 63% positive score. Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \\"Berg, when he wants to be, is a surgical craftsman of chaos. Yet Mile 22 has little weight or resonance.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Like an athlete who leaves it all on the field, the film leaves it all in the moment and on the screen, and there's really nothing to take away afterwards. There is nothing to think about, no nuances to contemplate, no connection with these characters who exist only in moments of hyper-tension and crisis, no greater truths to consider other than to prevail.\\" The performance of Uwais received some praise. Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"As a performer and fight choreographer, Uwais delivers, with some extremely athletic and imaginative kills, mostly performed while handcuffed. It's also far and away Uwais's best acting performance in a film, and he almost makes Mile 22 worth it.\\" Brian Lowry of CNN stated, \\"In fact, Uwais' action sequences—fast paced and electric—are easily the highlight of a movie otherwise characterized by an abundance of automatic-weapons fire and tedious dialogue during the fleeting gaps between those bursts.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, criticizing the editing of the fight scenes and stating, \\"Why go through the trouble of giving Iko Uwais several fight scenes and editing them so that you can barely see the star inflict highly choreographed damage?...Mile 22 can give you chase scenes and bullet-ridden shoot-outs and evil Russians and lengthy diatribes. It can give you something approximating action. What it can't give you is a watchable action movie. That's where it truly fails to go the distance.\\" Future Mile 22 is intended to be a starting point to a multi-media series: There are also plans for a sequel in the early stages of development. After its release, STX Digital announced that they will produce a short-term live-action series called The Kiev Exchange. The series will follow the CIA's elusive paramilitary force, Ground Branch, as they negotiate a tense and complex hostage exchange in a public square. Berg will return to direct, and it will be written by Umair Aleem, with the film's producers returning to produce the series. It is 2020, nothing has yet been known about the production of the series and the sequel is not known if it is still in development or was cancelled.

His composition teachers included John Ireland and Bernard van Dieren, and he studied piano with Mabel Lander, Leonid Kreutzer, Wilhelm Backhaus and Egon Petri. He worked as a concert pianist, before devoting himself more to music composition. He composed a piano concerto, piano quartet, and a cello concerto. He corresponded regularly with fellow composer Gerald Finzi during the latter 1930s about the policies of Adolf Hitler against Jews in Germany. His pacifism during World War II resulted in decreased reception for his works during this time. Busch died in 1945 in Woolacombe, North Devon, England. Music critic John Amis wrote that his works would have a lasting legacy due to their value. His compositions were performed in 2010 at a music festival in Ludlow, Shropshire, where he was compared to Muriel Herbert and Martin Shaw. Raphael Wallfisch released an album in 2014 featuring his compositions. Early life and education William Busch was born on 24 June 1901 in London, England. His parents were originally from Germany, and later went through the naturalization process to become citizens of the United Kingdom. His musical studies took him to London; Berlin, Germany; and the United States. His studies in Germany took place between 1921 and 1924. Busch learned musical composition under English composer John Ireland and Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren. He took instruction from piano tutor Mabel Lander. His piano skills were honed by classical pianist Egon Petri. Music career After his education, Busch came back to England and worked for a time as a concert pianist. He traveled and performed as a concert pianist in South Africa and the United States. After his work as a concert pianist, Busch subsequently devoted himself in the later part of his career to musical composition. He switched from performing regularly, to composition mainly, because of his affliction with stage fright. Busch composed a piano concerto for the BBC Contemporary Music concert which he himself performed in 1938, and wrote a piano quartet in 1939. Between 1938–1939, Busch corresponded regularly with his composer colleague, Gerald Finzi. Their letters mainly focused on the sanctions imposed on Jews at the time in Germany by Adolf Hitler, with Finzi arguing staunchly against segregation. Busch's pacifism during World War II left himself and fellow composer William Wordsworth given less reception during this time period. His cello concerto, written in 1941, was performed at The Proms in 1943. Death and legacy Busch died on 30 January 1945 in Woolacombe, North Devon, England. At the time he was in the early stages of receiving significant recognition for his music works. Music critic John Amis wrote upon his death of his impact: \\"Recognition will not cease now, for his work has permanent values.\\" In 2010, Busch's work was highlighted at the Fourth Triennial Weekend of English Song, Ludlow, Shropshire, where the artistic director of the program called him an \\"unsung\\" composer and classed his compositions amongst the works of Muriel Herbert and Martin Shaw. Raphael Wallfisch released an album in 2014, British Music for Cello and Piano, featuring compositions by Busch.

The site of the shrine has especially strong connections to Tokugawa Ieyasu, as he lived at Hikuma Castle, where the shrine was built, for 17 years, from age 29 to 45. Hamamatsu Castle, which was ruled by a succession of fudai daimyō under Hamamatsu Domain was built overlapping the ruins of Hikuma Castle. Following the Meiji restoration. the castle was pulled down, and much of its area was subsequently absorbed by the growing urbanization of the modern city of Hamamatsu. Ii Hachirō (1816-1897), the former castellan of Hamamatsu Castle, petitioned the Meiji government for permission to build a shrine of the site of Tokugawa Ieyasu's residence in Hikoma Castle in 1877. Permission was granted, but no funding. As raising the funds to build the shrine took a long time, it was not until 1887 that a temporary shrine was built on the grounds of the adjacent Dai Nippon Hotokusha, a public foundation dedicated to propagating the teachings of Ninomiya Sontoku. The shrine at Motoshirochō was not completed until 1936. However, during the Bombing of Hamamatsu in World War II, the shrine burned down. The present structure dates from 1958.

AM4 was launched in September 2016 and was designed to replace the sockets AM3+, FM2+ and FS1b as a single platform. It has 1331 pin slots and is the first from AMD to support DDR4 memory as well as achieve unified compatibility between high-end CPUs (previously using Socket AM3+) and AMD's lower-end APUs (on various other sockets). In 2017 AMD made a commitment to using the AM4 platform with socket 1331 until 2020.  Features  The X370 chipset supports multiple graphics cards. But the number of available PCIe lanes depends on the CPU/APU. * Support for Zen (including Zen+, Zen 2 and Zen 3) based family of CPUs and APUs (Ryzen, Athlon), as well as for some A-Series APUs and Athlon X4 CPUs (Bristol Ridge based on the Excavator microarchitecture) * Supports PCIe 3.0 and 4.0 * Supports up to 4 modules of DDR4 SDRAM in dual-channel configuration  Heatsink  The AM4 socket specifies the 4 holes for fastening the heatsink to the motherboard to be placed in the corners of a rectangle with a lateral length of 54×90 mm. Previous sockets have 48×96 mm. Some heat sinks for older sockets are not compatible. However, some cooler manufacturers are reported to be offering brackets allowing previously manufactured coolers to work with AM4, while other coolers will be redesigned. Alternatively, some motherboard makers are including both AM3 and AM4 cooler mounting holes, allowing previous generation coolers to be used.  Chipsets  Socket AM4 is currently a base for 8 chipset models. While the processors for this socket have been designed as systems on a chip (SoC), with the traditional northbridge and southbridge on board the processor, the motherboard chipset will increase the number of PCI Express lanes and other connectivity options. These connectivity options include: NVMe, SATA, and USB 3.2 Gen 2.  Criticism  In 2020, AMD faced some criticism when it was announced on 7 May that the Zen 3/Ryzen 5000 microprocessors would only be compatible with newer 500-series AM4 motherboards. This was explained as motherboard BIOS's sizes not being large enough to support the full range of AM4 socket processors. This had upset some of the user base as, described by Anandtech, they \\"...had assumed that this meant any AM4 platform based motherboard would be able to accept any processor made from 2016 to 2020, including the new Zen 3...\\". After the announcement some motherboard manufacturers announced they were planning to add in support for Zen 3 processors via BIOS updates. However on 19 May 2020 AMD changed its position and stated that Zen 3 would be coming to selected older X470 and B450 motherboards via a BIOS update. This would be achieved by disabling support for some older AM4 processors in the BIOS ROM in order to allocate space to support the newer processors.

Since oxygen is carried by the blood, TCOM can be used as an indirect measure of blood flow to the tissue. Since blood flow is important for wound healing, TCOM is often used to gauge the ability of tissue to effectively heal. To perform the test, one set of electrodes are placed on viable tissue (e.g. the chest) as a control and a second set is placed around the tissue in question (e.g. legs or feet). The electrodes may mildly heat the skin to increase blood flow into the area. Oxygen may also be given to the patient to see if that increases oxygen levels in the tissue. The test takes about 45 minutes. Results are reported either as the absolute values of the tissue in question (in mmHg) or as a ratio of the tissue in question to the control tissue. The normal oxygen tension in the foot is approximately 60 mmHg, and the normal chest/foot ratio is approximately 0.9. Many factors can limit the accuracy of the test including edema, temperature, inflammation, medications, and stress. In addition for the measurement to be normal, all parts of the oxygenation pathway must be functioning: the lungs must be able to oxygenate the blood, the heart must be able to pump the blood, and a patent artery must be able to carry blood to the skin. Without comorbitities, wounds are thought to be able to heal if the oxygen tension is >40 mmHg. In the presence of comorbities, such as diabetes or edema, a higher value is likely needed. Patients with oxygen tensions <20 mmHg are likely to need revascularization to promote adequate wound healing. The required TCOM level for adequate wound healing, however, remains controversial.

A follower of the Yunmen School, Faxiu had many friends among the educated elite, including scholars, writers, and painters, such as Huang Tingjian, Su Shi, Wang Shen, Wang Anshi, and Li Gonglin. He is also remembered for a quotation recorded by his student Changlu Zongze in the Chanyuan Qinggui, or The Rules of Purity in the Chan Monastery. In that influential text, he is quoted as saying that practitioners who meditate with closed eyes are in the \\"ghostly cave under the dark mountain\\". Dahong Baoen, a student of Touzi Yiqing, is said to have practiced with Faxiu, who recognized his promise in Zen practice. Faxiu was a close friend of the Song Dynasty painter Li Gonglin, who depicted him in a painting called \\"Elegant Gathering in the Western Garden\\". As an apparently moralistic teacher, Faxiu taught his lay students in terms of karmic retribution, and he specifically urged Gonglin to give up painting horses lest he be reborn as one. Faxiu suggested he should instead repent by painting the Bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara. He also was in contact with Huang Tingjian, whose writing he criticized for its \\"seductive language\\". Juefan Huihong, a contemporary monk, recorded that Faxiu had a famously bad temper. He wrote of Faxiu: > ...he had a severe, cold expression. [His imposing] rage [gives the > impression that] he would spit [water] at people. In his life he regarded > cursing as the business of Buddhism. In 1084, Faxiu was appointed to be the first abbot of Fayun Chan Monastery by Emperor Shenzong of Song, which is the origin of the \\"Fayun\\" in his name. The Great Hall there was furnished with the help of his friends, with Su Shi providing the inscription for the great bell, and Li Gonglin sculpting the main Buddha image. The Conglin shengshi, or Glorious matters from the monasteries, written in 1199 by Guyue Daorong, presents a supposed dialogue between Faxiu and his teacher Tianyi Yihuai. In it, Yihuai asks Faxiu what the essence of the Avatamsaka Sutra is, to which Faxiu replies \\"dharmadhatu\\". Yihuai then asks what the essence of dharmadhatu is. Faxiu responds \\"Mind\\". Unrelenting, Yihuai asks what the essence of Mind is, to which Faxiu finds himself unable to respond. Faxiu later traveled to the Longmian Mountains to practice with Fushan Fayuan.

The fortified city was enclosed by a two- part system of defensive walls, and the gardens, fed by springs on the steep slope below, played a vital role in keeping the city provisioned and watered. The gardens were added to the UNESCO tentative list in 2013, and they became a World Heritage Site in 2015, along with the walls of Diyarbakır Fortress. History The Hevsel Gardens are first mentioned in Aramean chronicles dating from the ninth century BC, the settlement of Diyarbakır on the hill above having been established earlier than this. Diyarbakır (originally called Amid), was built on a basalt escarpment overlooking the Tigris River. In 866 bc, the city was besieged by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II and when it fell, the gardens were destroyed as a form of punishment. The fortified city has been of importance in the region during the Hellenistic period, and during the Roman, Sassanid, Byzantine, Islamic and Ottoman Empires up to modern times. The Hevsel Gardens were created between the city and the river, with the objective of providing water and food for the inhabitants. Numerous springs emerge from beneath the basalt and the gardens are divided into five terraces above the present Tigris floodplain. The terraces have been formed over millennia as the river meandered in its wide valley and sometimes carved itself a deeper channel. The uppermost part of the garden will have been critical to the siting of the city; the gardens were regarded as sacred because of their important provisioning role, and have been compared to the Garden of Eden.Diyarbakır Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape (2016) Karadoğan, Sabri; Alper, Berrin; Soyukaya, Nevin By 1655 the gardens included both banks of the Tigris and were said to be filled with fragrant orchards, vineyards, rose gardens and basil gardens. Nineteenth century travellers reported seeing a great variety of vegetables and fruit grown, and commented on the melons, grapes and apricots, and the famous watermelons, which were grown on the sandy islands formed by the braided river. The gardens were integrated with the city, with poplars and fruit trees separating the different vegetable gardens, and the waste water from the city being channelled to provide fertility and to drive water wheels. Mulberry trees were grown to support a silk industry in the city, and timber was produced, from poplar and willow trees, and shipped to Mosul Province on rafts. Nowadays, about one third of the gardens is used for growing poplars and the rest for cultivation of a great range of produce; cabbage, spinach, lettuce, radish, green onions, parsley, watercress, eggplants, squashes, tomatoes, peppers and beans, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, figs, mulberries and nuts. Conservation The Hevsel Gardens are still in cultivation to this day, but their integrity is threatened by unauthorised businesses and dwellings which have been established at the base of the fortress. Other concerns are blocked drainage channels and the quality of the water. Extraction of water higher up the Tigris Valley has reduced waterflow in the river and decreased periodic inundation of the floodplain. Buffer zones have been established, but the gardens are considered to be vulnerable.

The tale is a rendition of a tale about a woodcutter (firewood-gatherer) from the early 13th-century anthology Uji Shūi Monogatari.  Textual notes  The tale, which may be known in Japanese as , , or , is arguably among the top ten native fairy tales that are frequently recounted to children in modern Japan. = English translations = The tale was translated as The Old Man and the Devils (1886) by James Curtis Hepburn. Hepburn translated the oni as \\"devils\\" where a more modern editions might give \\"demons\\" or \\"ogres\\", but it was commonplace during this time period to replace native Japanese concepts with equivalent Christian ones in these translated stories. \\"How an Old Man Lost his Wen\\" by Yei Theodora Ozaki (1903) was a retelling based on a published Japanese text edited by . Though not a literal translation by her own admission, it has been assessed as deserving more credit as to its fidelity. There was one other translation also using Sazanami Iwaya as the Japanese textual source, namely \\"The Old Man with the Wen\\" translated by M. E. Kirby (volume 10 of 12 in the Iwaya's Fairy tales of Old Japan series, Eigaku-Shimpo-sha, 1903). However, when the tale was reissued in the compendium edition Iwaya's Fairy tales of Old Japan (1914), only Hannah Riddell was given translator credit. A similar version \\"Story of the Man with the Wen\\", which names the locale as \\"mount Taiko\\", was printed in the Transactions of the Japan Society in 1885. A more recent translation effort is \\"Lump off, Lump On\\" (1987) by Royall Tyler.  Plot  The man's lump is taken by the oni (devils). The second old man returns home with two lumps on his face There was an old man with a lump (or wen) on the right side of his face. is \\"lump\\" or \\"wen\\". The tale says it grows on the right side (, and in Japanese), but was overlooked by . Ozaki's translation describes the lump to be \\"like a tennis-ball\\", while the Spanish translation makes the lump to be the size of a peach (). One day he went into the mountain to cut wood, and was caught in the rain. He took refuge in the hollow of a tree. He was soon to witness a gathering of strange beings nearby, some one-eyed and some mouth- less. They were the oni Japanese text. First referred to as then interchangeably as . (demons or ogres; \\"devils\\" being the Christendom equivalent). The oni created a great bonfire as light as day. The began to drink sake wine, sing and dance. They old man overcame his fears and was lured to join the dance. The greatly entertained oni wanted him to return the next day. (or \\"always\\") for an encore. To ensure the old man's return, the oni wanted keep custody of some valuable possession, and of all things, decided the old man's lump should be taken as pledge. They then proceed to remove the unwanted tumor.In , , , the demons arrive at their own conclusion that the lump is some sort of lucky charm, without the old man's contrivance. In , the old man encourages them to believe it by saying the lump was something he would not willingly part with. The old man was elated to find the lump gone, with not a remnant of it remaining, and no soreness in the cheek where it was removed., , . There lived next door an old man who had a big lump on his left cheek.; When he heard his neighbor's story about losing the lump, he wanted to emulate, and therefore asked to take the place of performing in front of the oni, and the neighbor yielded him the opportunity. The left-lump old man went to the same tree hollow, and when the oni assembled, the chief demon was particularly eagerly awaiting.: : \\"King Demon\\", : \\"the demon chief\\". Unfortunately, the left-lump old man did not have the same level of skill in the art of dancing, and was a disappointment to the demons, who bid him to take back his lump and leave. And the demons slapped on (or threw) the piece of flesh which stuck to the clean side of his face,: \\"brought the lump and stuck it on the other side of his face\\". and this old man returned home chagrined, now with two lumps on his face.: the two lumps looked like , which closely renders as \\"Japanese gourd\\". gives \\"ends of a dumbbell\\". Origins This folktale can be traced to the tale collection Uji Shūi Monogatari compiled in early 13th century. The medieval version has been translated as \\"How Someone Had a Wen Removed by Demons\\". Here the man explicitly \\"made his living gathering firewood\\". The oni demons are of assorted variety, and some are picturesquely described: red ones wearing blue, black ones wearing red and sporting loincloths (or wearing a red loincloth), some one-eyed, and some mouthless. The medieval version concludes with a one-liner moral cautioning against envy. Also it is added in the variant text that the lump was the size of an , and this prevented him from engaging in a profession that mingles with people. ed., p. 4 note. The variant's plain text @ Komazawa U. It is speculated this refers to the citrus variety known today as natsumikan.  Analysis  =Variants= The version given by A. B. Mitford in 1871 \\"The Elves and the Envious Neighbour\\" features two men with a wen on the forehead, and the second visitor earns another wen on top of his own. The second man could not be faulted for his poor dancing or companionship, and it was just a case of mistaken identity. Mitford\\"s version also concludes with a moral against envy. Another variant called , where the protagonist priest has a tumor over the eye, was collected by Kunio Yanagita. Here, the tumor is taken by the tengu (\\"long-nosed demons\\"), and given to a second priest with a tumor. Here again, the second priest suffered his ill fate despite his dancing being entertaining enough. The locality of the tale was not given. = Analogues = The kobutori tale has been finely classified as tale type AT 503A \\"The Gifts of the Tengu\\" by Hiroko Ikeda, but is type 503 \\"The Gifts of the Little People\\" for purposes of cross-referencing international analogues.  Asian analogues  There is a Chinese analogue to be found in 's book (1611). A version written in Chinese also occurs in edited by and published 1749, and purports to be a reprint of texts lost before the Han Dynasty, but the general consensus is that this is by the editor. A number of specimens of the analogous tale also occurs in Korea. translated one version of the Korean Kobutori (1910). Here the first old man deceives the goblins (dokkaebi) and sells off his lump as the source of his bel canto voice. The second old man with a lump was a fine singer too, but receives the detached lump which goblins discovered to be useless. Chʻoe In-hak's selected anthology (1974) also includes a kobutori tale (in Japanese). The tale in Hangul, entitled Hogtten-iyagi or \\"Wen-taking story\\" () was later printed in the 1923 edition of the Korean-language Reader, which also gave an illustration of the goblin. But the textbook was issued under Japanese control (Government-General of Korea). Kim Jong-dae of Chung-Ang University who is an expert on the Korean goblin thinks the tale was imported into Korea from Japan in the Colonial Period (1910–1945). However, scholar Bak Mikyung who earned her doctorate at Kyoto University, has pointed out that if the story \\"The Story of Hok Lee and the Dwarfs\\" printed by Andrew Lang in 1892 is a Korean tale, this would set the date of its establishment in Korea to at least the pre-colonial era. Although Lang represents the tale as translated from the Chinese (it is also set in China), the protagonist's name Hok means \\"wen\\" or \\"lump\\" in Korean and may indicate its actual origins.  European parallels  Charles Wycliffe Goodwin noticed that the Japanese \\"Kobutori\\" tale closely paralleled the Irish \\"The Legend of Knockgrafton\\", presenting his finding in 1875, though this was not printed for the public at large until 1885. The Irish tale had been published by Thomas Crofton Croker c. 1825, and Goodwin first noticed the similarity after reading Mitford's brief version of the Japanese tale. Goodwin subsequently obtained a fuller version of the story which he printed in his paper. The resemblance of \\"The Legend of Knockgrafton\\" to the Japanese folktale was also noted by Joseph Jacobs in 1894. Moreton J. Walhouse, another jurist serving in India, also regurgitated this parallel in a 1897 paper entitled \\"Folklore Parallels and Coincidences\\". Joseph Bédier in 1895 noted the resemblance between the Japanese tale and a tale from Picardy which contains the same formula as the Irish one: the fairies sing the beginning days of the week, and the second hunchback upsets them by adding days.

Cunningham and starring Bruce Campbell and Chase Masterson. The plot involves a group of aliens disguised as humans who take over an airport in preparation for an invasion of Earth. A female pilot and a convicted murderer fight back. Plot A convicted murderer is being transported across the highway in a blizzard when the police wagon crashes into a tree. The officers and the prisoner, Jack, make their way through the blizzard to a small airport. In the restroom the officers are killed by an alien disguised as a preacher, who reveals a plan to invade and take over Earth. Jack kills the alien, who disintegrates. The pilot and the passengers awaiting their flight in the airport believe that Jack the prisoner killed the policemen until another woman is killed in a scuffle and her body also disintegrates. The other passengers tie Jack to a post and urge the pilot to fly out but she refuses due to the dangerous blizzard conditions. A businessman awaiting an important meeting threatens the pilot with a gun and shoots a human serviceman who stands in his way, killing him. Jack escapes and takes the gun back from the businessman. The baggage x-ray machine reveals that an elderly woman is an alien and she kills the airport security guard. Radio communications do not work and the pilot goes to the hangar, where she uses a radio found by children there. The children belong to no one and reveal themselves as aliens while Jack escapes with the pilot. They locate a two-person biplane and he convinces her to fly him to Canada to escape prosecution. The other passengers barricade themselves in the lounge, refusing to let the alien children in. They discover boxes containing a gun for clearing avalanches and use it to fight off the children when they come attacking through the back of the vending machine but two more passengers are killed. The pilot and Jack crawl back to the main hall through the air ducts and rescue the surviving passengers along the way before the aliens make their way into the lounge. Together they all return to the hangar, losing the businessman to aliens along the way. On the surveillance camera they see that one of the passengers, Darien, is still alive in the lounge. The pilot and Jack sneak back to save him, narrowly avoiding a pursuing alien and setting it ablaze with gasoline as they escape to the hangar. Just as the pilot is about to fly Jack away they receive a phone call Darien disguises his voice as the pilot, screaming that Jack the prisoner has been killing the passengers. Darien, a leader in the alien invasion, holds them at gunpoint places mind-controlling handcuffs on one of the passengers to make her state that Jack is the killer. The pilot refuses to wear the handcuffs and will not blame Jack for the killings. Jack seems to accept the alien's offer to allow him to escape and let the others die but then explains that he removed the bullets from that gun. Together the surviving humans work to throw the alien into a moving propeller, killing it. As the police sirens are closing in the pilot fulfills her promise and flies Jack to Canada.

Born in Jarrow, Johnston left school at the age of eleven to work in the office of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company. He studied at evening school and undertook an apprenticeship to become an engineer, then worked as a draughtsman.Margaret 'Esipinasse and Judith Fincher Laird, Dictionary of Labour Biography (vol.5), pp.121-124 Always interested in political and ethical matters, Johnston was a vegetarian and teetotaller from an early age. He was involved in Jarrow Literary and Debating Society and was honorary secretary for many years. In 1866, he was active in the campaign for Jarrow to receive a town charter. In 1868, he moved to Sunderland for work, then later relocated to Glasgow, where he studied engineering in the evenings at Anderson's College and then the University of Glasgow. He moved on again to London and then Rotherham before settling in Manchester in 1880, where he was a prominent advocate of the Manchester Ship Canal, working for the Parliamentary Committee which drew up the bill authorising its construction. At the 1885 general election, Johnston stood unsuccessfully as an Independent Liberal-Labour candidate in Jarrow, taking 1,731 votes and second place. He was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), setting up its Macclesfield branch in 1894. At the 1895 general election, the ILP's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Manchester North East, Leonard Hall, withdrew at short notice due to a lack of campaign funds, and Johnston stepped in, although he took only 546 votes. At the 1900 general election, he stood in Ashton-under-Lyne, again at short notice, on this occasion for the Labour Representation Committee, but with the support of the ILP. He took 737 votes and was again unsuccessful. However, he was elected to Manchester City Council in 1898, representing St George's ward, serving three years, and again from 1902 to 1905, and as an alderman from 1916. In his spare time, Johnston founded a boys' activity club, then ran seaside camps for young girls, to enable them to go on holiday. He was president of the Smoke Abatement League from 1884 until 1890, the Manchester and Salford Equitable Co-operative Society from 1886 to 1889, and chaired the Manchester Working Men's Association during the 1890s. He also twice travelled around the world, and enjoyed rock climbing in Britain and Switzerland.

These programs are not to be confused with similar master's degree programs. At the end of five years, the student will have two bachelor's degrees, one from each school. Often, 3-2 programs advertise that students get a more robust education. Traditional engineering majors cannot take as many classes in the humanities because they follow strict course sequences to graduate on time. 3-2 students get the technical training at the partner school as well as a myriad of quintessential liberal arts courses at their home institution. Home Institution Requirements Students complete general education requirements for the home institution and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses for transferring to the partner school. Since students are intended to stay for three years, they do not receive a degree from the home institution, usually a BA, until graduating from the partner school. Depending on the home institution, a student might receive a pre-engineering degree or a degree in the field of interest (i.e. a chemistry major for a chemical engineer or a physics major for a mechanical engineer). Some partnerships allow students to complete a four-year degree at their home institution and then transfer to the partner school and get another degree. In this case, the student does not have to complete the engineering segment to get the home institution degree. Note that this not universally offered as a part of all 3-2 programs. Partner Institution Requirements The partner school requires a student to take courses in calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science before transferring. Some of the more established programs ensure admission given that the student fulfills grade, GPA, and course requirements. Other partner schools have students apply as transfer students. The partner recognizes STEM classes taken at the home institution as prerequisite for upper level engineering courses. After two years of engineering courses, the student receives both degrees. History 3-2 engineering programs have been around for quite some time. Case Institute of Technology, now Case Western Reserve University, established a program from 1903 to 1927 with Adelbert College. After a brief hiatus, widespread proliferation of 3-2 programs “… begun in the 1960s. Their major purpose has been to add a combined liberal arts/engineering dimension to higher education rather than to contribute to the central flow of undergraduate engineering manpower.”. 3-2 Programs as a Means to Promote Minorities in Engineering Some 3-2 programs have promoted racial diversity in engineering by partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Georgia Tech, for example, has several partnerships with HBCUs. “In line with the initial goals of the program, the mission is to increase educational access for minorities in the engineering profession and attract talented young men and women to careers in math, science, and engineering through the Dual Degree Engineering Program”. Additionally, 3-2 programs minimize the, “… thousands of high school seniors [who] are overlooked by engineering programs because they didn't go to the \\"right\\" school, take the right courses, or do well on a standardized test”. A bright but perhaps unmotivated high school student is not likely to enroll in an engineering program his or her first year if he/she does not have certain grades/test scores. 3-2 programs are structured so 1st, 2nd, and 3rd- year students can develop their calculus, physics and chemistry backgrounds in a more nurturing environment. At the Atlanta University Center, \\"Tutors are available for all pre-engineering courses offered at the member [home] institutions”. 3-2 Student Success Despite 3-2 program’s lengthy history, there is little information on the success of 3-2 students. Depending on the source, one can find information dismissing, promoting, and being indifferent to 3-2 students. An article from the 1960s claims, “Several other officials state that the three-two students do as well as the regular students, or better”. Whereas a more recent 1987 article states, “Such students represent an aberration in a liberal arts environment, and from the engineering side they have been more tolerated than encouraged”. Both sources agree that there is a shortage of data on graduation rates and/or washout rates, GPA performance, and enrollment.

H. de Young, founded the newspaper The Daily Dramatic Chronicle, which became the San Francisco Chronicle, and was its editor-in-chief. He was murdered by Isaac M. Kalloch, son of Isaac S. Kalloch, the Mayor of San Francisco, in revenge for a feud Charles had with the mayor. Early life and family Charles de Young was born on January 8, 1846 in Natchitoches, Louisiana. He was the son of Cornelia \\"Amelia\\" (née Morange; 1809-1881) and Miechel de Young (d. 1854), who married in 1837, and the brother of Michael Henry \\"Harry\\" de Young and Virginia de Young (d. 1875). His family, who were Jewish, had immigrated from the Netherlands and France. His maternal grandfather, Benjamin Morange, who served as the French Minister to Spain under Napoleon I,The Hebrews in America moved to the United States about 1815 and helped found the B'nai Jeshurun Congregation in New York in 1825. Career In 1859, he began publishing the Holiday Advertiser, a daily publication, while he was finishing his apprenticeship. The interests were sold and in 1865, he began publishing the Dramatic Chronicle with his brother, Harry. The daily paper was focused on theater gossip, advertising and light news. The revenue from the Dramatic Chronicle allowed the brothers to begin publishing the San Francisco Chronicle in 1869. Charles focused on the content and editing of the paper, while Harry was responsible for the management of the paper on the business side. In 1874, de Young denounced San Francisco Judge Delos Lake, which led to the two meeting in California Street for a duel during the busiest time of day. Judge Lake shot twice at de Young, who returned the shots, however, neither were hit. At the time of his death, the San Francisco Chronicle was worth $250,000 (). =Assassination= In 1879, Isaac Smith Kalloch ran for mayor of San Francisco. It was not long before he came under attack from the San Francisco Chronicle's editor-in-chief, Charles de Young, who was backing another candidate. De Young, with the hopes of taking Kalloch out of the mayoral race, accused the minister of having an affair. Kalloch responded by accusing Charles' mother, Amelia, of running a brothel. In response, Charles De Young ambushed Kalloch in the streets of San Francisco and shot him twice. Kalloch survived the wounds and with the sympathy of voters was elected the 18th Mayor of San Francisco. He served from 1879 until 1881. On April 23, 1880, Kalloch's son, Isaac Milton Kalloch, entered the Chronicle building and shot and killed Charles de Young. Memorial In 1884, de Young's brother, Harry, commissioned a bronze statue of Michael, erected at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in San Francisco which cost in excess of $10,000 (). The statue was sculpted by F. Marion Wells, a member of the Bohemian Club in San Francisco.

A series of interior renovations began in 2002 by the Public Works and Government Services Canada at the direction of the National Capital Commission, and is concentrated on the Centre Block, West Block, and East Block, Library of Parliament, Confederation Building, and the Justice Building. History In 2002, an extensive $1 billion renovation project began across the parliamentary precinct, specifically focusing on masonry restoration, asbestos removal, vehicle screening, parking, electrical and mechanical systems, and improved visitors' facilities. The Library of Parliament and Peace Tower, as well as some exterior areas of masonry on the Centre Block have so far been completed, though focus has shifted to the West Block due to its rapidly deteriorating cladding. Before 2018, when the Centre Block is slated to be closed for five years in order to carry out an extensive interior restoration and upgrade, the inner courtyard of West Block will be enclosed and fitted with temporary chambers for the House of Commons. The Senate will move to the Government Conference Centre. In 2007, the government approved an updated Long-Term Vision and Plan to be carried out through a series of five-year programs. Each program includes primary projects to rehabilitate key heritage buildings, urgent building repairs to ensure the ongoing viability of buildings and to address health and safety issues, and planning activities to develop the next five-year program. The first priority as outlined in the Long-Term Vision and Plan is to renovate the core historic Parliament buildings, the triad of the West Block, Centre Block, and East Block. The Centre Block cannot be renovated while it is occupied, its occupants will be relocated and will use the East and West blocks as interim space. However, these buildings also need rehabilitation work, which will have to be done first. Before this work can take place, however, the functions displaced from the East and West blocks need to be relocated in interim or new accommodation. Timeline In 1988, the East Block 1910 Wing restoration begins. It was completed in 1997. In 1992, the West Block project receives preliminary approval. The project receives final approval in 1997, is postponed in 1998, and receives revised preliminary approval in 2005. In 1993, the Peace Tower masonry repair begins. It was completed in 1997. In 1995, the Centre Block South façade restoration begins. It was completed in 1998. In 1997, the construction of Centre Block Underground Services rehabilitation begins. It was completed in 1998. In 2001, the preliminary approval of new construction, the Bank Street Building, was granted. The Bank Street Building construction was cancelled in 2005. In 2002, the Library of Parliament rehabilitation begins. It was completed in 2006. In 2005, projects to provide swing space or relocate functions for West and East blocks begin. These projects are ongoing as of 2015. In 2010, the Wellington Building rehabilitation begins. It was completed in 2016. In 2012 the Sir John A. MacDonald Building (previously the Bank of Montreal Building) rehabilitation began. It was completed in 2015. Buildings undergoing rehabilitation =Centre Block= Planning for the major rehabilitation of Centre Block is currently underway. The building will have to be emptied prior to initiating the rehabilitation. Until the major rehabilitation begins, ongoing maintenance and repair work is being carried out. The Centre Block is scheduled to close in 2019. =East Block= The exterior rehabilitation work underway on the East Block aims to preserve the building's distinctive characteristics. Planning and building investigation work is underway and will include an upgrade to the masonry work on the 1867 Wing of the building. Rehabilitation work has also begun on the Northwest Tower, which will include structural and seismic reinforcement and the installation of a new copper roof. The East Block rehabilitation work is scheduled to be complete by 2022. =West Block= Both the interior and the exterior of the building will be rehabilitated, which will include the restoration of the masonry, modernization of life-safety systems and seismic upgrades. The rehabilitation will include construction of a permanent courtyard infill and the first phase of a visitor welcome centre. Public Works and Government Services Canada will enclose the courtyard of West Block for use as a temporary legislative chamber while Centre Block is out of commission. The West Block re-opened in 2018. =Wellington Building= The Wellington Building, located at 180 Wellington Street was renovated to extend its lifecycle and was repurposed from an administrative office function into parliamentary accommodations so that the East Block and the Centre Block can be emptied and fully restored. It houses 70 parliamentary offices and 10 committee rooms. The work began in 2010 and the building re-opened in 2016. =Sir John A. Macdonald Building= The building on the southwest corner of Wellington and O’Connor, known to most in Ottawa since it was built in 1930 as the Bank of Montreal building. The Beaux-Arts façade has been conservered with a modern addition to its west at a cost of just under $100 million. It houses parliamentary ceremonial and committee rooms.

Plot  Danila, an art student in Italy, visits an abandoned, deconsecrated church to view life- size wooden sculptures of the crucifixion uncovered there. Along with her art professor, Danila purchases one of the sculptures and brings it to the campus art studio. That night, Danila attends a house party held by her parents, where she witnesses her mother engaging in sadomasochistic sex in one of the bedrooms with Mario, her lover. Disturbed by what she has witnessed, Danila returns to the art studio to work. While painting, she has a vision of the statue of the man coming to life and seducing her. After, Danila meets her boyfriend, Carlo, for dinner. Upon returning home, she is accosted by something unseen in the stairwell. Upon entering her apartment, she begins masturbating furiously. Her parents later find her in bed, writhing and scratching herself violently. She attempts to initiate sex with her father, after which he slaps her in the face. After being sedated, Danila dreams of driving with her parents into the countryside, during which their car has a tire blowout near an abandoned cathedral. As her father repairs the tire, Danila wanders into the cathedral, where an artist is performing restorations. Danila wanders into catacombs, where she has a vision of three women sacrificing another for the man she earlier witnessed manifest from the statue; the cultists address the man as Satan. Danila drinks from a cup offered to her, before the man crucifies her. Danila awakens from the dream, violently screaming. Her parents summon a doctor, who finds stigmata on Danila's hands; however, the wounds miraculously disappear the next day. After a priest determines Danila may be possessed, she is taken to a remote Catholic convent in the mountains to undergo an exorcism. When the nuns recite Latin prayer in the chapel, Danila goes mad and flees, but is stopped in town. Sequestered in the mother's superior's quarters, Danila is approached by Father Xeno, a priest, and she attempts to seduce and fellate him. In his room, Father Xeno flagellates himself as penance. In a second attempt to exorcise Danila, Father Xeno is attacked by her with a chain, which she repeatedly whips him with. She begins to violently foam at the mouth upon seeing his crucifix. Father Xeno ultimately dies during the exorcism, but Danila is saved.

The site is under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India. The campus includes the stūpa itself and the Archaeological Museum. The important sculptures from the site are now in a number of museums in India and abroad; many are considerably damaged. The great majority of sculptures are in shallow relief, and the original sculptures do not include large iconic Buddha figures. The largest collections are the group in the Government Museum, Chennai, that in the Amaravati Archaeological Museum, and the group in the British Museum in London. Others are given below. Name of the site The name Amaravathi is relatively modern, having been applied to the town and site after the Amareśvara Liṅgasvāmin temple was built in the eighteenth century.South Indian languages do not distinguish aspirated and unaspirated consonants, thus Amarāvatī can appear as Amarāvathī, Ratana as Rathana, etc. The oldest maps and plans, drawn by Colin Mackenzie and dated 1816, label the stūpa simply as the deepaldimma or 'hill of lights'.For link to maps and plans at the British Library: The Amaravati Album The monument was not called a stūpa in ancient inscriptions, but rather the mahācetiya or great sanctuary.Pia Brancaccio, The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion (Leiden: Brill, 2011), p. 47. History The Stupa, or mahācetiya, was probably founded in the third century BCE in the time of Asoka but there is no decisive evidence for the foundation.Akira Shimada, Early Buddhist Architecture in Context The Great Stūpa at Amarāvatī (Ca. 300 BCE-300 CE). Leiden: Brill, 2013. The earliest inscription from the site belongs to the early centuries BCE but it cannot be assigned to Aśoka with certainty.See Harry Falk, Aśokan Sites and Artefacts: A Source-Book with Bibliography (Mainz: Von Zabern, 2006). The main construction phases of Amaravati fall in two main periods, with the additions consisting of railings (vedikā) and carved slabs placed around the stūpa proper. These slabs are usually called 'drum slabs' because they were placed round the base of the stūpa which has a shape similar to a circular drum.Akira Shimada, Early Buddhist Architecture in Context The Great Stūpa at Amarāvatī (Ca. 300 BCE-300 CE). Leiden: Brill, 2013. In the early period (circa 200-100 BCE), the stūpa had a simple railing consisting of granite pillars, with plain cross-bars, and coping stones. The coping stones with youths and animal reliefs, the early drum slabs, and some other early fragments belong to this period. The stūpa must have been fairly large at this time, considering the size of the granite pillars (some of which are still seen in situ, following excavations). The late period of construction started around ca. 50 BCE and continued until circa 250 CE. This period is divided into three phases by Akira Shimada on the basis of the dates that can be assigned to parts of the great limestone railing. The first phase is 50-1 CE, and the same period as the Sanchi stūpa I gateways. The second phase is 50-100 CE, the same period as Karli caitya and the Pandavleni Caves (no. 3 and 10) at Nasik. The third phase is circa 200-250 CE based on comparisons with Nagarjunakonda sculpture. Some other types of sculpture of belong to an even later time, about the seventh or eighth centuries, and include standing Bodhisattvas and goddesses. Amaravātī continued to be active after this time, probably to about the thirteenth century. Recovery Reconstruction of the Amaravati Stupa by Walter Elliott, 1845.Amaravati: The Art of an early Buddhist Monument in context. PdF Plan of the Amaravati Stupa as sketched by Colin Mackenzie in 1816. Westerners were first alerted to the ruins of the Stupa at Amaravati after a visit in 1797 by Major Colin Mackenzie.Buddha, ancientindia.co.uk, retrieved 19 December 2013 On the right bank of the Krishna River in the Andhra district of southeast India, Mackenzie came across a huge Buddhist construction built of bricks and faced with slabs of limestone.Amravati, PilgrimTrips, retrieved 12 January 2014 By the time he returned in 1816, indiscriminate excavations had already destroyed what remained of the structure and many of the bricks had been reused to build local houses. Mackenzie carried out further excavations, recorded what he saw and drew a plan of the stupa.Government Museum Website Government Museum homepage (and then click on \\"Archaeology\\", Chennai Museum, Tamil Nadu, retrieved 11 January 2014 In 1845, Sir Walter Elliot of the Madras Civil Service explored the area around the stupa and excavated near the west gate of the railing, removing many sculptures to Madras (now Chennai). They were kept outside the local college before being transported to the Madras Museum. At this time India was run by the East India Company and it was to that company that the curator of the museum appealed. The curator Dr Edward Balfour was concerned that the artefacts were deteriorating so in 1853 he started to raise a case for them to be moved. Excavation of the south gate of the stupa by J.G. Horsfall in 1880. By 1855, he had arranged for both photographs and drawings to be made of the artifacts, now called the Elliot Marbles. 75 photographs taken by Captain Linnaeus Tripe are now in the British Library. The sculptures were exported to London in 1859. Robert Sewell made further excavations in the 1880s, recording his excavations in some detail with drawings and sketches but not in the detail that would now be expected. Plans have also been put in place to create a purpose built exhibition space for the sculptures still in India. Those marbles not in an air-conditioned store were said to show signs of damage from the atmosphere and salt. The Chennai museum has plans for an air-conditioned gallery to install the sculptures, but these goals have yet to be realised. Sculptures The region between the Krishna and Godavari rivers was an important place for Buddhism from the 2nd century BCE onwards. A Buddhist stupa was built during the reign of Ashoka in 200 BCE, carved with panels that tell the story of Buddha. The story of the sculptures, including their discovery, misuse and destruction and subsequent preservation and distribution to various museums (Chennai, Calcutta, London, Masulipatnam etc.) has been poignantly described by Shimada.Early Buddhist Architecture in Context: The Great Stūpa at Amarāvatī (ca. 300 BCE-300 CE) by Akira Shimada, Brill, 2012, 322 pages; , 9789004233263 During the period of the decline of Buddhism, this stupa was neglected and was buried under rubble. A 14th-century inscription in Sri Lanka mentions repairs made to the stupa, and after that it was forgotten. The stupa is related to the Vajrayana teachings of Kalachakra, still practiced today in Tibetan Buddhism.Kilty, G Ornament of Stainless Light, Wisdom 2004, The Dalai Lama of Tibet conducted a Kalachakra initiation at this location in 2006. Distribution of the Edicts of Ashoka\\"India: The Ancient Past\\" p.113, Burjor Avari, Routledge, Art historians regard the art of Amaravati as one of the three major styles or schools of ancient Indian art, the other two being the Mathura style, and the Gandharan style. The Amaravati school of art had great influence on art in Sri Lanka and South-East Asia. It also had influence over South Indian sculpture. The Chinese traveller and Buddhist monk Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang) visited Amaravati in 640 CE, stayed for sometime and studied 'Abhidhammapitakam'. Xuanzang wrote a glorious account of the place, Viharas and monasteries that existed.Travels of Xuanzang File:Amaravati Stupa relief at Museum.jpg  Relief from the side of the stūpa, now at the Government Museum in Chennai File:Buddha Preaching in Tushita Heaven.

Guimet Museum, Paris = Amaravati School = A different type of art form evolved and flourished in Amaravati for nearly six centuries, commencing from 200-100 BCE. Patronized first by the Satavahanas and later by the Ikshvakus and other groups (feudatories, officials, and merchants), four periods of activity are easily discernible. The Amaravati school of art occupies a pre-eminent position in the history of Indian Art. With its beginning in 3rd century BCE, the Amaravati unfolds its chapters through the galaxy of sculptural wealth that once adorned the Mahachaitya - the majestic monument of the Buddhists situated here with its history extending over a period of a millennium and a half. The Colin Mackenzie album This album of drawings of Amarāvatī is a landmark in the history of archaeology in India. The pictures were made in 1816 and 1817 by a team of military surveyors and draftsmen under the direction of Colonel Colin Mackenzie (1757-1821), the first Surveyor-General of India. The album contains maps, plans and drawings of sculpture from the stūpa at Amarāvatī. The album is preserved in the British Library, where it is online,link to the British Library album with a second copy in Kolkata.

She was most known for a debate speech made days before her death which resulted in passage of a proposal to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. She was posthumously inducted into the inaugural group of women honored by the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame. Biography =Early years= Aloysius Larch-Miller was born on September 27, 1886, in Tennessee to Ellen (née Burke) and George Larch-Miller. The family moved to Oklahoma Territory after the 1900 census, but prior to Larch-Miller's sister, Genevieve's marriage in 1905, taking up residence in Shawnee, Pottawatomie County. =Work for women's suffrage= Larch-Miller became involved in the work of the Red Cross during the First World War. She was secretary of the county Red Cross organization and county chairman for the Third Liberty Loan. Larch-Miller worked with the Oklahoma suffrage movement, calling the first mass meeting of suffragettes in Oklahoma and served as chair of women's petitions. In 1919, she was authorized by the State Board of Education to supervise the addition of nursing training to the state normal schools. Oklahoma voters passed a suffrage bill in November 1918, prior to the vote on the federal amendment, but a provision of the state law prohibited women from holding state office. When the US congress passed the voting amendment, Governor Robertson agreed to hold a special session to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment, if the women could get the attendants to come to the session at their own expense. In October, 1919, Larch-Miller, who was heading the ratification committee, and a delegation of suffragists secured a majority of support and attempted to meet with the governor to have him call the special session. He refused to meet with them to accept their list of supporters. =Death= In February, 1920, Larch-Miller, though sick with influenza, attended a county convention debate over ratification. She succeeded in defeating her rival's arguments and secured the convention's agreement to adopt the resolution by a 2 to 1 margin; however, she succumbed to her illness and died the following day.

Early life  Kein Cross was born in Dallas, Texas. Spent his early childhood at his family home in Bentonville, Arkansas. His father was in the military and Cross's mother was an artist who was constantly on the move, which meant he was enrolled in 17 different schools before he graduated from High School. \\"What better stew pot for a future display artist than a mother whose gift is tricking the eye, although it’s possible Mr. Cross’s gift for display was something he was born with: as a 6-year-old boy, he was already rearranging the furniture\\". Kein's love of black & white stripes was apparent from an early age. At the age of 5, he begged his grandmother, a “Southern belle” whose trade was dressmaking, to make him a black & white striped suit complete with a matching hat. Cross attributes his love of fashion to his grandmother's skills Apart from Fashion and black & white stripes, young Cross had an insatiable fascination with all things French. At the age of 3, his parents bought a Citroen sports car with 3 wheels, which was something quite rare in rural Arkansas, and he was struck by the car's \\"exoticism\\". This signalled the beginning of his journey to become the \\"number 1 Francophile\\". One day after school, Cross returned home with a book titled How To Speak French, which slightly perturbed his parents, but their lack of enthusiasm couldn't quell his interest in the language, the country and its culture.  Life & Career  During Cross's working life, he has held a number of different jobs. His first job after leaving school was working at an abattoir, which he says gave him the motivation needed to find something he was truly interested in. He soon moved to New York City to pursue a career in fashion and design. = New York = Cross moved to the design capital, New York City. After arriving in the New York, Kein found a job designing window displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He then worked as a window-display designer for both Barneys New York and Henri Bendel in the mid-1980s. Eager to return to the world of interiors, Cross opened Cross & Spellen Home, a modern furniture and home-decoratives store, with Spellen. Ultimately, Cross wanted to work for himself, and so in 1992, Cross branched out on his own with La Maison Moderne Interiors, an interior-design business, and La Maison Moderne, his chic two-story home furnishings boutique at 144 West 19th Street, \\"pioneering the Chelsea location before it became fashionable\\". At La Maison Moderne, clients didn't just shop; they enjoyed sparkling champagne or fresh coffee while perusing the wares at either end of his spiral staircase. His two-pronged operation was a consistent success during its eleven-year run, receiving well-deserved attention from thousands of clients as well as media including: The New York Times, Architectural Digest, New York Magazine, Town & Country, Condé Nast Traveler, Elle Décor, British Vogue, In Style, W, Women's Wear Daily, and Esquire. Eventually, the success of these ventures made it possible to open more outlets and turn the brand into a chain. Living in Paris has been his dream since he was 21. \\"I was going to live in New York for a year, then move to Paris\\", he says. \\"It got delayed 26 or 27 years.\\" = Paris = \\"My former assistant, had bought a house in Marrakesh with his boyfriend, and he was talking about moving there\\", Cross says. \\"Last September, I was in Paris ...

The exterior was battered and marred by a bricked-up window; the kitchen had an old water heater that \\"stuck out like a sore thumb\\", and the bathroom was \\"grubby\\".

Atlanta University was, at that time, employing white and black teachers and included students of both races (many of the white students were children of white faculty). In 1889, Georgia Legislator W. C. Glenn introduced what would be passed as the Glenn Bill to mandate that all educational facilities be segregated by race, but to also create normal schools for African Americans. While this bill was supported by some black leaders, including AME bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Hershaw was very vocal against it.\\"A Bill to Establish Colored Normal Schools in Georgia Rouses Negro Wrath\\".

Charleston News and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina). page 5 In July 1889, Hershaw told an audience of blacks that education was of higher quality in the North than in the South, spoke highly of the influence of northern ideas on the Chautaqua School in Lithia Springs, Georgia, and of the positive effect of Northern capital and engineering in the South. This speech offended Colonel W. S. Thompson and Judge William Roberson Hammond of the Board of Education in the City of Atlanta, and the pair had Hershaw fired.

Washington sent his assistant, New York Customs Agent Charles W. Anderson to suggest action against the radicals to Roosevelt. Anderson opposed the idea of Niagara movement members holding federal jobs and suggested to the president that Hershaw was responsible for the problems in the press and that Hershaw should be demoted.Jacqueline M. Moore, Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920 University of Virginia Press, 1999, p. 154 Roosevelt sent Anderson to the Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock, and requested the secretary reduce Hershaw's rank or transfer him to a disagreeable job.Jacqueline M.

From 1893 to 1896, Hershaw served under Secretary of the Interior M. Hoke Smith, and the pair continued a relationship after Smith's term ended. Hershaw knew and became friends with Woodrow Wilson when Wilson was a struggling lawyer in Atlanta. Wilson opposed segregation of Hershaw from white members of the Civil Service during the implementation of that policy in 1913. In 1925, Hershaw was promoted to Assistant Law Examiner, the highest position held up to that time by a black man in the Land Office.\\"Negro Promoted\\". Broad Ax (Chicago).

Washington presented a speech that came to be known as the Atlanta Exposition Speech or the Atlanta Compromise Speech. This outlined Washington's conservative approach and came to represent a compromise in the South of black education and due process in exchange for white political rule. In Washington, D.C., intellectual groups held a number of meetings where the speech was discussed and debated. At meetings of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society, the Shiloh Baptist Lyceum, and elsewhere, Hershaw supported Washington. While some claimed Washington spoke of blacks having a low menial position in the history of the nation, Hershaw claimed that the speech was \\"logical, instructive, and sensible\\" and focused on the portion of the speech which \\"advised harmony and friendly relations between the races\\".\\"Discussed Mr. Washington's Speech\\".

In that address, Miller spoke of the advancement of blacks. In an editorial reply, Charles Remond Douglass saw the argument as similar to those of Booker T. Washington that black people must show through their achievements that they deserve their position in civilization. This offended the son of the famous escaped slave and radical black rights activist Frederick Douglass.\\"Miller's Castle Shelled.

Exceptions Taken to Maj. Douglass' Strictures upon the Address of Prof. Kelly Miller\\". The Colored American, Washington, D.C., July 9, 1898 After a few more editorials, Douglass recognized that the remainder of Miller's address clarified the issue and the real problem lay in the excerpt by the newspaper, The Washington Post, which only included the offensive paragraph which minimized the value of blacks.Douglass did take offense to Hershaw's tone, but the dispute seemed to have died out afterwards, \\"Douglass in Judgment.

Evening Star (Washington, D.C.). page 10 Hershaw returned to Atlanta in 1898 to present his work at the Third Atlanta Conference, an important conference on the subject of civil rights and black life in America and run by W. E. B. DuBois. This was among the earliest intellectual interactions between Hershaw and the civil rights giant. And in 1899, he concluded that black rights organizations were spreading themselves too thin and they should focus more on one single thing.\\"The Congressional Lyceum. an Interesting Address by Mr. Hershaw\\".

May 23, 1903. Volume 22 Issue 50 Page 1 where members of the club gave talks on black history. At that speech at the Second Baptist Lyceum, Hershaw quotes with great admiration W. E. B. Du Bois famous line that \\"the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line\\" before presenting an argument that hews closely to the ideas of Du Bois: the equality of blacks and whites, the importance of political and civil equality rather than simply industrial opportunity, the illegitimacy of \\"Jim Crow Cars\\", and against compromise. While this did not represent an irreparable split from Washington, it did signify an increased affinity between Hershaw and the Bethel Society and W. E. B. Du Bois.While ultimately, Hershaw was a supporter of Du Bois in the conflict between the pair, Hershaw continued to interact with Washington, for instance visiting the Tuskegee Institute in 1914 and praising Washington's work there: \\"Tuskegee Institute \\"Stupendous\\".

Du Bois Du Bois c. 1911 As a prominent member of D.C. literary and activist circles, Hershaw frequently presented papers and speeches regarding the sociology, economics, and history of blacks. In the late spring of 1905, he traveled to Atlanta to participate in the Tenth Atlanta Conference, a conference put on by W. E. B. Du Bois and one in which he had participated before. Thus, on May 30, 1905, he was a presenter at the tenth anniversary meeting of what was called the Atlanta Conference to study the Negro problems at Atlanta University with the theme Methods and Results. The conference was presided by university president Horace Bumstead and W. E. B. Du Boise was corresponding secretary. Tougaloo College President Frank G Woodworth, and General Education Board of Hampton member W. T. B. Williams. Women's meetings were addressed by Frances Kellor, Mary Ovington, and Butler Wilson.

The meeting saw Du Bois elected general secretary of the movement, George H. Jackson of Cincinnati as general treasurer and Dubois, William H. Richards, B. S. Smith, William Monroe Trotter, and William H. H. Hart signed the official statement of the movement and Hershaw was among the twenty nine African Americans who attended.\\"Negroes Address the Nation a New Movement Started\\".

The meeting was welcomed by Storer College president Henry T. McDonald and was marked by reports by Niagara Movement state secretaries. Hershaw's speech, as well as that of C. E. Bently, George W. Mitchell, Byron Gunner, O. M. Waller, and C. G. Morgan were noted as especially strong. Hershaw also read an address to the country urging political action.\\"Second Annual Meeting of the Niagara Movement Noticeable. Dubois Re-Elected General Secretary\\". Savannah Tribune (Savannah, Georgia). September 1, 1906. Volume XXI Issue 48 Page 3 While the Niagara movement was marked by its opposition to the attitude of compromise of Booker T. Washington, Washington was still an important scholar, and he was invited to give a talk about Frederick Douglass to a meeting of the Pen and Paper club, now led by Henry P. Slaughter with Hershaw still an officer.\\"In Memory of Douglass\\". Washington Bee (Washington, D.C.) February 24, 1906. Volume XXV Issue 39 Page 1 However, Hershaw ultimately found himself on Du Bois' side in the dispute. He denied Du Bois or himself having any animosity towards Washington, but spoke against Washington's relationship with his \\"Masters and myrmidons ... sponsors and retainers\\". Washington's supporters saw Du Bois and Hershaw as elitists and sentimental in comparison to Washington's practicality and at least in part characterized the dispute in rural versus urban terms.\\"No Headline\\". Evening Star (Washington, D.C.). October 26, 1906. Page 4 Ultimately, Hershaw's devotion to Du Bois put Hershaw on an \\"enemies list\\" in Washington's personal correspondence in the early 1900s which began with William M. Trotter, Archibald Grimké, George Forbes, and Clement G. Morgan, but eventually included Hershaw, Judson Lyons, Francis James Grimké, Napoleon Marshall, and William Calvin Chase, all Du Bois supporters,Benjamin R Justesen, Broken Brotherhood: The Rise and Fall of the National Afro-American Council. SIU Press, April 3, 2008 =The Horizon= In order to publicize the views of the movement, Du Bois, Hershaw, and F. H. M. Murray began publication of the magazine, The Horizon. The journal was published from 1907 to 1910; Murray was printer and Du Bois and Hershaw were co-editors W. M. Sinclair and William Monroe Trotter were noted as other key players in the movement and involved in the magazine.Freeman (Indianapolis, Indiana). June 29, 1907 Volume XX Issue 25 Page 3 The Horizon's scope went beyond black rights, and here and elsewhere Hershaw was vocal about women's rights and a supporter of suffrage for black women. Hershaw's most frequent contribution to Horizon was a column called \\"The Out-Look\\", a view of the black experience from the perspective of the white world, while Murray contributed \\"The In-Look\\" about the black experience from the view of black and the black press and Du Bois wrote \\"The Over-Look\\" about any issue in the black experience he felt necessary. Hershaw's \\"The Out-Look\\" has been called the \\"least coherent and least memorable of the three sections\\".Tom Pendergast. Creating the Modern Man: American Magazines and Consumer Culture, 1900-1950. University of Missouri Press, 2000, page 93 The paper was not always in perfect harmony, and Hershaw and Murray frequently fought over material to be included in the \\"Horizon\\".

Going beyond black civil rights, in The Horizon Hershaw was vocal about women's rights and a supporter of suffrage for black women. =NAACP= After the departure of Trotter, the Niagara movement declined. In 1909, Moorfield Storey, Mary White Ovington, and Du Bois called for the formation of a new body, leading to the formation of the National Negro Committee (the Committee of 40) on May 31, 1909, which included Hershaw.Bernie Morris Evans.

Volume XXXI Issue 41 Page 4 and the group would create a branch of the association in Washington, D.C., which was one of the largest and most powerful branches. Hershaw played an important role in the local and national NAACP.In 1914 he gave a talk on \\"The Civil War and the Colored Man\\" in the sixth annual meeting in Baltimore on May 3, 4, and 5: \\"The Sixth Annual Meeting of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\\".

Volume XXVI Issue 41 Page 7 Washington, D.C., branch In April 1912, Archibald Grimké led the organization of a D.C. branch of the NAACP, with Hershaw an officer. Federal government desegregation was one of its first goals. In 1913, racial segregation in the federal government was often not publicly well known. Hershaw and Thomas H. R. Clarke managed to collect data to publicize the extent of the segregation in the federal government.Moore 1999, p. 203 However, segregation continued to worsen over the following two decades.Harold Ickes, The secret diary of Harold L.

Editors David Desrimais and Mathieu Cénac of the Jean Boîte Éditions publishing company created software that simultaneously collected the first occurrences of every word in a Google Image Search. Their goal was to produce an inventory of Google’s visual representation of all words at a single time.

The book is a representation of the intrinsic themes of the Digital Era.

It should not be confused with the on the Place de la République, which houses the administrative functions of the prefect. History This grand hôtel particulier, of a different design than most in Strasbourg (featuring a straight and a crescent-shaped façade instead of two straight ones), was built between 1732 and 1736 for the royal moneylender (prêteur royal) François- Joseph de Klinglin (1686–1753). The architects were Jean-Pierre Pflug and Joseph Massol. After Klinglin's disgrace and imprisonment in 1752, the hôtel became the seat of the royal Intendancy of Alsace, which it remained until the French Revolution. Between 1789 and 1799, it was used as the seat of the Directoire du district and since 1800, it has served as the residency of the prefect of Bas-Rhin, with two intervals: between 1871 and 1918, it housed the Statthalter (governor) of Alsace-Lorraine and between 1940 and 1944, the Gauleiter. During the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870, the hôtel was heavily damaged by Prussian artillery: the exterior walls withstood but the roof collapsed and almost all the interiors were destroyed. It was rapidly rebuilt and refurnished using as much original material as possible; only the shape of the roof was modified and a balcony added. The architect responsible for the reconstruction was , who also faithfully rebuilt the opera house nearby. The Hôtel du préfet is not open for tourists apart on special days such as European Heritage Days.

Another brother, Thomas, was born in 1828; a sister, Anne, in 1830; another brother, Frederick Buel, in 1832; and another brother, Walter Simonds Jr., in 1835. Franklin attended several private schools as a youth before completing his education at York County Academy, a prep school. Early naval career On February 18, 1841, Franklin enlisted at the age of 15 in the United States Navy as a midshipman. As the United States Naval Academy would not be established until 1844, \\"midshipmen were left to educate themselves and one another. Their schools were held in receiving ships and cruising vessels, in the midst of a thousand interruptions and impediments, which render[ed] the whole system of little or no value.\\" He was assigned to the of the Pacific Squadron, serving aboard her until 1843. The United States believed war was imminent with Mexico, and the commander of the Pacific Squadron had standing orders to seize the Mexican Pacific port city of Monterey in Alta California (now part of the U.S. state of California). Hearing a false report that war had broken out, the Pacific Squadron left Lima, Peru, and seized Monterey without a fight October 19–20, 1842. At the time, the United States had no ports on the Pacific coast of North America, and naval vessels relied on storeships—naval vessels loaded with supplies and fresh water which sat, stationary, at sea. About June 1844, Franklin left the United States to serve aboard the storeship . Antebellum naval advancement In late 1844, at his own request, Franklin joined the sloop-of-war . The ship spent some months cruising the North Pacific and the coast of Central America, and Franklin and some of his fellow sailors took several days to explore the interior of Nicaragua near the port city of El Realejo. When the Mexican–American War broke out in the spring of 1846, the Levant joined the Pacific Squadron and sailed to Monterey again. Franklin took part in the landing party which captured the city (uncontested) on July 7. The Levant was ordered to return to the United States shortly thereafter. The ship arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on April 28, 1847. Although Franklin could have joined the Class of 1847 immediately, it would have left him just two months to prepare for his examination. He therefore decided to put off entrance at the Naval Academy until October, and spent the months of July, August, and September at home in York, Pennsylvania. Upon his entry to the Naval Academy, on August 10, 1847, Franklin was promoted to \\"passed midshipman\\". Instruction lasted nine months, and Franklin passed. He was assigned to the Coast Survey, which he joined in mid-July 1848. The survey team spent the autumn months surveying the coast beginning at Cape Henlopen, Delaware; moving south to the tip of the Delmarva Peninsula; and up and down the east and west coasts of Chesapeake Bay. The winter was spent in quarters in Washington, D.C., and survey work resumed in the spring of 1849. In mid-spring 1849, Franklin was ordered to leave the Coast Survey and report to the razeed , then being fitted out in Norfolk as the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron. The Independence sailed for the Mediterranean Sea on July 26, 1849. After an uneventful three-year cruise, the ship returned to Norfolk in June 1852 and was sent to drydock in New York City, where she arrived on July 3, 1852. Franklin was given three months' leave, but was ordered to report to the sloop-of-war for another three-year cruise of the Mediterranean before it was up. Before the Saranac sailed, however, Franklin's ordered were changed and he was assigned to the . The Dolphin was to cruise the northern Atlantic Ocean, taking deep-sea soundings to determine whether a subsurface ridge, plateau, or mount existed on which an undersea telegraph cable might be laid. In March 1853, the Dolphin made port at Norfolk, and Franklin was assigned to the Coast Survey again. He helped survey the coast around Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Sandy Hook, New Jersey; and along New England in the fall of 1853, wintered in Washington, D.C., again, and in the spring of 1854 worked around Nantucket Shoals off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. In October 1854, Franklin was reassigned to the Naval Academy, where he served as a disciplinary officer in the Executive Department. He was promoted to Master on April 18, 1855. Unhappy acting as a spy on midshipmen, he requested a transfer to the Department of Ethics and English Studies, which was granted in the fall of 1855. He was promoted to Lieutenant on September 14, 1855, making his naval rank commensurate with his instructor's status. At the end of the fall term of 1856, Franklin was assigned to the . The Falmouth was in drydock, and did not relaunch until January 12, 1857. She was assigned to the Brazil Squadron, an understrength group of vessels patrolling the coast of South America from Venezuela to the Falkland Islands with the goal of protecting American shipping, indicting the West African slave trade, and protect American interests in the emerging region. During this time, the Falmouth participated in the Paraguay expedition, and cruised the Paraná River and Río de la Plata until April 1859. The Falmouth then returned to New York City on May 19, 1859, and was decommissioned. After three months of leave, Franklin was assigned in September 1859 to the Ordnance Department of the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. After a few months, he was transferred to the U.S. Naval Observatory across town. Neither duty involved any training or experience; officers were expected to pick up knowledge on their own, and Franklin strongly disliked the work. He left the Observatory in mid-1860 and took several months' leave again. Civil War duty In late 1860, Franklin was assigned to the sloop-of-war . The ship was part of the Home Squadron, which patrolled the East Coast and Gulf Coast, suppressing piracy and the slave trade and assisting ships in distress. Franklin set sail from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the Macedonian on January 12, 1860. The American Civil War was on the verge of breaking out, and secessionists had seized the harbor at Pensacola, Florida. The ship stopped at the U.S. Navy base at Key West, Florida, and the Dry Tortugas. While at the Dry Tortugas, Franklin met Lieutenant Colonel Montgomery C. Meigs, then somewhat furtively taking stock of the various United States ports, forts, and harbors in the Deep South with an eye toward holding them if war broke out. Meanwhile, with the end of the Mexican-American War in 1847, Mexico had slid further into turmoil. With foreign intervention looming and a possible civil war, the Navy ordered the Macedonian to depart for the Mexican city of Veracruz to monitor events in that nation. Arriving at Veracruz, Franklin remained with the ship for some months before the Macedonian began patrolling the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. She received orders to sail for the Boston Navy Yard, reaching Massachusetts on January 16, 1862. =Battle of Hampton Roads= With the Civil War raging, Franklin was ordered back to the Washington Navy Yard, where he assisted in outfitting the gunboat . He was then assigned as the Executive Officer of the , and rushed to Fort Monroe at Hampton Roads, Virginia. Because the Dacotah was still at sea, Franklin took up quarters aboard the . While Franklin waited, the Confederate States Navy completed construction of the ironclad warship CSS Virginia. Development and construction of the warship was widely reported in the North, which was deeply alarmed. On March 4, 1862, the Virginia was declared ready for combat. On March 8, the Virginia was towed down the Elizabeth River to engage the Union Navy fleet which awaited her: The Roanoke, , , , and . The Roanoke and the Minnesota were both steamships, and the most powerful warships in the Union naval squadron. But Roanoke's main shaft had been damaged four months earlier, and a replacement shaft was delayed due to the crush of wartime production orders. Instead, she relied on steam tugboats and her sails for maneuverability. Roanoke's captain, John Marston, was acting commander of the flotilla. The Virginia entered Hampton Roads at 1:30 PM, and by 2:20 PM had engaged the Cumberland. The Roanoke passed the Rip Raps (a small, man-made island in the harbor's mouth) about the same time, she and her three tugs struggling against the current. As she passed Sewell's Point, Confederate shore batteries fired on her. She returned fire, but her gun was too weak to reach them in return. By 2:55 PM, Virginia had critically injured Congress, and 10 minutes later rammed Cumberland. After being bombarded by Virginia, Cumberland sank at 3:25 PM. Minnesota ran firmly aground at 3:10 PM, and St. Lawrence at 5:30 PM. Roanoke withdrew at 4:10 PM. She ran aground on a shoal about 4:30 PM, although the tide lifted her off again a few minutes later, and she returned to Fort Monroe and the safety of the Union shore guns. By 5:45 PM, Congress had surrendered and was afire, and Virginia shelled both the Minnesota and St. Lawrence. But darkness began to fall, and the Confederate ship retreated to Sewell's Point for the night. At 9:00 PM, the dropped anchor beside Minnesota. When the battle began again at about 8:30 AM on March 9, the only two ships to engage in active battle were the Virginia and Monitor (although the Minnesota, still aground, fired shots to defend herself). =Dacotah= The Roanoke departed for New York City after the battle, leaving Franklin ashore for a few days until the Dacotah arrived. The ship was assigned to the North Atlantic Blocking Squadron, serving in the waters off Hampton Roads as part of the Union blockade of the Confederacy. On May 18 and 19, 1862, Franklin and the Dacotah participated in an exchange of gunfire with Confederate shore batteries at Sewell's Point. He witnessed the scuttling and burning of the Virginia on May 11, 1862, and cruised to New Orleans, Louisiana, to deliver messages before returning Hampton Roads in late June. The Dacotah then joined the James River Flotilla, destroying forts along the James River. =Aroostook= In June 1862, Franklin was appointed commander of the . Franklin was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on July 16. On August 31, the James River Flotilla was disbanded on the orders of Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, and Aroostook was assigned to the Potomac Flotilla, which was based at the Washington Navy Yard. After the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, largely ended the Confederate threat to the national capital, Franklin was ordered to take Aroostook to the Gulf of Mexico and join the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Arriving October 22, she joined the forces blockading Mobile Bay, Alabama. Franklin saw his first extensive action while with the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Her first major action occurred on the night of December 15, when she gave chase to a blockade runner attempting to flee. Although Aroostook lost sight of the ship, the next day they discovered the schooner stranded on shoals and aflame. In another action on March 5, 1863, Aroostook and another Union vessel destroyed the blockade runner SS Josephine. Aroostook attempted to intercept a small blockade runner on the night of March 6, but it escaped them and made it into Mobile Bay. Aroostook exchanged fire with shore batteries on April 19, captured the blockade runner SS Sea Lion on the evening of May 9, assisted in the capture of the SS Hunter on May 18, and again exchanged shore fire on June 23. At about 1:00 AM on July 17, Aroostook assisted in the capture of the SS James Battle. =Other Civil War duty= Franklin was relieved of command of Aroostook on July 28, 1863. He claims that he was assigned command of the , but since only someone of a higher rank could command such a large ship, he was forced to relinquish his duty. With his old command of Aroostook already filled, he had no ready shipboard duty. Instead, the Navy assigned him to the staff of Commodore Henry H. Bell, Commander-in-Chief of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Bell was new to the job, Rear Admiral David Farragut having recently departed for consultations and a different command. Bell appointed Franklin his Fleet Captain (chief of staff to a flag officer). Farragut resumed command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in December 1863 and on January 19, 1864, his flagship (the ) anchored off Mobile Bay. Farragut relieved Franklin, appointing Captain Percival Drayton Fleet Captain in his stead. Franklin's new assignment was as Fleet Captain on the staff of Commodore James Shedden Palmer, senior officer of U.S. naval forces on the Mississippi River in the vicinity of New Orleans. Admiral Farragut then won the Battle of Mobile Bay, but the city of Mobile did not surrender. Farragut asked to be relieved of command to take up other duties, and Palmer was appointed commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on November 17, 1864. When Palmer departed for the New York Navy Yard, Acting Rear Admiral Henry K. Thatcher was appointed commander of the squadron on February 23, 1865. Franklin remained on Thatcher's staff as Fleet Captain, and was the naval representative on the Union delegation which accepted the surrender of Mobile on April 12, 1865. The Civil War had effectively ended on April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. Franklin spent a few months in command of the off New Orleans, but relinquished his command after a few months and returned to Pennsylvania for several months' rest. Post-war duty =Shipboard commands= On February 5, 1866, Captain Robert Wainwright Scott of the died suddenly while the ship was at Acapulco, Mexico. Saginaw had spent the last six months of 1865 protecting American citizens and interests at various ports on Mexico's Pacific coast. Franklin traveled by ship to Panama, crossed the Isthmus of Panama by rail, and sailed to Acapulco to take up command of Saginaw. Saginaw reached San Francisco, California, in March 1866, and spent five months undergoing repairs at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She received orders to assist settlers in the Washington Territory, and said in August 1866 to Puget Sound. She then received orders to proceed to Esquimalt Harbour on Vancouver Island in Canada, where she spent several months assisting the Western Union in laying a telegraph cable across the Bering Strait. She returned to Mare Island in December 1866. Franklin was promoted to Commander on July 25 or September 26, 1866 (sources differ as to the date). Shortly after his return to Mare Island, Franklin was appointed Inspector of Ordnance at Mare Island. In late 1868 or early 1869, he was given command of the sllop- of-war . Mohican had been decommissioned on April 3, 1868, but was undergoing refit and recommissioning. She launched again on June 7, 1869, and Franklin was ordered to take a scientific party to Siberia so it could observe a solar eclipse. Sailing east across the Pacific, Franklin returned to Esquimalt Harbour, where he was instructed to set sail on October 11 for Hawaii. Franklin met King Kamehameha V of the Kingdom of Hawaii, as well as the future queen, Liliuokalani. Mohican returned to Mare island on January 11, 1870. Franklin was assigned to equipment duty at Mare Island upon his return, and served in that capacity until mid 1872. He was ordered back east to the newly constructed New London Naval Station in Connecticut. He served at new London from July to September 1872, during which time he was promoted to Captain on August 13, 1872. He was transferred to the Washington Navy Yard in September 1872, serving there until December. After two months' leave, he was appointed Executive Office of the New London Naval Station, returning to duty there on March 1, 1873. Franklin was then given command of the in April 1873, and appointed chief of staff to Rear Admiral Augustus Case. He sailed on a civilian ship for the United Kingdom and spent time visiting London before sailing to France and touring Paris. He then traveled overland to Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Mediterranean coast of France, where he joined the Wabash. Franklin cruised the Mediterranean Sea until November 30, 1873, he received orders to head for Key West, Florida. The Virginius Affair had caused a war scare between the United States and Spain, and Wabash headed for Florida in case the Navy needed ships to invade Cuba. Wabash arrived in Key West on January 3, 1874. She never left port again, and was decommissioned on April 25, 1874. Admiral Case's flag was transferred to the , and Franklin won the Navy's permission to command the vessel and resume his Mediterranean duties. When Admiral Case retired, Franklin was named chief of staff to his successor, Rear Admiral John Lorimer Worden. Franklin had been decommissioned in 1871, but was recommissioned on December 15, 1873. Franklin departed Key West on April 11, 1874, and after an uneventful tour of duty she sailed for Norfolk, arriving on September 14, 1876. =Shore duties= After a brief tenure as the Executive Officer of the Gosport Naval Yard in Norfolk, Virginia, during which time he was President of the Board for Promotion of Officers, Franklin spent similarly short periods of time as the Executive Officer of the New London Naval Station and then the Washington Navy Yard. In 1877, he was assigned as a hydrographer to the United States Hydrographic Office, and on June 1, 1878, was appointed by the President of the United States to a one-year term on the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. (He spent the last six months of 1880 on leave.) At the end of 1880, Franklin was assigned to special duty in the Bureau of Equipment in the Navy Department. He was promoted to Commodore on May 28, 1881, and in 1882 appointed to the Board of Visitors of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was named the board's president in June. On June 16, 1883, he was appointed President of the Board of Examiners again. His duty station changed when in February 1884 he was appointed Superintendent of the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. =Final duties= Franklin now had just three and a half years of service remaining before retirement, and fully expected to serve out his remaining years at the Naval Observatory. But on January 24, 1885, he was promoted to rear admiral, and from May 7 to May 28, 1885, he served as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy's Training Squadron, with his flagship aboard the . The following month he was named Commander-in-Chief of the European Squadron. He assumed his duties on June 10, 1885, serving aboard the Pensacola until his retirement in August 1887. Franklin retired from the Navy on August 24, 1887, at the age of 62. According to maritime historian Hans Van Tilburg, throughout his career Franklin was well liked and competent. But he was prone to sloth. Personal life On January 10, 1883, Franklin married Marion Sands, daughter of Rear Admiral Benjamin F. and Helen M. ( French) Sands. Her maternal uncle was United States Army General William H. French. Marion had previously been married to Arthur Henry Dutton, a U.S. Army engineer and brevet brigadier general who died in battle in 1864. The Franklins never had children. Mrs. Franklin had a son, Arthur Henry Dutton, Jr., (born in 1864) from her previous marriage. Franklin converted to Roman Catholicism in 1880. Retirement and death Franklin lived in Washington, D.C., in retirement. He joined the Metropolitan Club, the Sons of the Revolution, the Washington Monument Society, the Memorial Society of the City of Washington, the Society of Foreign Wars, the Society of the Cincinnati, the Pennsylvnia Military Order, and the Chevy Chase Club. In February 1889, President Grover Cleveland appointed Franklin a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Marine Conference. When the conference met in Washington in October, Franklin was appointed its president on October 16. Franklin later sued the United States government over his remuneration for this event. The U.S. law establishing the conference allowed salaried military officers to be paid their expenses, but nothing more. Other delegates received $5,000 ($ in dollars). Franklin sued to gain his $5,000, but the United States Court of Claims held that his Navy pension qualified as salary, and denied relief. In 1898, Franklin authored a memoir, Memories of a Rear-Admiral Who Has Served for More Than Half a Century in the Navy of the United States. After several weeks of illness, Samuel Rhoads Franklin died at his home in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1909, of chronic kidney failure. His funeral was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
