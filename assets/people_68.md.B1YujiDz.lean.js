The Roman army was defeated and captured in its entirety by the Persian forces; for the first time, a Roman emperor was taken prisoner. As such, the battle is generally viewed as one of the worst disasters in Roman military history. Background and prelude Prior to the battle, Shapur I had penetrated several times deeply into Roman territory, conquering and plundering Antioch in Syria in 253 or 256. After defeating the usurper Aemilianus and assuming the power for himself, Valerian arrived in the eastern provinces as soon as he could (254 or 255) and gradually restored order.Potter 2004, p.254 Soon he had to confront a naval Gothic invasion in northern Asia Minor. The Goths ravaged Pontus and moved south into Cappadocia. An attempt from Valerian and his army in Antiocheia to intercept them failed because of the plague. While his army was in that weakened state, Shapur invaded northern Mesopotamia in 260, probably in early spring.Potter 2004, p.255  Battle  fine cameo showing an equestrian single combat (mard o mard) between Shapur I and Valerian in which the latter is seized, according to Shapur's own statement, \\"with our own hand\\" In his sixties, the aged Valerian marched eastward to the Sasanian borders. According to Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, Valerian met the main Persian army, under the command of Shapur I, between Carrhae and Edessa (in Middle Persian: Urhāy), with units from almost every part of the Roman Empire, together with Germanic allies,\\"... Valerian Caesar marched against us, and he had had with him, from [Magna] Germania (Germān-šahr), Raetia (Rešyā-šahr), Noricum (Nirkos-šahr), Dacia (Dākyā-šahr), Moesia (Mūsyā-šahr), Istria (Estriyā-šahr), Hispania (Espāniyā-šahr), Africa (Afrikiyā-šahr), Thracia (Trākyā-šahr), Bithynia (Butniyā-šahr), Asia (Āsiyā-šahr), Pamphylia (Pamfaliyā-šahr), Isauria (Esuriyā-šahr), Lycaonia (Lūkunyā-šahr), Galatia (Galātenyā-šahr), Cilicia (Kilikiyā-šahr), Cappadocia (Kappadukiyā-šahr), Phrygia (Frūgiyā- šahr), Syria (Sūriyā-šahr), Phoenicia (Funikiyā-šahr), Judaea (Jehūdiyā-šahr), Arabia (Arabiyā-šahr), Mauretania (Murin-šahr), Germania (Germānyā-šahr) [the province], Rhodes (Rodās-šahr), Osrhoene (Asenyos-šahr), and Mesopotamia (Meyānrōdān-šahr) an army of 70 000 men.\\" —Res Gestae Divi Saporis and was thoroughly defeated and captured with his entire army. According to Roman sources, which are not very clear, the Roman army was defeated and besieged by the Persian forces. Valerian subsequently tried to negotiate, but he was captured; it is possible that his army surrendered after that. The prisoners included, according to Shapur's claims, many other high-ranking officials, including a praetorian prefect,Potter 2004, p.256 possibly Successianus. It has also been claimed that Shapur went back on his word by having the emperor seized after agreeing to truce negotiations.David Vagi (2001) [Coinage and History of the Roman Empire: C 82 BC - AD 480: Vol. 1] [Routledge]Rum\\", Persian miniature from Shahnameh  Aftermath  There are varying accounts as to Valerian's fate following his capture at the hands of Shapur. Some scholars claim Shapur sent Valerian and some of his army to the city of Bishapur, where they lived in relatively good conditions. Shapur used the remaining soldiers in engineering and development plans, as the Romans were skilled tradesmen and artisans. Band-e Kaisar (Caesar's dam) is one of the remnants of Roman engineering located near the ancient city of Susa.Zarinkoob (1999), p. 195 According to another source (Lactantius), Shapur humiliated Valerian, using the former emperor as a human stepping-stool while mounting his horse. He was reportedly kept in cage and was humiliated for the Persian Emperor's pleasure, according to Aurelius Victor. Upon his death, Valerian's body was allegedly skinned and stuffed with, depending on which account, manure or straw, to produce a trophy of Roman submission preserved in a Persian temple. However, there are also accounts that stipulate he was treated with respect, and that allegations of torture may have been fabricated by Christian historians of the Late Antiquity to show the perils that befell persecutors of Christianity. Following Valerian's capture, Shapur took the city of Caesarea and deported some 400,000 of its citizens to the southern provinces of the Sassanian Empire.Paul Chrystal, Roman Military Disasters: Dark Days & Lost Legions, (Pen & Sword, 2015), 198. He then raided Cilicia, but he was finally repulsed by a Roman force that was rallied by Macrianus, Callistus and Odenathus of Palmyra. Valerian's defeat at Edessa became the catalyst for a series of revolts that would lead to the temporary fragmentation of the Roman Empire. In the East, Macrianus used his control of Valerian's treasury to proclaim his sons Macrianus Minor and Quietus as Emperors. Along the Danubian frontier, Ingenuus and Regalianus were also proclaimed Emperors. In the West, the Roman governor Postumus took advantage of Gallienus' distraction to murder the Imperial heir Saloninus and take control of what is now called the Gallic Empire.

He had previously served as the Governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007. Background Tinubu was born on 29 March 1952 in Osun State, Nigeria. His mother, Abibatu Mogaji( iyaloja of Lagos), Secondary school education Unknown He attended St. John's Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos and Children's Home School in Ibadan, South West of Nigeria. Tinubu then went to the United States in 1975, where he studied first at Richard J. Daley College in Chicago, Illinois, and then at Chicago State University. He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting.? Tinubu worked for the American companies Arthur Andersen, Deloitte, Haskins, & Sells, and GTE Services Corporation. After returning to Nigeria in 1983, Bola Tinubu joined Mobil Oil Nigeria, and later became an executive of the company. Early political career His political career began in 1992, when he joined the Social Democratic Party where he was a member of the Peoples Front faction led by Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and made up of other politicians such as Umaru Yar'Adua, Atiku Abubakar, Baba Gana Kingibe, Rabiu Kwankwaso, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila, Magaji Abdullahi, Dapo Sarumi and Yomi Edu. He was elected to the Senate, representing the Lagos West constituency in the short-lived Nigerian Third Republic. After the results of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections were annulled, Tinubu became a founding member of the pro-democracy National Democratic Coalition, a group which mobilized support for the restoration of democracy and recognition of Moshood Abiola as winner of the June 12 election. Following the seizure of power as military head of state of General Sani Abacha, he went into exile in 1994 and returned to the country in 1998 after the death of the military dictator, which ushered in the transition to the Fourth Nigerian Republic. In the run-up to the 1999 elections, Bola Tinubu was a protégé of Alliance for Democracy (AD) leaders Abraham Adesanya and Ayo Adebanjo. He went on to win the AD primaries for the Lagos State governorship elections in defeating Funsho Williams and Wahab Dosunmu, a former Minister of Works and Housing. In January 1999, he stood for the position of Governor of Lagos State on the AD ticket and was elected. Governor of Lagos State When he assumed office in May 1999, Tinubu promised 10,000 housing units for the poor with little achieved. During the eight-year period of his being in office, he made large investments in education in the state and also reduced the number of schools in the state by returning many schools to the already settled former owners. He also initiated new road construction, required to meet the needs of the fast-growing population of the state. Tinubu, alongside a new deputy governor, Femi Pedro, won re-election into office as governor in April 2003. All other states in the South West fell to the People's Democratic Party in those elections. He was involved in a struggle with the Olusegun Obasanjo-controlled federal government over whether Lagos State had the right to create new Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) to meet the needs of its large population. The controversy led to the federal government seizing funds meant for local councils in the state. During the latter part of his term in office, he was engaged in continuous clashes with PDP powers such as Adeseye Ogunlewe, a former Lagos State senator who had become minister of works, and Bode George, the southwest chairman of the PDP. Relations between Tinubu and deputy governor Femi Pedro became increasingly tense after Pedro declared his intention to run for the gubernatorial elections. Pedro competed to become the AC candidate for governor in the 2007 elections, but withdrew his name on the eve of the party nomination. He defected to the Labour Party while still keeping his position as deputy governor. Tinubu's tenure as Lagos State Governor ended on 29 May 2007, when his successor Babatunde Fashola of the Action Congress took office. Corruption In April 2007, after the elections but before Babatunde Fashola had taken office, the Federal Government brought Tinubu before the Code of Conduct Bureau for trial over the alleged illegal operation of 16 separate foreign accounts. In January 2009, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission cleared Tinubu and governors James Ibori of Delta State and Obong Victor Attah of Akwa Ibom State of charges of conspiracy, money laundering, abuse of office and official corruption in relation to a sale of V-mobile network shares in 2004. In March 2009, there were reports that a plot had been identified to kill Tinubu. The Alliance for Democracy called on the Inspector General of Police, Mike Okiro, to conduct a thorough investigation.In September 2009, however, there were reports that the British Metropolitan Police were investigating a transaction in which the Lagos State government made an investment in Econet (now Airtel). Tinubu said the transaction was straightforward and profitable to the state, with no intermediaries involved. The Federal Government rejected a request by Britain to release evidence needed for further investigation and prosecution of the three Nigerian ex-governors in a London court. Tinubu has been widely perceived as the \\"Godfather of Lagos\\", leveraging his political capital in the mega city-state to influence regional and national affairs. His role in pulling the strings of the mega city-state was exposed in The Lion of Bourdillion, a 2015 documentary film highlighting Tinubu's political and financial grip on the city-state. Tinubu filed a N150 billion libel suit against the producers, AIT, and the documentary stopped airing on 6 March 2015. Nonetheless, antecedents such as his overbearingness on successors such as in December 2009, when there were reports that Fashola and Tinubu had fallen out over the issue of Fashola's re-election in 2011, with Tinubu preferring the commissioner for environment, Muiz Banire. And a similar scuffle in 2015, over Fashola's successor pitting Tinubu against him who threw his full weight behind Akinwunmi Ambode, who later succeeded Fashola and was himself single-handedly ousted from office by Tinubu replacing him with incumbent Babajide Sanwo-Olu, all goes to show his unprecedented influence in the city-state. During the 2019 election, a bullion van was seen entering Tinubu's residence on Bourdillion Road in Ikoyi, with Tinubu claiming \\"I keep money anywhere I want\\".  Politics  In 2007, following the landslide victory of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in the April 2007 elections, Tinubu was active in negotiations to bring together the fragmented opposition parties into a \\"mega-party\\" capable of challenging the PDP. In February 2013, Tinubu's negotiations in creating a \\"mega opposition\\" party became paid off with the merger of Nigeria's three biggest opposition parties – the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new PDP (nPDP), a faction of serving governors of the then ruling People's Democratic Party – into the All Progressives Congress (APC). In 2014, Tinubu supported former military head of state General Muhammadu Buhari, leader of the CPC faction of the APC – who commanded widespread following in Northern Nigeria, and had previously contested in the 2003, 2007, and 2011 presidential elections as the APC presidential candidate. Tinubu initially wanted to become Buhari's vice presidential candidate but later conceded for Yemi Osibanjo, his ally and former commissioner of justice. In 2015, Buhari rode the APC to victory, ending the sixteen year rule of the PDP, and marking the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost to an opposition candidate. Tinubu has gone on to play an important role in the Buhari administration, supporting government policies and holding onto the internal party reins, in lieu of his long-held rumored presidential aspiration. In 2019, he supported Buhari's re-election campaign defeating the PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar. In 2020, following an internal party crisis which led to the removal of Tinubu ally and party chairman Adams Oshiomole, it is believed the move was to scuttle Tinubu's presidential prospects ahead of 2023. Personal life He is a Muslim.Tinubu is married to Oluremi Tinubu, the current Senator of the Lagos Central Senatorial District. His nephew, Adewale Tinubu is the CEO of Oando Plc. His mother, Chief Abibatu Mogaji, died on 15 June 2014 at the age of 96. On 31 October 2017, his son Jide Tinubu had a heart attack while in London and was later confirmed dead.

Biography Jean Huber was the son of Jacob Huber, a member of the \\"Two-Hundreds\\" council, and of Catherine Vasserot de Vincy. The family came from Schaffhausen originally and was admitted into the Geneva bourgeoisie in 1654. In 1738 Jean Huber entered the Hessel-Cassel military service in Prince Frederick's Grenadier regiment, then in 1741 he transferred to the Piedmont service where he fought with the rank of captain during the war of the Austrian Succession. In 1747 he married Marie-Louise Alléon-Guainieret. There were two sons: François Huber (1750–1831), the celebrated author of a work on bees, and Jean-Daniel, paysagiste and amateur engraver, and also one daughter named Madelaine. In 1752 Huber was made a member of the \\"Two-Hundreds\\" council. Jean Huber died in Lausanne in 1786. Painter and silhouettiste Huber started painting without having had any training. He was a talented observer, and his first works were of horses and scenes of hunting, of birds in particular. In 1783 he published in the \\"Mercure de France\\" a \\"Note on the Way of Steering Balloons, based on the Flight of Birds of Prey\\", then in 1784, \\"Observations on the Flight of Birds of Prey\\" (Geneva 1784) with 7 plates designed by him. He was working on a \\"History of Birds of Prey\\" when he died. Huber also had talents as a caricaturist which he used on a number of occasions, and particularly against Liotard. He visited Voltaire at \\"Les Délices\\" in 1756 and became part of the Ferney set. He painted numerous pictures representing Philosophy, and dedicated a collection of his portraits to Catherine II of Russia. He was with Voltaire for twenty years and was given the nickname of Huber-Voltaire. Voltaire wrote in 1772 to Madame du Deffand: \\"Since you have seen Monsieur Huber, he will do your portrait; he will do it in pastel, in oils, or in mezzotint. With scissors he will make a cutout sketch of you as a complete caricature. This is the way he ridiculed me from one end of Europe to the other.\\" In Geneva, he popularised the art of the silhouette, and worked without even making an initial sketch. His talent for cutouts allowed him to create the most complicated scenes of fights and chases; sometimes he would produce thick forests leaving distant plains and mountains to be imagined; his illustrations showed inimitable fine details. Most of his cutouts are in England, in private galleries. His \\"scenes of\\" made him famous, as well as his irreverent caricatures of Voltaire. In 1761 a silhouette that Huber had created of Anne FitzRoy, Duchess of Grafton and her daughter was sent to Horace Walpole. This letter was to be the start of a correspondence of 455 letters. Matthew Kilburn, ‘Fitzpatrick , Anne, countess of Upper Ossory [other married name Anne FitzRoy, duchess of Grafton] (1737/8–1804)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2008 accessed 23 March 2017 Huber produced various works in pastel, including his self- portrait which is in Lausanne museum. J J Rigaud wrote of him, \\"The reproduction of Voltaire's features was so familiar to Huber that he could draw his profile without having his eyes fixed on the paper, or with his hands behind his back, or even without scissors, by tearing a card. The joke of doing his dog with a profile of Voltaire, while giving it a crust of bread to eat, gave Huber almost as much fame as his serious works.\\" References Category:Artists from the Republic of Geneva Category:Military personnel from the Republic of Geneva Category:18th-century Swiss painters Category:1786 deaths Category:1721 births Category:Swiss military personnel ","title":"Jean Huber"},{"id":"3034344","text":"Gules, a lion rampant between three cross-crosslets fitcheé or Arthur Capell, 1st Baron CapellThe variant spelling \\"Capel\\" is frequent in the historical sources. (20 February 16089 March 1649), of Hadham Hall and Cassiobury House, Watford, both in Hertfordshire, was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 until 1641 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Capell. He supported the Royalist cause in the Civil War and was executed on the orders of parliament in 1649. Life Capell was the only son of Sir Henry Capell, of Rayne Hall, Essex, and his wife Theodosia Montagu, daughter of Sir Edward Montagu of Boughton House, Northamptonshire. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire in the Short Parliament, and was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640. At first, he supported the opposition of the arbitrary government of King Charles I of England. On 5 December 1640, he delivered the \\"Petition from the county of Hertfordshire\\", outlining grievances against the King, and continued to criticise the King and the Kings advisers right through to the summer of 1641. In June 1641, in an effort to raise additional revenue, the price of baronies was reduced from £400 to £350, and Arthur Capell was raised to the peerage by the title of Baron Capell of Hadham, in the County of Hertford, on 6 August 1641. However, Capell was openly allying himself with the King's cause by early 1642, on which side his sympathies were now engaged. On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was appointed lieutenant-general of Shropshire, Cheshire, and North Wales, where he rendered useful military services, and was later made one of the Councillors of Prince Charles Stewart (who later became King Charles II of England), as well as a commissioner at the Treaty of Uxbridge in 1645. He attended the Queen, Henrietta Maria of France (the wife of King Charles I), in her flight to France in 1646, but disapproved of her son Prince Charles's journey thither, and afterwards retired to Jersey; later, he subsequently aided in the King's escape to the Isle of Wight. Capell was one of the chief Royalist leaders in the second Civil War, but met with no success, and on the 27 August 1648, together with Earl of Norwich, he surrendered to Lord Fairfax at Colchester, on the promise of quarter for life. cites S. R. Gardiner History of the Civil War, iv, 206; also article on Thomas Fairfax by C.H. Firth in the Dictionary of National Biography. This assurance was afterwards interpreted as not binding the civil authorities, and his fate for some time hung in the balance. He succeeded in escaping from the Tower of London, wading the moat once he had got over the walls, only to be betrayed by a Thames waterman, who had been engaged to row him from a hiding place at the Temple to one in Lambeth. He was again captured and was condemned to death by parliament, on 8 March 1649, and beheaded together with the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Holland. One of Lord Capell's last requests was for his heart to be buried with the body of King Charles I, and after his execution, Capell's heart was preserved in a silver box. The silver box was kept in the custody of the Bishop of Winchester, and was later presented, by the Bishop, to King Charles II. In 1703, a heart in a silver box was found at Hadham Hall, suggesting that the King sent the heart to Capell's son. It was later taken to Cassiobury, but since the dissolution and sale of the Cassiobury estate, the whereabouts of Capell's heart are now unknown. A memorial stone to Lord Capell was erected at St Cecelia's Church in Little Hadham, Hertfordshire. Works Capell wrote Daily Observations or Meditations: Divine, Morall, published with some of his letters in 1654, and reprinted, with a short life of the author, under the title Excellent Contemplations, in 1683. Marriage and children Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, and his Family, by Cornelius Johnson, National Portrait Gallery, London Cassiobury House, 1888 On 28 November 1627, Capell married Elizabeth Morrison, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Charles Morrison of Cassiobury, Hertfordshire, and Mary Hicks, who brought the Cassiobury estate, including Cassiobury House, into his family, making him one of the richest men in England. His lands were scattered across ten counties, and brought him a reputed annual income of £7,000.

In 1996, he actually played against North Melbourne in the Grand Final, playing on the losing side of Sydney. In the 2005 season, Shannon Grant was involved in numerous comeback victories by the Kangaroos. The first was in Round 2 against his old club the Sydney Swans at Manuka Oval. Trailing by 17 points at 3 quarter time, Grant and his team mates lifted with Grant kicking 3 goals to help the Roos to a convincing win. The following week against , the 'Roos again lifted from a 3rd quarter shocker, trailing against the highly fancied St Kilda which had not lost a game at Docklands Stadium since 2003. Grant once again kicked 4 goals in the last quarter to defeat the Saints by 7 points, 100-93. Grant's fourth was a 'ripper' from 5 metres in from the boundary 45 metres out. Then later in Round 19, the Kangaroos trailed by 3 goals with 4 minutes to play against the lowly at the Telstra Dome. Grant announced his retirement on Tuesday 26 August 2008. The following Saturday, Grant played the 300th game of his career. Fittingly, his 301st and last game of AFL football was an elimination final against his old club, the Sydney Swans at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, which the Kangaroos lost by 35 points. Grant was given a standing ovation by both Sydney and North Melbourne players as he left the ground for the final time, as he was well respected by both clubs. Grant coached the Frankston Football Club for one season in the Victorian Football League in 2009. At season end of 2009, he was appointed coach of the struggling Bendigo Bombers for 2010, also in the VFL. Shannon Grant joined the Western Bulldogs Coaching panel as an Assistant coach for 2012 after two seasons at Essendon.

Amongst his students at the Lysenko Music Institute were the composers Arkady Filippenko and Valentin Silvestrov. Biography =Early life and education= Levko Mykolayevych Revutsky was born on in Irzhavets, Priluksky Uyezd of the Poltava Governorate (presently in the Chernihiv Oblast) in Ukraine) to a family of a trustee of a rural school. The parents of the future composer were well-educated. His music talent showed up very early and his mother began to teach young Revutsky to play the piano when he hardly was five years old. By age ten, he showed skill at improvisation and had perfect pitch, earning him the nickname \\"Tuning fork\\". In 1903 his parents transferred Revutsky to Kiev's Val'ker gymnasium and simultaneously the music school of Mykola Tumanovsky where he studied fortepiano with Mykola Lysenko. Revutsky later recalled, \\"Lysenko became for me the first example of artistic ideals.\\" Graduating from the gymnasium in 1907, he entered the physic-mathematics faculty of Kiev University. In 1908, Revutsky also entered law school and at the same time renewed piano classes at the Kiev music college run by the Russian Music Society. He was greatly impressed by visits to Moscow and St. Petersburg where he attended the theatre and concerts. In three years of studies in the premiere course of the school Revutsky had considerable successes. In 1911 he graduated to the higher level in the class of G. Hodorovsky. Revutsky's studies in the class of this master lasted a few years: from 1911 to 1913 year in musical school, and afterwards in the newly opened Kiev conservatory. In the conservatory, Revutsky simultaneously with his piano studies begins to visit Gliere's composition classes. He continued his university studies. The first part of piano sonata (in C minor), sketches for the first symphony, and the prelude of opus four were created at this time. Revutsky graduated from both the university and conservatory in 1916, and went to fight in the First World War. =Post graduate work= Demobilized in 1918, Revutsky moved to Pryluky. In 1924 Revutsky was invited to Kiev to work as a teacher at the Lysenko Music-Drama Institute. From this time he gave himself to pedagogical work, initially as teacher, and then as professor of music-theory and performance and composition . In the 1930s Revutsky had considerable achievements as a composer. In addition, he created his music-pedagogical systems. For hismerits in the field of culture Revutsky received the title of People's Artist of Ukraine in 1942, and in 1944 People's Artist of USSR. In the post-war period he participated in a renewal of artistic-cultural life of the Republic. From 1944 to 1948 he headed the Composers Union of Ukraine. Revutsky was also elected by the deputy of Supreme Soviet of Ukraine to a number of convocations. In 1950 he undertook the enormous task of editing and preparing Mykola Lysenko's works for publication. In February, 1969 in connection with his 80th birthday and for creative merit Levko Revutsky was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. He died on 30 March 1977 in Kiev, and is buried in Baikove Cemetery. =Legacy= The creative legacy of Levko Revutsky is the original legacy in the world of national music, specifically selected from the general background of artistic culture by the unique harmonic beauty. Unsurpassed melodic standards (in particular, in «Song», cantata-poem «Shawl», row of songs for choir, his Concerto No. 2 for piano with the orchestra) due to an original combination of individual vivid approach with intonation-harmonical and rhythmic facilities of folk lyric songs and thoughts, and laments. Unexcelled aspiration to show his own art at a level of the best European and world classics standards, distinguish the creative handwriting of a great master in all his undertakings. His creation is a deep re-comprehension, successive claim of artistic ideals. The prosecution of folk song in an eventual result opened the extraordinarily wide and complete picture of folk life in general, with the traditions, faith, aspirations. Revutsky in new historical terms repeated what Mykola Lysenko did, — He organically put together folk and professional music. Levko Revutsky further developed the methods of Lysenko and Leontovych. He enriched Ukrainian music with his individual stylistic discoveries. The composer's style of Revutsky was formed on the basis of deep and comprehensive understanding of Ukrainian folk melody and traditions of modern professional music. Life-asserting attitude, lyricism, restraint, breadth and riches of emotions, are inherent in the works of this artist. His measured, expressive melody unites with the saturated, difficult harmony. Revutsky exposed reality and in lyrical-dramatic, and in lyrical-epic keys. His works belong to the treasury of Ukrainian classics (The second symphony and piano concerto are the first considerable works of these genres in Ukrainian music). Revutsky made a considerable contribution to the development of genre folk songs arrangements. There are about 120 such original arrangements in his creative inheritance. “Sonechko” regional child creative activity holiday is sited at Revutsky homestead in Irzhavets of Ichnia district. Quotes * \\"I attach serious significance to the ethics-moral face of an artist… I do not separate aesthetics from ethics.\\" — L. Revutsky. * \\"Levko Mykolaevich Revutsky is for sure one of the most prominent figures at the musical front of Soviet Ukraine… The creative prosecution of the richest song material of Ukraine exposed Revutsky as a large master, whose taste provided him into treatments of high artistic level and mass fully deserved popularity, which goes out far outside Ukraine…\\" — B.Liatoshinsky.

Gameplay In-game screenshot The game allows up to four players to play simultaneously. Each player chooses from among four characters: Captain Jose, Twinbats Ryno, Beanball Roger, and Stick Straw. The object of the game is to recover various artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, while a boss character will appear at the end of each stage, which requires the player(s) to defeat it. Like in most arcade video games, whether the player fails or beats the game, he or she will type in three letters or other text characters in to record their score. Like Irem's previous beat 'em up arcade Undercover Cops, Ninja Baseball Bat Man features playable characters with several different fighting moves performed by inputting several commands using an 8-way joystick and two buttons (attack and jump), including \\"smart bomb\\" or \\"screen zapper\\" moves that sacrifices health in order to annihilate every enemy on the screen. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against several enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health. There are items throughout the game that include American and Japanese food for restoring health, alternate weapons such as baseballs and shurikens, or items that call cheerleaders to either obliterate enemies on screen or drop a large amount of food. There are also mini-games after each boss before the final one is defeated. Development Irem America opened its U.S. office in 1988 in Redmond, Washington, headed up by Frank Ballouz (founder of Fabtek, a thriving video kit company and former North American publisher of several arcade machines by Seibu Kaihatsu and TAD Corporation) and National Sales Manager Drew Maniscalco. During this time, Drew created the \\"Ninja Baseball Bat Man\\" video game concept (including the English title, plot and characters) and licensed it to Irem America in 1991. (Transcription by Drew Maniscalco. ). To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison. Drew's concept came up after he read the top-grossing films during its time in a USA Today newspaper. One was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; the other was one of the Batman films (possibly Batman Returns). After that, he started creating his own superhero influenced by what he saw in the USA Today newspaper. During the development of his concept, he liked the word ninja, because of it sounding mysterious to him. He gave the protagonists baseball bats and baseballs as their main weapons, as well as dressing them in baseball uniforms, because Drew is a baseball fan. Drew thought the baseball bat idea was also probably an influence from the 1973 film Walking Tall. This was also how he came up with the game's English title. In Japan, however, Irem of Japan's staff came up with the game's Japanese name as a reference to numerous tokusatsu television shows, most notably the Super Sentai series. Drew later created the concept for the other characters such as enemies. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison. Drew's original gameplay ideas for the video game was for a 1-player, adventure-based, platform game similar to Nintendo's Super Mario Bros.. However, due to the very successful game sales of several 4-player games (most of them being beat 'em ups), Drew added 3-players in an effort to compete with the 4-player games. While the title and characters were Drew's concept, Irem Japan programmed the arcade game, and modified the look of its prototype. Drew did not mind it being different, as he was thrilled about it being programmed by them. During the development of the two-player platform version, the two main characters were named \\"Willie\\" and \\"Mickey\\", named after Drew's two favorite baseball players of his childhood, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. During the development of the 4-player beat 'em up version, the prototype names of the four main characters were Captain Jeff (red), Nunchaks Sugar (green), Hammer' Eddy (yellow) and Naginata Jimmy (blue). Drew later came up with the final names of the four protagonists that are currently used in the finished version today, which the names are references to the four baseball stars during the arcade game's release: Jose Canseco (red), Ryne Sandberg (green), Roger Clemens (yellow) and Darryl Strawberry (blue). In Japan, their last names were changed to the names of their colors. Reception and legacy Despite being one of the top arcade hits of Japan while receiving good reviews from critics during its 1993 release, when compared to the sales of other kits sold at the time, it sold poorly in the Far East and especially North America. Of the 1042 units sold, only 50 units were sold in North America, making Ninja Baseball Bat Man quite rare (especially in the U.S.). Drew \\"was very disappointed with the effort by the US office.\\" Despite all of this, the popularity of the arcade emulator MAME caused Ninja Baseball Bat Man to gain more popularity years later than it had when originally released. A year after its concept was created and a year before it was released, despite it being interesting in his opinion, Drew left the company in 1992 and moved to Data East USA. Because of that, he was unable to market nor manage any other input related to the game. However, according to his interview with GameRoom, he now owns the rights to Ninja Baseball Bat Mans non-video game products, while Irem Japan owns the rights to its video game content.

He is known mainly for his comic opera Zaporozhets za Dunayem (A Zaporozhian (Cossack) Beyond the Danube), as well as for his dramatic talent and his powerful, rich baritone voice. He was the nephew of the poet Petro Hulak-Artemovsky and a close friend of Taras Shevchenko. Biography Hulak-Artemovsky was born in Horodyshche, Kiev Governorate (today in independent Ukraine) to the family of a priest, and went on to study at the Kiev Theological Seminary from 1835 to 1838. Having gained the attention of Mikhail Glinka, the young Semen was brought to the capital of the empire, St Petersburg, in 1838 to receive vocal training directly from Glinka, as well as entry into the Imperial Chapel Choir. The following year, Hulak-Artemovsky left to continue his studies in Italy. Towards the end of his stay in that country, he began performing opera in Florence. Upon his return to St. Petersburg in 1842, Hulak-Artemovsky became a soloist of the Imperial Opera at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, a position he held for 22 years. In 1852 and 1853 he sang roles in Anton Rubinstein's first two operas, Dmitry Donskoy and Fomka the Fool. Hulak-Artemovsky performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from 1864 to 1865. He performed over fifty operatic roles during his career, including Ruslan in Glinka's Ruslan and Lyudmila, Masetto in Mozart's Don Giovanni, as well as Antonio and Lord Ashton in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix and Lucia di Lammermoor. A composer of operas, as well as vocal and instrumental music, Hulak-Artemovsky composed his seminal work Zaporozhets za Dunayem in 1864, after completing the libretto in 1862. His friendship with Taras Shevchenko began in the fall of 1838, after a chance meeting in St. Petersburg. The lifelong friendship continued during Shevchenko's incarceration and subsequent release, and was said to have strongly influenced Hulak-Artemovsky's view of the world. He dedicated his song A Maple Tree Stands Over The River (, translit. Stoyit' yavir nad vodoyu) to Shevchenko. Hulak-Artemovsky died at the age of 60 in Moscow. Operas *Ukrainian Wedding (, translit. Ukrayins’ke vesillya, translit. Ukrainskaya svad'ba) was first performed in 1851, with Hulak-Artemovsky in the role of the father-in- law. *Ivan Kupala Eve (, translit. Nich na Ivana Kupala, translit. Noch' nakanune Ivana Kupala) was first performed in 1852 *Zaporozhets za Dunayem (, translated as A Zaporozhian (Cossack) Beyond the Danube, also referred to as Cossacks in Exile) was premiered in St. Petersburg, with Hulak-Artemovsky in the role of Karas'.

She started in 51 races, winning 30, and was second 7 times, third twice and unplaced in 12 races. Show Gate was owned, bred and trained by Gordon Thomson of Mosgiel, Dunedin. A mare with an ability to carry big weights over all distances in record times, legendary New Zealand jockey Bob Skelton was quoted to say \\"She's A Machine\\" and the \\"Equal of modern day Hall of Fame mare Sunline\\" She won the Stewards, Canterbury Gold Cup and the Churchill Stakes over 1200m, 2000m and 1600m respectively over 7 days at the Canterbury Show week meetings at Riccarton Park. She went on to capture all three twice during her career. Show Gate suffered a fractured sesamoid bone in the spring of 1974 after winning her first five races as a five-year-old. She returned to racing as a seven-year-old, winning 7 of her 13 starts, and ran a very unlucky second to Good Lord in the 1977 Wellington Cup over 3200m.

He was traded from the Hawks to the Bombers during the 2009 AFL trade week. Making his debut in 2002 after being drafted by the Hawks at pick 43 in the 2000 AFL Draft, Williams was a small forward and came of age in 2005 when he was used as a full forward where he kicked 63 goals, making him the leading goal kicker of the club. Known for his flamboyance, pace and use of the \\"shotgun\\", a trademark celebration he used to use after kicking a goal, Williams was one of a number of young players at Hawthorn. Williams finished 2006 with a total of 60 goals and again was the leading goalkicker at the Hawks. A knee injury cut short his 2007 season after only four games leaving him stranded on 13 goals. Williams attracted controversy in 2008 when he made a choking gesture targeted at then-Port Adelaide coach, Mark Williams. This was in reference to the then-Port Adelaide coach's famous choking gesture when the Power 2004 Premiership. Williams was warned that he would be shown the door if such action occurred again. He did apologise to his Port Adelaide namesake after the game, which Hawthorn won. In the 2008 Grand Final, Williams and Stuart Dew kicked four goals in three minutes to put Hawthorn in a winning position late in the third quarter. Williams' three goals was the most by any player during the Grand Final. In 2009, Williams injured his knee and missed almost half of that season's games. The 2009 post-season trade week saw Williams traded to Essendon in a complex trade involving four clubs. He had a disappointing debut game for Essendon, when the Bombers were beaten by Geelong at the MCG. It was not a great night for Williams as he gathered just eight disposals and was kept scoreless in the match. In the twilight of his career, Williams was unable to gain senior selection and played with Essendon's Victorian Football League affiliate the Bendigo Bombers, until his retirement which was announced on 25 July 2011.http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/mark- williams-forced-into-afl-retirement-20110725-1hwcj.html Williams agreed to play with Ballan in the Central Highlands Football League for 2012 and 2013.O'Neill, David (4 April 2012 Williams signs with Ballan Williams became the inaugural coach of Western Region Football League club Newport Power at the end of 2015.

In Killeen, SH 195 is known as Fort Hood Street, as the highway leads to the entrance of Fort Hood. The Texas Memorial Highway System has designated the entire road as the Phantom Warriors Highway. History This route was designated on June 5, 1933 from Georgetown and turned approximately north of Florence, to meet up with SH 74 (now U.S. Highway 183), as a renumbering of a portion of SH 74, which was rerouted further west. The section from Killeen southwest 5 miles was originally designated FM 440 on June 11, 1945, but was extended south 3.8 miles on May 26, 1949, and to SH 195 in Florence on May 23, 1951. FM 440 was redesignated as RM 440 on October 1, 1956. On January 27, 1988, the section of SH 195 from Florence to U.S. Highway 183 was redesignated as State Highway 138. SH 195 was rerouted over RM 440 north to US 190 in Kileen. The section of RM 440 from Business US 190 to US 190 became part of FM 439. On January 31, 2002, SH 195 was extended north over part of FM 439 to the east gate of Fort Hood, as part of FM 439 from there to FM 2410 was cancelled, and FM 439 was rerouted south replacing part of FM 2410 to BU 190-F & FM 2410. As of October 2005, portions of the highway between Killeen and Florence are four lanes with median, or two lanes with shoulders. In Florence, the highway becomes a four- lane road with traffic signals at the intersection of FM 487, as well as the intersection of FM 970, near Florence Middle School and Florence High School. South of FM 970, it is a two-lane road all the way to Interstate 35. As of October 2005, SH 195 is undergoing a major overhaul. The former two-lane highway is being widened to four lanes with a median and shoulders. The project has been broken up into phases. In the first phase, the road was widened from just south of FM 3470 in Killeen (known locally as Stan Schlueter Loop) to near the intersection with RM 2670 in the community of Ding Dong. The second phase added two new bridges over the Lampasas River and extended to near the Bell-Williamson county line. The third and final phase was completed. It begins 3 miles south of State Highway 138 near Florence and stretches to Ronald Reagan Boulevard in Georgetown.http://kdhnews.com/news/traffic/work- begins-on-final-phase-of- construction/article_0882fc78-b17d-11e3-b193-001a4bcf6878.html Due to federally protected bugs which reside in caves under the 195 roads, the progression of the final phase was delayed until funding could be produced to purchase these caves. In the future, new phases will create a divided highway along the entire length of SH 195. A bypass was constructed around the town of Florence, so that travellers can avoid the before-school and after-school traffic in Florence. There are several reasons for the construction project. The road was once known in Central Texas as the \\"Highway of Death\\" due to the many fatal accidents on 195. One small period between 1996 and 1998 saw the loss of 21 lives. The road's new design will ease traffic congestion caused by daily commutes to Georgetown and Austin, since the road is the only route directly to Interstate 35 from Killeen, besides Interstate 14/U.S. Highway 190. Also, the new highway will facilitate vehicle movement in the event of a deployment of troops from Fort Hood en route to Interstate 35. On May 31, 2007, the highway officially reopened to the public as the finished divided highway.

Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. It is based on the 2002 live action film, Scooby-Doo, which was filmed at the studio adjacent to the park at the same time the ride was being constructed. In 2018 the ride underwent a significant theming overhaul and reopened in December under the name Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster: Next Generation with a new ride storyline, new theming (still based on the 2002 film) and new special effects. History On 3 June 1991, Warner Bros. Movie World opened to the public with Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure as one of its original attractions. In late 2001, Warner Bros. Movie World announced that they would be closing the attraction to make way for a new attraction set to open in 2002. On 17 June 2002, the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster opened in the location of Warner Bros. Classics & Great Gremlins Adventure. Characteristics =Overview= Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster is a Wild Mouse roller coaster manufactured by Mack Rides. Warner Bros. Movie World collaborated with Mack Rides to develop a Wild Mouse roller coaster that was unlike the previous models (such as The Fly, Technic Coaster and Mulholland Madness). The ride is enclosed in a show building making it a dark ride. =Statistics= Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster features of track. The highest point, , is reached through the use of an elevator lift. The largest drop is and is performed in reverse. At this point, riders reach the top speed of . One cycle of the ride takes approximately 4 minutes and 13 seconds. The ride caters for approximately 1000 guests per hour. =Theme= The Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster is themed around the 2002 live action film, Scooby-Doo. The main entrance facade is modelled after the Spooky Island Castle that is featured in the film. Additionally, the ride's eighteen vehicles are modelled on that used in the film. These vehicles seat four people, in two rows of two. In December 2016 internal theming was removed due to it being a fire hazard. New theming was installed in late 2018 and the ride's name was slightly altered with \\"Next Generation\\" to reflect the update as well as the storyline changes. =On Ride Photo= The Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster has an on ride photo in the first dark ride section on the ride. The photo is taken as riders drop in front of the swinging axes. This photo is available as part of the Fast Photo digital pass and viewable on screens in the exit retail store. Experience The monster fountain located in the main queue area of the ride. =Queue= The entrance to the Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster is a replica of the Spooky Island Castle seen in the 2002 film. This façade hides a large sound stage where the actual ride exists. On most days, guests must walk up a few steps enter the castle and the ride's queue line. On busier days, the ride's outdoor overflow queue is utilised. It is located on the right hand side of the entrance and leads into the side of the castle façade. Once inside the castle riders are treated to the sight of a monster fountain and a making of video of the 2002 film. A series of queue switchbacks are located closer to the load station. =Ride= Original Version Once the ride begins, the first part is like a typical dark ride, embellished with effects including a swinging axe and various other spooky- themed audio-animatronics displays. Along the way, an animatronic Scooby-Doo will tell the rider which way the carriage will go next until it reaches a platform. As the platform ascends vertically it tilts from side to side giving riders the illusion that they will fall out. As it rises a short conversation between Scooby-Doo and Daphne can be heard. Once the carriage has reached the top of the elevator, and the top of the show building, it drops backwards towards to turntable which spins the carriage around before continuing along the roller coaster track. This is where the true wild mouse section of the roller coaster begins. This section features various smoke, lighting and laser effects as well as a giant spider (previously used in the Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience and Halloween Family Fun Nights). It is also musically accompanied by U.S. punk band MXPX playing a cover of the Scooby-Doo theme song. A final animatronic Scooby shows riders the way out of the wild mouse section. The ride concludes with one very small drop to get to the exit platform. Next Generation (2018 update) Although the ride's rollercoaster track is unaltered and it's ghost train elements are still present, the ride's storyline has been significantly changed, although it is still themed to the 2002 film. Scooby-Doo now no longer appears in the ride till the very end in the exit queue. However his initial voice over and disembarkment audio remains in use. The creatures from the movie have escaped their enclosures and are attacking the riders. After the ride exits the station, using projection mapping effects, the train is attacked by two of the monsters breaking down the right-side wall, but the train gets away in time. Following the usual Ghost Train section, Riders are greeted with the mirror scene which now uses more projection effects to display the two monsters attacking the vehicle. The ride then passes by several voodoo statues before coming to the Platform lift. Daphne and Shaggy both spot and talk to Scrappy Doo who, as the lift rises, appears on screens surrounding the riders and changes into his own monster form, then roars at the riders. Shaggy then says his iconic quote from the battle with Scrappy, which is, \\"You're a bad puppy!\\", followed by the claw used in the first movie pulling out the Daemon Ritus from Scrappy's chest. The train then drops backwards to the turntable as before, however the turntable is now surrounded by a disco like box with mirrors and neon lights. The traditional wild mouse section remains relatively unaltered, however the vat carrying the souls from the movie now sits in the center of the room. As riders leave this section they are now greeted by two projection mapped screens on either side of the train, but as the disco skull on the ceiling shines, the creatures become afraid. The train then makes its final small drop, however this small section is now incorporated into the ride's storyline and a screen above it shows one of the creatures screaming in the \\"Tiki Doll Lounge\\". As riders disembark and pass through the lounge, Scooby-Doo is seen hiding in a hut saying \\"I'm scared!\\"(this scene uses the same animatronic and audio previously used at the beginning of the ride).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYISdN2uVB8 =Exit= Riders exit through a gift shop to buy various articles of Scooby-Doo merchandise, as well as on-ride photos.

She has become a recurrent motif in Ukrainian literature and the songs ascribed to her are widely performed in Ukraine. Very little is known of her life. She was a native of Poltava (then in Crown of the Kingdom of Poland), and is regarded as the author as well as the subject of the well-known Ukrainian folk song \\"Oi Ne Khody Hrytsiu Tai na Vechornytsi\\" (Hryts, Don't Go to the Evening Dances) known in the West as the song \\"Yes, My Darling Daughter\\". Influence in literature The legend about Marusia Churai was formed under the influence of 19th century literary works such as the novel \\"Marusia, Malorosiiskaia Sapfo\\" (Marusia, the Littlerussian Sappho) by C. Shakhnovsky (1839). Many writers used the theme of \\"Hryts\\" in their works: M. Starytsky's play \\"Oi Ne Khody, Hrytsiu\\" (1892), V. Samiylenko's drama \\"Churaivna\\" (1894), Olha Kobylianska's novel \\"V Nediliu Rano Zillia Kopala\\" (She Gathered Herbs on Sunday Morning 1909), I. Mykytenko's drama \\"Marusia Churai\\" (1935), L. Kostenko's novel in verse \\"Marusia Churai\\" (1979), and others. Influence in music Franz Liszt composed \\"Ballade d'Ukraine,\\" a piano piece on the theme of commonly associated with the \\"Hryts\\" text. The song \\"Oi Ne Khody Hrytsiu\\" was translated into Polish (1820), Czech (1822), German (1827), French (1830), English (1848) and other languages. However its melody is not of folk origin. It was first documented use was as an arietta from a vaudeville by a Venetian composer Catterino Cavos. The melody was used in Yes, My Darling Daughter, a 1941 song by Jack Lawrence. Three other song texts that are attributed to Marusia Churai: \\"Kotylysia Vozy z Hory\\" (The Wagons Were Rolling Downhill), \\"Viyut' Vitry\\" (Winds Are Blowing) and \\"Za Svit Staly Kozachenky\\" (The Kozaks Were Ready to March at Dawn). While the texts of these songs may indeed be authentic, the music is not. All the melodies that are attached to her texts date from the late 18th century. The text of the Ukrainian folk song \\"Oi ne khody Hrytsiu\\" was first published in English translation in London in 1816. A Polish translation first appeared in 1822 in Lviv and a German translation appeared in 1848. Evidence exists to the songs popularity in France (1830s), Czech, Slovak lands, Belgium and the United States where it equally well known was the song \\"Ikhav kozak za Dunai\\" (the Cossack rode beyond the Danube; music and words by Semen Klymovsky). In Classical Music Israeli musicologist Yakov Soroker states that the end of the first melodic phrase of \\"Oi ne khody Hrytsiu\\" (Yes my Darling Daughter) contains a \\"signature\\" melody common in Ukrainian songs in general which he calls the \\"Hryts sequence\\" and gives a list of hundreds of Ukrainian folk songs from the Carpathians to the Kuban that contain this particular sequence. His estimation, after studying Z. Lysko's collection of 9,077 Ukrainian melodies was that 6% of Ukrainian folk songs contain the sequence.Yakov Soroker Ukrainian Elements in Classical Music CIUS Press, Edmonton-Toronto, 1995 p.126 Other scholars have also addressed the unique character and expressiveness of the Hryts sequence such as Alexander Serov, who stated that \\"the refrain exudes a spirit of freedom that transports the listener to the steppes and is mixed with the sorrow of some unexpected tragedy.Alexander Serov, Muzyka Ukrainskyx pesen. Izbrannii stat'i, Moscow and Leningrad 1950, Volume 1, p. 119\\" Soroker states that the Hryts signature was used by composers: Joseph Haydn (String Quartet no. 20, op. 9, no. 2; String quartet no. 25, op. 17, no 1; The Saviour's Seven last Words on the Cross, the Rondo of the D major Piano Concerto (composed 1795), Andante and variations for piano (1793)), Luigi Boccherini (duet no. 2), Wolfgang A. Mozart (Symphonia concertante K. 364), L. van Beethoven, J. N. Hummel, Carl Maria von Weber, Franz Liszt (Ballade d'Ukraine), Felix Petyrek, Ivan Khandoshkin, and others.Yakov Soroker Ukrainian Elements in Classical Music CIUS Press, Edmonton-Toronto, 1995 This legendary composer and singer was commemorated on a Ukrainian postage stamp in February 2000.

His father is Italian and his mother is Spanish. AFL career =Sydney Swans= Licuria was drafted to Sydney in the 1995 National Draft as a second round selection, after having two knee reconstructions at ages 16 and 17. He was recruited as a hard-working midfielder but also was rumoured as a recruit to keep Anthony Rocca at the club as they were good friends. Licuria struggled to get a spot in the side after his debut in 1997. He played 4 games in 1997, and then only 6 more in 1998, not having the impact he would have liked. =Collingwood Football Club= Licuria was traded to the club he supported as a child, Collingwood, as part of a deal which saw Sydney receive their first round selection, (no.3 overall). Licuria immediately made an impact at the club with his ability to win the ball off half-back; however, his disposal let him down, and his consistency had dropped off, causing him to be dropped halfway through his first year. However, he came back into the side and won a Rising Star nomination for a 28 possession game against the West Coast Eagles. His form at the time showed signs of what was to come and he carried this form into the 2000 season, finishing 6th in the club's best and fairest, and playing every game with an average of 21 touches. His 2001 and 2002 seasons were brilliant. His disposal was once again questioned, but his incredible workrate and consistency were rated very highly. He played every game in both seasons, averaging 23 and 22 touches a game in respective seasons. He capped both terrific seasons by winning the Copeland Trophy. It stunned everyone with his win in 2001, but in 2002 it was expected in the year the club made it to the Grand Final. Licuria's final series was fantastic. Despite a poor performance in the big game, he would achieve a career-high 40 disposals in the Qualifying Final against Port Adelaide and in the 2002 Grand final loss to Brisbane he and Mick Malthouse showed their disappointment in tears, with Licuria visibly crying.Roger Federer not the only big man to cry Terry Brown for heraldsun.com.au 3 February 2009 His 2003 season was productive also, managing 24 games, missing round 1 through suspension, and breaking a consecutive games run of 74 games. He played all games once again in 2004 and 2005, being noted as one of the most durable midfielders, despite his knee problems early in his career. He finished runner-up in the 2004 best and fairest, once again showing his importance to the side. However, 2006 would see Licuria exposed as a tiring player, with his use of the ball continually debated, and his consistency being questioned. He was rested in Round 16 after an inconsistent start to the year, with highs and lows. He played for Williamstown in the VFL but forced his way back into the side after one week in the reserves. After playing few games during the 2007 season, Licuria retired from the AFL at the end of the season. In 2011, Licuria was inducted into the Collingwood Hall of Fame. =Collingwood Reserves= After Paul retired from AFL football in 2007 he was appointed team manager, with Eddie Hillgrove, of the newly formed Collingwood VFL side under the team's head coach Gavin Brown. Paul also played for the VFL side in the 2008 season and now plays in the VAFA. Post AFL Licuria became a contestant on the Channel Seven series Dancing with the Stars for the 2008 series of the show. Overall, Licuria finished third in the competition.

NSU Prinz I, II & III The first post-war NSU car, the Prinz I, was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1957 accompanied by the advertising slogan \\"Fahre Prinz und Du bist König\\" (\\"Drive a Prince and you're a king\\"). After a pilot run of 150 preproduction cars, volume production began in March 1958. The Prinz I was available as a 2-door saloon Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945-1970, page 145 featuring an upright roof line and seating for four people. The doors opened wide enough to permit reasonable access even to the rear seats, although leg room was severely restricted if attempting to accommodate four full sized adults. In addition to a luggage compartment accessed via a hatch at the front of the car and shared with the spare wheel and fuel filler, there was a narrow but deep full width space behind the rear seat sufficient to accommodate a holiday suitcase. The noisy two-cylinder 600 cc engine was located at the back where it drove the rear wheels, initially via a \\"crash\\" gearbox. Later versions gained a four-speed all-synchromesh gearbox. Contemporaries were impressed by the brevity of the maintenance schedule, with the engine, gear box and final drive operating as a single chamber and all lubricated by means of oil, added through a filler in the rocker box cover. There were just two grease nipples requiring attention, positioned on the steering kingpins. The engine was also commended in contemporary reports for its fuel economy and longevity. Although noisy, the engine offered impressive flexibility, recalling NSU's strengths as a motorcycle manufacturer. 1960 NSU Prinz II The Prinz II (a 'luxury' version)nsu prinz ii automobile 1959 at audi.com/corporate/en/company/history/models Accessed 28 December 2016 was released in 1959 with better trim and an all-synchromesh gearbox.1960 NSU Prinz III, www.microcarmuseum.com Retrieved 9 February 2016 A 30E export version was equipped with a 30 hp engine.

It was designed by Franco Scaglione at Bertone studios in Turin. 20,831 were manufactured between 1958 and 1968. The first 250 bodies were built by Bertone in Turin. The rest were built in Heilbronn at Karrosseriewerke Drauz which was later bought by NSU. The Sport Prinz was initially powered by the Prinz 50 straight-twin engine but a maximum speed of was nevertheless claimed. From late 1962 a engine was fitted. The NSU Spider was a Wankel rotary powered two-seater roadster based on the Sport Prinz platform. Sport Prinz, rear view NSU Prinz 4 One of the revelations of the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1961,nsu prinz 4 1962 at audi.com/corporate/en/company/history/models Accessed 28 December 2016 the Prinz 4 replaced the original Prinz. Its new body closely resembled the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair, but was of course much smaller. Like the original Prinz, it was powered by a two-cylinder air-cooled engine in the rear. The Prinz 4 was much improved and continued to be a well-engineered car, like its predecessors. The engine carried on the tradition of eccentric rod driven camshaft inherited from NSU motorcycle engines and had a dynastart (combined starter/generator) built into the crankcase. Later four-cylinder engines adopted the more conventional (pre-engaged) separate starter motor and alternator. In 1968, Britain's Autocar road tested a Super Prinz. They had tested a Prinz 4 in 1962, and in commenting on how little the car had changed in the intervening six years quipped some of their road testers appeared to have gained more weight than the commendably light-weight Prinz in that period. The test car achieved a top speed of and accelerated to in 35.7 seconds. The home grown Mini 850 reached in 29.5 seconds in an equivalent recent test and also managed to beat the NSU's top speed, albeit only by about 3%. At this time, the UK car market was heavily protected by tariffs, and the Prinz's UK manufacturer's recommended retail price was £597, which was more than the (possibly below cost) £561 asked for the 850 cc Mini, but certainly not completely out of touch with it. The testers concluded their report that the car was competitively priced in its class and performed adequately. They opined, cautiously, it offered 'no more than the rest' but neither did it 'lack anything important'.

All had the same body with inline-four air-cooled OHC engines and were frequently driven as sports cars, but also as economical family cars as well. The engines were very lively, and highly reliable. Paired with the low total weight, excellent handling and cornering, both the NSU 1000 and the much higher powered NSU 1200 TT/TTS outperformed many sportscars. The Prinz 1000 lost the \\"Prinz\\" part of the name in January 1967, becoming simply the NSU 1000 or 1000 C depending on the equipment. It has DIN, while the 1200 TT has DIN and the most potent TTS version has DIN from only one litre. The 1000 received large oval headlights, while the sportier TT versions have twin round headlights mounted within the same frame. The first 1000 TT has DIN and uses the engine first introduced in the larger NSU Typ 110. NSU Prinz 1000 The NSU Prinz 1000 TT was built in 14,292 examples between 1965 and 1967, when it was replaced by the bigger engined TT. This, with a 1.2-liter engine, was built until July 1972 for a total of 49,327 examples. The TT can be recognized by its broad black stripe between its headlights. The TTS was built especially for competition, being successful in both hillclimbs and circuit racing. It has a front-mounted oil cooler and was built in 2,402 examples from February 1967 until July 1971. It was briefly referred to as the \\"Prinz 1000 TTS\\" when first introduced. There was also a competition model of the TTS available for sale, with . Production of the Typ 67a (NSU 1000) came to a halt in December 1972. In 1965, an even larger model was added, initially called Typ 110, and from 1967 on NSU 1200. It offered more space, so it was a better family car, but was not as sporty as the smaller models. Therefore, the NSU 1200TT used the 1200 cc engine of the 1200 in the smaller body of the NSU 1000. 1969 NSU TT =End of production= When NSU was acquired by Volkswagen in 1969, it was merged with Auto Union AG. Auto Union had previously been taken over by VW in 1964 and produced mid-sized cars, resurrecting the Audi marque. The name of the new company changed to Audi NSU Auto Union AG. The small, rear-engined NSUs were phased out in 1973, as production capacity was needed for larger and more profitable Audis. The successor of the NSU Prinz was the front-wheel drive Audi 50, later rebadged Volkswagen Polo. Related models Under license, the Prinz was manufactured in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, by PRETIS (Preduzeće Tito Sarajevo). The Prinz was also manufactured in Argentina by Autoar, making mainly models Prinz II and Prinz III / 30. A total of 2.432 units were built between 1959 and 1963. It is told only 40-45 Sportprinz and a few Prinz IV (less than 10) were imported. The Ramses was the first car produced in Egypt, and was the result of a co-operation between the new Egyptian car firm Egyptian Light Transport Manufacturing Company, and NSU. The factory was located right next to the Great Pyramids. Plans were to produce around 10,000 cars a year, most of the work being manual labor. The Prinz 4-cylinder air-cooled engine was also famously adopted by Friedl Münch in 1966 for the hand-built Münch Mammoth motorcycle, at the time the fastest and most expensive motorcycle in production.

His subject range was varied and included history subjects, mythological scenes, allegories, landscapes, genre scenes, portraits, architectural scenes and animals. After training in his native Flanders, he left his home country and ultimately settled down in Florence, Italy. He became a prominent court artist to the Medici during the second half of the 16th century and worked on the many decorative projects of the court.M.

He was one of the earliest members of the prominent Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno established in Florence in 1563. Stradanus also worked on various commissions in Rome. He resided in Napels from 1576 but returned to Florence in 1580, where he died.M.

He subsequently continued his training in the workshop of the further unknown Bruges master Maximiliaen Francken (from 1535 to 1537). He later moved to Antwerp where he studied from 1537 to 1540 in the workshop of Pieter Aertsen, a Dutch genre painter active in Antwerp. There he mastered the visual language of the Renaissance and the ability to depict complex compositions.Manfred Sellink, Johannes van der Straet, Gevierd Brugs schilder in Florence in: Ons Erfdeel. Volume 51 (2008) In 1545 he was registered under the name Hans vander Straten as a master painter in the Antwerp guild of Saint Luke. In Antwerp he moved in the circle of the Romanists, i.e. Northern artists who had traveled to Italy and upon their return to their home country created a Renaissance style, which assimilated Italian formal language.Ilja M. Veldman. \\"Romanism.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 October 2019 As was common at the time, he left his home country to travel to Italy to complete his studies. He traveled first to Lyon where he may have worked with the Dutch painter Corneille de la Haye. He then moved on to Venice where he spent a few months.Three drawings by Jan van der Straet, called Stradanus (1523-1605) in: Stephen Ongpin Fine Art: 2018 Master Drawings Catalogue, published on 9 January 2018, p. 16-27 In Venice he met the Flemish carpet weaver Jan Rost who headed up the newly established Arazzeria Medicea, the personal weaving workshop in of Florence of the Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo I de' Medici. Rost encouraged Stradanus to travel to Florence for work. He followed the advice and reached Florence in 1550, where he entered in the service of the Medici Dukes. He became one of the principal assistants of Giorgio Vasari, a painter, architect and the principal advisor of the Medici on art issues. Stradanus carried out his first commissions as a designer of tapestries in the Arazzeria Medicea. He designed a number of scenes for tapestries and frescoes to decorate the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence and the Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano, projects that were under the general direction of Vasari and executed by the about 20 assistants in Vasari's workshop. Wildcat Hunt, tapestry During the period from 1550 to 1553, he spent time in Rome to work on commissions.STRADANUS Johannes & GALLE Philippe & COLLAERT Adrian, La mésaventure du chasseur Here he assisted Francesco Salviati and also worked with Daniele da Volterra on the decoration of the Vatican Belvedere. Some time between 1550 and 1555 Stradanus married Lucrezia di Lorenzo Guardieri. Two children from this marriage were Lucrezia (before 1556) and Scipione (1556-1612). Scipione became an artist and collaborated with his father on some projects.G.J.J. van der Sman & Bouk Wierda, Wisselend succes - De loopbanen van Nederlandse en Vlaamse kunstenaars in Florence, 1450-1600, in: Netherlands yearbook for history of art, 63, pp. 170-239 Stradanus became financially successful and he was able to acquire a house and other possessions as well as donate substantial sums to religious institutions. One of these was the Sant'Agata Monastery, where his daughter Lucrezia became a nun in 1569. Allegory of the arts, engraved by Cornelis Cort after Stradanus Stradanus worked in Florence in a milieu that included Vasari, Bronzino, Allori and Salviati. Stradanus was one of the earliest members together with the aforementioned artists of the Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno, after its establishment was approved by the Medici court on 13 January 1563 at the request of Vasari. The Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno acted both as a guild for all working artists in Florence and an institution for education in the arts. Stradanus later became a consul of this institution. He also taught classes at the Accademia and one of his pupils was Antonio Tempesta. He played a key role in the design of the tomb of Michelangelo who died in 1564.Arthur J. DiFuria, Review of Stradanus 1523-1605: Court Artist of the Medici By Alessandra Baroni and Manfred Sellink, in: Historians of Netherlandish Art Reviews, published in 2013 Stradanus also worked on various ephemeral works created for important public events in Florence. In 1565, he was a member of the team of painters and sculptors who executed the large-scale decorations at the occasion of the entry into Florence of Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany on the occasion of her wedding with Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The overall direction of the project was in the hands of Giorgio Vasari. Cleansing of the Temple Stradanus was one of the artists involved in the decoration of the Studiolo of Francesco I, the small, windowless barrel- vaulted room in the Palazzo Vecchio commissioned by Francesco I de' Medici and completed between 1570 and 1575 after designs by Vasari. The room was a Wunderkammer (Hall of Wonders), containing a vast collection of rare and precious items such as gems, medals, precious metals, carvings, pharmaceuticals and animal exhibits.Mike McKiernan, Joannes Stradanus (Jan van der Straet), Francesco I in His Alchemy Laboratory, 1570 in: Occupational Medicine, Volume 63, Issue 3, April 2013, Pages 172–174 Representations of the four elements (earth, air, fire and water) covered each wall. Stradanus contributed two paintings to the decoration of the Studiolo: The Alchemist's Studio and Circe transforms the companions of Ulysses.The \\"Studiolo\\" of Francesco I at the site of the Civil Museums of Florence In the early 1570s Stradanus seems to have become independent of the court and Vasari. By this time the relationship between Stradanus and Vasari had soured and Vasari even tried to prevent Stradanus from gaining certain commissions. During this period he created a number of easel paintings. He had started to gain on his own commissions for large altarpieces for the most important churches of Florence, starting with the Santa Croce in 1569, which was followed by the Santissima Annunziata, the Santo Spirito, the Santa Maria Novella and other churches. He was also gradually working more outside Florence in places such as Pisa, Prato, Arezzo and Forli. In 1576 he moved to Naples where he was employed by he newly appointed vice-roy of Naples John of Austria. He visited around 1578 Antwerp possibly traveling from Naples in the company of John of Austria who had been appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands. At that time Antwerp was the most important centre of printing and publishing in Europe. Following this visit, he began to design engravings for the Antwerp printers, eventually producing a large number of drawings destined to be translated into prints.Jan van der Straet, called Stradanus biography at Stephen Ongpin Fine Art Stradanus collaborated with printmakers Hieronymus Cock and the Galle family in Antwerp to produce hundreds of prints on a variety of subjects, most of which were repeatedly reproduced and often bound into volumes. Siege of Florence, Palazzo Vecchio, Sala di Clemente VII By 1583 Stradanus had returned to Florence. He worked that year for the Pazzi family for whom he painted an extensive series of frescoes for the chapel in Villa Pazzi al Parugiano in Montemurlo near Florence. He worked between 1585 and 1587 on a commission by Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici (later Pope Leo XI) on frescoes for the chapel of the Palazzo Della Gherardesca in Florence. He died in Florence on 2 November 1605. He was buried in the Cappella della Compagnia di Santa Barbara of de Santissima Annunziata in Florence. To this day, his tomb is decorated with a bust of the artist, made after a portrait by his son Scipio, together with an inscription referring to his Flemish roots. Work =General= Stradanus was a versatile artist who worked as an easel and fresco painter, designer of tapestries, draughtsman, designer of prints and pottery decorator. His subject range was varied and included history subjects, mythological and religious scenes, allegories, landscapes, genre scenes, portraits, battle pieces, architectural scenes and animals. He was a prolific designer of prints which were circulated widely throughout Europe for many centuries. It is Stradanus' versality and relentless zest for work that ensured him such an important role in the workshop of Vasari and in the Florentine art world which he was able to maintain for almost 60 years. Around 1580 he commissioned a printed self-portrait (engraved by Johannes Wierix) accompanied by the following motto: ASSIDUITATE NIHIL NON ADSEQUITUR (There is nothing that cannot be achieved through perseverance. Ball game on the Piazza Santa Maria Novella in Florence He played an important role in the design and execution of the large commissions for the Medici court the overall direction of which was in the hands of Vasari. His key task was to translate the sketches by Vasari into finished designs, which in turn were used to produce the cartoons for the final painted work. It is clear from the preserved drawings of Stradanus that he regularly participated in the initial development of the compositions. Sixteen finished studies for compositions by Stradanus have been discovered. These designs are executed in pen and ink, embellished by abundant wash.Jan van der Straet, known as Giovanni Stradano, or Stradanus, The enlargement of the city of Florence at Sotheby's In his use of wash to outline the figures Stradanus distinguished himself from his Flemish masters who preferred the use of a pen for such work. In his style and technique Stradanus combined his Flemish training with Italian techniques. He emphasized the pictorial qualities in his drawings.Stradanus, Men hunting bulls with falcons at Stephen Ongpin Fine Art =Paintings= Stradanus produced large altarpieces for the most important Florentine churches. His monumental religious panels still hang in the Santa Croce, Santissima Annunziata, Santa Maria Novelia and Santo Spirito. Stradanus' talent as a fresco painter is visible in the murals he created in the Palazzo Vecchio. This ducal palace, which was designed under the direction of Giorgio Vasari, was given a complete decoration with frescoes according to an extensive and complex iconographic program developed by Vasari. Stradanus made a fundamental contribution to the detailed designs of the fresco's, which were then executed by him and workshop assistants. In recognition of his important contribution his portrait was placed alongside that of Vasari on the ceiling of the Salone dei Cinquecento, the majestic reception room of the Palazzo. In style, composition and technique, the work of Stradanus is entirely in line with that of Vasari and his workshop. He used the elaborate and complex compositions with an overly emphatic display of virtuosity in the postures and twists of the human body. His use of color was also in line with the development of what is later known as Florentine Mannerism: brighter and with greater emphasis on light-dark effects than the previous generations. There is little evidence of any influence of the Flemish painting traditions during this period, probably also because Giorgio Vasari had a firm grip on the program of the palace's decorations. His work is characterised by its high technical quality and the accuracy of his painting. Moderation disarming Vanity =Tapestries= While it is believed that Stradanus was active as designer of tapestries in Italy upon his arrival in the early 1550s, his first recorded designs were carried out for the Arazzeria Medicea, the personal weaving workshop of the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. He was paid in 1559 for the cartoons for a series of three tapestries on the Story of Saturn, the original designs of which were made by Vasari. These tapestries were intended for the Terrazo di Saturno in the Palazzo Vecchio. Stradanus changed the original designs of Vasari for the series. In 1559 Stradanus designed the cartoons on the theme of the Life of Man for the Quartiere di Leonora in the Palazzo Vecchio. The series was completed in 1565 and only four tapestries survive. Stradanus further designed cartoons for a six-piece series of Roman women (realised in 1562-1564), a series of four on the Story of Esther and Ahasuerus (realised in 1562-1564) and a six piece series of the Story of Ulysses (realised in 1563-1565) for the Sala di Penelope. Stradanus designed cartoons for a series of four on the Story of David for the Quartiere di Cosimo (realised in 1561-1562), a four piece series of the Story of Solomon (realised in 1564-1565), two sets of the Story of Cyrus comprising 13 tapestries (realised in 1565-1567) and two more series of the Story of David. He further provided designs for cartoons for a series of tapestries on the History of the Medici for the Quartiere di Leone X (realised in 1569-1574).Campbell, Thomas P. (2002). Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art-Yale University Press. pp. 502-504 Cosimo wanted to decorate his outdoor villa in Poggio a Caiano with tapestries. Stradanus developed a decorative project with hunting scenes divided in three categories: hunts for four-legged animals, animals in the air and animals in the water. The designs were inspired by contemporary sources, the classical literature of Pliny, Homer and Herodotus, as well as the hunting practices at the Florentine court. The designs were received with great acclaim. Stradanus completed 28 cartoons for the series, which was woven between 1566 and 1577. The designs for these tapestries were later published as prints by printers in Antwerp such as Philip Galle and other international publishing houses. =Prints= The invention of printing from the Nova reperta, c. 1590 Stradanus became interested in working for the printers in the 1570s in particular after his visit to Antwerp in 1578. Initially, he provided existing designs he had created for his paintings and tapestries to the publishers to be turned into prints. The Antwerp publisher Hieronymus Cock published in 1570 a series of prints after Stradanus' designs for the tapestries of hunting scenes he made for the Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo I de' Medici. From 1576 the design of prints became one of the principal activities of Stradanus. He later worked with Philip Galle as his main publisher, likely as a result of meeting with Galle in Antwerp during his visit in 1578. Stradanus' virtuoso drawings were engraved by some of the leading engravers of the second half of the sixteenth century, among them Hendrick Goltzius, Philip Galle and his sons Theodoor and Cornelis, Hans Collaert and his sons Adriaen and Jan, and members of the Sadeler family and the Wierix brothers. The subjects of the prints were wide-ranging and were in the first place geared towards the demand on the international market for prints that was supplied by the Antwerp printers. After the take-over by Antwerp by the Catholics, the preference was for counter-reformation themes such as the two Passion cycles, series on the life of the Virgin and the life of St. John the Baptist, the Acts of the Apostles, two series of the Resurrection of Christ and countless loose devotional prints that Stradanus designed. Lucifer Appearing to Dante and Virgil In addition, Stradanus drew inspiration for subjects from the Florentine intellectual and literary climate in which he lived. Important were his contacts with the exiled Florentine writer and scholar Luigi Alamanni and other members of the Alamanni family who are mentioned in various commissions and dedications to prints. Luigi Alamanni likely inspired Stradanus to illustrate the entire Divina Commedia. Stradanus made a number of drawings for this project which was never completed. Only one of these drawings, depicting Canto 34 of Hell, where Dante and Vergilius look at Lucifer in the center of the earth, was engraved by Philip Galle. Other themes that tie in with similar intellectual interest are the Nova reperta, depicting inventions of the modern era ending with a print showing an active printshop and the Americae retectio, a so-called 'picture atlas', issued in leaflet form to commemorate the first centenary of the discovery of the New World. It has been argued that the two prints in the Nova reperta series on America of which one shows Amerigo Vespucci's first encounter with the New World and the four symbolic prints making up the Americae retectio series were aimed at showing the presumed important role played by Florence in the discovery of America as Vespucci was a Florentine. The prints and their allegorical symbols were disseminated widely through the next century and informed the contemporary perception of America.Lia Markey, Stradano’s Allegorical Invention of the Americas in Late Sixteenth-Century Florence, in: Renaissance Quarterly Renaissance Quarterly Vol. 65, No. 2 (Summer 2012), pp. 385-442 He also designed a series depicting the Horses of the Stable of John of Austria and the Illustrious acts of Roman women. In yet another genre of print designs, aimed at a wider audience, Stradanus referred back to the subjects which he had elaborated as a court artist to the Medici court in his designs of tapestries and frescoes in the Palazzo Vecchio: a series that recounts the history and production of silk, an extensive series on the military triumphs of the Medici and a series depicting hunts of various animals published under the title Venationes Ferarum, Avium, Piscium. While some of the hunts in the last series are depicted in a relatively realistic manner, such as the dramatic rendering of horsemen with lances trying to kill a lion that fiercely resists, other hunts seem rather unrealistic such as the print showing leopards being caught with the help of mirrors. One of his most famous loose prints was the Allegory of the arts engraved by Cornelis Cort in 1578.

A common view is that the Dievs is at the same time the transcendent fountain of reality, the matter-energy substrate, and the law ordaining the universe. The movement was started in 1925 by Ernests Brastiņš with the publication of the book entitled Revival of Latvian Dievturība.Latvian Encyclopedia of Religions: Neopagānisms / dievturi. After the annexation of Latvia to the Soviet Union the Dievturi were repressed, but the movement continued to operate among exiles.

There are also Romuviai in Norway. Practising the Romuva faith is seen by many adherents as a form of cultural pride, along with celebrating traditional forms of art, retelling Baltic folklore, practising traditional holidays, playing traditional Baltic music, singing traditional dainas or hymns and songs as well as ecological activism and stewarding sacred places.Dundzila and Strmiska (2005), p. 244. =Other= The re-enactment group Vilkatlakai, originally named Baltuva, formed in Lithuania in 1995 and is distinguished by its masculine vision of Baltic paganism.Pranskevičiūtė and Aleknaitė (2014), p. 172.

They were also critical of Romuva's openness to the media and other outsiders at religious events.

She was one of the handful of European Radicals in Sri Lanka.  Early years  She was born in Gillingham, Kent. Her father, Major William Leo Hoban was a British featherweight boxer and former soldier of Irish roots, her mother, May Irene Free, was a small businesswoman of partly Jewish extraction. Her early life was spent in a variety of Army camps. In 1936, her father was appointed an instructor at Eton College, and they settled in Slough. She attended Slough High School for Girls, where she became Head Girl in 1942. During the Second World War, she was once machine-gunned by a Nazi Luftwaffe aircraft. Although selected for London University, she had to do her two-year National Service as a government inspector in the Bristol aircraft factory at Staines. There she joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1943. She was a member of the Transport and General Workers' Union and came from a fairly radical background – the Merseyside branch of what would later become the Militant tendency used to meet in her aunt's house in Birkenhead. To the end of her life, she maintained that the members of the CPGB were the most dedicated and conscientious political workers she ever knew. At University College London and LSE, she studied law. There she met her future husband, Anil Moonesinghe, who converted her to Trotskyism, and also a young conscientious objector called Stan Newens, who would later become a Labour Party MP and MEP.  RCP and Labour Party  The three of them joined the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), and Jeanne was elected to its National Executive. She fell out early with Gerry Healy, who was most prominent in the RCP at the time, but remained close to Ted Grant. She was associated with the group around Tony Cliff, the so-called State-Caps after their characterisation of the USSR as state- capitalist. The group would later become the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). She married Anil Moonesinghe in 1948 and they moved into a houseboat called Red October, which they built together, on the Thames near Marlow. They both entered the Labour Party in Slough, on the orders of the RCP. Jeanne was elected to the Executive of the Labour Leagues of Youth, later being put on the list of Labour Party Parliamentary candidates. She and Anil were associated with the MP for Slough Fenner Brockway and with George Padmore, the prophet of Black African Liberation. After graduating from University College, she studied International Law at the London School of Economics. However, she was unable to complete her master's degree as she was forced to accompany Anil to Sri Lanka in 1952.  Sri Lanka  In Sri Lanka, Jeanne joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and worked in the Lanka Estate Workers' Union (LEWU), which organised labourers on the tea and rubber plantations. At the time the British were still very powerful on the island, in spite of the country having obtained a form of independence in 1948. The British planters, aghast at the idea of a white woman speaking on behalf of coolies, prevailed upon the government to deport Jeanne, but she went into hiding with Vivienne Goonewardena and the LSSP fought successfully to prevent the deportation, in a repeat of the Bracegirdle affair. = Lake House and the CMU = She joined the Lake House group of newspapers as a journalist, recruited by chief editor Esmond Wickremasinghe (the father of Ranil Wickremasinghe) along with other left-oriented intellectuals such as Herbert Keuneman and Regi Siriwardena. She had a column (under the pseudonym Jane Freeman) in The Observer and also worked on the Jana magazine. In 1955, she was called upon by Wickremasinghe to help write the a speech for Sir John Kotelawala, the then Prime Minister. This was the Bandung Conference of Non-Aligned Movement, and the speech, which became quite famous, was a joint effort with the brilliant B.J.B. Fernando (Bonnie). In the mid-1950s, she joined Sri Lanka's first co-operative housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society, founded by Herbert Keuneman, Seneka Bibile, Bonnie Fernando and other members of the radical intelligentsia. This led to the foundation of the Welikadawatte housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity. Jeanne formed a journalists' branch of the Ceylon Mercantile Union (CMU) at Lake House, much to the chagrin of the management which had strenuously upheld a no unions policy. She was elected national Assistant Secretary of union, a post she held for several years. In 1960, she and several other trade-unionists were sacked from Lake House and were not reinstated. At this time she edited Visi-pas-vasarak, a magazine brought out by the LSSP on its 25th anniversary. In the 1960s, she was involved in the Union's publications and was active in many strikes of the period. = Teaching, journalism and broadcasting = In need of employment, Jeanne turned to teaching at the Terence de Zilva School in Kolonnawa. She subsequently joined the Ghana High Commission (at the time Kwame Nkrumah was President and had been advised by George Padmore) as a press officer, but returned to teaching at the Castle Street School (later Devi Balika Vidyalaya) in Borella, St Michael's Polwatte and St Paul's Milagiriya. She went on to edit the left-wing Patriot newspaper. She was also foreign news editor of the Nation newspaper. In 1967, her she was one of those proposed to contest the Agalawatte constituency on the LSSP ticket, but Dr Colvin R de Silva was selected by the party's central committee in preference to her. She became active in the Kantha Kavaya, a circle of leftist women led by Tamara Kumari Ilangaratne. One of the proposals she made through this organisation, for a consumer council, was later adopted. In 1968 she began broadcasting on the arts programme of Radio Ceylon. From 1970–72 she presented a radio programme, Partners for Progress. = Education reform = In 1972, as part of the ongoing educational reforms instituted by the United Front government, she was appointed to a committee to look into the teaching of English in Sri Lanka Schools. She was seconded to the Curriculum Development Centre, where she edited its bulletin. There she was on the drafting committee of a new series of English Language textbooks. She was associated with a group of educationists led by Douglas Walatara, who wanted to teach English through the medium of the students' mother tongue, the indirect method. The new English textbook, which replaced the GCE (Advanced Level) English textbook, and which she was partly responsible for, was controversial, avoiding Chaucer and Shakespeare, but including Bob Dylan (Blowin' in the Wind), John Lennon (Imagine) and Isaac Asimov (Jokester) – her personal favourite, Arthur C. Clarke's (\\"The Star\\"), was left out for fear of offending Roman Catholics. She returned to England for a short time and was active in the Anti-Nazi League and the trade union movement. In 1981, she returned to Sri Lanka once again. She died in 1997 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. She left two children, Janaki and Vinod.

He studied at the Kharkiv Music and Drama Institute (graduated 1926) with S. Bogatyryov. He taught at the Kharkiv Conservatory (professor, 1960). Among his students were Valentin Bibik, Vitaliy Hubarenko, and Viktor Suslin. Ukrainian composer Dmitri Lvovich Klebanov (1907–1987) is one of a long row of Soviet composers who have more or less disappeared completely from sight. He composed in most genres, including operas and symphonies. Klebanov studied music academically as a pianist, violist, conductor, and composer, and became a professor of composition at the Kharkiv Conservatory. In the late 1930s and early 1940s a couple of ballets, a violin concerto, and a symphony received major performances in Moscow and Kiev. Unfortunately, the first symphony \\"In Memoriam to the Martyrs of Babi Yar\\" (1945) fell afoul of Stalinist critics who found it anti-patriotic. Being accused of distortion of the historic truth about the Soviet people and of national narrow-mindedness it was exiled for a life in archives. Stalin made his infamous attack on Soviet artists. The Soviet Composers' Union adopted the unwritten rule that one composer would be selected to take the heat for all of them—Klebanov was it. Although Klebanov was spared exile to Siberia, or worse, he was relegated to an obscure existence and spent most of this period composing politically correct works of \\"socialist realism\\" with titles like Ode for the Party and \\"First of May\\" Symphony. Following thirty years in de facto exile, Klebanov thawed out with the rest of the USSR in the 1980s. In 1983, Mela Tenenbaum (violinist/violist) was in Kharkiv to play a viola concerto written for her by a pupil of Klebanov, whom she met after the concert. Klebanov suggested Ms. Tenenbaum perform his own Violin Concerto, and after the success of that venture the following season, he wrote a viola concerto expressly for her. This work had a positive reception in several Russian cities and Klebanov found his long- stifled creative energies reviving. Another new work followed, Japanese Silhouettes for soprano, viola d'amore and instrumental ensemble, based on haiku texts translated into Russian. This work was recorded for Radio Kiev with soprano Natalia Kraftzova, and a \\"rehabilitation\\" of Klebanov seemed imminent. But the composer died in 1987, just short of his 80th birthday, and soon artistic chaos engulfed the disintegrating Soviet Union. His music disappeared and was thought to have been lost in a fire and flood which destroyed the Musical Foundation building where his scores were kept.

Fire ritual at the Temple of Svarozhich in Krasotinka. The Slavic Native Faith, commonly known as Rodnovery, and rarely as Slavic Neopaganism, is a modern Pagan religion. Classified as a new religious movement, its practitioners harken back to the historical belief systems of the Slavic peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, though the movement is inclusive of external influences and hosts a variety of currents. \\"Rodnovery\\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as Vedism, Orthodoxy, and Old Belief. Many Rodnovers regard their religion as a faithful continuation of ancient beliefs that survived as folk religion or as conscious \\"double belief\\" following the Christianisation of the Slavs in the Middle Ages. Rodnovery draws upon surviving historical and archaeological sources and folk religion, often integrating them with non-Slavic sources such as Hinduism (as they are believed to be coming from the same Proto-Indo-European source). Rodnover theology and cosmology may be described as pantheism and polytheism—worship of the supreme God of the universe and of the multiple gods, ancestors and spirits of nature identified through Slavic culture. Adherents usually meet together in groups to conduct religious ceremonies. These typically entail the invocation of gods, sacrifices and the pouring of libations, dances and a communal meal. Rodnover ethical thinking emphasises the good of the collective over the rights of the individual. The religion is patriarchal, and attitudes towards sex and gender are generally conservative. Rodnovery has developed distinctive strains of political and identitary philosophy. Rodnover organisations often characterise themselves as ethnic religions, emphasising that the religion is bound to Slavic ethnicity. This often manifests in forms of nationalism, opposition to miscegenation and the belief in the fundamental difference of racial groups. Rodnovers often glorify Slavic history, criticising the impact of Christianity in Slavic countries and arguing that these nations will play a central role in the world's future. Rodnovers share a strong feeling that their religion represents a paradigmatic shift which will overcome the mental constraints imposed through feudalism and the continuation of what they call \\"mono-ideologies\\". The contemporary organised Rodnovery movement arose from a multiplicity of sources and charismatic leaders just at the brink of the collapse of the Soviet Union and spread rapidly by the mid-1990s and the 2000s. Antecedents are to be found in late 18th- and 19th-century Slavic Romanticism, which glorified the pre- Christian beliefs of Slavic societies. Active religious practitioners devoted to establishing Slavic Native Faith appeared in Poland and Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Soviet Union under the leadership of Joseph Stalin promoted research into ancient Slavic religion. Following the Second World War and the establishment of communist states throughout the Eastern Bloc, new variants were established by Slavic emigrants living in Western countries, being later introduced in Central and Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent times, the movement has been increasingly studied in academic scholarship. Overview Russian Rodnover women with child. A Polish Rodnover outdoors altar. Scholars of religion regard Slavic Native Faith as a modern Pagan religion. They also characterise it as a new religious movement. The movement has no overarching structure, or accepted religious authority, and contains much diversity in terms of belief and practice. The sociologist of religion Kaarina Aitamurto has suggested that Rodnovery is sufficiently heterogeneous that it could be regarded not as a singular religion but as \\"an umbrella term that gathers together various forms of religiosity\\". The historian Marlène Laruelle has described Rodnovery as \\"more inclusive than just adherence to a pantheon of pre-Christian gods\\". The scholar of religion Alexey Gaidukov has described \\"Slavic Neopaganism\\" as a term pertaining to \\"all quasi-religious, political, ideological and philosophical systems which are based on the reconstruction and construction of pre-Christian Slavic traditions\\". The scholar of religion Adrian Ivakhiv has defined Rodnovery as a movement which \\"harkens back to the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of ancient Slavic peoples\\", while according to the historian and ethnologist Victor A. Shnirelman, Rodnovers present themselves as \\"followers of some genuine pre-Christian Slavic, Russian or Slavic-Aryan Paganism\\". Some involved in the movement avoid calling their belief system either \\"paganism\\" or \\"religion\\". Many Rodnovers refer to their belief system as an \\"ethnic religion\\", and Rodnover groups were involved in establishing the European Congress of Ethnic Religions. The usage of this term suggests that the religion is restricted to a particular ethnic group. Some practitioners regard \\"ethnic religion\\" as a term synonymous with \\"Native Faith\\", but others perceive there as being a distinction between the two terms. Laruelle has emphasised that Rodnovery \\"cannot necessarily be defined as a religion in the strict sense\\"; some adherents prefer to define it as a \\"spirituality\\" (dukhovnost), \\"wisdom\\" (mudrost), or a \\"philosophy\\" or \\"worldview\\" (mirovozzrenie). According to Shnirelman, it was the Soviet Union's official scientific atheism, which severely weakened the infrastructure of universalist religions, combined with anti-Westernism and the research of intellectuals into an ancient \\"Vedic\\" religion of Russia, that paved the way for the rise of Rodnovery and other modern Paganisms in Eastern Europe. After the Soviet Union, the pursuit of Rodnovery matured into the spiritual cultivation of organic folk communities (ethnoi) in the face of what Rodnovers consider as the alien cosmopolitan forces which drive global assimilation (what they call \\"mono-ideologies\\"), chiefly represented by the Abrahamic religions. In the Russian intellectual milieu, Rodnovery usually presents itself as the ideology of \\"nativism\\" (narodnichestvo), which in Rodnovers' own historical analysis is destined to supplant the mono-ideologies whose final bankruptcy the world is now witnessing. =Rodnovery as a new synthesis= Shnirelman has stated that Rodnovery does not actually constitute the \\"restoration of any pre-Christian religion as such\\". Rather, he describes the movement as having been \\"built up artificially by urbanised intellectuals who use fragments of early pre- Christian local beliefs and rites in order to restore national spirituality\\". In this way, Slavic Native Faith has been understood—at least in part—as an invented tradition, or a form of Folklorismus. Simpson has noted, speaking of the specific context of Poland, that unlike historical Slavic beliefs, which were integral to the everyday fabric of their society, modern Slavic Native Faith believers have to develop new forms of social organisation which set them apart from established society. Textual evidence for historical Slavic religion is scant, has been produced by Christian writers hostile to the systems being described and is usually open to multiple interpretations. In developing Slavic Native Faith, practitioners draw upon the primary sources about the historical religion of Slavic peoples, as well as elements drawn from later Slavic folklore, official and popular Christian belief and from non-Slavic societies. Among these foreign influences have been beliefs and practices drawn from Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Germanic Heathenry, Siberian shamanism, as well as ideas drawn from various forms of esotericism. Other influences include documents like the Book of Veles, which claim to be genuine accounts of historical Slavic religion but which academics recognise as later compositions. According to the folklorist Mariya Lesiv, through this syncretic process, \\"a new religion is being created on the basis of the synthesis of elements from various traditions\\". Some Rodnovers do not acknowledge this practice of syncretism and instead profess an explicitly anti-syncretic attitude, emphasising the need to retain the \\"purity\\" of the religion and thus maintain its \\"authenticity\\". Other Rodnovers are conscious that the movement represents a synthesis of different sources, that what is known about ancient Slavic religion is very fragmented, and therefore the reconstruction requires innovation. Laruelle has thus defined Rodnovery as an \\"open-source religion\\", that is to say a religion which \\"emphasizes individual participation and doctrinal evolution, and calls for the personal creation of religious belief systems\\". =Slavic folk religion and double belief= The Fiery Chariot of the Word—19th-century Russian Old Believers' icon of the Theotokos as Ognyena Maria (\\"Fiery Mary\\"), fire goddess sister of Perun. p. 905. Belief in a mother goddess as the receptacle of life, Mat Syra Zemlya (\\"Damp Mother Earth\\"), was preserved in Russian folk religion up to the 20th century, often disguised as the Virgin Mary of Christianity. The fiery \\"six- petaled roses\\" that umbego the Ognyena are one of the variants of the whirling symbol of the supreme God (Rod) and of its sons. A different perspective is offered by the historian Svetlana M. Chervonnaya, who has seen the return to folk beliefs among Slavs as part of a broader phenomenon that is happening to \\"the mass religious mind\\" not merely of Slavic or Eastern European peoples, but to peoples all over Asia, and that expresses itself in new mythologemes endorsed by national elites. The notion that modern Rodnovery is closely tied to the historical Slavic religion is a very strong one among practitioners. In crafting their beliefs and practices, Rodnovers adopt elements from recorded folk culture, including from the ethnographic record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Practitioners often legitimise the incorporation of elements from folk culture into Slavic Native Faith through the argument that Slavic folk practices have long reflected the so-called \\"double belief\\" (dvoeverie), a conscious preservation of pre-Christian beliefs and practices alongside Christianity. This is a concept that was especially popular among nineteenth-century ethnographers who were influenced by Romanticism and retains widespread popularity across Eastern Europe, but has come under criticism in more recent times. Slavic Christianity was influenced by indigenous beliefs and practices as it was established in the Middle Ages and these folk practices changed greatly over the intervening millennia; according to this, Rodnovers claim that they are just continuing living tradition. The concept of double belief is especially significant in Russia and for the identity of the Russian Orthodox Church and the folk Orthodoxy of the Old Believers; in that country, it is an oft-cited dictum that \\"although Russia was baptised, it was never Christianised\\". The movement of the Old Believers is a form of \\"folk Orthodoxy\\", a coalescence of Pagan, Gnostic and unofficial Orthodox currents, that by the mid-seventeenth century seceded from the Russian Orthodox Church (the Raskol, \\"Schism\\"), channelling the \\"mass religious dissent\\" of the Russian common people towards the Church, viewed as the religion of the central state and the aristocracy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a new wave of scholarly debate on the subject within Russia itself. A. E. Musin, an academic and deacon of the Russian Orthodox Church published an article about the \\"problem of double belief\\" as recently as 1991. In this article he divides scholars between those who say that Russian Orthodoxy adapted to entrenched indigenous faith, continuing the Soviet idea of an \\"undefeated paganism\\", and those who say that Russian Orthodoxy is an out-and-out syncretic religion. Slavic Native Faith adherents, as far as they are concerned, believe that they can take traditional folk culture, remove the obviously Christian elements and be left with something that authentically reflects the historical beliefs of the Slavic peoples. According to Ivakhiv, despite the intense efforts of Christian authorities, the Christianisation of the Slavs, and especially of Russians, was very slow and resulted in a \\"thorough synthesis of Pagan and Christian elements\\", reflected for instance in the refashioning of gods as Christian saints (Perun as Saint Elias, Veles as Saint Blasius and Yarilo as Saint George) and in the overlapping of Christian festivals on Pagan ones. The scholar of Russian folk religion Linda J. Ivanits has reported ethnographic studies documenting that even in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Russia there were entire villages maintaining indigenous religious beliefs, whether in pure form or under the cover of a superficial Christianity. According to her, the case of Russia is exceptional compared to western Europe, because Russia neither lived the intellectual upheavals of the Renaissance, nor the Reformation, nor the other movements which severely weakened folk spirituality in Europe. =Symbolism= :'''' Kolovrat, Hands of Svarog, Thundermark, symbol of Veles. The most commonly used religious symbol within Rodnovery is the kolovrat (\\"spinning wheel\\"), a variant of the swastika (Sanskrit: \\"wellbeing\\", \\"wellness\\"). As such, it represents wholeness, the ultimate source of renewal, the cosmic order and the four directions. According to the studies of Boris Rybakov, whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the \\"six- petalled rose inside a circle\\" (e.g. 30px) and the \\"thunder mark\\" (gromovoi znak), represent the supreme God (Rod), expressing itself as power of birth and reproduction, in its various forms (whether Triglav, Svetovid, Perun and other gods) and were still carved in folk traditions of north Russia up to the nineteenth century. The contemporary design of the symbol called kolovrat, the eight-spoked wheel, used by Rodnovers was already present in woodcuts produced in the 1920s by the Polish artist Stanisław Jakubowski, under the name słoneczko (\\"little sun\\"). Illustrations of Jakubowski's artworks. According to Laruelle, Rodnovers believe that it is a symbol of \\"accession to the upper world\\". For some Rodnovers, the Orthodox cross is another Slavic version of the swastika. Terminology =\\"Rodnovery\\" (Native Faith)= The Anglicised term \\"Rodnovery\\", and its adjective \\"Rodnover(s)\\", have gained widespread usage in English and have been given an entry in the second edition (2019) of the academic Historical Dictionary of the Russian Federation. It means \\"Native Faith\\" and it is the name used by the majority of the movement's adherents. The term is adapted from Slavic forms, and variations of it are used in different Slavic languages: for instance, in Ukrainian it is Ridnovirstvo or Ridnovirya, in Russian Rodnoverie, in Polish Rodzimowierstwo, and in Czech Rodnovĕří. The term derives from the Proto-Slavic roots *rod, which means anything \\"indigenous\\", \\"ancestral\\" and \\"native\\", also \\"genus\\", \\"generation\\", \\"kin\\", \\"race\\" (e.g. Russian rodnaya or rodnoy); and *vera, which means \\"faith\\", \\"religion\\". Within the movement, it has also been used to define the community of Native Faith practitioners themselves as an elective group. The term has different histories and associations in each of the Slavic languages in which it appears. The suffix \\"-ism\\" is usually avoided in favour of others that describe the religion as if it were a practice or craft (which is the meaning of the Ukrainian and Russian suffix -stvo, thus translatable with the English suffix \\"-ery, -ry\\"). The Svetoary community of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities celebrating Mokosh. Sometimes the term \\"Rodnovery\\" has also been interpreted as meaning \\"faith of Rod\\", a reference to an eponymous concept of supreme God, Rod, found in ancient Russian and Ukrainian sources. Aitamurto stated that in addition to being the most used term, it is the most appropriate because of its meanings. It has deep senses related to its Slavic etymology, that would be lost through translation, which express the central concepts of the Slavic Native Faith. Rod is conceived as the absolute, primordial God, supreme ancestor of the universe, that begets all things, and at the same time as the kin, the lineage of generation which is the ancestral bond to the supreme source. Rodna or rodnaya is itself a concept which can denote the \\"nearest and dearest\\", and such impersonal community as one's native home or land. A variant of \\"Rodnovery\\" is \\"Rodianism\\" (Rodianstvo), which Laruelle also translates as \\"Ancestrism\\". The earliest known usage of this term was by the Ukrainian emigree Lev Sylenko, who in 1964 established a mimeographed publication in Canada that was titled Ridna Vira (\\"Native Faith\\"). The portmanteau Ridnovir began to be used by Ukrainians to refer to the broader movement (not restricted to Sylenkoism) by at least 1995. From Ukraine, the term began to spread throughout other Slavic countries. In 1996, it was adopted by a Polish group, the Association of Native Faith (Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary) and in 1997 by the Russian Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities (Союз Славянских Общин Славянской Родной Веры). By the early 2000s, the term was widespread across Slavic language countries. In 2002, six Russian Rodnover organisations issued the \\"Bittsa Appeal\\" (Bittsevskoe Obraschchenie), in which, among the many topics discussed, they expressed the view that \\"Rodnovery\\" should be regarded as the foremost name of the religion. The spread of the term reflected the degree of solidarity in establishing a broader brand and a sense of international movement despite the disagreements and power struggles that permeated the groups. The term also came to be applied to the modern Pagan religions of non-Slavic groups; for instance, in the Polish language Lithuanian Romuva has been referred to as Rodzimowierstwo litewskie (\\"Lithuanian Native Faith\\") and Celtic Paganism has been referred to as Rodzimowierstwo celtyckie (\\"Celtic Native Faith\\"). =\\"Orthodoxy\\", \\"Old Belief\\", \\"Vedism\\" and other terms= Outdoors shrine (kapishche) at the Temple of Svarozhich's Fire in Krasotinka, Kaluga Oblast, Russia. The appropriate name of the religion is an acute topic of discussion among believers. Many Rodnovers have adopted terms that are already used to refer to other religions, namely \\"Vedism\\", referring to the historical Vedic religion and the ancient Iranian religion, and \\"Orthodoxy\\", commonly associated to Orthodox Christianity. For instance, one of the earliest branches of Rodnovery is known as \\"Peterburgian Vedism\\". They explain that \\"Vedism\\" derives from the word \\"to know\\" and implies that rather than dogmatically believing (verit), Vedists \\"know\\" or \\"see\\" (vedat) spiritual truths. The term was first employed by Yuri P. Mirolyubov—the writer or discoverer of the Book of Veles—in the mid-twentieth century, and later adopted by the founder of Peterburgian Vedism, Viktor Bezverkhy. In Ukraine and Russia many important Rodnover groups advocate the designation of \\"Orthodoxy\\" (Russian: Pravoslaviye, Serbian: Pravoslavlje, Ukrainian: Pravoslavya) for themselves. They claim that the term, which refers to the \\"praise\\" or \\"glorification\\" (slava) of the universal order (Prav, cf. Vedic Ṛta, \\"Right\\"), was usurped by the Christians. Another term employed by Rodnovers, but historically associated to the Russian Orthodox Christian movement of the Old Believers, is \\"Starovery\\" (Russian: Старове́ры Starovéry, \\"Old Faith\\"). Some Slovenian practitioners use the Slovenian language term ajd, which is a loan-word of the Germanic-language heathen. When using English language terms to describe their religion, some Rodnovers favour \\"Heathen\\", in part due to a perceived affinity with the contemporary Germanic Heathens who also commonly use that term. Another term employed by some Rodnovers has been \\"Slavianism\\" or \\"Slavism\\", which appears especially in Polish (Słowiaństwo), in Russian (Slavianstvo), and in Slovak (Slovianstvo). The ethnonym \\"Slavs\\" (Polish: Słowianie, South Slavic: Sloveni, Russian: Slavyane), derives from the Proto-Slavic root *slovo, \\"word\\", and means \\"those who speak the same words\\", and according to Rodnovers it has the religious connotation of \\"praising one's gods\\". =General descriptors: Western \\"pagan\\" and Slavic yazychnik= Ringing Cedars' Rodnovers gathering on Kupala holiday, at the kinship settlement Silver Forest (Серебряный Бор, Serebrany Bor) in Ustinka, Belgorod Oblast, Russia. In Slavic languages the closest equivalent of \\"paganism\\" is poganstvo (taking for instance Russian; it itself deriving from Latin paganus), although Rodnovers widely reject this term due to its derogatory connotations. Indeed, many Slavic languages have two terms that are conventionally rendered as \\"pagan\\" in Western languages: the aforementioned pogan and yazychnik. The latter, which is a derivation of the near-homophonous yazyk, \\"tongue\\", is prevalent and has a less negative acceptation, literally meaning \\"pertaining to (our own) language\\". It is often more accurately (though by no means thoroughly) translated as \\"Gentile\\" (i.e. pertaining \\"to the gens\\", \\"to the kin\\"), which in turn it itself renders in Slavic translations of the Bible. Some Russian and Ukrainian Rodnovers employ, respectively, Yazychestvo and Yazychnytstvo (i.e. \\"our own language craft\\", \\"Gentility\\"), but it is infrequent. Yazychnik has been adopted especially among Rodnovers speaking West Slavic languages, where it has not any connotations related to \\"paganism\\". Thus, Czech Rodnover groups have coined Jazyčnictví and Slovak Rodnovers have coined Jazyčníctvo. By the mid-1930s, the term \\"Neopagan\\" had been applied to the Polish Zadrugist movement. It was adopted among Rodnovers in the 1990s—when it appeared in such forms as the Russian Neoyazychestvo and the Polish Neopogaństwo—but had been eclipsed by \\"Slavic Native Faith\\" in the 2000s. However, the prefix \\"neo-\\" within \\"Neopaganism\\" is a divisive issue among Rodnovers. Some practitioners dislike it because it minimises the continuity of indigenous pre-Christian beliefs. They regard themselves as restoring the original belief system rather than creating something new. Others embrace the term as a means of emphasising what they regard as the reformed nature of the religion; the Polish Rodnover Maciej Czarnowski for instance encouraged the term because it distinguished his practices from those of the pre-Christian societies, which he regarded as being hindered by superstition and unnecessary practices like animal sacrifice. Many Rodnovers straightforwardly reject the designator \\"paganism\\", whether \\"neo-\\", \\"modern\\", \\"contemporary\\" or without prefixes and further qualificators, asserting that these are \\"poorly defined\\" concepts whose use by scholars leads to a situation in which Rodnovery is lumped together with \\"all kinds of cults and religions\\" which have nothing to do with it. Beliefs =Theology and cosmology= The Seven Gods—Russian artist Maxim Sukharev, 2010s. The artwork represents the supreme God (Rod) manifested as a sevenfold hierarchy, according to Slavic theo-cosmology. Prior to their Christianisation, the Slavic peoples were polytheists, worshipping multiple deities who were regarded as the emanations of a supreme God. According to Helmold's Chronica Slavorum (compiled 1168–1169), \\"obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods\\". Belief in these deities varied according to location and through time, and it was common for the Slavs to adopt deities from neighbouring cultures. Both in Russia and in Ukraine, modern Rodnovers are divided among those who are monotheists and those who are polytheists. Some practitioners describe themselves as atheists, believing that gods are not real entities but rather ideal symbols. Monotheism and polytheism are not regarded as mutually exclusive. The shared underpinning is a pantheistic view that is holistic in its understanding of the universe. Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of monism, by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God—generally identified by the concept of Rod, also known as Sud (\\"Judge\\") and Prabog (\\"Pre-God\\", \\"First God\\") among South Slavs. In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important. The root *rod is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality. Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \\"primordial God\\", but the term also literally means the generative power of family and \\"kin\\", \\"birth\\", \\"origin\\" and \\"fate\\" as well. Its negative form, urod, means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous. Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations. Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal emanation, which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods; Rod expresses itself as Prav (literally \\"Right\\" or \\"Order\\"; cf. Greek Orthotes, Sanskrit Ṛta) in primordial undeterminacy (chaos), through a dual dynamism, represented by Belobog (\\"White God\\") and Chernobog (\\"Black God\\"), the forces of waxing and waning, and then giving rise to the world in its three qualities, Prav-Yav-Nav. Triglav (\\"Three-Headed One\\") and Svetovid (\\"Worldseer\\") are concepts representing the axis mundi and, respectively, the three qualities of reality and their realisation in the four dimensions of space. When emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as rodnianin, \\"believers in God\\" (or \\"in nativity\\", \\"in genuinity\\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities. This theological explanation is called \\"manifestationism\\" by some contemporary Rodnovers and implies the idea of a spirit–matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, Perun). In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \\"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\\". Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript The Lay of Igor's Host may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of Dazhbog (the \\"Giving God\\", \\"Day God\\"). Statue of Svetovid in Kyiv. The four-faced \\"Worldseer\\" represents (according to the Book of Veles) Prav, Yav and Nav in the four directions of space. Pantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith. Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others. The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod; these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as Vyshen, i.e. Vishnu, and Intra, i.e. Indra), Iranian deities (such as Simargl and Khors), deities from the Book of Veles (such as Pchelich) and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard Koschei. Another Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolay Speransky (volkhv Velimir), emphasises a dualistic eternal struggle between forces of good and evil; the former represented by Belobog, who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog, who created the human body. Rodnovers also believe and worship tutelary deities of specific elements, lands and environments, such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry Veles is called upon as the god of literature and communication. In Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic. In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism. Conversely, Sylenko's Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira; also called \\"Sylenkoism\\") regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God who they identify with the name Dazhbog. For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos. Sylenko characterised Dazhbog as \\"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\\". Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as pantheistic or panentheistic rather than monotheistic. Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted. A similar view is espoused by Russian Ynglism. Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \\"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\\". For Native Ukrainian National Faith's members, polytheism is regarded as backward. Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion. =Morality and ethics= Rodnover wedding ceremony. Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a kapy (pole) of Perun, in Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine. Rodnovery emphasises the \\"this-worldliness\\" of morality and moral thinking, seen as a voluntary and thoughtful responsibility towards the others that sprouts from the awareness of the interconnectedness of all things and of the continuity of spirit–matter and not as a strict set of rules. Although some Rodnovers believe in an afterlife, Iriy or Vyriy, they argue that retribution is not deferred to such future; since gods manifest themselves as the natural phenomena, and in people as lineage descendants, Rodnovers believe that actions and their outcomes unfold and are to be dealt with in the present world. People are viewed as having unique responsibilities towards their own contexts: for instance, the duty of parents is to take care of their children and that of children to take care of their parents, the right of ancestors is to be honoured, and the land deserves to be cultivated. Rodnovers blame Christianity for transferring personal responsibility into a transcendent future, when actions will be judged by God and people either smitten or forgiven for their sins, in fact exempting people from responsibility. According to Rodnovers, justice and truth have to be realised in this life, so that \\"turning the other cheek\\", waiving agency and intervention in the things of this world, is considered immoral and equivalent to welcoming wrongness. In other words, fleeing from the commitment towards the forces at play in the present context is the same as denying the gods; it disrupts morality, impairing the individual, society and the world itself. Rodnovers value individual responsibility as the cornerstone for the further maturation of humanity, equating the conversion to Rodnovery with such maturation. This emphasis on individuality is not at odds with the value of solidarity, since collective responsibility is seen as arising from the union of the right free decisions of reflexive individuals. By using terms of Émile Durkheim, Aitamurto says that what Rodnovers reject is \\"egoistic individualism\\", not \\"moral individualism\\". Immediately related to the morality of a responsible community is the respect for the natural world in general, or what Aitamurto defines \\"ecological responsibility\\". However, have been difficulties with Rodnover involvement in the wider environmentalist movement as a result of many environmentalists' unease with the racial and anti-Christian themes that are prominent in the religion. Rodnover ethics deal with a wide range of contemporary social issues, and they can be defined as conservative. Aitamurto summarised Rodnover ethics in the concepts of patriarchy, solidarity and homogeneity, with the latter two seen as intrinsically related. Laruelle similarly found an emphasis on patriarchy, heterosexuality, traditional family, fidelity and procreation. Shnirelman observed that Rodnovers' calls for social justice tend to apply only to their own ethnic community. Within Rodnovery, gender roles are conservative. Rodnovers often subscribe to the view that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their tasks also differ. Men are seen as innately disposed towards \\"public\\" life and abstract thought, while women are seen as better realising themselves in the \\"private\\" administration of the family and the resources of the house. Rodnovers therefore reinforce traditional values in Slavic countries rather than being countercultural, presenting themselves as a stabilising and responsible social force. They may even view their upholding of social traditionalism as a counterculture in itself, standing in the face of modernism and globalism. Ideas and practices perceived as coming from Western liberal society—which Rodnovers perceive as degenerate—are denounced as threats to Slavic culture; for instance, alcohol and drug consumption, various sexual behaviours and miscegenation are commonly rejected by Rodnovers, while they emphasise healthy family life in harmonious environments. Many groups in both Russia and Ukraine have demanded the prohibition of mixed-race unions, while the doctrine of the Ynglist Church includes an articulate condemnation of race mixing as unhealthy. Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that \\"hardly any women\\" in Russian Rodnovery would call themselves feminists, partly due to Rodnover beliefs on gender and partly due to the negative associations that the word \\"feminism\\" has in Russian culture. In adopting such a conservative stance to sexual ethics, practitioners of Rodnovery can adopt misogynistic and homophobic attitudes. Aitamurto and Gaidukov noted that it would be \\"difficult to imagine that any Rodnover community would accept members who are openly homosexual\\". The Russian-based Circle of Pagan Tradition distinguishes itself for its more accommodating positions—compared to those of other organisations—about the coexistence of different lifestyles, holding that tolerance should be a key value. They reflect their stance in the slogan \\"unity in diversity\\". This organisation has also placed greater emphasis on environmentalist issues over nationalist ones, and has called on its members to vote for the Green Russia party. Identity and political philosophy Map of countries in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic languages predominate. Dark green represents East Slavic languages, pale green represents West Slavic languages, and sea green represents South Slavic languages. There is no evidence that the early Slavs ever conceived of themselves as a unified ethno-cultural group. There is an academic consensus that the Proto-Slavic language developed from about the second half of the first millennium BCE in an area of Central and Eastern Europe bordered by the Dnieper basin to the east, the Vistula basin to the west, the Carpathian Mountains to the south and the forests beyond the Pripet basin to the north. Over the course of several centuries, Slavic populations migrated in northern, eastern and south-western directions. In doing so, they branched out into three sub-linguistic families: the Eastern Slavs (Ukrainians, Belarusians, Russians), the Western Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks) and the Southern Slavs (Slovenes, Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Macedonians and Bulgarians). The belief systems of these Slavic communities had many affinities with those of neighbouring linguistic populations, such as the Balts, Thracians and Indo-Iranians. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov studied the origin of ancient Slavic themes in the common substratum represented by Proto-Indo-European religion and what Georges Dumézil studied as the \\"trifunctional hypothesis\\". Marija Gimbutas, instead, found Slavic religion to be a clear result of the overlap of Indo-European patriarchism and pre-Indo-European matrifocal beliefs. Boris Rybakov emphasised the continuity and complexification of Slavic religion through the centuries. Laruelle observed that Rodnovery is in principle a decentralised movement, with hundreds of groups coexisting without submission to a central authority. Therefore, socio-political views can vary greatly from one group to another, from one adherent to another, ranging from extreme pacifism to militarism, from apoliticism and anarchism to left-wing and to right-wing positions. Nevertheless, Laruelle says that the most politicised right-wing groups are the most popularly known, since they are more vocal in spreading their ideas through the media, organise anti-Christian campaigns, and even engage in violent actions. Aitamurto observed that the different wings of the Rodnover movement \\"attract different kinds of people approaching the religion from quite diverging points of departure\\". There are, nonetheless, recurrent themes within the various strains of Rodnovery. The scholar of religion Scott Simpson has stated that Slavic Native Faith is \\"fundamentally concerned with questions of community and ethnic identity\\", while the folklorist Nemanja Radulovic has described adherents of the movement as placing \\"great emphasis on their national or regional identity\\". They conceive ethnicity and culture as territorial, moulded by the surrounding natural environment (cf. ecology). Rodnovery typically emphasises the rights of the collective over the rights of the individual, and their moral values are the conservative values typical of the right-wing of politics: emphasis on patriarchy, heterosexuality, traditional family, fidelity and procreation. Most Rodnover groups will permit only Slavs as members, although there are a few exceptions. Many Rodnovers espouse socio-political views akin to those of the French Nouvelle Droite, and many of them in Russia have come close to the ideas of Eurasianism. In this vein, they often oppose what they regard as culturally destructive phenomena such as cosmopolitanism, liberalism and globalisation, as well as Americanisation and consumerism. =Nationalism= Mazovian Temple (Chram Mazowiecki) of the Native Polish Church. The political philosophy of Rodnovery can be defined as \\"nativism\\", \\"nationalism\\" and \\"populism\\", all of which render the Russian word narodnichestvo. This is often right-wing ethnic nationalism. Aitamurto suggested that Russian Rodnovers' conceptions of nationalism encompass three main themes: that \\"the Russian or Slavic people are a distinct group\\", that they \\"have—or their heritage has—some superior qualities\\", and that \\"this unique heritage or the existence of this ethnic group is now threatened, and, therefore, it is of vital importance to fight for it\\". There are Rodnovers with extreme right-wing nationalist views, including those who are Neo-Nazi and openly inspired by Nazi Germany. Some blame many of the world's problems on the mixing of ethnic groups, and emphasise the idea of ethnic purity, promoting ideas of racial segregation, and demanding the legal prohibition of mixed-race marriages. Some regard ethnic minorities living in Slavic countries as a cause of social injustice, and encourage the removal of those regarded as \\"aliens\\" from Russia, namely those who are Jewish or have ethnic origins in the Caucasus, an approach which could require ethnic cleansing. Other Rodnovers are openly anti-Semitic, for instance urging fellow Rodnovers not to get involved with Jews, and endorse anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jews control the economic- political elite. Many other Rodnovers deny or downplay the racist and Nazi elements within their community, and claim that extreme right-wingers are not true believers in Slavic Native Faith because their interests in the movement are primarily political rather than religious. There are groups that espouse positions of cultural nationalism and patriotism, rather than extreme ethnic nationalism. For instance, the Russian Circle of Pagan Tradition characterises itself as \\"patriotic\\" rather than \\"nationalist\\", avoids ethnic nationalist ideas, and recognises Russia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural state. Moreover, in countries like Poland and Russia there has been an increasing de- politicisation of Rodnovery in the twenty-first century. In Russia too, Aitamurto and Shizhenskii have found that expressions of extreme nationalism were considered socially unacceptable at one of the largest Rodnover events, the Kupala festival outside Maloyaroslavets. Rodnover themes and symbols have also been adopted by many Russian nationalists—including in the Russian skinhead movement—who do not necessarily embrace Rodnovery as a religion. Some of them merge Rodnover themes with others adopted from Germanic Heathenry and from Russian Orthodox Christianity. A number of young practitioners of Slavic Native Faith have been detained on terrorism charges in Russia; between 2008 and 2009, teenaged Rodnovers forming a group called the Slavic Separatists conducted at least ten murders and planted bombs across Moscow targeting Muslims and non-ethnic Russians. Laruelle has observed that even in groups which reject extreme nationalism or are apolitical, ethnic identity is still important, and a good Rodnover is considered one who is conscious of ethnic identity, national traditions, and knows the history of the ancestors. Shnirelman similarly noted that there is a loose boundary between the explicitly politicised and less politicised wings of the Russian movement, and that ethnic nationalist and racist views were present even in those Rodnovers who did not identify with precise political ideologies. =Grassroots democracy and samoderzhavie= The socio-political system proposed by Rodnovers is based on their interpretation of the ancient Slavic community model of the veche (popular assembly), similar to the ancient Germanic \\"thing\\" and ancient Greek democracy. They propose a political system in which decisional power is entrusted to assemblies of consensually-acknowledged wise men, or to a single wise individual. Western liberal ideas of freedom and democracy are traditionally perceived by Russian eyes as \\"outer\\" freedom, contrasting with Slavic \\"inner\\" freedom of the mind; in Rodnovers' view, Western liberal democracy is \\"destined to execute the primitive desires of the masses or to work as a tool in the hands of a ruthless elite\\", being therefore a mean-spirited \\"rule of demons\\". Some Rodnovers interpret the veche in ethnic terms, thus as a form of \\"ethnic democracy\\", in the wake of similar concepts found in the French Nouvelle Droite. Aitamurto has defined the Rodnover idea of the veche as a form of grassroots democracy, or, using the term preferred by the Ynglists, as a samoderzhavie, that is to say a system of \\"self-power\\", \\"people ruling themselves\\". =Views on history and eschatology= Shnirelman notes that the movement is \\"obsessed with the idea of origin. Many Rodnovers legitimise their practices by according their Slavic ancestors great cultural achievements. Academics studying the movement have described these views of the past as \\"extremely imaginative and exaggerated\\", \\"rather fantastic\\", and linked to pseudo-historical ideas. However, Aitamurto and Gaidukov later noted that the \\"wildly imaginative\\" ideas typical of the 1980s were in decline, and that—within Russia at least—\\"a more realistic attitude\\" to the past was \\"gaining ground\\" in the twenty-first century. New World. Sun City by the Russian artist Lola V. Lonli, 2013. Many within the movement regard the Book of Veles as a holy text, and as a genuine historical document. Some Rodnovers take their cosmology, ethical system, and ritual practices from the Book. The fact that many scholars outspokenly reject the Book as a modern, twentieth- century composition has added to the allure that the text has for many Rodnovers. According to them, such criticism is an attempt to \\"suppress knowledge\\" carried forward either by Soviet-style scientism or by \\"Judaic cosmopolitan\\" forces. Other modern literary works that have influenced the movement, albeit on a smaller scale, include The Songs of the Bird Gamayon, Koliada's Book of Stars, The Song of the Victory on Jewish Khazaria by Sviatoslav the Brave or The Rigveda of Kiev. Some Rodnovers pejoratively dismiss movements such as that of the Vseyasvetnaya gramota (\\"Universal alphabet\\", a discipline which, similarly to Jewish Kabbalah, sees Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts as mystical and magical ways to communicate with God, and as instruments to see past events and foresee future ones) as \\"New Age\\" and claim that reliance on them discredits the Slavic Native Faith movement. Some Rodnovers believe that the Slavs are a race distinct from other ethnic groups. According to them, the Slavs are the directest descendants of an ancient Aryan race, whom they equate with the Proto-Indo-Europeans. Some Rodnovers believe that the Aryans originated at the North Pole but moved south as a result of declining temperatures, while others claim that the Aryans germinated in Russia's southern steppes. In claiming an Aryan ancestry, Slavic Native Faith practitioners legitimise their cultural borrowing from other ethno-cultural groups who they claim are also Aryan descendants, such as the Germanic peoples or those of the Indian subcontinent. Some Rodnovers hold eschatological beliefs. For instance, they regard Slavic countries as having a messianic role in humanity's future, for instance with the belief that Ukraine will be the world's future geopolitical centre, or that Russia will be the home of a post- apocalyptic civilisation which will survive the demise of the Western world. Such racial and eschatological beliefs are explicitly rejected by other Rodnovers, like the Circle of Pagan Tradition. Although their understanding of the past is typically rooted in spiritual conviction rather than in arguments that would be acceptable within the academia, many Rodnovers seek to promote their beliefs about the past among academics. For instance, in 2002 Serbian Rodnovers established Svevlad, a research group devoted to historical Slavic religion which simulated academic discourse but was \\"highly selective, unsystematic, and distorted\\" in its examination of the evidence. In several Slavic countries, many archaeologists and historians have been hesitant about giving credence to Rodnover interpretations of the past. In turn, Rodnovers have accused academics of being part of a conspiracy to conceal the truth about the past. =Views on Christianity and mono-ideologies= The initiation of a woman into Rodnovery, in Moscow, Russia. Many Rodnovers actively reject Christianity or adopt anti-Christian views. They generally regard Abrahamic religions as destructive forces that erode what they view as organic peoples, with Christianity being perceived as a foreign entity within Slavic culture. They consider the Abrahamic religions and their later secular ideological productions (Marxism, capitalism and the general Western rationalism begotten by the Age of Enlightenment) as \\"mono-ideologies\\", that is to say ideologies which promote \\"universal and one-dimensional truths\\", unable to grasp the complexity of reality and therefore doomed to failure one after the other. Christianity is denounced as a hierarchical and centralised power that throughout history defended the rich and legitimised slave mentality, and as an anthropocentric ideology which distorts the role of mankind in the cosmos by claiming that God could have been incarnated as a single historical entity (Jesus). In Russia, Rodnovers often compare Christianity, for its claim to have a monopoly on truth, to Soviet Marxism. They also criticise capitalism and seek a return to a pre-capitalist society. As an alternative to the \\"mono- ideologies\\" and the world of \\"unipolarity\\" that they created, the Rodnovers oppose their idea of \\"multipolarism\\". Some Rodnovers also take a hostile stance toward Judaism, which they regard as having spawned Christianity, or believe that Christianity has left Russia under the control of Jews. Rodnovers often reject Christian ideas of humility, regarding them as antithetical to a Rodnover emphasis on courage and fighting spirit. Christianity is also considered as a system that destroys morality by casting human responsibility away from the present world and into a transcendent future, and it is also criticised as being anthropocentric, and thus responsible for ecological disruption. Rodnovers express their anti-Christian views in various ways. Many Native Faith groups organise formal ceremonies of renunciation of Christianity (raskrestitsia, literally \\"de-Christianisation\\"), and initiation into Rodnovery with the adoption of a Slavic name. The folklorist Mariya Lesiv observed Rodnovers marching in Kiev in 2006 chanting \\"Out with Jehovah! Glory to Dazhboh!\\" Simpson noted that in Poland, several Rodnovers launched a poster campaign against Valentine's Day, which they regarded as not being an authentically Polish celebration. In Russia, Rodnovers have vandalised and torched various churches. Christians have also been responsible for opposition to Slavic Native Faith, for instance through the establishment of social media groups against the movement. The Russian Orthodox Church has expressed opposition to the growth and spread of Slavic Native Faith across Russia on various occasions. Some Russian Rodnovers have however attempted to improve relations with the Orthodox Church, arguing that Russian Orthodoxy had adopted many elements of historical Slavic belief and rites. In this way they argue that Russian Orthodoxy is distinct from other forms of Christianity, and seek to portray it as the \\"younger brother\\" of Slavic Native Faith. The Orthodox Christian Old Believers, a movement that split out from the Russian Orthodox Church during the reform of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow in the seventeenth century, is seen by Rodnovers in a more positive light than the mainstream Russian Orthodox Church, as Old Believers are considered to have elements similar to those of the Slavic Native Faith. Practices Russian Rodnover priest drawing a dot on the forehead of believers for the celebrations of Kupala Night festival. Rodnovery is essentially a religion of the community, with most adherents actively joining organisations; only a minority of believers choose solitary practice. Laruelle has observed that most Rodnover groups emphasise the exoteric aspect of the religion, organising large communal, popular celebrations, and spreading exoteric knowledge open to all. However, there are more closed groups that require more stringent commitment from their adherents, and emphasise esoteric teachings and practices, including complex initiation rituals, reference to systems similar to Jewish Kabbalah, prayer and magic. For many Rodnovers, greater importance is given to the construction of \\"authentic\\" Slavic rituals rather than psychologically empowering practices. For many others, rituals may include magical practices and are meant at the creation of shared meanings and new community ties. Ceremonial accuracy is often considered essential for the efficacy of a ritual, but at the same time Rodnover rituals have been regarded as flexible frameworks, wherein there is room for elaboration and experimentation. Sources that Rodnovers rely upon include valued scholars like Vladimir Dal and Boris Rybakov. Most Rodnover groups strongly emphasise the worship of ancestors. An example of ancestor worship is the ritual \\"Veneration of Ancient Russian Knights\\" practised by the Russian Rodnover organisation Svarozhichi, centred in Yekaterinburg and widespread in the Ural region, on May 9, in honour of the victory of Sviatoslav I of Kiev against the Khazars. Some Sylenkoite organisations commemorate Ukrainian national heroes such as Ivan Franko, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and Hryhory Skovoroda, as well as more abstract concepts such as \\"Ukrainian Ancient Literature\\" and \\"New Ukrainian Literature\\". =Ritual, magic and other techniques= According to Aitamurto, rituals play \\"a central role in defining, learning and transmitting the religion\\", and thus they constitute an important complement to Rodnover theology. Ritual practice makes use of mythology, symbolism, codified chants and gestures. Myths and symbols are considered to emerge from the subconscious of humanity, and to be imaginified sacred knowledge which has to be deciphered and reinterpreted since the true meaning is not always apparent. Among the most common myths is that of Belovodye (the esoteric kingdom of \\"White Waters\\"), deriving from eighteenth-century Old Believers' culture. Symbols such as the trident, the swastika, and objects representing fire, are prominent features of Rodnover rituals. The swastika (or kolovrat, as the eight-spoked wheel is called in Rodnovery) is considered the main symbol for mystical ascension to the divine world. Other symbols such as animals, geometric shapes, and ancient Slavic runic writing, are considered to be associated to specific gods, and the prayer to their image is considered to intercede with these gods. Also appropriate chants and gestures are believed to allow the participants to enter in communion with the upper world. Some Rodnovers espouse ideas similar to those of the Kabbalah, such as the belief in a connection between language and the cosmos (corroborated by the etymological connection between the word yazychnik, \\"pagan\\", and yazyk, \\"language\\", which share the same root): the Cyrillic and Glagolitic scripts are considered to have magical usefulness. Rodnovers engaged in a circle-dance around a bonfire, celebrating the Koliada festival in Naro-Fominsk, Moscow Oblast, Russia. Rituals take place at consecrated places and generally include the lighting of fire (vozzhiganie ognia), invocation of gods, the singing of hymns, sacrifices (prinesenie treby) and the pouring of libations, circle-dances (khorovod or simply kolo, \\"circle\\"), and usually end with a communal meal. Some Rodnover organisations require that participants wear traditional Slavic clothes for such occasions, although there is much freedom in interpreting what constitutes \\"traditional clothes\\", this definition generally referring to folkloric needlecraft open to a wide range of artistic patterns. Rituals of initiation include a formal renunciation of Christianity (raskrestitsia) which entails the baptism with a Slavic name (imianarechenie), the ritual of entry into a brotherhood (bratanie), marriage and death. The renaming symbolises the death and rebirth of the individual into the new community. Male brotherhoods practise the cutting of a second \\"life line\\" on the palm of the hand of converts, symbolising the new \\"blood bond\\" that is formed with other members. There is much variation between major currents and organisations of Rodnovery. For instance, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), one of the churches of the denomination of Ukrainian Sylenkoism, holds unique weekly \\"Holy Hour of Self- Realisation\\", in which practitioners read from Sylenko's Maha Vira, sermons are given, the ancestors are commemorated, and prayers and hymns are given. The meeting ends with the singing of Shche ne vmerla Ukraina, the national anthem of Ukraine. The rival and near homonymous Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira), also conducts weekly Holy Hours, but incorporates a wider selection of sources—such as readings from the pan-Rodnover Book of Veles or the poetry of Taras Shevchenko—into the proceedings. The structure of these Syenkoite rites is modelled on those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Espousing a holistic worldview that does not create a dichotomy between mind and body, many Rodnover groups employ physical techniques, or martial arts (such as the Slavyano-goritskaya borba), as means for cleaning, strengthening and elevating the mind. Some Rodnover groups incorporate practices which are not Slavic in origin. For instance, a group of Polish Rodnovers has been documented to use the fire poi at their Midsummer festivities, a practice that originally developed in Pacific regions during the mid-twentieth century. The Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith promotes a healing technique called zhyva that has close similarities to the Japanese practice of reiki. In another instance, Lesiv observed a Ukrainian Rodnover who legitimised the practice of yoga by claiming that this spiritual tradition had originally been developed by the ancestors of modern-day Ukrainians. =Communities, citadels and temples= A building of the Slavic Kremlin Vitaly Sundakov in the Podolsky District, Moscow Oblast, Russia. Rodnover organisations have inherited ideas of commonality and social governance from Slavic and Russian history. They recover the pre-Christian social institution of the veche (assembly), which they also see as reflecting the concept of sobornost formulated in twentieth-century Russian philosophy. Veche is used as the name of some Rodnover overarching organisations, as well as international councils. Aitamurto characterises the veche as a model of organisation \\"from below and to the top\\", following descriptions given by Rodnovers themselves—that is to say a grassroots form of governance which matures into a consensual authority and/or decision-making. Local Rodnover groups usually call themselves obshchina (the term for traditional peasant communities), while skhod, sobor and mir are used for informal meetings or to refer to traditional Russian ideas of commonality. Another term for a community, though not frequently used, is artel. A form of organisation of Rodnover communities consists in the establishment of places for commonunal living, such as fortresses (kremlin) or citadels (gorodok), in which temples are surrounded by buildings for various social uses. The Slavic Kremlin Vitaly Sundakov is one of such centres, located in the Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast. Some Rodnover networks have established entire villages all over Russia; this is the case, among other examples, of those Rodnovers who are part of Anastasianism. Rituals and religious meetings are often performed in rural settings, forests and clearings. The basic structure of a temple of the Slavic Native Faith (капище, kapishche; or храм, khram) is constituted by a sacred precinct at the centre of which are placed poles with carved images of the gods enshrined. These poles, or statues, are called rodovoi, stolb, chur, but also kapy (\\"poles\\"). There are many such basic temples throughout Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. A large, elaborate temple of this type is projected to be built in Khabarovsk. In 2015, the Temple of Svarozich's Fire, in the form of a simple wooden architecture, was opened by the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in Krasotynka, Kaluga. Gaidukov documented that in the 2000s Rodnovers erected a statue of Perun in a park near Kupchino in Saint Petersburg, although they did not obtain official permission first. The statue remained in place for some time until being removed by the authorities in 2007 when a decision was made to construct a church nearby. =Priesthood= Sacrificers officiating at a simple temple (kapishche) in Kaluga, Kaluga Oblast, Russia. In Slavic Native Faith, priests are distinguishable into the orders of volkhv (translatable as \\"wiseman\\", \\"wizard\\", i.e. \\"shaman\\", or \\"mage\\") and zhrets (\\"sacrificers\\"). They are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, while zhrets are of a lower authority. Though the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of zhritsa and vedunya (\\"seeresses\\"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, Halyna Lozko from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement. In 2012, a number of Rodnover organisations in Russia made an agreement for the mutual recognition of their priesthood and for the uniformisation of ordination policies. =Calendars and holidays= Ukrainian Rodnovers worshipping a goddess' pole on Vodokreš holiday in the countryside. The common Rodnover ritual calendar is based on the Slavic folk tradition, whose crucial events are the four solstices and equinoxes set in the four phases of the year. Slavic Native Faith has been described as following \\"the cycles of nature\\". A festival that is believed to be the most important by many Rodnovers is that of the summer solstice, the Kupala Night (June 23–24), although also important are the winter solstice festival Karachun and Koliada (December 24–25), and the spring equinox festival Shrovetide—called Komoeditsa or Maslenitsa (March 24). Festivals celebrated in spring include the Day of Yarilo and the Krasnaya Gorka (literally \\"Red Hill\\", celebrated between April 30–May 1), the latter dedicated to ancestor worship; while in autumn Rodnovers celebrate the Day of Marzanna and that of Mokosh (November 10). Other festivals include the Days of Veles (multiple, in January and February) and the Day of Perun (August 2), the latter considered to be the most important holiday of the year by some Rodnover organisations. Usually, the organisation of festivals involves three layers of society: there is a patronising \\"core\\" of practitioners, who are often professionally affirmed people, usually belonging to the intellectual class; then there is the population of committed adherents; and then there is a loose \\"periphery\\" constituted by sympathisers, generally relatives and friends of the committed followers. Aitmurto notes that festivals are usually set in the evenings, the weekends and on public holidays, in order to allow everyone's participation. Shizhenskii and Aitamurto described one Kupala festival, held over the course of three days outside Maloyaroslavets in Russia; at this event, weddings, purification rituals, and name-giving ceremonies took place, accompanied by musical performances, martial arts, and folkloric plays, while a market sold traditional handicrafts. The interplay with the gods and the cycle of nature which they represent is displayed through large-scale ceremonies which Aitamurto defines as \\"aesthetically lavish\\", vectors of a great deal of creativity. For instance, the end of winter is marked by burning straw images of Marzanna, the goddess of winter, while celebrating the victory of Yarilo, the god of the full swing of natural forces; the end of summer, instead, is marked by the burial of an image of Yarilo. Adherents of Slavic Native Faith often adopt elements from recorded folk culture, giving new meaning and purpose to Christianised or non-Pagan contents. Some Rodnover groups have appropriated or reappropriated Christian festivals. The same Kupala Night is a reappropriation, being the day of the year when Christian churches set the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. The calendar of some Sylenkoite organisations includes holidays that have been de-Christianised, such as a \\"Christmas of Dazhboh's Light\\" and an \\"Easter of the Eternal Resurrection\\". =Artistic and other pursuits= Russian Rodnovers engaged in a martial arts dare. A number of Rodnovers have expressed their religion through visual arts; among practitioners, Svyatoslav I of Kiev is one of the most popular subjects. Rodnover rituals and festivals often include martial arts displays; these sometimes symbolise seasonal change, such as the victory of spring over winter, or can be regarded as manifestations of bravery, strength, and honesty. Slavic-hill wrestling (Славяно-горицкая борьба, Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba) was established by the Russian Rodnover Aleksandr Belov. Other martial arts styles that are popular among Rodnovers are \\"bench wrestling\\" (lavochki) and \\"wall against wall\\" (stenka na stenku). Some Rodnovers espouse linguistic purism, proposing the replacement of foreign words with Slavic equivalents (such as svetopisi instead of fotografii, or izvedy instead of interv'iu). History =1800s–1920s: Romantic and Russian revolutionary precursors= 2018 publication of Dołęga-Chodakowski's \\"About the Slavs before Christianity\\" by Polish Rodnovers. The origins of Slavic Native Faith have been traced to the Romantic movement of late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Europe, which was a reaction against rationalism and the Age of Enlightenment. This was accompanied by a growth in nationalism across Europe, as intellectuals began to assert their own national heritage. In 1818, the Polish ethnographer Zorian Dołęga-Chodakowski (Adam Czarnocki; 1784–1825) in the work O Sławiańszczyźnie przed chrześcijaństwem (\\"About the Slavs before Christianity\\") declared himself a \\"pagan\\" and stated that the Christianisation of the Slavic peoples had been a mistake. Therefore, he became a precursor of the return to Slavic religion in Poland and all Slavic countries. Similarly, the Polish philosopher Bronisław Trentowski (1808–1869) saw the historical religion of the Slavs as a true path to understanding the divine creator, arguing that Christianity failed to do so. Another precursor in Poland was Jan Sas Zubrzycki (1860–1935), who elaborated the doctrine of \\"God-Knowing\\" (Bogoznawstwo). It was this Romantic rediscovery and revaluing of indigneous pre-Christian religion that prepared the way for the later emergence of Rodnovery. Whereas calls to re-establish pre-Christian belief systems existed within the German and Austrian far-right nationalist movements during the early twentieth century, in Russia the situation was different. In Russia there was a shared belief among the intellectual circles that Slavic paganism had survived within the \\"folk Orthodoxy\\" of the common people (which was regarded as a dvoeverie, a \\"double faith\\"), and the Old Believers' movements. The study of this syncretic popular religion and philosophy was the foremost interest for late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Russian intellectuals: early revolutionaries (Alexander Herzen, Nikolay Ogarev, Mikhail Bakunin), Narodniks (Populists), and early Bolsheviks were inspired by the radical forms of society practised within folk religious communities, which in many ways were precursors to socialism. Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich was assigned by the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party the task of studying folk religious movements, and in 1908–1910 a faction of the Bolsheviks, represented by Anatoly Lunacharsky, Alexander Bogdanov, Maxim Gorky, and Vladimir Bazarov, formulated the \\"God-Building\\" movement (Bogostroitelstvo), whose aim was to create a new religion for the proletariat through a synthesis of socialism with folk religion. =1930s–1940s: Early concrete developments= One of the earliest copies (dated 1955) of one of \\"Isenbek's Planks\\" (the n. 16), upon which the Book of Veles was supposedly written. In Ukraine, the first practitioners of Slavic Native Faith appeared in the 1930s. One of the most influential Ukrainian Rodnover ideologues was Volodymyr Shaian (1908–1974), a linguist and philologist who worked at Lviv University. He claimed that in 1934 he underwent a spiritual revelation atop Mount Grekhit in the Carpathian Mountains. Particularly interested in the idea about an ancient Aryan race that were popular at the time, he subsequently began promoting what he called a \\"pan-Aryan renaissance\\". He turned to recorded Ukrainian folklore to find what he regarded as the survivals of the ancient Slavic religion. In 1944, he fled the Soviet government and travelled to refugee camps in Germany and Austria. There, he established the Order of the Knights of the Solar God (Orden Lytsariv Boha Sontsia), a religio-political group that he hoped would affiliate itself to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army during the Second World War. In Poland, Jan Stachniuk (1905–1963) established the Zadruga magazine in 1937, which gave rise to the movement of Zadrugism. the term Zadruga refers to a South Slavic tribal unit. Continuing on from Dołęga-Chodakowski, Stachniuk's own work criticised Catholicism in Poland, arguing that it had had a negative effect on the country's national character. He did not develop his ideas into a religion, and those who shared his views remained \\"a very loose and diverse intellectual clique\\". The magazine and its associated group embraced members with a wide variety of viewpoints, ranging from secularly humanistic to religiously Slavic Native Faith stances. He was nevertheless labelled a neopoganin (\\"Neopagan\\") by the Polish popular press, a term that he embraced as a self-descriptor in later life. Władysław Kołodziej (1897–1978) later claimed to have established, before the Second World War, the Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid (Święte Koło Czcicieli Światowida), although there is no evidence that they conducted regular meetings until many years later. During the war, Stefan Potrzuski led a unit in the Peasant Battalion which battled the Nazi occupation of Poland. His unit had a shrine to the god Svetovid in their secret forest base and held group rites in which they toasted a wooden image of the deity with mead. Also Jan Stachniuk fought against the Nazi occupation during the Warsaw Uprising. Following the end of the war and the incorporation of Poland under the Stalinist regime, both Stachniuk and Kołodziej were arrested, preventing the establishment of a Slavic Native Faith community. In 1954, a student group known as Klan Ausran was established at the University of Łódź; officially dedicated to a study of Indo-European society, its members provided hymns and prayers. A key influence on the movement was the circulation of the Book of Veles among Russian and Ukrainian emigrees. This text was brought to the public by the Russian Yuri Mirolyubov (1892–1970), who claimed that it had been discovered by a friend of his, Fodor Arturovich Isenbek, while serving as a White Army officer during the Russian Civil War. Mirolyubov alleged that the original text had been etched on wooden boards, but that these had been lost during the Second World War, leaving only his own copies. It is probable that the Book of Veles was a literary composition produced by Mirolyubov himself. In following decades the work would have caused a sensation, with many emigrees regarding it as a genuine tenth-century text. Another supporter of the book was the Ukrainian entomologist Sergey Paramonov (also known as Sergey Lesnoy; 1898–1968). =1960s–1980s: Soviet Union and Slavic diaspora in the West= One of the disciples of Volodymyr Shaian was Lev Sylenko (1921–2008). He subsequently left Europe and moved first to Canada and then the United States. It was in Chicago that he established the earliest groups of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (Sylenkoism) in 1966. Sylenko presented himself as a prophet of Dazhbog who had been sent to the Ukrainian people. In his view, the Ukrainians were the superior manifestation of the European peoples, and Kyiv the oldest city of the white race. Sylenko was a charismatic leader, whose followers praised his talents and oratorial skills. In 1979 he published the Maha Vira (\\"mighty Faith\\"), a book which he claimed chronicled the ancient history of the Ukrainian people. Sylenkoism was influenced by deism and Theosophy. A Sylenkoite centre, the Temple of Mother Ukraine, was established in Spring Glen, New York. Native Ukrainian National Faith congregations were established among Ukrainian emigree communities in other parts of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany. New York, United States. During era of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union (1920s–1950s), research into prehistoric societies was encouraged, with some scholars arguing that pre-Christian society reflected a form of communitarianism that was damaged by Christianity's promotion of entrenched class divisions. In doing so, pre-Christian belief systems underwent a rehabilitation. Joseph Stalin himself was a supporter of the idea of Slavic Vedism, the shared Indo-European origins of Vedic and Slavic cultures. Boris Rybakov (1908–2001), former head of the Institute of Archaeology, provided the first academic studies about ancient Slavic religion. In the 1960s, the renewal of militant atheism under Nikita Khrushchev also presupposed a recovering of pre-Christian and pre-Islamic traditions. Russian Rodnovery originated in the Soviet dissidents' circles of the 1970s, as intellectuals became concerned for the eradication of traditional Russian culture and identity. An intellectual circle that cultivated themes of Slavic indigenous religion formed as a wing of the predominantly Orthodox Christian samizdat nationalist journal Veche (1971–1974). The first manifesto of Russian Rodnovery is considered to be the letter \\"Critical remarks by a Russian man\\" (Kriticheskie zametki russkogo cheloveka) published on such journal, anonymously in 1973, by Valery Yemelianov (1929–1999), who was then close to Khrushchev. The letter criticised Christianity as a product of Judaism serving the interests of Zionism. The journal attracted various personalities, including Anatoly Ivanov, the artist Konstantin Vasilyev (1942–1974), and Nikolay Bogdanov, among others. Vasilyev's art is widely celebrated within the Rodnover community. Ivanov, who declared himself a Zoroastrian and subscribed to \\"Arism\\" or \\"Slavism\\", published a fervently anti-Christian pamphlet entitled \\"The Christian Plague\\" (Khristianskaya chuma). Throughout the 1970s, the nationalist dissident movement split into two branches, an Orthodox Christian one and another one that developed National Bolshevism, which eventually continued to harbour Pagan traditionalists. Other influential texts in this period were Valery Yemelianov's Desionizatsiya (\\"De-Sionisation\\") and later Istarkhov's Udar russkikh bogov (\\"The Strike of Russian Gods\\"). In the 1970s, explicitly religious Rodnover groups had still to operate in secret, although a few small groups were known to exist in Moscow and Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), closely linked to the nationalist intellectual circles. In Moscow, an occult circle was established by Yevgeny Golovin and Yuri Mamleyev; although not explicitly Pagan, they were influenced by occult Pagan thinkers like Guido von List and sought a return to a pre-Christian Aryan world. In the early 1980s, the Pamyat movement was established by figures active at the Metropolitan Moscow Palace of Culture, whom similarly looked with fondness on ancient Aryan culture. The Pamyat movement attracted personalities interested in Vedism and welcomed the ideas developed among Russian emigrees, also organising a conference on the Book of Veles led by Valery Skurlatov (b. 1938). From 1985 onwards, Pamyat became affiliated with Orthodox Christianity and the Rodnover component eventually left the movement. Vedism was also explicitly espoused within more official Soviet circles; Apollon Kuzmin (1928–2004), leader of the neo-Slavophile historiography, did so in his 1988 book \\"The Fall of Perun\\" (Padenie Peruna), in which he supported indigenous Slavic religion while criticising Christianity as the cause of the Mongol yoke (which led to the incorporation of Kievan Rus' in the Golden Horde from 1237 to 1480). In the 1980s, Boris Rybakov published his last books, including The Paganism of the Ancient Slavs (1981) and The Paganism of Ancient Russia (1988). Meanwhile, literary writings of important figures of village prose (derevenshchiki) promoted Paganism, including Petr Proskurin (1928–2001) and Yury Kuznetsov (1941–2003). In 1986, Viktor Bezverkhy (1930–2000) established the Saint Petersburg-based Society of the Mages (Obshchestvo Volkhvov), an explicitly white supremacist and anti-Semitic organisation; it was followed by the Union of the Veneds, founded in 1990. These organisations gave rise to the stream of Rodnovery known as Peterburgian Vedism. =1990s–2000s: Post-Soviet growth= Ukrainian Rodnovers engaged in public worship. After Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet government introduced the policy of perestroika in the 1980s, Slavic Native Faith groups established themselves in Ukraine. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its official policy of state atheism resulted in a resurgence of open religious adherence across the region. Many individuals arrived at Rodnovery after exploring a range of different alternative spiritualities, with Asian religious influences being particularly apparent within Rodnovery at that time. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent republic, with many Ukrainians turning to strongly nationalistic agendas; among those to have done so are pseudo- archaeologists like Yuri Shylov, who posits Ukraine as the \\"cradle of civilisation\\". It is within this broader milieu of cultural nationalism and interest in alternative spiritualities that Rodnovery re-emerged in Ukraine. The United States-based Native Ukrainian National Faith established itself in Ukraine soon after independence, with the first congregation in Ukraine gaining official recognition in Kyiv in 1991. There had been schisms in the international organisation of Native Ukrainian National Faith. A number of senior followers broke with Sylenko during the 1980s, rejecting the idea that he should be the ultimate authority in the religion; they formed the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSID RUNVira) and secured legal control of the temple in Spring Glen. A second group, the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (OSIDU RUNVira), maintained links with Sylenko himself, whom it regards as a prophet, and adopted his Maha Vira as a sacred text. Despite the animosity that existed between these rival Ukrainian groups, there was some collaboration between them. In 2003, the First Forum of Rodnovers was held in Ukraine, resulting in two public proclamations: the first urged the country's government to protect what the Rodnovers regarded as sacred sites and objects, and the second called on the government not to go ahead with the proposed privatisation of agricultural land. That same year, a group called Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith was established; in contrast to the anti-Russian slant taken by Sylenkoism, it embraced a pan- Slavic perspective. The social context of Rodnovery's growth in Russia differed from that in other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Russian nationalists had welcomed the collapse of the Soviet system but were disappointed with the arrival of capitalism and the dramatic economic downturn that Russia faced in that decade. Many people became unemployed, and many turned to the past, nourishing the study of ethnic roots. In this context, the growth of Rodnovery can be seen as part of the nationalistic drive to regain national pride. Many leaders of early post-Soviet Rodnovery were intellectuals who were already Rodnovers in the late Soviet times; for instance, Grigory Yakutovsky (Vseslav Svyatozar), Aleksei Dobrovolsky (volkhv Dobroslav) and Viktor Bezverkhy. Other leaders who emerged in this period were Aleksandr Asov, author of numerous books on Rodnover philosophy which have sold millions of copies, and Aleksandr Belov, founder of the Rodnover martial arts style known as \\"Slavic-hill wrestling\\". Since the 1990s, Russian Rodnovery has expanded and diversified. Rodnovers started to establish numerous organised groups by the mid of the decade; in 1994 the Moscow Slavic Community was the first Rodnover group to be registered by the government. Concerted efforts by the communities of Moscow and Kaluga led to the establishment of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities in 1997, led by Dobroslav and characterised by nationalist views. In 1999, the communities of Moscow and Obninsk left it as they refuted nationalism, and established another umbrella organisation, the Circle of Veles led by Ilya Cherkasov (volkhv Veleslav), which is one of the largest and administers communities also located in the territory of Ukraine. The Ynglist Church too was formally established in the early 1990s, and it is considered one of the most sectarian and authoritarian denominations of Rodnovery. In 2002, groups of Rodnovers that did not share the extreme right-wing views dominant within some of the largest organisations at the time, promulgated the \\"Bittsa Appeal\\", which among other things condemned extreme nationalism and was the foundation charter of another umbrella organisation, the Circle of Pagan Tradition headquartered in Moscow. In 2009, the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities and the Circle of Pagan Tradition issued a joint statement against Ynglism, disapproving what they reckoned as the Ynglists' \\"pseudo-Pagan teachings, pseudo-linguistics, pseudo- science and outright fiction\\". Polish Rodnovers worshipping in the woods. In Poland, the Wrocław-based publishing house Toporzeł reissued Stachniuk's works and those of his disciple Antoni Wacyk. The 1940s Zadrugist movement inspired the establishment in 1996 of the Association of Native Faith (Zrzeszenie Rodzimej Wiary; now simply called Rodzima Wiara, \\"Native Faith\\"), whose founder Stanisław Potrzebowski wrote his doctoral thesis on the pre-war Zadrugism in German (Zadruga - eine völkische Bewegung in Polen). Another Polish Rodnover group registered by the state in 1995 is the Native Polish Church (Rodzimy Kościół Polski), which represents a tradition that goes back to Władysław Kołodziej's Holy Circle of the Worshippers of Svetovid. In 1998, a Czech Rodnover group called Rahoŝť was founded by an Italian-born academic specialist in Slavic studies, Giuseppe Maiello. In 2000 this group merged with the extreme-right nationalist National Front of the Pures (Národní Fronta Kastitů) to form the Rodná Víra group. This organisation subsequently nurtured strong links with Rodnover groups in Slovakia, Poland, and Russia. The group broke apart following a schism in 2005. Rodnovery spread to the countries of former Yugoslavia in the early twenty-first century. A Serbian Native Faith group known as the Slavic Circle (Slovenski Krug) existed during the 1990s and 2000s, merging historical Slavic religion with a ritual structure adopted from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In Slovenia, a group called the Svetovid Parish of the Old Belief (Staroverska Župa Svetovid) was established around 2005 through a union of an older group, Ajda, with the followers of the military historian Matjaž Vratislav Anžur. As of 2013, it had between ten and fifteen members. In 2011, the Circle of Svarog (Svaroži Krug) was founded in Bosnia. During the 1990s and 2000s, a number of groups were established in Bulgaria, namely the Dulo Alliance, the Warriors of Tangra, and the Bulgarian Horde 1938. These groups have strong political motivations, being extremely nationalistic, anti-Western, and anti-Semitic. Rodnover personalities and groups played a prominent role in the 2002 establishment of Ongal, a Bulgarian far-right umbrella organisation. The 1990s and 2000s also witnessed the development of international contacts between Rodnover groups from all Slavic countries, with the organisation of various All-Slavic Rodnover Councils. The Internet helped the spread of Rodnovery and a uniformisation of ritual practices across the various groups. The first Rodnover website on the Russian Internet (so-called Runet)—was created by a Moscow-based believer in 1996. Many Rodnovers made use of Russian Wikipedia to promote their religion, although many switched to LiveJournal and mail.ru, through which they could promulgate their ideas more directly. From the mid-2000s, Rodnovers made increasing use of social media to communicate with other members of their community. Russian Rodnovery also attracted the attention of Russian academics, many of whom focused on the political dimensions of the movement, thus neglecting other aspects of the community. The scholar Kaarina Aitamurto later criticised some of these Russian-language studies for reflecting scholars' own religious biases against Rodnovery, over-reliance on the published texts of prominent figures, or for sensationalising the subject to shock or impress their audience. This attitude generated some mutual hostility between academics and practitioners of Rodnovery, rendering subsequent scholarly fieldwork more difficult. Rodnover themes entered the heavy metal subculture, particularly in bands like Sokyra Peruna (\\"Perun's Axe\\"), Whites Load, and Komu Vnyz (\\"Who Will Go Down\\"). In Poland, Rodnovery also influenced various forms of folk and popular music. =2010s: Consolidations and War in Donbass= Priests of the Skhoron ezh Sloven Rodnover organisation. The early 2010s saw a strengthening of relations between Rodnover groups. In 2012, in Russia, representatives of the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities, the Circle of Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an \\"Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests\\" that defined the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests. On the same occasion, they once again expressed disapproval for some authors and movements, including the large Skhoron ezh Sloven, which is also present in Belarus and Ukraine. In 2014, the Russian government officially registered the Union of Slavic Native Belief Communities as an interregional public organisation for the promotion of Slavic culture. Rodnovery has a significant role in the War in Donbass, with many Rodnovers forming or joining armed forces. Some of them—for example those of the Svarozich Battalion—have been fighting in favour of Russia; other Rodnovers—such as those of the Azov Battalion—have taken the side of Ukraine. The war has stirred different reactions among Ukrainian Rodnovers; many adherents of the Native Ukrainian National Faith viewed Russia as the aggressor, while adherents of other Rodnover organisations like the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith more commonly saw Russians and Ukrainians as brothers and believed that the conflict was caused by the machinations of the United States. In August 2015, during the 3rd Polish Nationwide Rodnover Congress, the Rodnover Confederation (Konfederacja Rodzimowiercza) was formally established. Among the members are eleven organisations including the Gontyna Association, the Żertwa Association, the Pomeranian Rodnovers (Rodzimowiercy Pomorscy), the Drzewo Przodków Association, the Circle of Radegast (Krąg Radogost), the Kałdus Association, the Swarga Group (Gromada \\"Swarga\\"), the WiD Group, ZW Rodzima Wiara and the Watra Rodnover Community (Wspólnota Rodzimowierców \\"Watra\\"). In June 2017, during the celebrations of the nationwide holiday called Stado, a new religious organisation was created: the Religious Organisation of Polish Rodnovers \\"Kin\\" (Związek Wyznaniowy Rodzimowierców Polskich \\"Ród\\"). Branches, interwoven movements and influences Russian Rodnovers engaged in a ritual with a fiery wheel. There are many denominations of Rodnovery as it is in general a democratic, free, or \\"open-source religion\\", that emphasises the \\"equality of men in their access to the divine\\" from different perspectives. Eclecticism and syncretism are accepted by most believers, although there is a \\"minimal framework in which the idea of national [Slavic] tradition dominates\\". Because of its \\"open\\" nature, Rodnovery also hosts in itself denominations which have developed clear doctrines around an authoritarian charismatic leadership. There are often tensions between nondenominational Rodnovers and followers of well- defined doctrines; it is the case of the doctrine of Ynglism, which is not recognised as true Slavic Native Faith by the major Rodnover organisations of Russia, and of Yagnovery, Ladovery and Sylenkoism, which some Rodnovers opine not to be classifiable as branches of Slavic Native Faith. Other Rodnover movements represent distinct ethnic groups within the broader Slavic family or space (this is the case of Scythian Assianism and Meryan Rodnovery). There are, otherwise, Rodnover groups that intertwine with forms of religion and spirituality which are not immediately related to the Slavic Native Faith (this is the case of Ivanovism, Roerichism and Anastasianism). Other documented movements include the devotees of Berehynia in Ukraine (Orantism), the Koliada Viatichey of Nikolay Speransky, the Russian Religious Church of Viktor Kandyba, and Authentism (Tezaurus), amongst others. Many of these movements share the assumption to represent expressions of \\"Vedism\\". Marlène Laruelle found that there are Rodnover movements which draw inspiration from Indo-Iranian sources, historical Vedism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism; Rodnover movements inspired to the Theosophy of Helena Blavatsky, the Fourth Way of George Gurdjieff and Peter Uspensky, and Roerichism (Nicholas Roerich); Rodnover movements inspired to East Asian religions with their practices of energetic healing and martial arts; Rodnover movements (often the most political ones) inspired to German Ariosophy and the Traditionalist School (studying thinkers such as René Guénon and Julius Evola); Rodnover movements centred on the Russian folk cult of the Mother Earth; and Rodnover movements drawing examples from Siberian shamanism. =Ethnic variations of Rodnovery= Krivich Rodnovery In Belarus and the neighboring regions of Russia, there is a branch of Rodnovery striving to reconstruct not a pan-Slavic religion, but the faith of the ethnic religion of the Krivichs, of one of the tribal unions of the early East Slavs, aligning with Baltic traditions. It is represented by organisations such as the Centre of Ethnocosmology–Kriya (Belarusian: Цэнтр Этнакасмалогіі \\"Крыўя\\"), and the Tver Ethnocultural Association–Tverzha (Russian: Тверское Этнокультурное Объединение \\"Твержа\\") founded in 2010. Meryan Rodnovery Meryan Rodnovery is a movement present in the regions of Ivanovo, Kostroma, Moscow, Vladimir, Vologda, Tver, and Yaroslavl. It consists in the establishment of an ethnoreligious identity among those Russians who have Meryan ancestry; Merya are Volga Finns fully assimilated by East Slavs in the historical process of formation of the Russian ethnicity. It is primarily an urban phenomenon and its adherents are Russian-speakers. Various organisations have been established in the late 2000s and 2010s, including Merjamaa and Merya Mir (Меря Мир, \\"Merya World\\"). In 2012 they presented their official flag. The scholar Pavel A. Skrylnikov notes that a salient feature of the movement is what he defines \\"ethnofuturism\\", that is to say, conscious adaptation of Merya heritage to the forms of modernity, in a process of distinction and interaction with Russian Native Faith. He says that Meryan Native Faith is mostly Slavic Native Faith whose concepts, names and iconoraphy are Finnicised. Meryan Rodnovers also rely upon the uninterrupted traditions of the Mari Native Faith; on 27 September 2015, they organised a joint Mari-Merya prayer in the Moscow region. The cult of a Meryan mother goddess is being built upon the festival of the female saint Paraskevi of Iconium, on November 10. Also, Saint Leontius of Rostov is appropriated as a native god. Scythian Assianism Ritual of the sword planted into a pile of stones or brushwood, to honour the martial deity (Perun), practised by Russian Ynglists in Omsk, Omsk Oblast. It is a Scythian ritual. Assianism (Russian: Ассианство) is essentially Scythian Rodnovery. It is present in Russia and Ukraine, especially, but not exclusively, among Cossacks who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. An organised renewal of Scythian religion started in the 1980s building upon the folk religious beliefs of the Ossetians, who are modern linguistic descendants of the Scythians. They endonymously call the religion Uatsdin (Ossetian Cyrillic: Уацдин, literally \\"True Faith\\"), and have embraced it in large numbers. The \\"North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire\\" is a Scythian Rodnover organisation in the North Caucasus region of Russia and eastern Ukraine that operates under the aegis of the Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith. There are various Assian organisations in North Ossetia–Alania, including the Atsætæ organisation led by Daurbek Makeyev. Some Russians have embraced Assianism by virtue of the fact that most of the ancient Scythians were assimilated by the East Slavs, and therefore modern Russians may reclaim Scythian culture. Such idea that Russians may derive, at least in part, from Scythians is popular in many Rodnover circles. Makeyev himself, in a 2007 publication entitled \\"Assianism and world culture\\" (Assianstvo i mirovaya kul'tura), presented the religion as a worldwide spiritual heritage. In 2009, on the occasion of a conference specifically dedicated to the subject held at the Moscow State University, the philosopher Alexander Dugin praised the renewal of Scythian culture among Ossetians as an inspiration that will be beneficial to all Indo- Europeans and to the whole world. Ukrainian Sylenkoism Sylenkoite clergy in a temple in Ukraine. Sylenkoism is the branch of Rodnovery represented by the churches of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (Ukrainian: Рі́дна Украї́нська Націона́льна Ві́ра) established by Lev Sylenko in the 1960s in the Ukrainian diaspora, and introduced in Ukraine only after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are at least four such churches: the Association of Sons and Daughters of Ukraine of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the Association of Sons and Daughters of the Native Ukrainian National Faith, the fellowship established by Volodymyr Chornyi centred in Lviv, and the more independent Union of the Native Ukrainian Faith. According to the definition of Sylenko himself, his doctrine is that of a solar \\"absolute monotheism\\", in which the single God is Dazhbog, that is to say the sky, the Sun, and the self-giving of the world itself. Sylenko proclaimed himself a prophet, bringing to the Slavs a new understanding of God that, according to him, corresponds to their own and original understanding of God. By his own words: \\"God's grace came upon me, and following the will of God I have proclaimed a new understanding of God\\". According to believers, he acquired this knowledge through \\"breath of his ancestors\\" being united with them \\"by divine holiness\\". The Federation of Ukrainian Rodnovers, which directly inherits Volodymyr Shaian's Orthodoxy, in the person of its leader Halyna Lozko has advanced vehement critiques of Sylenkoism, calling Lev Sylenko a \\"false prophet\\" and accusing him of trying to lead Ukrainians in the \\"quagmire of cosmopolitan monotheism\\", the \\"fruit of Judaic religions which aim for global world domination\\". Yagnovery, Ladovery, and Orantism Yagnovery (Ukrainian: Ягновіра), Ladovery (Ладовіра) and Orantism (Орантизм) are branches of Rodnovery that are present in Ukraine. Ladovery is a doctrine articulated by Oleksander Shokalo and other personalities in the magazine Ukrainsky svit (\\"Ukrainian World\\"). Orantism is a movement centred around the cult of Berehynia, linked to Ukrainian national identity, non-violence and resistance to global assimilation. =Movements often classified as \\"Vedism\\"= Peterburgian Vedism Peterburgian or Russian Vedism (Russian: Петербургский/Русский Ведизм) is one of the earliest Rodnover movements started by the philosopher Viktor Bezverkhy in Saint Petersburg, between the late 1980s and early 1990s, and primarily represented by the Society of the Mages (Общество Волхвов) founded in 1986 and the Union of the Veneds (Союз Венедов) established in 1990, and their various offshoots, including Skhoron ezh Sloven (Схорон еж Словен), established in 1991 by Vladimir Y. Golyakov, which has branches across Russia, and in Belarus and Ukraine. The use of the term \\"Vedism\\" to refer to Slavic religion goes back to Yuri Mirolyubov, the writer or discoverer of the Book of Veles. Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism Buildings in the Korenskye kinship estate, an Anastasian settlement in the Shebekinsky District of Belgorod Oblast, Russia. The Ringing Cedars (Russian: Звенящие Кедры) or Anastasianism (Анастасианство, Анастасиизм) is a spiritual movement that overlaps with Rodnovery. The Anastasian movement arose starting in 1997 from the writings of Vladimir Megre (Puzakov; born 1950), codified in a series of ten books entitled The Ringing Cedars of Russia, whose teachings are attributed to a beautiful Siberian woman known as Anastasia, often considered a deity or the incarnation of a deity, whom Megre would have met during one of his trade expeditions. These books teach what the scholar Rasa Pranskevičiūtė has defined as a \\"cosmological pantheism\\", in which nature is the manifested \\"thought of God\\" and human intelligence has the power to commune with him and to actively participate to the creation of the world. Anastasians have established rural villages all over Russia and in other countries. Their settlements are known as \\"kinship homesteads\\" (родовое поместье, rodovoye pomest'ye), where they conduct a harmonious life in at least a hectare of land, owned by a kinship. The name \\"Ringing Cedars\\" derives from the beliefs held by Anastasians about the spiritual qualities of the Siberian cedar. In his writings, Megre identifies the ideal society which the Ringing Cedars' movement aims at establishing as \\"Vedic\\", and many of his teachings are identical to those of other movements of Rodnovery. Roerichism, Bazhovism, and Ivanovism Varangian Rosses from Scandinavia to the heart of the Eurasian continent. Roerichism (Russian: Рерихиа́нство) and Ivanovism (Ивановизм) are spiritual movements linked with Russian cosmism, a holistic philosophy emphasising the centrality of the human being within a living environment, in turn related to the God- Building movement. It originated in the early twentieth century and experienced a revival after the collapse of the Soviet Union, relying upon the Russian philosophical tradition, especially that represented by Vladimir Vernadsky and Pavel Florensky. The Roerichian movement originated from the teachings of Helena and Nicholas Roerich, it inherits elements of Theosophy, and revolves around the practice of Agni Yoga, the union with Agni, the fire enliving the universe. Ivakhiv classifies Roerichians and others movements of Theosophical imprint, such as the Ukrainian Spiritual Republic founded by Oles Berdnyk, together within the broader \\"Vedic\\" movement. Ivanovism is a spiritual discipline based on the teachings of the mystic Porfiry Ivanov, based on the Detka healing system and religious hymns. The movement has its headquarters in eastern Ukraine, the region of origin of Ivanov himself, and it is widespread in Russia. Ivanovite teachings are incorporated by Peterburgian Vedism. Shnirelman reported in 2008 that Ivanovism was estimated to have \\"a few dozen thousand followers\\". Bazhovism (Бажовство) originated as a branch of the Roerichian movement and is centred in the Ural region of Russia, where Arkaim, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, is regarded by the Bazhovites as the world's spiritual centre. The Bazhovites retain most of the Roerichian practices, and worship, as their major deities, the Mistress of the Copper Mountain and the Great Snake. Tezaurus' Authentism, and the Way of Troyan Authentism (Russian: Аутентизм), incorporated as the Tezaurus Spiritual Union (Духовный Союз \\"Тезаурус\\"), is a Rodnover spiritual philosophy and psychological order created by the psychologist Sergey Petrovich Semenov in 1984, in Saint Petersburg. The movement is based on the teachings of the Russian Veda, considered an expression of Slavic paganism, Russian cosmism and psychoanalysis. The aim of the Authentist philosophical practice is to reveal one's own true spiritual essence, which is identical with God, Rod—which is viewed as the complementary unity of Belobog/Sventovid and Chernobog/Veles—and therefore the unity of mankind and God, which characterises Russia's special mission opposed to Western individualism. The Way of Troyan (Тропа Троянова, Tropa Troyanova; where \\"Troyan\\" is another name of the god Triglav, regarded as the patron god of Russia), incorporated as the Academy of Self-Knowledge (Академия Самопознания) and the All-Russian Association of Russian Folk Culture (Всероссийское Общество Русской Народной Культуры), is a Rodnover psychological movement founded in 1991 by the historian and psychologist Aleksei Andreev (pseudonym of Aleksandr Shevtsov) relying upon a thorough ethnographic fieldwork, especially focused on the Ofeni tribe of Vladimir Oblast. Tropa Troyanova does not identify as a \\"religion\\", but rather as a \\"traditional worldview\\". The movement promotes traditional Russian healing methods, psychoanalysis and martial arts. Ynglism Ynglism (Russian: Инглии́зм), institutionally known as the Ancient Russian Ynglist Church of the Orthodox Old Believers–Ynglings, was established in the early 1990s by the charismatic leader Aleksandr Khinevich from Omsk, in Siberia. According to the movement, which presents itself as the true, Orthodox, olden religion of the Russians and the Slavs, Yngly is the fiery order of reality through which the supreme God—called by the name \\"Ramha\\" in Ynglist theology—ongoingly generates the universe. They believe that \\"Yngling\\", a name that identifies the earliest royal kins of Scandinavia, means \\"offspring of Yngly\\", and that the historical Ynglings migrated to Scandinavia from the region of Omsk, which was a spiritual centre of the early Indo-Europeans. They hold that the Saga ob Ynglingakh, their Russian version of the Germanic Ynglinga saga (itself composed by Snorri Sturluson on the basis of an older Ynglingatal), proves their ideas about the origins of the Ynglings in Omsk, and that the Germanic Eddas are ultimately a more recent, western European and Latinised version of their own sacred books, the Slavo-Aryan Vedas. Besides their Vedas, the Ynglists instruct their disciples about \\"Aryan mathematics\\" and grammar, and techniques for a \\"healthy way of life\\", including forms of eugenics. The Church is known for its intensive proselytism, carried out through a \\"massive selling\\" of books, journals and other media. Ynglists organise yearly gatherings (veche) in summer. The Ynglist Church was prosecuted in the early 2000s for ethnic hatred according to Russian laws, and its headquarters in Omsk were liquidated. Despite this, Ynglism continues to operate as an unregistered religious phenomenon represented by a multiplicity of communities. Ynglism meets widespread disapproval within mainstream Rodnovery, and an international veche of important Rodnover organisations has declared it a false religion. Nevertheless, according to Aitamurto, on the basis of the amount of literature that Ynglists publish and the presence of their representatives at various Rodnover conferences, is clear that Ynglism has a \\"substantial number of followers\\". The scholar Elena Golovneva described Ynglist ideas as \\"far from being marginal\\" within Russian Rodnovery. =Other movements= Worship ceremony led by the priests of the Ukrainian organisation General Fire of Slavic Native Faith. Koliada Viatichey (Russian: Коляда Вятичей) is a Rodnover faction that emerged in 1998 through the union of the Viatichi group founded by Nikolay Speransky (volkhv Velimir) in 1995, which comprised well-educated Moscow intellectuals, and the Koliada community. Koliada Viatichey refutes any non-Slavic influence in their religion, including the label \\"Vedic\\" and Vedic literature, influences from Eastern religions, influences from Roerichism and esotericism, and also the Book of Veles. The movement also rejects extreme right-wing and anti-Semitic ideas. Yet, they espouse Russian nationalism, ancestrality and ecology, and oppose Christianity (but not folk Orthodoxy, which is regarded as a continuation of Russian indigenous religion) and the Western \\"technocratic civilisation\\". Koliada Viatichey is theologically dualistic, giving prominence to the complementary principles of Belobog and Chernobog, respectively governing spirit and matter, a polar duality which reflects itself in humanity as the soul and the body. Polytheism is accepted for its ability to \\"account for the complexity of the world with its multiple good and evil forces\\", and particularly emphasised is the popular Russian belief in the great goddess of the Earth (Mokosh or Mat Syra Zemlya). Speransky has adopted the concept of Darna from Lithuanian Romuva, explaining it as ordered life \\"in accordance with the Earth and with the ancestors\\". The Way of Great Perfection is an esoteric doctrine of the left-hand path elaborated by Ilya Cherkasov (volkhv Veleslav), offering a perspective which according to him never existed in Slavic religion. He borrows from various traditions, including Tantrism, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism and alchemy, as well as the medieval German mysticism of the Friends of God (Meister Eckhart and Johannes Tauler). The goal of this esoteric system goes beyond that of other left-hand path traditions which stop at the deification of the individual; the goal of Veleslav's way is the union of the individual with the supreme source of all divinity. Veleslav's left-hand path has been criticised by other Rodnover groups and leaders including Nikolay Speransky. According to Laruelle, the most politicised current of Rodnovery has given rise to organisations including the Church of the Nav (Це́рковь На́ви), founded by Ilya Lazarenko and inspired by German Ariosophy; the Dead Water movement and its parties which participated to the Duma elections in 2003; Aleksandr Sevastianov's National Party of the Russian Great Power, which has had links with politicians close to the former mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov (1936–2019); and the Party of Aryan Socialism led by Vladimir Danilov. The ideas of these Rodnover political groups span from extreme right-wing nationalism and racism, to Stalinism, seen by some of them as the most successful political expression of Paganism. Demographics =Eastern Slavic nations= Russia Group of Anastasian believers in Russia. Writing in 2000, Shnirelman noted that Rodnovery was growing rapidly within the Russian Federation. In 2016, Aitamurto noted that there was no reliable information on the number of Rodnovers in Russia, but that it was plausible that there were several tens of thousands of practitioners active in the country. This was partly because there were several Rodnover groups active on the social network VK which had over 10,000 members. Estimates from some research institutes, often reported by Russian Orthodox Church organs, put the number of Native Faith practitioners in the few millions. In 2003, the Russian Ministry of Justice had forty registered Rodnover organisations, while there were \\"probably several hundred of them in existence\\". Aitamurto observed that a substantial number of adherents—and in particular those who had been among the earliest—belonged to the \\"technical intelligentsia\\". Similarly, Shnirelman noted that the founders of Russian Rodnovery were \\"well-educated urbanised intellectuals\\" who had become frustrated with \\"cosmopolitan urban culture\\". Physicists were particularly well represented; in this Aitamurto drew comparisons to the high number of computer professionals who were present in the Pagan communities of Western countries. The movement also involved a significant number of people who had a background in the Soviet or Russian Army, or in policing and security. The vast majority of Russian Rodnovers were young and there were a greater proportion of men than women. A questionnaire distributed at the Kupala festival in Maloyaroslavets suggested that Rodnovers typically had above-average levels of education, with a substantial portion working as business owners or managers. A high proportion were also involved in specialist professions such as engineering, academia, or information technology, and the majority lived in cities. Marlène Laruelle similarly noted that Rodnovery in Russia has spread mostly among the young people and the cultivated middle classes, that portion of Russian society interested in the post-Soviet revival of faith but turned off by Orthodox Christianity, \\"which is very institutionalized\\" and \\"out of tune with the modern world\\", and \\"is not appealing [to these people] because it expects its faithful to comply with normative beliefs without room for interpretation\\". Rodnovery is attractive because of its \\"paradoxical conjunction\\" of tradition and modernity, recovery of the past through innovative syntheses, and its values calling for a rediscovery of the true relationship between mankind, nature and the ancestors. Rodnovery has also contributed to the diffusion of \\"historical themes\\"—particularly regarding an ancient Aryan race—to the general population, including many who were Orthodox or non-religious. Some strains of Rodnovery have become close supporters and components of Eurasianism (whose most prominent contemporary theorist is the philosopher Alexander Dugin), the currently dominant ideology of the Russian central state. A number of youth subcultures have been identified as introducing people to Rodnovery, among them heavy metal, historical re-enactment, and the admirers of J. R. R. Tolkien. Rodnovery is also spread through a variety of newspapers and journals. Also popular with Russian Rodnovers has been the martial arts movement known as Slavyano-goritskaya bor'ba. A number of popular celebrities, including the singer Maria Arkhipova and the professional boxer Aleksandr Povetkin, have publicly embraced Rodnovery. Ukraine People gathered for worship at a temple of the Native Ukrainian National Faith in Ukraine. Slavic Native Faith underwent dramatic growth in Ukraine during the early and mid 1990s. In 2005, Ivakhiv noted that there were likely between 5000 and 10,000 practitioners in Ukraine. Three years later he reported sociological researches suggesting Ukrainian Rodnovers to be 90,000 or 0.2% of the population. The religion's \\"main base\\" consisted of ethnic Ukrainians who were \\"nationally oriented\\" and who displayed higher than average levels of education. There is overlap between Slavic Native Faith followers and other sectors of Ukrainian society, such as the folk and traditional music revival groups, Cossack associations, traditional martial arts groups, and nationalist and ultra-nationalist organisations. Ivakhiv noted that Rodnovery remains \\"a relatively small niche in Ukrainian religious culture\\", and that it faces a mixed reception in the country. Established Ukrainian Orthodox and Roman Catholic groups have viewed it with alarm and hostility, while the country's educated and intellectual classes tend to view it as a fringe part of the ultra-conservative movement which was tinged with anti-Semitism and xenophobia. In the global Ukrainian diaspora, there has been a \\"great decline\\" in the numbers practising the Native Ukrainian National Faith branch of Rodnovery. This has been due to branch's inability to attract sufficient numbers of youth in this community. Alternately, the Ukrainian organisation Ancestral Fire of the Native Orthodox Faith has expanded in both Moldova and Germany. Belarus Fire ritual of Belarusian Rodnovers. Slavic Native Faith groups are also active in Belarus, the most numerous being the Commonwealth of Rodoviches (Rodnovers), who fully align with Slavic traditions, and the organisation Radzimas, aligning with Baltic traditions instead. Rodnovery in Belarus is popular among some intellectuals active in the pro-Russian political scene, for instance Rodnover leader Uladzimir Sacevič. =Southern Slavic nations= As of 2013, Rodnover groups in Bulgaria were described as having few members and little influence. In Serbia, there is the Association of Rodnovers of Serbia \\"Staroslavci\\" (Serbian: Удружење родноверних Србије \\"Старославци\\"). There is a Slavic Native Faith group called \\"Circle of Svarog\\" (Svaroži Krug) in Bosnia and Herzegovina that was created in 2011. The group is associated with the movement of Praskozorje. =Western Slavic nations= Group of Polish Rodnovers celebrating a ritual in winter. In 2013, Simpson noted that Slavic Native Faith remains a \\"very small religion\\" in Poland, which is otherwise dominated by Roman Catholicism. He suggested that there were under 900 regularly active members of the main four registered Polish Native Faith organisations, and around as many adherents belonging to smaller, unregistered groups. In 2017, he stated that between 2000 and 2500 \\"actively engaged and regular participants\\" were likely active in the country. He observed that in the country, Slavic Native Faith's adherents were \\"still relatively young\\", and saw an overlap with the community of historical re- enactors. In Poland, Slavic Native Faith outnumbers other Pagan religions, although both are represented in the Pagan Federation International's Polish branch. Anna-Marie Dostálová stated that the entire Pagan community in the Czech Republic—which includes Heathens, Wiccans, and Druids as well as Slavic Rodnovers—was of a \\"small size\\". =Baltic states' Slavic minorities= There are also practising Rodnovers among Lithuania's and Estonia's ethnically Russian minorities. Russians in Estonia have established their own religious organisation, the Fellowship of the Russian People's Faith in Estonia registered in Tartu in 2010. In Lithuania there are also homesteads of the Anastasian movement. =Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States= In Australia there is \\"Southern Cross Rodnovery\\", a Rodnover organisation that caters to Australians of Slavic ethnicity. It is officially registered as a charity by the government of Australia. In Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, within the Ukrainian diaspora, there are various congregations of the Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira).

Self-styled \\"The Young Adventurer,\\" he was one of Francis I's close companions in the last years of Louis XII's life, and remained close after Francis ascended the throne. A fondness for military exercises displayed itself in his earliest years, and at the age of ten he was sent to the court of Louis XII, and placed in charge of the count of Angoulême, afterwards King Francis I. In his twentieth year he married a niece of the cardinal d'Amboise, but after three months he quit his home to join the French army in the Milanese. With a handful of troops he threw himself into Verona, then besieged by the Venetians; but the siege was protracted, and being impatient for more active service, he rejoined the army. He then took part in the relief of Mirandola, besieged by the troops of Pope Julius II, and in other actions of the campaign. In 1512 the French being driven from Italy, Fleuranges was sent into Flanders to levy a body of 10,000 men, in command of which, under his father, he returned to Italy in 1513, seized Alessandria, and vigorously assailed Novara. But the French were defeated, and Fleuranges narrowly escaped with his life, having received more than forty wounds. He was rescued by his father and sent to Vercelli, and thence to Lyon. Returning to Italy with Francis in 1515, he distinguished himself in various affairs, and especially at Marignano, where he had a horse shot under him, and contributed so powerfully to the victory of the French that the king knighted him with his own hand. He next took Cremona, and was there called home by the news of his father's illness. In 1519 he was sent into Germany on the difficult errand of inducing the electors to give their votes in favor of Francis; but in this he failed. The war in Italy being rekindled, Fleuranges accompanied the king there, fought at Pavia (1525), and was taken prisoner with his royal master. The emperor, irritated by the defection of his father, Robert II, sent him into confinement in Flanders, where he remained for some years. During this imprisonment he was created marshal of France. He employed his enforced leisure in writing his Histoire des choses mémorables advenues du règne de Louis XII et de François I, depuis 1499 jusqu'en l'an 1521. In this work he designates himself Jeune Adventureux. Within a small compass he gives many curious and interesting details of the time, writing only of what he had seen, and in a very simple but vivid style. The book was first published in 1735, by Abbé Lambert, who added historical and critical notes; and it has been reprinted in several collections. The last occasion on which Fleuranges was engaged in active service was at the defence of Péronne, besieged by the count of Nassau in 1536. In the following year he heard of his father's death, and set out from Amboise for his estate of La Marck; but he was seized with illness at Longjumeau, and died there in December 1537. He had married in 1510 with Guillemette de Sarrebruck and had 1 son : * Robert IV de La Marck (1512-1556), Duke of Bouillon, Prince of Sedan and Marshal of France.

Laid down in December 1978 and commissioned in October 1981, the corvette operated in the Persian Gulf on two occasions, first in 1990 and 1991 as part of the multinational fleet enforcing the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, then again in 2003 in support of the United States-led invasion of Iraq. Olfert Fischer was deployed as part of the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic (and its successor, the Standing NATO Response Force Maritime Group 1) on at least four occasions during her career.

The corvette is fitted with a Rascall Cutlass B-1 intercept unit, a Telgon HFD/F unit, and four 6-round Seagnat Mk 36 chaff launchers. Construction The three ships were built by Aalborg Værft, at their shipyard in Aalborg, Denmark.Wertheim (ed.), Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 153 Olfert Fischer was the second to be built: she was laid down on 6 December 1978, and launched on 12 January 1980. Althoigh scheduled to commission on 25 May 1981, a fire broke out in the engine room eleven days prior, and the time required to repair the ship meant that she missed this date. Olfert Fischer entered service on 16 October 1981. The corvette, along with her two sister ships, was based at Korsør on Sealand Island. Operational history Following the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait at the start of August 1990, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq, and asked that member nations contribute forces to help implement them.Houben, International crisis management, p. 93 On 31 August, the Danish Parliament decided that a single ship, Olfert Fischer, would make up the Danish contribution. The corvette was to enforce the UN sanctions only; she was not to become involved in the developing Gulf War. She was accompanied and supported by a Norwegian supply ship. The Gulf War deployment, which ended in September 1991, was the first time a Danish warship had operated outside the European region.Balsved, Olfert Fischer (1981-)Houben, International crisis management, p. 94 The deployment marked a change in Danish attitudes and actions towards international security and foreign policy. During 1992, 1994, and 1995, Olfert Fischer was assigned to the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic. Six ships of Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG) 1 sailing in formation in 2007.

It was formed in 1987 to promote the use of Cornish as a spoken language in the Cornish revival (). At that time only those observed to be using the language fluently could become members by invitation. In 1990 Agan Tavas was reformed by its members into an open society with the aim of ensuring continued support for the Unified form of revived Cornish first put forward in 1929 by Robert Morton Nance. Orthographic Standards Agan Tavas recognises the validity of any form of Revived Cornish based on orthography used by Cornish people at any time in the history of the language. It opposes the use of what it sees as invented forms of the language which lack any historical authenticity. Agan Tavas received a boost in its membership after 1995 when Nicholas Williams of University College Dublin claimed in his book Cornish Today that the form of Cornish known as Kernewek Kemmyn \\"Common Cornish\\", devised by Ken George and favoured by the Kesva an Taves Kernewek \\"Cornish Language Board\\", was badly flawed. At present, Agan Tavas supports the amendments made to Unified Cornish but respects the rights of its members to use either Unified Cornish or Unified Cornish Revised. It maintains a list of classes using historical Cornish, organises events for its members and publishes books in both Unified and Unified Cornish Revised. It produces for its members the four monthly bilingual magazine, An Gowsva \\"The Talking Shop\\". Both previous Chairmen, Andrew Climo and Craig Weatherhill, have been advocates of bringing the language community together by means of a Standard Written Form based on traditional forms of Cornish.

These small marsupials are part of the rat-kangaroo family. The long-nosed potoroo contains two subspecies, P. t. tridactylus from Mainland Australia, and P. t. apicalis from Tasmania, which tends to have lighter fur than P. t. tridactylus. At first glance, the long-nosed potoroo with its pointed nose and grey-brown fur looks very much like a bandicoot — that is, until it hops away with its front feet tucked into its chest, revealing its close relationship with the kangaroo family. The long-nosed potoroo exhibits many morphological specializations such as an elongated pointed rostral region (nose), erect ears, large eyes, claws for digging, and long robust hind legs.Seebeck 1981 It is only a small marsupial, with a body length between , and a semi-prehensile tail length of . As it is rarely seen in the wild, better indicators of its presence are the runways it makes through the undergrowth and the hollow diggings it leaves behind when feeding on underground roots and fungi.  Taxonomy  The species was first noted in 1790 by John White in a record of his journey to Botany Bay. The informal description named the animal as a \\"Poto Roo\\" or \\"Kangaroo Rat\\" and was accompanied by an illustration. The classification of the genus Potorous has seen the name subjected to frequent revisions. The following is a summary of the associated species and subspecies, * genus Potorous :* P. gilbertii Gilbert's potoroo, :* P. longipes Long-footed potoroo, :* P. platyops Broad-faced potoroo, † modern extinction :* P. tridactylus Long-nosed potoroo, ::*Potorous tridactylus tridactylus ::*Potorous tridactylus apicalis Habitat and distribution A pair of Long- nosed Potoroos. The long-nosed potoroo is found in a variety of microhabitats located in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and South-Western Victoria on the Australian mainland, and in Tasmania.Norton 2010, Bennett 1993 Its bones have been found in a number of cave deposits, indicating it was once more widespread than it is today. This species prefers a range of vegetation types, from subtropical and warm temperate rainforest, through tall open forest with dense understorey, to dense coastal heaths. Its main requirement is thick groundcover, which it needs for protection and nesting material. It also prefers light soils that are easy to dig in for the underground roots and fungi that it eats. Home-range sizes of the long-nosed potoroo vary considerably; the largest recorded was .Kitchener 1973 In Tasmania, large overlapping home ranges of have been recorded, with males typically acquiring more land than females. Home ranges in Victoria, however, are much smaller. Life history and behaviour Long-nosed Potoroo Generally, the long-nosed potoroo is solitary and has only been observed in brief encounters for mating and when with young. There have also been reports of several males and females feeding in loose aggregations. These mammals are non-territorial and frequently have overlapping home ranges. The male's home range can overlap many females', but the female's home range is usually exclusive, allowing the female access to the male year round. Breeding, however, usually occurs from late winter to early summer.Bali et al. 2003 Females are polyestrous and can have up to two reproductive sessions per year. The long-nosed potoroo is nocturnal, spending much of its time within the shelter of understorey vegetation. It uses long, slightly curved claws on its front feet to dig up its food. It is an omnivore and eats underground fruiting bodies of fungi, roots, fruit, flowers, seeds, and insects and their larvae.Bennett 1989 Fungi are the main dietary component, and are a very important resource in the potoroo's diet, with at least 50 species consumed depending on seasonal variation.Lewis 2009 During the fall and winter months, potoroos primarily consume fungi and seeds, while in the spring and summer months, the amount of arthropods, plant tissue, fruits, and flowers consumed increases. The long- nosed potoroo sniffs the ground with a side to side motion near the vicinity of food. Once the long-nosed potoroo has located a possible food source (with its sense of smell), it positions itself to begin excavating with its forepaws.Vernes 2014 Because it eats fungi, it spreads fungal spores in its droppings. Some of these fungi grow on the roots of native plants and assist the plant in the uptake of nutrients from the soil. Threatening processes The long-nosed potoroo was one of the first marsupials to be described by European settlers. Unfortunately, these early encounters with this species were the result of the spread of human settlement, which has led to the clearing of much of its habitat for grazing and other land uses. Threats to the long-nosed potoroo include feral cats, wild dogs, red foxes, human settlement, and fragmentation for agriculture, livestock grazing, habitat degradation, habitat clearance/loss, and inappropriate fire regimes.Curtis 2011 The pattern of burning in areas of remaining habitat has also changed, with more severe and more frequent fires creating a sparse understorey that provides little shelter for small mammals like the potoroo. This species is listed as Near Threatened according to the IUCN red list, Vulnerable in Queensland according to the Nature Conservation Act 1992 and also nationally by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is listed under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 as endangered in Victoria. Recovery actions Past conservation initiatives listed the long-nosed potoroo under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act of 1988, construction of conservation reserves at Barren Ground Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park, and the preparation of a recovery plan which outlines priorities for species research.Lewis 2009, Curtis 2011 A completed national recovery plan is still a work in progress, however, the Department of Environment and Conservation has prepared a (PAS) Priorities Action Statement in order to help aid in the recovery of threatened species in New South Wales. Sarah Stone for John White, 1790 This statement encourages: *Controlling fox population *Controlling weeds that affect habitat *Enforcing appropriate fire regimes *Increasing habitat by creating barriers/corridors linking habitat patches *Preventing spread of disease (Phytophthora sp.) *Restricting livestock from habitat *Pursue formal protection of remaining areas of known habitat *Inform public *Researching: **Estimate population sizes and densities using survey methods **Genetic differences between populations **Diet preference **Effects of disturbance on fungi species(e.g. fertilizer use) **Effects of predation on populations **Determine need for captive breeding-reintroduction programs There is ongoing monitoring of the long-nosed potoroo while a recovery plan is being prepared for this species.

Camp Arifjan is a United States Army installation in Kuwait which accommodates elements of the US Air Force, US Navy, US Marine Corps and US Coast Guard. The camp is funded and was built by the government of Kuwait. Military personnel from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Romania and Poland are also forward deployed there. Camp Arifjan is located south of Kuwait City, and west of the Shuaiba Port (Military Sea Port of Debarkation/Embarkation, or SPOD) and Kuwait Naval Base (KNB). Camp Arifjan is divided into 7 zones. Camp Arifjan is a US military installation used as a forward logistics base, Aviation Classification and Repair Activity Depot (Task Force AVCRAD) for the entire Southwest Asian Theater (through Patton Army Air Field), helicopter ground support base, and as a motor pool for armored and unarmored vehicles. U.S. military vehicles that did not receive new additional armor plating in the United States prior to deployment to U.S. Central Command–tens of thousands–received their \\"up-armoring\\" at Camp Arifjan. Additionally, many thousands of service members and contractors pass through Camp Arifjan either on their way to or from Iraq, Afghanistan or other countries in Southwest Asia. The service members deployed to Camp Arifjan are in a variety of different statuses. Many are on active duty and come on a one-year Permanent Change of Station (PCS), while some active duty come in a Temporary Change of Station (TCS) status. Additionally, there are many Guard and Reserve units that support a variety of functions in the SouthWest Asia [SWA] theater that come on varied length tours.

Because of the Khobar Towers bombing of 1996 in nearby Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Army decided to replace Camp Doha near Basrah with a base more protected from terrorist attacks. In July 1999, the Kuwaiti government began constructing Camp Arifjan south of its capital.  Patton Army Air Field  Patton Army Airfield is the United States Army airfield, located within the camp boundaries. Patton Army Airfield is run by elements of the Army National Guard's Aviation Classification and Repair Activity Depots (AVCRADs). Organizational (AVUM), Intermediate (AVIM) and limited depot maintenance support is available via Patton Army Airfield and its corresponding AVCRAD elements to many United States military aviation assets within the Southwest Asian Theater (SWA). The airfield is named in memory of General George S. Patton.  Facilities  The base has undergone many changes within the past several years, including the construction of half a dozen barracks, hundreds of \\"temporary\\" or transitional barracks, known as PCBs (Pre-Fabricated Concrete Buildings), three dining facilities, and the establishment of three base exchanges (AAFES), as well as a major addition of paved roads throughout the Camp. There are approximately 9,000 personnel stationed at Camp Arifjan. In addition, a number of foreign nationals also work at the base. The facility is primarily staffed by US Army Contractors. The base leadership continues to allow local and Third Country National vendors to set up small shops within the main PX lobby. In addition to the permanent vendors, certain vendors are also allowed to set up large Arab-style bazaars on Wednesdays and Sundays.

There is also a large Chilli's restaurant with 250-person seating capacity, as well as three Military Dining Facilities (DFACs), some of which serve four meals daily. In addition, the camp - known colloquially by the initials \\"AJ\\" or as Camp Afri-jail\\\\- is regarded by U.S. military personnel as having the best recreational facilities of any Kuwaiti military installation. The camp's swimming pool and three gym facilities make it the most desirable duty station in the country among foreign military personnel. Recreation centers are located in Zone-1 and Zone-6.

Nonsense! is the third full-length album by Art of Noise, recorded in 1987 and released in September that year. By the time of its recording, the group had been reduced to a duo, with the engineer Gary Langan leaving the previous year; Langan's mix engineering work was taken over by Bob Kraushaar and Ted Hayton for this album, but the music was produced entirely by Anne Dudley and J.J. Jeczalik. With this album, the group expanded its sound to include rock and orchestral instrumentation, in addition to its trademark sampling. Many of the album's tracks are seamlessly segued; ambient soundscapes blend into percussive rhythms, dramatic buildups, melodic string arrangements, clarinet ensemble arrangements, and vocal choruses and chants. The sounds of various forms of transport are a recurrent theme. Musical motifs from \\"Dragnet\\", \\"Galleons of Stone\\" and \\"Ode to Don Jose\\" recur throughout the album. In addition, \\"Roundabout 727\\" samples \\"A Nation Rejects\\", a B-side from the In Visible Silence album. The original LP and cassette releases end side A with \\"E.F.L.\\" and resume with \\"Ode to Don Jose\\" on side B. For the CD pressings that followed, \\"Don Jose\\" and its following track, \\"A Day at the Races\\", were swapped. To compensate for the change, the field recording from the end of \\"Don Jose\\" were appended to \\"E.F.L.\\" instead. Some cassette pressings of this album have the same program recorded on both sides, due to the advantages of C90 tape and the desire to keep the album as one continuous piece. \\"Ransom on the Sand\\" is sampled in \\"Melt\\", the fourth track of Leftfield's 1995 album Leftism. On 2 November 2018, the album was re-released in a new, expanded \\"deluxe\\" format alongside 20+ remixes, 12\\" versions and expanded versions of the original tracks on the album, including many tracks which didn't make the original album first time around.

Restoration of the station after 21 months of disuse cost £3,250, which was paid for by the then Blaby Rural District Council and Narborough Parish Council. Next to the station is a level crossing across Station Road. Services There are services to and in each direction usually every hour. There are three trains per day to Stansted Airport and a fourth to on weekdays only. This station has a waiting room, which is open for the same hours as the booking office.

It was formed by the merger in November 2001 of Bonhams & Brooks and Phillips Son & Neale. This brought together two of the four surviving Georgian auction houses in London, Bonhams having been founded in 1793, and Phillips in 1796 by Harry Phillips, formerly a senior clerk to James Christie. Today, the amalgamated business handles art and antiques auctions. It operates two salerooms in London--the former Phillips sale room at 101 New Bond Street, and the old Bonham's sale room at the Montpelier Galleries in Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge--with a smaller sale room in Edinburgh. Sales are also held around the world in New York, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney, and Singapore. Bonhams holds more than 280 sales a year in more than 60 collecting areas, including Asian art, Pictures, motor cars and jewellery. It has sales in London, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Edinburgh and Sydney. Bonhams has more than 550 staff with some of the world's leading specialists in their fields. History Bonhams was set up in 1793 when Thomas Dodd, an antique print dealer, joined forces with the book specialist Walter Bonham. The company expanded and by the 1850s was handling all categories of antiques including jewellery, porcelain, furniture, arms and armour, and wine. After returning from the war, in the early 1950s, Leonard Bonham purchased some land in Knightsbridge and erected a saleroom on Montpelier Street. The first sale was held in June 1956. In 2000, Bonhams became Bonhams & Brooks when it was acquired by Brooks auction house. Brooks had been founded in 1989 by the former Head of Cars at Christie's, Robert Brooks who specialized in the sale of classic and vintage motorcars. Brooks continued a major acquisition programme aimed at creating a new international fine art auction house. In 2001 Bonhams & Brooks merged with Phillips Son & Neale to form a new UK company trading as Bonhams. Phillips Son & Neale had been based in 101 New Bond Street, which subsequently became the new headquarters of Bonhams. The building consisted of seven different freeholds and had been described as \\"a Dickensian rabbit warren\\". The first of the sites to be acquired was Blenstock House, an Art Deco building at the junction of Blenheim Street and Woodstock Street, eventually acquiring the complete building in 1974. Acquisition activity continued, and in 2002 Bonhams purchased Butterfields, a leading auction house on the West Coast founded in 1865. Bonhams changed Butterfields’ name to Bonhams & Butterfields, and Malcolm Barber, formerly of Brooks, became the chief executive officer of the American subsidiary. Bonhams remained the company's brand name outside of the United States. By the end of 2003 Bonhams was conducting more than 700 annual sales with revenues of $304 million. The company's worldwide network of sales included two major London venues, nine additional UK locations, and salerooms in Switzerland, Monaco, Germany, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sydney. Bonhams & Butterfields conducted its first East Coast sale in 2003 with an auction of Edwin C. Jameson's collection of classic cars and antiques in Massachusetts. During 2005, Bonhams continued to expand its presence in the US and acquired a new saleroom on Madison Avenue in New York. The company also expanded further in Europe with the opening of the Paris office in June 2005. In October 2005, Bonhams gained full independence after buying back a 49.9% stake held by French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. As part of a phased programme of international expansion, Bonhams opened an office in Hong Kong in 2007. Seven years later, in 2014, it established an East Asian HQ and saleroom in Hong Kong in One Pacific Place. Bonhams East Asian and Southeast Asian network now also includes offices in Beijing, Taiwan and Singapore. In March 2008, Bonhams New York moved to new salerooms on the corner of 57th Street and Madison Avenue - formerly the home of the respected Dahesh Museum of Art. The inaugural sale featured 20th century furniture and decorative arts. In 2013, Bonhams opened its new headquarters at 101 New Bond Street, a state-of-the-art building, designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands; and in 2015 it completed a seven-figure refurbishment of its Knightsbridge saleroom. In 2016, Bonhams held its first online-only auction. The sale – Watches and Wristwatches from the Collection of a European Nobleman – was 100 per cent sold. In September 2018, Bonhams was acquired by the UK-based private equity company, Epiris. Locations Bonhams has a worldwide network of offices and regional representatives in 25 countries. It has three salerooms in the UK; two major salerooms in London – New Bond Street and Knightsbridge, and a saleroom in Edinburgh. Regional offices around the UK offer valuation and consignment services. In Europe, sales are held in France, Monaco and Belgium. In the US, sales are held in Los Angeles, and New York. In Asia-Pacific, sales take place in Bonhams saleroom in Pacific Place, Hong Kong, and in Sydney.

The story of their marriage was depicted in the TV film Rock Hudson (1990), starring Daphne Ashbrook as Gates and Thomas Ian Griffith as Hudson.  Early life  Gates was born in Dawson, Minnesota, and raised on a farm. Early in her life, she worked as a sales clerk in a department store, airline stewardess, and secretary for a New York City talent agent, before moving to Hollywood to work for Hollywood talent agent Henry Willson, who represented actors Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter and Rory Calhoun.  Marriage to Rock Hudson  Gates met Rock Hudson in October 1954. They started dating some time later and were married in Santa Barbara, California, on November 9, 1955, shortly after he finished filming Giant. Following a brief honeymoon in Jamaica, their marriage began to disintegrate. They separated in 1957, following rumors that Hudson had committed adultery while on location in Italy for the film A Farewell to Arms. The rumors were later confirmed by a close friend of Gates's, who also revealed to her that the individual Hudson had the affair with was a man. The divorce was eventually finalized in 1958.  Later life  Gates later became a successful interior decorator. She died from lung cancer at her home in Marina del Rey, California, aged 80. She was survived by her sister Marvis Ketelsen and brother Russell Gates. In her autobiography, published in 1987 after Hudson's 1985 death from AIDS, Gates wrote that she was in love with Hudson and that she did not know Hudson was gay when they married, and was not complicit in his deception. However, the author and journalist Robert Hofler wrote in the biography The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson : \\"Those who knew her (Gates) say she was a lesbian who tried to blackmail her movie star husband (Hudson)\\" or \\"She then became addicted to being the wife of a star, and didn't want the divorce (...) Phyllis could play around with women, but Rock had to remain faithful to her. In a way, she was just being pragmatic: she feared that Rock's exposure would ruin his fame, which was in turn her gravy train.\\" This was disputed by Gates in an interview with Larry King in which she also said that she had been the one to initiate the divorce based on her husband's behavior. Gates said she did not get much in the divorce because she did not want to take advantage of him. She also said that she had never stopped loving him, and that he was the 'love of her life'.

It is important to keep your feet on the ground in a > profession where you are idolized to such an extent that each wish becomes a > command for others. But I had always wanted to quit films at the peak of my > career. I had prepared myself mentally for that moment. One of the reasons > why I am at peace with myself is that I never socialized or made friends > with the showbiz lot. Examples of actors like Waheed Murad made a deep > impression on me. I never wanted to touch the peak of stardom only to drop > low in life. No, life is more than lights, adulation and being beautiful,\\" In 2005, she appeared in a Lux 50 years celebration commercial.

The album saw the group experimenting with world music, collaborating with South African Zulu group Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, who provide a heavy layer of mostly non-English-language vocals on three tracks (\\"Yebo!\\", \\"Chain Gang\\" and \\"Spit\\"). The album was produced by Anne Dudley, Ted Hayton and J.J. Jeczalik.\\" The album represents the diverging interests of the two remaining members of the original group, Anne Dudley and J.J. Jeczalik. Dudley's influence is evident in the album's ambient interludes of melodic, orchestral pieces, while Jeczalik's influence can be heard in the album's dub tracks and harder, rock- edged pieces. The latter songs also feature arrangements more typical of the band's earlier material, utilising sampling techniques, lengthy fade-outs, a diverse mixture of classical instruments, guitar riffs and percussion typical of industrial music. Like its predecessor, In No Sense? Nonsense!, the album also features cover versions of previously recorded themes composed for television and film, namely \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" (originally the theme to the 1964 television programme The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe) and \\"James Bond Theme\\" which was submitted for the soundtrack of the 1989 James Bond film Licence to Kill and subsequently rejected by the film's producers.. The \\"Emphasis Speakers\\" on the album cover were designed by Morten Villiers Warren for B&W.; The orchestra was led by John Bradbury. Although the album was praised for its collaboration with Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens, the reviews for the album were mostly negative, with Allmusic music reviewer Dean Carlson calling the album a 'misfire' and compared it to 'world mall- music'.https://www.allmusic.com/album/release/below-the-waste-mr0001336933 Track listing # \\"Dan Dare\\" (Anne Dudley, J.J.

Written and recorded in America, the series was animated in Japan and later South Korea. The entire series was based upon the line of transforming toys originally created by Japanese toy manufacturer Takara, which were developed into the Transformers line by American company Hasbro. In the United States, the show aired a total of 98 episodes between 1984 and 1987. The episodes are ordered chronologically by broadcast date.

It served to further promote the new \\"combiner\\" figures who had been introduced at the end of season 2, and a few other figures from the 1986 product line (like Ultra Magnus, Metroplex and Trypticon) who had not yet appeared in the American cartoon, which were all being released in Japan with the sub-branding of \\"Scramble City.\\" Set soon after the end of the second season, the episode focuses on the Autobots' efforts to construct a new mobile fortress, the titular \\"Scramble City.\\" When the Decepticons learn of this, their combiner robots are deployed to attack, and a battle between them and their Autobot counterparts ensues, focusing on their \\"Scramble Power\\" – the interchangeability of the individual limbs – to the extent that at one point, Breakdown of the Stunticons connects to Superion to damage him. At the episode's conclusion, Scramble City is activated and assumes its robot mode of Metroplex to rout the Decepticons. However, from the ocean depths, the Decepticons' own city, Trypticon, rises. = The Transformers: The Movie (1986) = The Transformers: The Movie is a 1986 animated feature film. It was released in North America on August 8, 1986. Set to an upbeat rock music soundtrack, the movie has a decidedly darker tone than the television series, with detailed visuals in Toei Animation's typical animated feature film styling. The film features several grand battles in which a handful of major characters meet their end. The story takes place in 2005, twenty years after the events of the TV series' second season and serves as a bridge to the third season. Decepticon villains are more menacing, killing Ironhide, Ratchet, Prowl, Brawn, Windcharger and Wheeljack without hesitation. Optimus Prime dies following a battle with Megatron. Later, Megatron is reformed into Galvatron by Unicron, while Skywarp, Thundercracker, Shrapnel, Kickback and Bombshell are reformed as Cyclonus, Scourge and the Sweeps. Starscream is destroyed by Galvatron. Blaster gets four cassettes of his own like Soundwave known as Ramhorn, Steeljaw, Eject and Rewind; however, Soundwave gets a new cassette called Ratbat. At the end of the film, Hot Rod becomes Rodimus Prime and uses the Matrix of leadership to destroy Unicron. He then becomes the new leader of the Autobots. = Season 3 (1986–87) = = Season 4 (1987) = Season 4's title sequence was made of parts from the others and TV commercials with Season 3 music. = Epilogue = Season 4 is the end of the American series.

He is known for his abstract landscapes and watercolors. Biography Marin was born in Rutherford, New Jersey.. His mother died nine days after his birth, and he was raised by two aunts in Weehawken, New Jersey.. He attended the Stevens Institute of Technology for a year, and tried unsuccessfully to become an architect. Young American Artists of the Modern School, L. to R. Jo Davidson, Edward Steichen, Arthur B. Carles, John Marin; back: Marsden Hartley, Laurence Fellows, c. 1911, Bates College Museum of Art Group of artists in 1912, L to R : Paul Haviland, Abraham Walkowitz, Katharine N. Rhoades, Stieglitz's wife Emily, Agnes Ernst Meyer, Alfred Stieglitz, J.B. Kerfoot, John Marin From 1899 to 1901, Marin attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia he studied with Thomas Pollock Anshutz, Hugh Henry Breckenridge and William Merritt Chase. He also studied at the Art Students League of New York.. In 1905, like many American artists Marin went to Europe, initially to Paris.. He exhibited his work in the Salon, where he also got his first exposure to modern art. He traveled through Europe for six years, and painted in the Netherlands, Belgium, England, and Italy. In Europe, he mastered a type of watercolor where he achieved an abstract ambience, almost a pure abstraction with color that ranges from transparency to translucency, accompanied by strong opacities, and linear elements, always with a sense of freedom, which became one of his trademarks. In 1909, Marin held his first one-man exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery in New York City. He had been introduced to Stieglitz by the photographer Edward Steichen, whom Marin in turn had met through the painter Arthur B. Carles. Marin's association with Stieglitz would last nearly forty years, and Stieglitz's philosophical and financial support would prove essential.. From 1909 until his death in 1946, Stieglitz showed Marin's work almost every year in one of his galleries.. Marin also participated in the landmark 1913 Armory Show. Marin spent his first summer in Maine in 1914 and almost immediately the rocky coast there became one of his favorite subjects. Over the rest of his life, Marin became intimately familiar with the many moods of the sea and sky in Maine. \\"In painting water make the hand move the way the water moves,\\" Marin wrote in a 1933 letter to an admirer of his technique.. Cover of 291, No 4 1915 Marin had a retrospective show in 1936 at the Museum of Modern Art. Late in life Marin achieved tremendous prestige as an American painter, an elder statesman of American art. In 1950, he was honored by the University of Maine and Yale University with honorary degrees of Doctor of Fine Arts. Marin was a resident of Cliffside Park, New Jersey in his last years, and also maintained a summer home in Addison, Maine, where he died in 1953.. He was interred at Fairview Cemetery (Fairview, New Jersey). Works John Marin was among the first American artists to make abstract paintings.. Marin is often credited with influencing the Abstract Expressionists. His treatment of paint—handling oils almost like watercolors—his forays into abstraction, and his use of evocative stretches of bare canvas caught the eye of younger painters.. His experience with architecture might have contributed to the role played by architectural themes in his paintings and watercolors. The largest collection of Marin's paintings, watercolors, drawings, etchings, and photographs are at the Colby College Museum of Art, the John Marin Collection, given to the college by John Marin Jr. and Norma B. Marin. Marin's paintings are also represented in several important permanent collections and museums including: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art and The Phillips Collection, both in Washington, D.C., the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and many others. The White House acquired his 1952 painting \\"The Circus No. 1\\" in 2007, and it is now displayed in the Green Room.

It is located in the South Parklands surrounded by Greenhill and Peacock Roads, South Terrace, and Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue. The gardens can be entered by entrances on South Terrace. Veale Gardens is named after William Charles Douglas Veale, who was Adelaide's Town Clerk from January 1947 to November 1965,.

Features Featuring a garden of roses with over 50 varieties of rose on display, the gardens include two rose beds containing the City of Adelaide rose, located at the South Terrace entrance, and Queen Adelaide rose, located at the corner of South Terrace and Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue. There are many walks through the parks taking you through gardens of water features, past the greenhouse, and through more lush shady areas. The gardens are also home to the Adelaide Pavilion restaurant and function centre, and is a popular location for weddings and wedding photography shoots. Meeting place For many years, a section of Veale Gardens was known as a \\"homosexual meeting place\\". There had been much debate over the years about whether to police Veale Gardens more closely due both to public complaint about loitering and lewd behaviour, or to provide more availability of security as a deterrent against violence and murder of vulnerable gay men (or any other soft target) who may have been visiting the park; at the hands of homophobic or otherwise abusive and violent people. In the absence of policies which were able to embrace public expressions of sexuality and create greater safety and support for the socially isolated, in late 2006 the public toilets were bulldozed and new toilets built on the South Terrace frontage. In 2007, the park entrance off Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue was closed and the street returned to park land to reduce late night parking. In more recent times the area of Veale Gardens and adjacent parkland has again become controversial because it has provided a relatively safe haven for Aboriginal people from distant inland communities who may be visiting Adelaide for periods of time and who would prefer to be staying informally outside rather than in formal suburban housing; if indeed these formal accommodations are available to them.

It was the most popular hors d'œuvre in Great Britain, as well as in the United States, from the 1960s to the late 1980s. According to the English food writer Nigel Slater, the prawn cocktail \\"has spent most of (its life) see-sawing from the height of fashion to the laughably passé\\" and is now often served with a degree of irony. History and origins An American-style shrimp cocktail made with store-bought cocktail sauce and garnished with endive and dill. A dish of cooked seafood with a piquant sauce of some kind is of ancient origin and many varieties exist.Retro classics: The prawn cocktail Jassy Davis, lovefood.com, 5 March 2012. Retrieved 27 June 2014. Oyster or shrimp dishes of this kind were popular in the United States in the late nineteenth century and some sources link the serving of the dish in cocktail glasses to the ban on alcoholic drinks during the 1920s prohibition era in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the invention of the Prawn Cocktail is often credited to British television chef Fanny Cradock in the 1960s; however, it is more likely that Cradock popularised her version of an established dish that was not well known until then in Britain. In their 1997 book The Prawn Cocktail Years, Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham note that the prawn cocktail has a \\"direct lineage to Escoffier\\". Variations The sauce is usually referred to as cocktail sauce, and is essentially ketchup plus mayonnaise in Commonwealth countries, or ketchup and horseradish in the United States. In Britain A prawn cocktail Nigel Slater says \\"it is all in the sauce\\", and that \\"the true sauce is principally mayonnaise, tomato ketchup and a couple of shakes of Tabasco.\\" The chef Heston Blumenthal states that prawn cocktail is his \\"secret vice\\": \\"When I get home late after working in The Fat Duck there's nothing I like better than to raid the fridge for prawn cocktail.\\" Blumenthal notes that it is best to use homemade mayonnaise, and recommends adding chopped basil and tarragon. The television chef and writer Delia Smith states that the best version is with self-cooked prawns, and that in the 1960s it was \\"something simple but really luscious, yet over the years it has suffered from some very poor adaptations, not least watery prawns and inferior sauces.\\" As Hopkinson and Bareham note in The Prawn Cocktail Years, what was once considered to be the \\"Great British Meal\\" consisted of Prawn Cocktail, followed by Steak Garni with Chips and Black Forest Gateau for dessert, commenting that \\"cooked as it should be, this much-derided and often ridiculed dinner is still something very special indeed.\\" The \\"prawn cocktail offensive\\" Before the 1992 British general election, the Labour Party campaigned to win the support of business and financial leaders by persuading them that they would not interfere with the market economy. The campaign was lampooned as the \\"Prawn Cocktail Offensive\\". Spin-off products Walkers prawn cocktail crisps (top right) in a vending machine in London The ubiquity of the prawn cocktail has led to such products as prawn cocktail flavour crisps, which are still one of the most popular varieties of this snack food.

He contributed to the life sciences, especially botany and zoology, and to linguistics, folklore, ethnography, history, literary studies, and archaeology. In 1871 he was elected as a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian language and literature department. Maksymovych also was a member of the Nestor the Chronicler Historical Association that existed in Kiev in 1872-1931. Life 1859 portrait by Taras Shevchenko Maksymovych was born into an old Zaporozhian Cossack family which owned a small estate on Mykhailova Hora near Prokhorivka, Zolotonosha county in Poltava Governorate (now in Cherkasy Oblast) in Left- bank Ukraine. After receiving his high school education at Novgorod-Severskiy Gymnasium, he studied natural science and philology at philosophy faculty of Moscow University and later the medical faculty, graduating with his first degree in 1823, his second in 1827; thereafter, he remained at the university in Moscow for further academic work in botany. In 1833 he received his doctorate and was appointed as a professor for the chair of botany in the Moscow University. He taught biology and was director of the botanical garden at the university. During this period, he published extensively on botany and also on folklore and literature, and got to know many of the leading lights of Russian intellectual life including the Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin and Russian writer, Nikolay Gogol, and shared his growing interest in Cossack history with them. In 1834, he was appointed professor of Russian literature at the newly created Saint Vladimir University in Kiev and also became the university's first rector, a post that he held until 1835. (This university had been established by the Russian government to reduce Polish influence in Ukraine and Maksymovych was, in part, an instrument of this policy). Maksymovych elaborated wide-ranging plans for the expansion of the university which eventually included attracting eminent Ukrainians and Russians like, Nikolay Kostomarov, and Taras Shevchenko to teach there. In 1847, he was deeply affected by the arrest, imprisonment, and exile of the members of the Pan-Slavic Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, many of whom, like the poet Taras Shevchenko, were his friends or students. Thereafter, he buried himself in scholarship, publishing extensively. In 1853, he married, and in 1857, in hope of relieving his severe financial situation, went to Moscow to find work. In 1858, Shevchenko returning from exile, visited him in Moscow, and when Maksymovych returned to Mykhailova Hora, visited him there as well. At this time, Shevchenko painted portraits of both Maksimovich and his wife, Maria. During his final years, Maksimovich devoted himself more and more to history and engaged in extensive debates with the Russian historians Mikhail Pogodin and Nikolay Kostomarov. The physical sciences and philosophy In the 1820s and 1830s, Maksymovych published several textbooks on biology and botany. His first scholarly book on botany was published in 1823 under the title On the System of the Flowering Kingdom. He also published popular works on botany for the layman. This \\"populist\\" approach to science, he carried over into his writings on folklore, literature, and history. In 1833 in Moscow, he published The Book of Naum About God's Great World, which was a popularly written exposition of geology, the solar system, and the universe, in religious garb for the common folk. This book proved to be a best-seller and went through eleven editions, providing Maksimovich with some royalties for many long years. Also in 1833, Maksymovych published \\"A Letter on Philosophy\\" which reflected his admiration for Schelling's \\"Nature-Philosophy.\\" In this letter, he declared that true philosophy was based on love and that all branches of organized, systematic knowledge, which strove to recognize the internal meaning and unity of things, but most especially history, were philosophy. With his emphasis upon history, Maksimovich approached the views of Baader and Hegel as well as Schelling. Folklore In 1827, Maksymovych published Little Russian Folksongs which was one of the first collections of folk songs published in eastern Europe. It contained 127 songs, including historical songs, songs about every-day life, and ritual songs. The collection marked a new turning to the common people, the folk, which was the hallmark of the new romantic era which was then beginning. Everywhere that it was read, it aroused the interest of the literate classes in the life of the common folk. In 1834 and in 1849, Maksymovych published two further collections. In his collections of folksongs, Maksymovych used a new orthography for the Ukrainian language which was based on etymology. Although this Maksymovychivka looked quite similar to Russian, it was a first step towards an independent orthography, based on phonetics which was eventually proposed by Maksimovich's younger contemporary, Panteleimon Kulish. The latter forms the basis of the modern written Ukrainian language. In general, Maksymovych claimed to see some basic psychological differences, reflecting differences in national character, between Ukrainian and Russian folk songs; he thought the former more spontaneous and lively, the latter more submissive. Such opinions were shared by many of his contemporaries such as his younger contemporary, the historian Nikolay Kostomarov and others. In 1856, Maksymovych published the first part of his \\"Days and Months of the Ukrainian Villager\\" which summed up many years of observation of the Ukrainian peasantry. In it, he laid out the folk customs of the Ukrainian village according to the calendar year. (The full work was only published in Soviet times.) Language and literature In 1839, Maksymovych published his History of Old Russian Literature which dealt with the so-called Kievan period of Russian literature. Maksymovych saw a definite continuity between the language and literature of Ruthenia (Kievan Rus') and that of Cossack period. Indeed, he seems to have thought that the Old Ruthenian language stood in relation to modern Russian in a way similar to that of Old Czech to modern Polish or modern Slovak; that is, that one influenced but was not the same as the other. Later on, he also translated the epic Tale of Igor's Campaign into both modern Russian and modern Ukrainian verse. Maksimovich's literary works included poetry and almanacs with much material devoted to Russia. History From the 1850s to the 1870s, Maksymovych worked extensively in history, especially Russian and Ukrainian history. He was critical of the Normanist Theory which traced Kievan Rus to Scandinavian origins, preferring to stress its Slavic roots. But he opposed the Russian historian, Mikhail Pogodin, who believed that Kievan Rus originally had been populated by Great Russians from the north. Maksimovich argued that the Kievan lands were never completely de-populated, even after the Mongol invasions, and that they had always been inhabited by Ruthenians and their direct ancestors. As well, he was the first to claim the \\"Lithuanian period\\" for Russian history. Maksymovych also worked on the history of the city of Kiev, of Cossack Hetmanate, of the uprising of Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Haidamak uprisings against Poland, and other subjects. In general, he sympathized with these various Cossack rebels, so much so, in fact, that his first work on the Haidamaks was banned by the Russian censor. Many of his most important works were critical studies and corrections of the publications of other historians, like Mikhail Pogodin and Nikolay Kostomarov. Slavistics With regard to Slavic studies, Maksimovich remarked upon the various theses of the Czech philologist, Josef Dobrovský and the Slovak scholar, Pavel Jozef Šafárik. Like them, he divided the Slavic family into two major groups, a western group and an eastern group. But then he sub-divided the western group into two further parts: a north-western group and a south-western group. (Dobrovsky had lumped the Russians together with the South Slavs.) Maksymovych particularly objected to Dobrovsky's contention that the major eastern or Russian group was unified, without major divisions or dialects. This eastern group, Maksymovych divided into two independent languages, South Russian and North Russian. The South Russian language, he divided into two major dialects, Ruthenian and Red Ruthenian/Galician. The North Russian language, he divided into four major dialects of which he thought the Muscovite the most developed, but also the youngest. In addition to this, he also seems to have considered Belarusian to be an independent language, intermediate between North and South Russian, but much closer to the former. Writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Croatian scholar, V. Jagic, thought Maksimovich's scheme to have been a solid contribution to Slavic philology. Maksymovych also argued in favour of the independent origin of the spoken Old Rus languages, thinking them separate from the book language of the time which was based on Church Slavonic. Maksimovich also made some critical remarks on Pavel Jozef Šafárik's map of the Slavic world, wrote on the Lusatian Sorbs, and on Polish proverbs. Maksimovich, as well, wrote a brief autobiography which was first published in 1904. His correspondence was large and significant. Legacy Maksymovych Scientific Library Maksymovych was a pioneer of his time and, in many ways, one of the last of the \\"universal men\\" who were able to contribute original works to both the sciences and the humanities. His works in biology and the physical sciences reflected a concern for the common man - love for his fellow human being, Schelling's philosophy, at work - and his works in literature, folklore, and history, often phrased in terms of friendly public \\"letters\\" to his scholarly opponents, pointed to new directions in telling the story of the common people. In doing this, however, Maksymovych \\"awakened\\" new national sentiments among his fellows, especially the younger generation. He greatly influenced many of his younger contemporaries including the poet Taras Shevchenko, the historian Nikolay Kostomarov, the writer Panteleimon Kulish, and many others. The library of Kiev University is named in his honour.

The Grossmünster was built on their graves from ca. 1100, while at the site of their execution stands the Wasserkirche. From the 13th century, images of the saints were used in official seals of the city and on coins. On the saints' feast day, their relics were carried in procession between the Grossmünster and the Fraumünster, and the two monasteries vied for possession of the relics, which attracted enough pilgrims to make Zürich the most important pilgrimage site in the bishopric of Konstanz. The Knabenschiessen of Zürich originates with the feast day of the saints on 11 September, which came to be the \\"national holiday\\" of the early modern Republic of Zürich. With the dissolution of the monasteries by Huldrych Zwingli in 1524, their possessions were confiscated and the graves of the martyrs were opened. There are conflicting versions of what happened then. Heinrich Bullinger claims that the graves were empty save for a few bone fragments, which were piously buried in the common graveyard outside the church. The Catholics, on the other hand, claimed that the reformers were planning to throw the relics of the saints into the river, and that a courageous man of Uri (who happened to be exiled from Uri, and by his action earned amnesty) stole the relics from the church and carried them to Andermatt, where the two skulls of Felix and Regula can be seen to this day, while the remaining relics were returned to Zürich in 1950, to the newly built Catholic church St. Felix und Regula. The skulls have been Carbon 14 dated, and while one dates to the Middle Ages, the other is in fact composed of fragments of two separate skulls, of which one is medieval, and the other could indeed date to Roman times.

It stars Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, with Deannie Yip, Pauline Yeung, and Crystal Kwok. It is the last film in which Hung, Chan and Biao all appeared in together, as Chan subsequently focused on his solo film career. Plot A fishery is seeking court action against a local chemical factory for polluting the water. The mysterious chemical company hires lawyer Jackie Lung (Jackie Chan) to find information that will discredit the fishery. He employs his arms dealer friend, Wong (Sammo Hung) to woo the fishery owner, Miss Yip (Deannie Yip), to try to convince her to settle out of court. Lung also brings in goofy inventor and professional criminal, Tung (Yuen Biao), to bug her apartment. Unfortunately, Wong and Tung are unaware of each other's roles and soon come into confrontation, whilst Lung tries to maintain the peace. Wong falls for Miss Yip, whilst Lung woos her cousin, Miss Wen (Pauline Yeung), an environmental scientist who is going to testify on Miss Yip's behalf. The three men inadvertently discover that the chemical company is just a facade for a narcotics empire, ran by Hua Hsien-Wu (Yuen Wah). They soon come up against Hua's thugs, and ultimately infiltrate the factory for a showdown with Hua himself and his henchman - martial arts master (Benny Urquidez). Versions There are three distinct versions of the film: the Hong Kong theatrical release (94 minutes), the international theatrical release (94 minutes), and the Japanese theatrical release (98 minutes). Two scenes with Timothy Tung Te-Biao (Yuen Biao) visiting a psychiatrist (played by Lucky Stars veteran, Stanley Fung) were cut from the domestic Hong Kong print of the film, but remain intact in the international version and the Japanese version. These scenes appeared as extras on the Hong Kong Legends DVD of the film, entitled Couch Potato and Mr Kinetic. In the latter, the psychiatrist was in the process of being robbed. So that Tung would not realise a robbery was taking place, one of the robbers, posing as the psychiatrist, gave him advice over the intercom - to \\"kill the witnesses\\", which explains why Tung attacks Jackie Lung (Chan) and Ling (Pauline Yeung) in a later scene, wearing a mask and armed with a knife. Several scenes were slightly trimmed for the international version. The only scene completely omitted shows how Tung Te-Biao leads Jackie and Ling into the chemical factory, having informed them about the danger Wong Fei-Hung (Sammo Hung) was in. They locate a hidden door, leading to where Wong is held captive and the drugs are refined. Ling distracts the guard, allowing Jackie the opportunity to attack. This scene is intact in the Hong Kong and Japanese versions. The Japanese version is the only one that contains all scenes in their complete form, except that it replaces the original end credits crawl of the police arrival at the factory with a different end credits crawl featuring outtakes from the film. In 2020 a limited edition Blu-ray containing fully restored transfers of all three versions was released by 88 Films. Cast Reception On the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of Dragons Forever, Hong Kong cinema expert Bey Logan offers his opinion on why the film underperformed both in the domestic and Japanese markets. The primary reason cited is that the actors played roles against type. Jackie Chan plays a slick lawyer who chases women, in contrast to the happy-go-lucky everyman characters he usually plays. Similarly, Yuen Biao plays an eccentric and possibly mentally disturbed character, rather than the underdog character fans were used to. For Sammo Hung, rather than the timid character that has been described in earlier films, he instead plays like a rascal. Logan explains that in general, the cinema going public in Hong Kong are not as open to such departures of role as, perhaps, Western audiences would be. Additional reasons cited include the occasional use of coarse language in the film, and the scenes of narcotics production, particularly Hung's character being injected with drugs against his will. The fact that Chan's character has a relationship with a woman may also have had an effect, particularly in the Japanese market, as many female viewers could not accept that their idol was not single. On learning that Chan was in a relationship in real life, one Japanese fan had committed suicide, and another poisoned herself in the offices of Golden Harvest. Box office Dragons Forever grossed HK$33,578,920 million in its Hong Kong theatrical run.

England were looking to maintain the form that had taken them to second place in the ICC Test Championship, and to victory in the 2005 Ashes series at home to Australia, but they suffered a sharp reversal of fortune, losing the test series 2-0 to Pakistan.

Pakistan took their first victory over England at home since 1987-88, despite surrendering a first-innings lead of 144 and setting a target of 198 - and England were even 64/1 chasing that target. However, Kaneria removed Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell in the same over, before Paul Collingwood was lbw to Mohammad Sami in the next. England had gone from 64/1 to 67/4 - Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen added 26, before Kaneria struck again, as Flintoff swept him to Younis Khan. Eventually, they were 117/7, before Shaun Udal came in and added 49 with Geraint Jones - and then, Shoaib Akhtar bowled Jones for 33, leaving England to hit 33 for the last two wickets. Udal and Steve Harmison went in quick succession, and England finished on 175. Despite the efforts of the bowlers, it was Salman Butt who became Man of the Match, as his 122 in the second innings enabled Pakistan to set a target. =2nd Test= Pakistan won the toss and batted first, and scored heavily on the first day - with Shahid Afridi in particular punishing England's bowlers. After the first day, Pakistan had reached 300/4. The second day of the test contains a few dramatic incidents. Inzamam-ul-Haq was run out in controversial circumstances - he was adjudged to have his foot in the air while avoiding a direct shy at the stumps by Stephen Harmison. The laws of cricket state a player should not be given out if he is taking evasive action to avoid injury. After Pakistan were bowled out for 462, England began their reply. The next incident occurred when a gas canister exploded within the ground, damaging the boundary hoarding and some spectators nearby. Play was halted for around 15 minutes until authorities determined it was safe to continue. However, television footage subsequently showed that Shahid Afridi had deliberately scuffed up the wicket during this distraction - an action for which he was subsequently fined, and banned for one Test match and two One Day Internationals. After this distraction, England lost 2 quick wickets to end the day of 113/3. They recovered on day 3 through the efforts of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who both scored centuries. England were eventually bowled out for 446, and their bowlers made an improved effort in Pakistan's second innings, reducing them to 183/6 by the end of day 4. They could think about a possible victory, but Inzamam-ul-Haq was still at the wicket going into day 5. Pakistan declared after Inzamam got his century, shortly before lunch on the fifth day, and in the sixth over they fell to 20/4. However, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff added 80 in 22 overs for the fifth wicket, and Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles held on for the draw. =3rd Test= The third and final test match at Lahore saw Pakistan enforcing their authority on the series off the back of the momentum they had built up by winning the first test and dominating most of the second one. England won the toss and chose to bat – and after a useful start where the openers put on 101, they were then regularly pegged back by Pakistan to end the day on 248/6. Criticism was levelled at the English batsmen for getting out to some injudicious shots. The use of the sweep shot came in for particular attention, as 5 batsmen lost their wicket attempting such a shot. Despite a battling 96 by Paul Collingwood, England were bowled out for 288. Pakistan initially struggled in their reply, losing two very early wickets to be 12/2 at lunch on day 2, and they lost their 3rd wicket before the score reached 100. However, Inzamam-ul-Haq continued his dominance over England's attack, and only left the crease due to a hand injury. Mohammad Yousuf also built on his good form, and profited from being dropped on 16. In fact, he would eventually bat through the entire third day, which was an awful one for England where their only success was the wicket of the nightwatchman, Shoaib Akhtar, and that was only after he had made a score of 38. Mohammad Yousuf and Kamran Akmal put on 269 runs for the fifth wicket, with Yousuf scoring a career best 223. Akmal scored 154 which was also a career best. England then faced the daunting prospect of the return of Inzamam after his injury, returning to resume his innings nearly 2 days after he had left the crease. Inzamam returned to play some expansive strokes with the lower order, and accelerate the scoring to an extent that it would be impossible for England to win the game. He was eventually run out on 97 just before lunch on the 4th day, and he immediately declared his side's innings on an enormous 636/8. England by this point were shattered, withdrawn and dispirited. Although Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell produced a determined rearguard effort in the second innings, putting on 175 for the third wicket, England would not be able to bat out the match. They slumped from 205/3 to 248 all out, to lose the match by an innings and 100 runs. Danish Kaneria and Shoaib Akhtar were the stand out bowlers involved in the collapse, recording figures of 4/52 and 5/71 respectively. Pakistan and their supporters were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to ask of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes was by no means the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards. ODI series =1st ODI= England recorded their second win on tour, and their first over Pakistan, after winning the toss and batting to set a target that was eventually too big for Pakistan to chase down. England's openers, Marcus Trescothick and Matt Prior (who played his second ODI), added 43 before Trescothick lobbed a catch to Danish Kaneria, but Prior went on to make a career-best 45 before Mohammad Sami had him out lbw. After 25 overs, England had made 131/2, but Strauss and Pietersen then added 50 in four overs before Pietersen was stumped off a wide ball from Shoaib Malik. His 56 off 39 balls, however, had brought the average English run rate above 6, and it never fell below 5.75 from then on. Though Strauss was eventually caught off Kaneria's bowling - six short of his third ODI century - Flintoff added 90 with Paul Collingwood in the last 11 overs, and England had totalled 327/4, Flintoff hitting three sixes on his way to an unbeaten 72. However, his bowling leaked runs at a rate quicker than the target rate, with the first four overs costing 41 runs after he had come on as first change bowler for James Anderson, who had dismissed Kamran Akmal with the eleventh ball of the match. Salman Butt and Younis Khan shared a stand of 117 runs at a rate of 6.75 per over, but mid-innings England's slowest bowlers came to the fore. Ian Blackwell bowled ten overs without conceding a boundary, ending without a wicket but conceding 45 runs, while Paul Collingwood dismissed Inzamam-ul-Haq as the latter mistimed a guide to third man into the gloves of Geraint Jones who held the catch on the second attempt. With ten overs remaining, Pakistan needed 88 with six wickets in hand, with Harmison, Flintoff and ODI debutant Liam Plunkett bowling. Plunkett was the first to get a wicket, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf after an 83-run stand (off 96 balls) with Shoaib Malik, but Abdul Razzaq hit Flintoff for 11 off the four balls he faced in the next over, and with five overs remaining Pakistan needed 51. However, both the recognised batsmen were out in the next over to Plunkett, as the debutant finished with 3/51 (all caught), and Shoaib Akhtar was run out on the final ball of the over. Flintoff got two wickets in the 47th over to end the chase, but Strauss was named Man of the Match for his innings of 94, which included partnerships with every batsman except Trescothick and Collingwood. (Cricinfo scorecard) =2nd ODI= Pakistan levelled the series after their wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal hit his second ODI century - indeed, his second score above 50. However, it was Shoaib Akhtar who became Man of the Match, after removing Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss in the same over and coming back to take three more wickets while bowling. England had won the toss and batted first, and after an opening stand of 30 between Trescothick and Matt Prior Shoaib took two wickets in an over. Another stand of 44 took England to 74 after 13 overs, but Rana Naved-ul-Hasan repeated Shoaib's feat, and a full ball from Abdul Razzaq took care of Prior for 32. Shoaib returned for two more wickets, and when Paul Collingwood chipped a return catch to Danish Kaneria England were 130/8 with 20 overs still to bat. They had little option but to put on their Super Sub Vikram Solanki, a specialist batsman, for bowler James Anderson - Solanki joined in with Liam Plunkett, who hit a maiden fifty in his second ODI for England, as the two shared a 100-run partnership. However, Plunkett and Steve Harmison were out in successive balls in the penultimate over, and England set a target of 230 on a pitch that had been described as \\"flat and perfect for batting\\". As it turned out, it wasn't enough - Flintoff, Harmison and Collingwood got a wicket each, but the Pakistani batsmen hit 34 boundaries in total - 138 of 231 runs - with Akmal sharing two 70+ stands, the opening with Salman Butt, and a third-wicket one with Mohammad Yousuf (who hit 28 off 68 balls) to carry Pakistan to 187/3 before he pulled a Harmison short ball to Solanki for 102. By that time, though, Pakistan needed 44 in 13.3 overs, and Inzamam-ul-Haq hit six fours in an unbeaten 31 as Pakistan made it to the target with six overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard) =3rd ODI= Kamran Akmal made his second century in three days to help Pakistan take a 2–1 lead in the series with two games to play, and their highest ODI victory by runs since their group match with Hong Kong at the 2004 Asia Cup.Cricinfo Stats Guru filter It was also their highest ODI win against a Full Member nation of the ICC since a 182-run win over South Africa in December 2002. England equalled their heaviest defeat ever with this loss.England collapse to record defeat from BBC Sport, published 15 December 2005, 13:08 UTC Pakistan were put in to bat after Marcus Trescothick won the toss, but England's bowlers did not back up the faith Trescothick had in them, not taking a wicket in the first 15 overs, before Liam Plunkett took two wickets in three balls, dismissing Younis Khan for the lowest score of the match, with 0. However, Plunkett was taken for 61 in his seven overs, and though he got the most wickets he was the least economical. Neither he nor Steve Harmison could stop the Pakistani pair of Akmal and Mohammad Yousuf, as the two added 104 in 16.2 overs before Kamran was caught off Paul Collingwood for 109. Mohammad Yousuf, who batted well for 68 off 65, was then responsible for two run-outs – his own, and that of the big-hitting Shahid Afridi, who creamed 31 off 14 balls. However, this was surpassed by Abdul Razzaq, who battered five fours and three sixes in a blazing 51 off 22 balls. At one stage, Razzaq looked poised to get the fastest ODI fifty, but some good death- over bowling from Andrew Flintoff, who was the best of the English bowlers, ensured that this at least would not happen. The Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul- Haq provided Razzaq with good support as he made 45 off 35. When England batted, no partnership lasted more than ten overs, and after a run out and two wickets from Rana Naved-ul-Hasan in the eighth over, they failed to chase the target. England were ahead of Pakistan by runs at the 15-over mark, having made 72/3 compared to Pakistan's 71/0, but Andrew Strauss was then lbw to an inswinging ball from Mohammad Sami, and Andrew Flintoff departed three overs later, bowled by Yasir Arafat, whom he had earlier hit for three fours in an over. With two more wickets falling, England brought on Ian Bell as a substitute, and though he made an unbeaten 37, the highest score of the innings, his batting partners could not pass 20, and England were bowled out for 188 eight overs before the end. (Cricinfo scorecard) =4th ODI= Despite restricting Pakistan to a below par 210 on a difficult pitch to bat on, England fell 13 runs short against an efficient Pakistan bowling attack. (Cricinfo scorecard) =5th ODI= England successfully defended an average total of 206 to win a close game by 6 runs.

A foundling hospital was not necessarily a medical hospital, but more commonly a children's home, offering shelter and education to foundlings. The antecedents of such institutions was the practice of the Catholic Church providing a rough system of relief, children being left (jactati) in marble shells at the church doors, and tended first by the matricularii or male nurses, and then by the nutricarii or foster parents. But it was in the 7th and 8th centuries that definite institutions for foundlings were established in such towns as Trèves, Milan and Montpellier. Historically, care for foundlings tended to develop more slowly or with greater variation from country to country than, for example, care for orphans. The reason for this discrepancy was the perception that children abandoned by their parents carried with them a burden of immorality. Their parents tended to be unmarried and poor. Alleviating the burden of unwanted pregnancies was often seen as encouraging infidelity and prostitution. Thomas Malthus, for example, the noted English demographer and economist, made, in his The Principles of Population (vol. i. p. 434), a violent attack on foundling hospitals. He argued that they discouraged marriage and therefore population, and that even the best management would be unable to prevent a high mortality. He wrote: \\"An occasional child murder from false shame is saved at a very high price if it can be done only by the sacrifice of some of the best and most useful feelings of the human heart in a great part of the nation\\". Foundling hospitals in the world =Austria= In Austria foundling hospitals occupied a very prominent place in the general instructions which, by rescript dated 16 April 1781, the emperor Joseph II issued to the charitable endowment commission. In 1818 foundling asylums and lying-in houses were declared to be state institutions. They were accordingly supported by the state treasury until the fundamental law of 20 October 1860 handed them over to the provincial committees. , they were local institutions, depending on provincial funds, and were quite separate from the ordinary parochial poor institute. Admission was free when the child was actually found on the street, or was sent by a criminal court, or where the mother undertook to serve for four months as nurse or midwife in an asylum, or produced a certificate from the parish priest and poor-father (the parish inspector of the poor-law administration) that she had no money. In other cases payments of thirty to 100 florins were made. When two months old the child was sent for six or ten years to the houses in the neighborhood of respectable married persons, who had certificates from the police or the poor-law authorities, and who were inspected by the latter and by a special medical officer. These persons received a constantly diminishing allowance, and the arrangement could be determined by fourteen days notice on either side. The foster-parents could retain the child in their service or employment till the age of twenty-two, but the true parents could at any time reclaim the foundling on reimbursing the asylum and compensating the foster-parents. =Belgium= In this country the arrangements for the relief of foundlings and the appropriation of public funds for that purpose very much resemble those in France (see below), and can hardly be usefully described apart from the general questions of local government and poor law administration. The Commissions des Hospices Civiles, however, are purely communal bodies, although they receive pecuniary assistance from both the départments and the state. A decree of 1811 directed that there should be an asylum and a wheel for receiving foundlings in every arrondissement. The last wheel, that of Antwerp, was closed in 1860. =France= In Louis XIII's France, St. Vincent de Paul rescued, with the help of the Louise de Marillac and other religious ladies, the foundlings of Paris from the horrors of a primitive institution named La Couche (on the rue St Landry), and ultimately obtained from Louis XIV the use of the Bicêtre for their accommodation. Letters patent were granted to the Paris hospital in 1670. The Hôtel-Dieu of Lyon was the next in importance. No provision, however, was made outside the great towns; the houses in the cities were overcrowded and administered with laxity; and in 1784 Jacques Necker prophesied that the state would yet be seriously embarrassed by this increasing evil. From 1452 to 1789 the law had imposed on the seigneurs de haute justice the duty of succouring children found deserted on their territories. The foundling hospitals had been started as a reform to save the numerous infants who were being abandoned in the streets of Paris. Infant mortality at that date was extremely high – about 50 percent, in large part because families sent their infants to be wet nursed. The mortality rate in the foundling hospitals, which also sent the babies out to be wet nursed, proved worse, however, and most of the infants sent there likely perished. The first constitutions of the French Revolution undertook as a state debt the support of every foundling. For a time premiums were given to the mothers of illegitimate children, the enfants de la patrie, by the law of 12 Brumaire, An II. Toute recherche de la paternité est interdite, while by art. 341 of the Code Napoléon, la recherche de la matérnité est admise. , laws of France relating to this part of what is called l'Assistance publique were: *the decree of January 1811 *the instruction of February 1823 *the decree of 5 March 1852 *the law of De l'administration des finances of 5 May 1869 *the law of 24 July 1889, and *the law of 27 June 1904 These laws carried out the general principles of the law of 7 Frimaire An V., which completely decentralized the system of national poor relief established by the Revolution. The enfants assistés included, besides (1) orphans and (2) foundlings proper, (3) children abandoned by their parents, (4) ill-treated, neglected or morally abandoned children whose parents have been deprived of their parental rights by the decision of a court of justice, and (5) children, under sixteen years of age, of parents condemned for certain crimes, whose parental rights have been delegated by a tribunal to the state. Children classified under 1-5 were termed pupilles de l'assistance, wards of public charity, and were distinguished by the law of 1904 from children under the protection of the state, classified as: (1) enfants secourus, i.e., children whose parents or relatives are unable, through poverty, to support them; (2) enfants en dépôt, i.e., children of persons undergoing a judicial sentence and children temporarily taken in while their parents are in hospital, and (3) enfants en garde, i.e., children who have either committed or been the victim of some felony or crime and are placed under state care by judicial authority. The asylum which received all these children was a departmental (établissement dépositaire), and not a communal institution. The établissement dépositaire was usually the ward of a hospice, in which, with the exception of children en dépôt the stay was the shortest, for by the law of 1904, continuing the principle laid down in 1811, all children under thirteen years of age under the guardianship of the state, except the mentally or physically infirm, must be boarded out in country districts. They were generally apprenticed to someone engaged in the agricultural industry, and until majority they remained under the guardianship of the administrative commissioners of the '. The state paid the whole of the cost of inspection and supervision. The expenses of administration, the home expenses, for the nurse (nourrice sédentaire) or the wet nurse (nourrice au sein), the prime de survie (premium on survival), washing, clothes, and the outdoor expenses, which include (1) temporary assistance to unmarried mothers in order to prevent desertion; (2) allowances to the foster-parents (nourriciers) in the country for board, school-money, etc.; (3) clothing; (4) travelling-money for nurses and children; (5) printing, etc.; (6) expenses in time of sickness and for burials and apprentice fees were borne in the proportion of two-fifths by the state, two- fifths by the ', and the remaining fifth by the communes. The droit de recherche was conceded to the parent on payment of a small fee. The decree of 1811 contemplated the repayment of all expenses by a parent reclaiming a child. The same decree directed a tour or revolving box (Drehcylinder in Germany) to be kept at each hospital. These have been discontinued. The Assistance publique of Paris was managed by a directeur appointed by the minister of the interior, and associated with a representative conseil de surveillance. The Paris Hospice des enfants-assistés contained about 700 beds. There were also in Paris numerous private charities for the adoption of poor children and orphans. It is impossible here to give even a sketch of the long and able controversies which occurred in France on the principles of management of foundling hospitals, the advantages of tours and the system of admission à bureau ouvert, the transfer of orphans from one ' to another, the hygiene and service of hospitals and the inspection of nurses, the education and reclamation of the children and the rights of the state in their future. =Great Britain= England The Foundling Hospital of London was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1739 for \\"the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children.\\" The petition of Thomas Coram, who is entitled to the whole credit of the foundation, states as its objects to prevent the frequent murders of poor miserable children at their birth, and to suppress the inhuman custom of exposing newborn infants to perish in the streets. The Foundling Hospital kept receiving children until the 1950s, when British law changed the focus in care for foundlings from children's homes to foster care and adoption. The Foundling Hospital is now a child care charity called Coram Family. Its history and art collection are on display at the Foundling Museum. Scotland Scotland never seems to have possessed a foundling hospital. In 1759 John Watson left funds which were to be applied to the pious and charitable purpose of preventing child murder by the establishment of a hospital for receiving pregnant women and taking care of their children as foundlings. But by an act of parliament in 1822, which sets forth doubts as to the propriety of the original purpose, the money was given to trustees to erect a hospital for the maintenance and education of destitute children. =Ireland= Dublin In 1704 the Foundling hospital of Dublin was opened. From 1,500 to 2,000 children were received annually. Due to the high mortality and financial cost of the hospital, in 1835 Lord Glenelg (then Irish Secretary) closed the institution. Cork A Foundling Hospital in Cork was opened in 1747 at Leitrim Street, following a 1735 Act of the Irish Parliament. It was funded by local taxes. Lewis, Samuel. A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland. S. Lewis & Co, 1837, 'Cork' Section. The building site, now occupied by the Lady's Well or Murphy's Brewery, was based around a small quadrangle with a chapel, school-rooms, boys dormitories, girls dormitories, and staff apartments. Following the enactment of the Poor Laws in Ireland the Poor Law Union workhouses replaced many of the functions of the Foundling Hospital. In Cork, the Union Workhouse was opened on Douglas Road in 1841. The Foundling Hospital at Leitrim Street subsequently closed in July 1855, when it was converted by the Emigration Commissioners for use as an Emigration depot.The Foundling Hospital Cork. Westmeath Independent, 7 July 1855. =Italy= , Italy was very rich in foundling hospitals, pure and simple, orphans and other destitute children being separately provided for. In Rome one branch of the Santo Spirito in Sassia (so called from the Schola Saxonum built in 728 by King Ina in the Borgo) was, since the time of Pope Sixtus IV, devoted to foundlings. The average annual number of foundlings supported was about 3,000. In Venice the Casa degli Esposti or foundling hospital, founded in 1346, and receiving 450 children annually, was under provincial administration. The splendid legacy of the last doge, Ludovico Manin, was applied to the support of about 160 children by the Congregazione di Carità acting through thirty parish boards (deputazione fraternate). =Russia= Under the old Russian system of Peter I foundlings were received at the church windows by a staff of women paid by the state. But starting in the reign of Catherine II, foundling hospitals were in the hands of the provincial officer of public charity (prykaz obshestvennago pryzrenya). The great central institutions (Vospitatelnoi Dom), at Moscow and St. Petersburg (with a branch at Gatchina), were founded by Catherine. When a child was brought to these institutions the baptismal name was asked, and a receipt was given, by which the child could be reclaimed up to the age of ten. After the usual period of six years in the country care was taken with the education, especially of the more promising children. The hospitals served as a valuable source of recruits for the public service. The rights of parents over their children were very much restricted, and those of the government much extended by a ukase issued by the emperor Nicholas I in 1837. =USA= , in the United States of America, foundling hospitals, which are chiefly private charities, existed in most of the large cities.

The projects aim is to introduce people to the concept of VoIP by allowing members to experiment with SIP and IAX2 devices.  Features  The VoIP User network was designed to operate within a community environment and therefore differs substantially from most other VoIP networks. The main highlighted difference being that users can call PSTN phone numbers through VoIP User's PSTN gateway without incurring any call charges. The way that VoIP User is funded is noteworthy: Calls into VoIP User’s numbers generate a small amount of per minute revenue (the “termination charge”), and this money goes into a community account or “pot”. Outbound calls from VoIP User then call upon this pot and use the accrued call minutes. This means that if all users are community-minded then there is a balance between incoming and outgoing calls that keeps the pot at a constant level. There is a cap on call routes (which may vary) meaning the VoIP User PSTN gateway will only route calls to any country which can be achieved for 2.5p/min (pence a minute) or less. This is mostly landlines, but does include some mobile phones. A full country list is available, as is a fair use policy. The maximum allowed call time per call is currently 10 minutes. The cost of calls to different countries/cities is determined according to rate tables that come from VoIP User’s own PSTN line provider(s), so costs vary over time as they do for fully commercial international telcos. Such variations are affected by changes in international currency exchange rates, commercial negotiations between large international carriers and commercial policies. Where VoIP User varies from a commercial telco, though, is that the intention is not to make large profits from connecting calls, but rather to broadly break even. This methodology is frequently referred to as \\"minute neutral\\". Data on calls routed between the PSTN and the internet by the VoIP User network can be seen on their analytics page. Members can obtain a UK non-geographic inbound phone number at no cost which can be routed to any landline throughout the world, or any SIP or IAX2 based VoIP device.  Web forum  In addition to the telco features of VoIP User, it also has a web forum with RSS feeds and a telecom-focused news feed. There are many discussion forums on topics including VoIP, telephony, messaging, presence, open source and Web 2.0. The forum is visited by a large international community, including many industry innovators and telecom experts.  Staff and founders  VoIP User was created by Dean Elwood and Tjardick van der Kraan in July 2003 and both are still intimately involved in the running of both network and web site. Both Dean and Tjardick are internationally known figures in the telecom and Web 2.0 world, and both are huge fans of gadgets and technology. A small team of volunteers administer the forums and help maintain the VoIP network and imagining and creating new features for VoIP User. The forum community itself also contributes a lot to VoIP User, with many experienced developers, gurus and engineers offering help and advice to others with questions and problems.  Fraud  As with any telco that enables calls to be connected internationally, the problem of fraud does sometimes arise. Companies and individuals wanting to make a “quick buck” have sometimes tried to harness the VoIP User network in order to connect paying customers with what is, essentially, a free service, allowing margin to be skimmed off for the fraudster. VoIP User handles this with a variety of measures, including the 10-minute call limit, and in extremis blocking of traffic to specific high fraud risk destinations altogether. Over the years VoIP User has seen many patterns of call fraud and has created tools and techniques to combat them based on the detection of those patterns.  Technology, protocols and architecture  VoIP User currently supports Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for both incoming and outgoing calls and IAX2 protocol for incoming calls. It also supports SIP SIMPLE for Instant Messaging and Presence. Most of the VoIP User core network is constructed using industry-standard PC servers, running Linux and telephony applications that include Asterisk (for audio messaging media and echotesting services), OpenSER (for SIP proxy and registrar duties) and edge controllers and media gateways being a combination of open-source and custom written software. Call rating, CDR collection and account handling software is custom written and based on FreeRADIUS and the integration of RADIUS messaging to the media gateways and SIP B2BUAs residing at the network edge. VoIP User currently operates 9 servers hosted globally and with the main core and media gateways residing at Telehouse London. A wide variety of customer equipment is used on the VoIP User network including desktop VoIP phones, softphones, mobile phones (using Fring on the Apple iPhone and Windows Mobile devices and in-built Wi-Fi functionality in Nokia E series), ATAs and open source switches and PBXes like FreeSWITCH and Asterisk. As VoIP User is a \\"Bring Your Own Device Network\\" best of breed solutions can be used by the end user. VoIP User enables these devices to be mapped to UK non-geographic numbers (typically 0844 or 0870) that have a per minute call rate low enough to fit in with VoIP User’s mode of operation. As an experimental network, several software vendors and private authors test their SIP devices using the VoIP User network. As of January 2009 there were over 250 SIP User-Agents known to VoIP User. Recently, the iNum initiative was launched, creating a special +883 country code (dubbed \\"Earth Area Code\\") that is intended to route calls for free (on-net) or low cost (from PSTN) irrespective of geographic location of the caller and callee. VoIP User is one of the handful of organizations signed up to this from the outset, and a practical result of this is that each one of VoIP User’s accounts now has its own 15-digit iNum telephone number. In the initial wave, VoIP companies have implemented iNum, but it is imagined that ultimately commercial telcos will route these calls too at local call rates.  Regulation  VoIP User is a member of ITSPA, the self-regulating body for the VoIP industry. It complies with the UK number portability scheme so that users may take issued numbers to alternative providers.  Website unavailability  The Voipuser website became unavailable in late 2011. A major data loss caused the website to become unavailable and despite a short notice promising a rebuild it eventually failed to resolve to a destination in November 2012. However, as of December 2012, existing SIP accounts at sip.voipuser.org are still operational. As of March 2013 there is activity on the site again.

It is a suburban development situated 13.6 miles (21.8 km) east of Charing Cross. The area is a relatively recent addition, compared with the more mature suburbs in Havering. It was built on open farmland and the former site of RAF Hornchurch. History =Toponymy= According to Mills (2001) the name South Hornchurch is not an old one, it was devised at the time of the local housing development.Mills, A., Dictionary of London Place Names, (2001) However the ancient parish of Hornchurch was divided into wards, one of which was called South End and covered the area between the town and the River Thames.'Hornchurch: Economic history and local government', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7 (1978), pp. 39-45. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42811 Date accessed: 28 August 2012 =Local government= The ancient parish of Hornchurch formed the royal manor and liberty of Havering. It was divided into the three chapelries of Havering-atte-Bower, Hornchurch and Romford. The South End, North End and Town wards were part of the Hornchurch chapelry under the control of the Hornchurch vestry. Town ward was absorbed into North End and South End wards around 1722. The boundaries of the South End ward were the River Ingrebourne in the east, the River Thames to the south and the River Beam to the west. In the north the boundary was formed by (in modern terms) by Hornchurch Road, High Street and Upminster Road. In 1894 the Hornchurch vestry was replaced by a parish council. From 1926 to 1965 the area was part of Hornchurch Urban District, under the control of Hornchurch Urban District Council. In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was abolished and the area became part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London. =Urban development= Much of lower South Hornchurch, near Thames was occupied by Mardyke Farm. A large, high density housing estate was built on this land by Hornchurch Urban District Council in 1964. Geography The River Beam forms the western boundary with Dagenham, the River Ingrebourne the eastern boundary with Rainham, to the northwest is Elm Park, and to the north is Eastbrookend Country Park. To the south are the industrialised Hornchurch Marshes and the River Thames. South Hornchurch is contiguous with Rainham to the east and the two settlements are connected by the Rainham Bridge over the Ingrebourne.

History The party was founded in 1867 in protest of the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover by the Kingdom of Prussia in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p420 They wanted the revival of the Kingdom of Hanover and the restoration of the sequestrated assets of the former ruling House of Welf.Taddey, Gerhard (1979) Lexikon der deutschen Geschichte. Personen. Ereignisse. Institutionen, Alfred Kröner Verlag, p253 The party therefore was also called the Welfen, and drew its strongest support from the rural areas around Hannover. DHP Reichstag MPs with Ludwig Windthorst (centre), 1889 In the Reichstag DHP deputies usually acted as allies of the anti-Prussian Centre Party parliamentary group under Ludwig Windthorst, who although a Catholic and leader of the Centre Party was a former Hanoverian Justice Minister who was loyal to the House of Welf.Pages 260-261, A history of modern Germany, 1840-1945 By Hajo Holborn From 1890 the party was led by Georg von der Decken. During the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the DHP advocated the implementation of a Free State of Hanover within the Weimar Republic and succeeded in having a plebiscite held in the Prussian Province of Hanover on 19 May 1924. However, the referendum fell short of the one-third threshold required to enact devolution. The defeat hastened the party's decline and in the following years many members joined the rising Nazi Party, others the Catholic Centre. In 1933 the DHP, like other conservative and liberal parties, dissolved to prevent a ban by the Nazi regime. After World War II, a party called Niedersächsische Landespartei (\\"Lower Saxon State Party\\") was formed as a continuation of the DHP. From 1947 that party was known as the German Party (DP). By the time of 1953, a group of DP dissidents formed a new DHP, which again joined the remnants of the German Party in 1962.

TdT adds N-nucleotides to the V, D, and J exons of the TCR and BCR genes during antibody gene recombination, enabling the phenomenon of junctional diversity. In humans, terminal transferase is encoded by the DNTT gene. As a member of the X family of DNA polymerase enzymes, it works in conjunction with polymerase λ and polymerase μ, both of which belong to the same X family of polymerase enzymes. The diversity introduced by TdT has played an important role in the evolution of the vertebrate immune system, significantly increasing the variety of antigen receptors that a cell is equipped with to fight pathogens. Studies using TdT knockout mice have found drastic reductions (10-fold) in T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity compared with that of normal, or wild-type, systems. The greater diversity of TCRs that an organism is equipped with leads to greater resistance to infection. Although TdT was one of the first DNA polymerases identified in mammals in 1960, it remains one of the least understood of all DNA polymerases. In 2016–18, TdT was discovered to demonstrate in trans template dependant behaviour in addition to its more broadly known template independent behaviour TdT is absent in fetal liver HSCs, significantly impairing junctional diversity in B-cells during the fetal period.  Function and regulation  Generally, TdT catalyses the addition of nucleotides to the 3' terminus of a DNA molecule. Unlike most DNA polymerases, it does not require a template. The preferred substrate of this enzyme is a 3'-overhang, but it can also add nucleotides to blunt or recessed 3' ends. Further, TdT is the only polymerase that is known to catalyze the synthesis of 2-15nt DNA polymers from free nucleotides in solution in vivo. In vitro, this behaviour catalyzes the general formation of DNA polymers without specific length. The 2-15nt DNA fragments produced in vivo are hypothesized to act in signaling pathways related to DNA repair and/or recombination machinery. Like many polymerases, TdT requires a divalent cation cofactor, however, TdT is unique in its ability to use a broader range of cations such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ and Co2+. The rate of enzymatic activity depends on the available divalent cations and the nucleotide being added. TdT is expressed mostly in the primary lymphoid organs, like the thymus and bone marrow. Regulation of its expression occurs via multiple pathways. These include protein-protein interactions, like those with TdIF1. TdIF1 is another protein that interacts with TdT to inhibit its function by masking the DNA binding region of the TdT polymerase. The regulation of TdT expression also exists at the transcriptional level, with regulation influenced by stage-specific factors, and occurs in a developmentally restrictive manner. Although expression is typically found to be in the primary lymphoid organs, recent work has suggested that stimulation via antigen can result in secondary TdT expression along with other enzymes needed for gene rearrangement outside of the thymus for T-cells. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia greatly over-produce TdT. Cell lines derived from these patients served as one of the first sources of pure TdT and lead to the discovery that differences in activity exist between human and bovine isoforms. = Mechanism = nucleophilic attack.left Similar to many polymerases, the catalytic site of TdT has two divalent cations in its palm domain that assist in nucleotide binding, help lower the pKa of the 3'-OH group and ultimately facilitate the departure of the resultant pyrophosphate by-product. = Isoform Variation = Several isoforms of TdT have been observed in mice, bovines, and humans. To date, two variants have been identified in mice while three have been identified in humans. The two splice variants identified in mice are named according to their respective lengths: TdTS consists of 509 amino acids while TdTL, the longer variant, consists of 529 amino acids. The differences between TdTS and TdTL occur outside regions that bind DNA and nucleotides. That the 20 amino acid difference affects enzymatic activity is controversial, with some arguing that TdTL's modifications bestow exonuclease activity while others argue that TdTL and TdTS have nearly identical in vitro activity. Additionally, TdTL reportedly can modulate the catalytic activity of TdTS in vivo through an unknown mechanism. It is suggested that this aids in the regulation of TdT's role in V(D)J recombination. Human TdT isoforms have three variants TdTL1, TdTL2, and TdTS. TdTL1 is broadly expressed in lymphoid cell lines while TdTL2 is predominantly expressed in normal small lymphocytes. Both localize in the nucleus when expressed and both possess 3'->5' exonuclease activity. In contrast, TdTS isoforms do not possess exonuclease activity and perform the necessary elongation during V(D)J recombination. Since a similar exonuclease activity hypothesized in murine TdTL is found in human and bovine TdTL, some postulate that bovine and human TdTL isoforms regulate TdTS isoforms in a similar manner as proposed in mice. Further, some hypothesize that TdTL1 may be involved in the regulation of TdTL2 and/or TdTS activity. = Role in V(D)J Recombination = leftUpon the action of the RAG 1/2 enzymes, the cleaved double-stranded DNA is left with hairpin structures at the end of each DNA segment created by the cleavage event. The hairpins are both opened by the Artemis complex, which has endonuclease activity when phosphorylated, providing the free 3' OH ends for TdT to act upon. Once the Artemis complex has done its job and added palindromic nucleotides (P-nucleotides) to the newly opened DNA hairpins, the stage is set for TdT to do its job. TdT is now able to come in and add N-nucleotides to the existing P-nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction that polymerases are known to function. On average 2-5 random base pairs are added to each 3' end generated after the action of the Artemis complex. The number of bases added is enough for the two newly synthesized ssDNA segments to undergo microhomology alignment during non-homologous end joining according to the normal Watson-Crick base pairing patterns (A-T, C-G). From there unpaired nucleotides are excised by an exonuclease, like the Artemis Complex (which has exonuclease activity in addition to endonuclease activity), and then template-dependent polymerases can fill the gaps, finally creating the new coding joint with the action of ligase to combine the segments. Although TdT does not discriminate among the four base pairs when adding them to the N-nucleotide segments, it has shown a bias for guanine and cytosine base pairs. = Template Dependent Activity = left In a template- dependant manner, TdT can incorporate nucleotides across strand breaks in double-stranded DNA in a manner referred to as in trans in contrast to the in cis mechanism found in most polymerases. This occurs optimally with a one base-pair break between strands and less so with an increasing gap. This is facilitated by a subsection of TdT called Loop1 which selectively probes for short breaks in double-stranded DNA. Further, the discovery of this template dependant activity has led to more convincing mechanistic hypotheses as to how the distribution of lengths of the additions of the N regions arise in V(D)J recombination. right Polymerase μ and polymerase λ exhibit similar in trans templated dependant synthetic activity to TdT, but without similar dependence on downstream double-stranded DNA. Further, Polymerase λ has also been found to exhibit similar template-independent synthetic activity. Along with activity as a terminal transferase, it is known to also work in a more general template-dependent fashion. The similatrities between TdT and polymerase μ suggest they are closely evolutionarily related.  Uses  Terminal transferase has applications in molecular biology. It can be used in RACE to add nucleotides that can then be used as a template for a primer in subsequent PCR. It can also be used to add nucleotides labeled with radioactive isotopes, for example in the TUNEL assay (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling) for the demonstration of apoptosis (which is marked, in part, by fragmented DNA). It is also used in the immunofluorescence assay for the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In immunohistochemistry, antibodies to TdT can be used to demonstrate the presence of immature T and B cells and pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, which possess the antigen, while mature lymphoid cells are always TdT-negative. While TdT-positive cells are found in small numbers in healthy lymph nodes and tonsils, the malignant cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are also TdT-positive, and the antibody can, therefore, be used as part of a panel to diagnose this disease and to distinguish it from, for example, small cell tumors of childhood. TdT has also seen recent application in the De Novo synthesis of oligonucleotides, with TdT-dNTP tethered analogs capable of primer extension by 1 nt at a time. In other words, the enzyme TdT has demonstrated the capability of making synthetic DNA by adding one letter at a time to a primer sequence.

The Adoration of the Shepherds measures 83.07 x 123.62 in. It was commissioned for the Capuchin Franciscans and was painted in Messina for the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli in 1609 just one year before the artist's death. It is now in the Interdisciplinary Regional Museum of Messina.  About the Artist  Michelangelo Merisi, commonly known as Caravaggio, was born in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, Italy in 1571. He had to flee from his hometown after wounding a police officer in a tavern brawl. As with most other aspiring artists, he went to Rome to study classical techniques. Throughout his young adult life, Caravaggio was known amongst Italian citizens to be quite unruly and rebellious. He was often arrested on charges for violent behavior. Cardinal Francesco del Monte took a struggling Caravaggio into his home, and introduced him to his circle—thereby securing Caravaggio with his first public commissions. These commissions were not religious, but entirely secular paintings ranging from flowers and fruit to paintings of a young classical Greek god. It was during this time that he would become world-renowned for the physical particularity and brutal realism of his paintings. In 1599, Caravaggio reached a turning point in his artistic career. Presumably under Cardinal Francesco de Monte, Caravaggio was commissioned to decorate a wall dedicated to Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi. This was Caravaggio's first religious work for the Catholic Church. He began to be seen as an artistic visionary for the Church with his use of anachronistic technique to draw people back to the Catholic Church during the Counter Reformation. With this good publicity, he began to pick up many more prestigious commissions. Caravaggio painted from life rather than drawings, which initially received criticism but later revolutionized the term “artistic realism”. Caravaggio mysteriously died in 1610, a year after finishing The Adoration of the Shepherds.  The Creation and Artistic Analysis of The Adoration of the Shepherds  By the time that Caravaggio painted The Adoration of the Shepherds in 1609, the subjects in his paintings had acquired a more spiritual expressiveness. His figures were isolated against vast, empty backgrounds. This was a contrast to the Renaissance technique of employing decorative backgrounds. The Capuchins were among the few religious patrons and critics who were fond of Caravaggio's brutal realism. Many were critical of Caravaggio's approach to his religious paintings and called it “vulgar” to represent biblical figures as ordinary peasants. The focal point of the scene is Mary in the center. She is swathed in bright red. One of the three shepherds closest to her also has a little bit of what appears to be the same red robe draped along his arm. This might be symbolic of the gesture he is making to touch the Virgin as she is holding Christ. All three shepherds, as well as Joseph identified by a faint halo, look on with amazement and complete adoration at this infant child born in a barn. Caravaggio's Baroque work is starkly different and revolutionary from Renaissance predecessors. To start, these divine figures are represented as ordinary people of the times. They are barefoot with ordinary robes. There is no divinity in the barn, either. There is no holy light source to shine the entire scene and make it overly-apparent that a divine event is occurring. Instead, the background is extremely dark with only a small single light source. It seems as though the space was lit by a single candle, as it might have realistically been during the actual event. We know that in the biblical account, Mary and Joseph were extremely poor. Their halos are almost barely seen, in contrast to the ornate halos of the Renaissance. Other than the halos, the clasped hands of the shepherds is the only thing hinting of any religious importance in the painting. There was nothing overtly marvelous about the birth of Christ. Caravaggio renders this aspect perfectly. Caravaggio's compositions are also non-classical: he arranges his figures along imaginary diagonal lines rather than a perfectly center linear composition like the Renaissance. There is a box of tools in the foreground, presumably Joseph's since he was a carpenter. There is a single roughly baked loaf of bread as well, to reiterate Mary and Joseph's poverty. There is nothing pre-arranged in the painting. It looks like a photograph that would have been taken in the exact moments after Christ's birth. Stylistically, Caravaggio used a technique he was famous for developing called chiaroscuro. Chiaroscuro is a contrast between dark and light. Using this technique heightened the drama of the work to make it seem raw and magnify the emotional aspects of the work. Chiaroscuro forces the viewer to focus on the figures and the event rather than other things going on in the background. The central theme of the painting is humility. By seating the Virgin on the ground, Caravaggio implies that she is not a heavenly queen, but rather a simple young mother. This painting is a representation of the majority. The response of the shepherds is to admire rather than to venerate. There is a calmness and tranquility that is unmistakably conveying their worth as common-folk for the people as the parents of the Savior.

It is located in the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia located on the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, Sicily. History According to The Golden Legend, Saint Lucy had bestowed her wealth on the poor, in gratitude for the miraculous healing of her mother. Denounced as a Christian by her own suitor who wrongly suspected her of infidelity, she refused to recant, offered her chastity to Christ, and was sentenced to be dragged to a brothel. Miraculously, nothing could move her or displace her from the spot where she stood. She was pierced by a knife in the throat and, where she fell, the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse was built. Caravaggio had escaped from prison on Malta in 1608, fleeing to Syracuse. There his Roman companion Mario Minniti helped him get a commission for the present altarpiece. Caravaggio painted it in 1608, for the Franciscan church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro. The choice of subject was driven by the fact that St. Lucy was the patron saint of Syracuse and had been interred below the church. The subject was unusual, but especially important to the local authorities, who were eager to reinforce the local cult of St. Lucy, which had sustained a setback with the theft of her remains during the Middle Ages.

In August 1608 Caravaggio fled from Malta, where he had been imprisoned for an unknown crime, and took refuge in Sicily with his friend, the artist Mario Minniti. Through Minniti's intercession he procured a number of important commissions, including this for the church of the Padri Crociferi in Messina, where it was presented by the wealthy Genoese merchant Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari on 10 June 1609. The fee was a thousand scudi, more than double any Caravaggio had received previously. Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was the patron saint of Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari, to whom Caravaggio was contracted to paint an altarpiece in the church of the Padri Crociferi. The Gospel of John tells how he fell sick, died, was buried and then miraculously raised from the dead by Christ. As in several paintings from this period of Caravaggio's career, the scene is set against blank walls that overwhelm the frieze of human actors. The interaction of the relief of figures caught in corporate effort and emotion, with a large void above, is quite different from the closely focussed individualised dramas of his early and middle periods. As is usual with Caravaggio, light becomes an important element in the drama, picking out crucial details such as Lazarus's hands—one lax and open to receive, the other reaching towards Christ—and the wonder-struck faces of the onlookers. The old story that Caravaggio had a freshly buried body exhumed for this painting is \\"probably apocryphal, but not beyond the bounds of possibility\\" (John Gash, see below). Some of the figures were said to be modelled on members of the community, but Caravaggio has also relied on his memory—the whole design is based on an engraving after Giulio Romano and his Jesus is a reversed image of the Christ who called Matthew to join him in The Calling of Saint Matthew. The painting is in poor condition and much restored, and it's possible that some passages are the work of assistants. According to Francesco Susinno, Caravaggio had produced a first version that he destroyed with a razor after adverse criticism. Subsequently he would have finished in record time the present version, but probably this account is fanciful.

Frédérick Lemaître (28 July 1800 - 26 January 1876) — birth name Antoine Louis Prosper Lemaître — was a French actor and playwright, one of the most famous players on the celebrated Boulevard du Crime. Biography Lemaître, the son of an architect, was born at Le Havre, Seine-Maritime. He adopted the first name \\"Frédérick\\" as a stage name. He spent two years at the Conservatoire de Paris, and made his first appearance at a variety performance in one of the basement restaurants at the Palais Royal. At the Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique on 12 July 1823 he played the part of Robert Macaire in L'Auberge des Adrets. The melodrama was played seriously on the first night and was received with little favor, but it was changed on the second night to burlesque, and thanks to him had a great success. All of Paris came to see it, and from that day he was famous. He created a number of parts that added to his popularity, especially Cardillac, Cagliostro and Cartouche. His success in the last led to an engagement at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, where in 1827 he produced Ducange's Trente ans, ou la vie d'un joueur, in which his vivid acting made a profound impression. Afterwards at the Odéon and other theatres he passed from one success to another. In 1836, at the Théâtre des Variétés he appeared with success as the great, and recently deceased, English actor Edmund Kean in the play Kean by Alexandre Dumas, père. He put the final touch to his reputation as an artist by creating the part of Ruy Blas in Victor Hugo's play (1838). On his return to the Porte St. Martin he created the title-role in Balzac's Vautrin, which was forbidden a second presentation, on account, it is said, of the resemblance of the actor's wig to the well-known toupé worn by Louis Philippe. His last appearance was at this theatre in 1873 as the old Jew in Marie Tudor. He was married to the actress, Sophia Halligner, sister of the mezzo-soprano Marie-Julie Halligner. Lemaître died in 1876 in Paris and was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre in the Montmartre Quarter.

The cancer originates from the uncontrolled division of specific types of B-cells known as centrocytes and centroblasts. These cells normally occupy the follicles (nodular swirls of various types of lymphocytes) in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. The cancerous cells in FL typically form follicular or follicle-like structures (see adjacent Figure) in the tissues they invade. These structures are usually the dominant histological feature of this cancer. There are several synonymous and obsolete terms for FL such as CB/CC lymphoma (centroblastic and centrocytic lymphoma), nodular lymphoma, Brill-Symmers Disease, and the subtype designation, follicular large-cell lymphoma. In the USA and Europe, this disease is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, exceeded only by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. FL accounts for 10-20% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with ~15,000 new cases of it being newly diagnosed each year in the USA and Europe. Recent studies indicate that FL is similarly prevalent in Japan. FL is a broad and extremely complex clinical entity with a wide range of manifestations which have not yet been fully systematized. It is commonly preceded by a benign precancerous disorder in which abnormal centrocytes and/or centroblasts accumulate in lymphoid tissue. They may then circulate in the blood to cause an asymptomatic condition termed in situ lymphoid neoplasia of the follicular lymphoma type (i.e. ISFL). A small percentage of these cases progress to FL. Most commonly, however, FL presents as a swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and/or groin. Less often, it presents as a gastrointestinal tract cancer, a cancer in children involving lymphoid tissues of the head and neck area (e.g. tonsils), or one or more masses in non-lymphoid tissues such as the testes. FL typically has a slow disease course which persists essentially unchanged for years. However, each year 2-3% of FL cases progress to a highly aggressive form often termed stage 3B FL, to an aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or to another type of aggressive B-cell cancer. These transformed follicular lymphomas (t-FL) are essentially incurable. However, recent advancements in the treatment of t-FL (e.g. the addition to standard chemotherapy of agents such as rituximab) have improved overall survival times. These newer regimens may also delay the transformation of FL to t-FL. Additional advances in understanding FL may lead to further improvements in treating the disease.  Pathophysiology  = Genomic alterations = The serial progressions of in situ FL to FL and FL to t-FL appear to involve the accumulation of increasing numbers of genomic alterations (i.e. chromosome abnormalities and gene mutations) in the formative B-cell precursors to these disorders. At least some of these alterations appear to cause the over-expression or under- expression of the products of genes that regulate these cells' susceptibility to develop further genomic alterations, to survive, to proliferate, and/or to spread to other tissues. In consequence, multiple B-cell clones that exhibit increasing genomic alterations and malignant behaviors populate the disorder. No single genomic alteration seems responsible for the development of each of the spectrum of FL disorders. Rather, interactions between multiple genomic alterations appear to underlie this serial progression.  In situ follicular lymphoma  In situ follicular lymphoma is an accumulation of monoclonal B cells (i.e. cells descendent from a single ancestral cell) in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissue. These cells commonly bear an pathological genomic abnormality, i.e. a translocation between position 32 on the long (i.e. \\"q\\") arm of chromosome 14 and position 21 on chromosome 18's q arm. This translocation juxtaposes the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene on chromosome 18 at position q21.33 near to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH@) on chromosome 14 at position q21. In consequence, BCL2 overexpresses its product, BCL2 apoptosis regulator (i.e. Bcl2). Bcl2 functions to inhibit programmed cell death thereby prolonging cell survival. The overexpression of Bcl2 in the B-cells of ISFL is thought to be a critical factor in their pathological accumulation and subsequent malignant progression. Small numbers (e.g. 1 in 100,000) of circulating nucleated blood cells bearing this t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation are found in 50-67% of otherwise healthy individuals. The prevalence of this finding increases with age and years of tobacco smoking. Since most individuals with this translocation in their blood cells do not develop ISFL, the t(14:18)(q32:q21) translocation, while prolonging cell survival, must be just one step in the development of ISFN. This translocation is proposed to occur during the early development of immature bone marrow B-cells (i.e. pre-B-cells/pro-B-cells) after which these cells circulate freely and in rare cases accumulate and mature to centrocytes and/or centroblasts in the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles to form ISFL. The mechanism favoring this localization and further accumulation is unclear. Individuals with ISFL progress to FL at a rate of 2-3%/year for at least the first 10 years following diagnosis. This progression likely involves the acquisition of genomic aberrations besides the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation in the ISFL B-cells. Suspect mutations include those in the following genes: 1) EZH2 (encodes polycomb repressive complex 2 family protein which is involved in maintaining the transcriptional repressive state of various genes and is found in up to 27% of FL cases); 2) CREBBP (encodes CREB-binding protein which contributes to the activation of various genes); 3) TNFSF14 (encodes tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 14, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily which may function as a co-stimulatory factor for the activation of lymphoid cells); and 4) KMT2D (encodes histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D, a histone methyltransferase which regulates the expression of various genes). ISFL may also acquire numerous copy-number variations (i.e. duplications and deletions of a portion of a chromosome along with any of the genes contained therein) that may contribute to FL. In all cases, the number of genetic abnormalities acquired in the B-cells of ISFL are much less than those in FL.  Follicular lymphoma  The genomic alterations found in FL include 1) the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation (85-90% of cases); 2) 1p36 deletions (i.e. deletions in the q arm of chromosome 1 at position 36, [60-70% of cases]) that lead to lose of TNFAIP3 (encodes tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3 which inhibits the activation of NF-κB, blocks cell death due to apoptosis, and regulates lymphocyte-based immune responses through its ubiquitin ligase activity); 3) mutations in PRDM1 (encodes the PR domain zinc finger protein which promotes the maturation and proliferation of B-cells); and 4) the same mutations seen in ISFL including KMT2D (85-90% of cases), CREEBP (40-65% of cases), BCL2 (40-65% of cases), and EZH2 (20-30% of cases) as well as other mutations such as those in the histone-modifying gene HIST1H1E (20-30% of cases), the RRAGC gene (~17% of cases) which regulates cell growth, survival, death, and proliferation, and, in ≤15% of cases several other genes including MEF2B, STAT6, EP300, ARID1A, SLC22A2, CARD11, FOXO1, GNA12, B2M (i.e. the gene for beta-2 microglobulin), and SGK1. Except for the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation and EZH2 mutations which lead to gains in the expression and function, respectively, of their products, the genetic alterations generally lead to a loss in the production or function of the cited genes products. However, the exact roles, if any, of these genomic abnormalities in promoting the progression of ISFL to FL are unclear.  Transformed follicular lymphoma  The transformation of FL to a more aggressive state or other type of aggressive lymphoma is associated with: 1) primarily gene-activating mutations in CREEBP, KMT2D, STAT6, CARD11 (encoding a guanylate kinase which interacts with BCL10 and activates NF-κB to regulate cell survival); 2) changes in the expression of diverse genes; 3) the overproduction of various cell-activating cytokines and CD79B (encoding the Ig-beta protein component of the B-cell receptor); 4) gene-inactivating mutations in TNFAIP3, CD58 (encoding the cell adhesion molecule, lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3, that is involved in activating T-cells), CDKN2A (encoding p16INK4a and p14arf tumor suppressor proteins) or CDKN2B (encoding cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B multiple tumor suppressor 2) (inactivation of either CDKN2 gene causes genome instability, i.e. increased frequency of other gene mutations), and TNFRSF4 (encoding one type of tumor necrosis factor receptor); and 5) gene-activating or -inactivating mutations in, or other causes for the under- or over-expression of, c-MYC ((encoding the c-Myc proto-oncogene transcription factor that regulates the expression of diverse genes many of which promote cell proliferation). = Tumor environment = The non-neoplastic immune and stromal cells as well as the extracellular matrix in tissues may enable neoplastic follicular cells to survive, proliferate, and avoid surveillance by the immune system. For example, laboratory studies show that: 1) follicular dendritic cells, fibroblastic reticular cells, and T helper cells provide growth and survival signals to neoplastic follicular B-cells; 2) neoplastic follicular B-cells recruit regulatory T cells that act to suppress immune responses to them; 3) the cytotoxic T-cells which normally kill neoplastic cells become dysfunctional in the presence of neoplastic follicular cells that are embedded in this multicellular environment; and 4) bone marrow stromal cells directly support the growth of neoplastic follicular cells. Reduced levels of immune-infiltration has been shown to be strongly associated with early progression of disease.  Presentation and course  = In situ follicular lymphoma = FL is commonly preceded by but uncommonly progresses to ISFL, an asymptomatic disorder that usually is discovered in tissues which are biopsied for other reasons. FL lymphoma may be diagnosed in the uncommon cases in which individuals with ISFL are found to have FL on follow-up examinations. Similarly, individuals with >1 in 10,000 circulating lymphocytes containing the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation are at increased but still small risk of developing FL and being diagnoses as having FL on follow up examinations. = Follicular lymphoma = FL commonly presents as an otherwise asymptomatic enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, groin, femoral canal, or other sites in individuals (median age 65) without a known history of ISFL or abnormal numbers of circulating t(14:18)q32:q21-conatianing lymphocytes. These enlargements may have been present for months to years and during this time waxed and waned in size. Less commonly, FL presents as extra- nodal masses in the skin, thyroid gland, salivary gland, breast, testicles. spleen, liver, and/or lung. Regardless of the type of presentation, FL is usually (~80% of cases) at an advanced stage at diagnosis as indicated by involvement of the bone marrow (50% to 70% of cases), multiple lymph nodes in different parts of the body, and/or other tissues. A minority (<33%) of FL patients present with B symptoms, i.e. recurrent unexplained fevers, recurrent night sweats, and/or weight loss ≥10% in the past 6 months. Generally, the disease has an indolent and prolonged course with a median life expectancy of 15–20 years: a large percentage of patients die from other causes than their FL disease. However, each year, including the early years after diagnosis, some 2-3% of FL cases transform to t-FL; Median survival has been ~4.5 years after the onset of this transformation. There are less common subtypes of FL that differ not only in their presentation but also in their histopathology, genetic abnormalities, and course. These subtypes, which are now (i.e. primary gastrointestinal tract FL) or may in the future (pediatric-type FL) be considered distinctive diseases, are:  Duodenal-type follicular lymphoma  Duodenal-type follicular lymphoma (DFL) was initially considered to be a type of Primary gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) follicular lymphoma (PGTFL), i.e. a follicular lymphoma in which GI tract lesions were prominent parts of the disease. However, a subset of PGTFL cases had lesions that were localized to the duodenum and other parts of the small intestine usually without involving other parts of the GI tract or tissues outside of the GI tract. This contrasts with the other cases of PGTFL which were systemic diseases involving a wide range of GI tract and non-GI tract tissues. Consequently, the World Health Organization (2017) removed the localized disease from the primary gastrointestinal tract follicular lymphoma category, reclassified it as a distinct disease entity, and termed it duodenal-type follicular lymphoma. DFL is most often an asymptomatic disease that is diagnosed on endoscopic examination of the GI tract conducted for other reasons. Less commonly, it presents with vague abdominal symptoms. In one review of former studies, the lesions in 85% of primary duodenal follicular lymphoma were located not only in the duodenum but also other sites in the intestine (i.e. jejunum and/or ileum), with rare cases having lesions in the rectum or cecum PDF is an indolent disease that may spontaneously remit and relapse but only rarely progresses to a more aggressive form. A watch-and-wait strategy has been a generally recommended method for the initial treatment of the disease.  Primary gastrointestinal tract follicular lymphoma  PGTFL is a follicular lymphoma (which as currently defined excludes cases of duodenal-type follicular lymphoma) that has a prominent component of GI tract involvement. The disease may present with signs and symptoms typical of the common type of follicular lymphoma. For example, enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck, armpit, groin, femoral canal, and/or other areas, and/or signs and symptoms of GI tract disease due to lesions in the stomach, small intestine, large intestine or rectum may be seen. These signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, persistent nausea and vomiting, hematochezia (i.e. passage of fresh blood usually on feces through the rectum), or melena (i.e. passage of tarry feces containing blood that has been digested in the stomach or upper intestine). PGTFL is generally treated like cases of common follicular lymphoma: depending on the severity of the disease and its symptoms, patients are treated with watchful waiting, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy plus radiotherapy, or combinations of these modalities.  Predominantly diffuse follicular lymphoma with 1p36 deletion  Predominantly diffuse follicular lymphoma with 1p36 deletion is a rare subtype of FL in which involved lymph nodes show infiltrations of centrocytes and centoblasts that generally do not form the nodular, swirling patterns characteristic of most types of FL. In addition, these cells lack the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation commonly found in other FL types but, similar to many FL cases, have a deletion in the terminal part of the short (i.e. \\"p\\") arm of chromosome 1 that encodes the TNFRSF14 gene (see pathophysiology section). Predominantly diffuse follicular lymphoma with 1p36 deletion usually presents with bulky enlargements of inguinal (i.e. groin) lymph nodes but may present with enlargements of the axillary (i.e. armpit) or cervical (i.e., neck) lymph nodes. In rare cases, there may be involvement of the bone marrow. In spite of the evidence of bulky and disseminated disease, predominantly diffuse follicular lymphoma with 1p36 deletion appears to be an indolent disorder that may require long-term observation rather than overtreatment.  Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma  Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma (PTFL) was initially reported to occur in children ages 1–17 years old (median age ~13-14) but more recently has been reported to occur in adults. The disorder was recently defined by the World Health Organization (2016) as a distinct entity that occurs mostly in males and involves swollen lymph nodes in the head (including tonsils and adenoids), neck, or, rarely, axillary, or inguinal areas, or non-lymphoid tissues. Currently, however, patients who had exhibited or are exhibiting involvement of areas or tissues outside of the head, neck, armpit, or groin areas are now regarded as far more likely to have a newly and provisionally defined disease, large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement. The lesions in PTFL consists of infiltrates containing rapidly proliferating centrocytes and centroblasts that lack the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation but nonetheless often overexpress the BCL2 gene. These cells may show a loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 (20-50% of cases) that results in decreased expression of the TNFRSF14 gene (see Pathophysiology section) as well as mutations in the IRF8 (10-50% of cases), which contributes to the development and function of B cells, and the MAP2K1 gene (10-40% of cases), which regulates activation of the ERK cell signaling pathway. More than 2 dozen other genes have been reported to be mutated in rare cases of PTFL but in general the genetic abnormalities found in this disorder are fewer and less complex than those in other types of FL. PTFL has an indolent, relapsing and remitting course with a 5 year survival rate of >95%. Patients diagnosed with PTFL have been treated with chemotherapy, surgery, and combinations of these treatments. In general, these patients did well (100% survival with <5% of cases relapsing regardless of treatment modality). More recently, 36 patients have been treated with surgical resection alone followed by observation; all these patients survived with only one having a relapse. Thus, PTFL appears to be a highly indolent type of FL in which multiple studies have reported overall and progression-free survival rates of 100% and >90%, respectively, for >2 years and an estimated probability of 5-year event-free survival rate of ~96%. The therapeutic regimens versus follow-up observations that best treat this disorder in children, adolescents, and adults (adults may require different treatments than children and adolescents) requires further study.  Primary follicular lymphoma of the testis  Primary follicular lymphoma of the testis (PFLT), also termed testicular follicular lymphoma, was classified as a distinct form of FL by the World Health Organization in 2016. It is an extremely rare disease that has been recognized as occurring primarily in children and adolescents but also has been reported in 5 adults. PFLT differs from cases of typical follicular lymphoma that involve the testis in that it more often occurs in children and adolescents; involves malignant B-cells that do have the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation; and presents with disease that is strictly limited to the testis. While similar to pediatric-type follicular lymphoma in not involving cells that bear the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation, PFLT differs from the former disease in that it is limited to the testis and involves malignant cells that do not express Bcl2. PFTL is an extremely indolent disease which is manifested by lesions that exhibit a typical FL histology or, more commonly, a mixed FL-diffuse large cell lymphoma histology. It usually involves a 2-4 centimeter lesion in a single testicle. Patients have been treated with removal of the involved testes followed by various standard anti- lymphoma chemotherapy regimens to attain excellent results, i.e. 100% completed remissions with no recurrence of disease in 15 child and adolescent patients observed for 4–96 months. No cases of primary follicular lymphoma of the testis have been reported to progress to t-FL. Surgery followed by less strenuous or even no chemotherapy may prove to be the optimal treatment for this disease. = Transformed follicular lymphoma = FL progresses at a rate of 2-3% per year for at least the first 10 years after diagnosis to a more aggressive form, principally diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (~93% of cases) or Burkitt-like lymphoma (~7% of cases) or in rare cases exhibit the histology resembling precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, plasmablastic lymphoma, the high grade subtype of B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma of the B-cell type, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphcytic lymphoma, or histiocytic sarcoma. t-FL is almost always diagnosed in patients being followed for FL. These FL patients present with the: fast growth of lymph nodes; formation of extra-nodal lesions in extra-nodal sites such as the central nervous system, liver or bone; the onset of B-symptoms (i.e. fever, night sweats, weight loss); development of hypercalcemia (i.e. high serum levels of calcium); and/or sudden rises in serum levels of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. A minority of t-FL patients present without a history of FL. These patients generally present with advanced, bulky disease that may be accompanied by extra-nodal lesions and B-symptoms. Typically, all the various forms of t-FL are aggressive, rapidly progressive diseases with overall media survival times in treated patients of ~4.5 years. The transformation of FL to DLBCL is in over 70% of cases associated with the gain of MYC activity by genetic or non-genetic mechanisms.  Diagnosis  Follicular lymphoma replacing a lymph node; the bubble-like outgrowths are enlarged follicles. The diagnosis of FL depends on examining involved tissues for histological, immunological, and chromosomal abnormalities that are indicative of the disease. FL usually involves enlarged lymph nodes populated by abnormal follicles (see adjacent picture) that when examined histologically contain a mixture of centrocytes or centroblast surrounded by non-malignant cells, mostly T-cells. The centrocytes, which typically outnumber centroblasts, are small to medium-sized B-cell lymphocytes that characteristically exhibit cleaved nuclei; the centropblasts are larger B-cell lymphocytes without cleaved nuclei. Rare cases of FL may show lesions that contain tissue infiltrations dominated by B-cells with features of precursor (i.e. \\"blast\\") cells, monocytes, or malignant mantle cells such as those found in mantle cell lymphoma. Immunochemical analyses reveal that the these cells generally express B-cell surface markers including the CD10 (60% of cases), CD20, CD19, CD22, and CD79 but not CD5, CD11c, or CD23 cell surface proteins; genomic analyses reveal that these cells contain t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation (85-90% of cases), 1p36 deletions (60-70% of cases), and with far less frequency the other genomic abnormalities listed in the above sections on Pathophysiology and Presentation and course. None of these protein markers or genomic abnormalities are diagnostic for FL, e.g. the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation is found in 30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in a small number of reactive benign lymph nodes. Rather, the diagnosis is made by a combination of histological, immunological, and genomic abnormalities. According to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, differences in the microscopically-determined morphology of these tissues can be used to diagnose and categorized FL into the following 3 Grades with grade 3 having A and B subtypes: *Grade 1: follicles have <5 centroblasts per high-power field (hpf). *Grade 2: follicles have 6 to 15 centroblasts per hpf. *Grade 3: follicles have >15 centroblasts per hpf. **Grade 3A: Grade 3 in which the follicles contain predominantly centrocytes. **Grade 3B: Grade 3 in which the follicles consist almost entirely of centroblasts. Grades 1 and 2 are regarded as low grade FL; Grade 3A is usually also regarded as low grade FL although some studies have regarded it as high grade FL; and Grade 3B is regarded as a highly aggressive FL in the t-FL category. In addition to grade 3B disease, histologic examinations may reveal other evidence of t-FL such as histologic findings consistent with FL and diffuse large cell lymphoma in the same tissue (referred to as composite lymphomas) or in separate tissues (referred to as (discordant lymphomas) or histologic findings similar to those found in Burkitt lymphoma, precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, plasmablastic lymphoma, the high grade subtype of B-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma of the B-cell type, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic lymphoma, or histiocytic sarcoma. Other findings indicating the presence of this transformation include rapid growth in size of lymph nodes, recently acquired or new B symptoms, recent development of FL lesions in non-nodal tissue, rapid rises in serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and the presence of high levels of serum calcium. = Differential diagnosis = FL may be confused with marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and the small lymphocytic lymphoma variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The malignant cells in marginal zone B-cell lymphoma may form follicular structures but commonly proliferate in the marginal zone rather than germinal center of lymphoid tissues. These malignant cells often show features of monocytes or plasma cells. Mantle cell lymphomas show monotonous, medium sized lymphocytes, monocytes, and atrophied germinal centers; unlike FL, the malignant lymphocytes in this disease are positive for Cyclin D1 by immunohistochemistry staining. Small lymphocytic lymphomas are composed of nodular structures with small- to medium-sized malignant cells surrounding immature lymphocytes and immunoblasts. The malignant cells in this disease, unlike FL, stain positive for CD5 and CD23.  Treatment and prognosis  FL is typically a slowly growing lymphoma with an overall median life expectancy for treated patients of 10–15 years with many cases of it waxing and waning in the size of their lesions and rare cases of it remitting spontaneously. These considerations favor the use of observation over intervention in patients whose particular form of FL has a favorable prognosis or who are intolerant to aggressive treatments. However, most cases of FL have a less favorable prognosis at some stage of their disease and will therefore require intervention. There is little consensus regarding the guidelines to be used to define the prognosis and treatment for FL at its presentation or during its course.. Currently used indicators for this include the disease's: 1) histology; 2) subtype; 3) predicted indolence and potential for transformation; and 4) extent of disease as measured by clinical examinations, bone marrow biopsy to determine bone marrow involvement, and PET/CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any areas outside of these regions if physical examination suggests involvement. Some suggested guidelines using these parameters to indicate the prognosis and need for treatment in FL include: *The WHO criteria using histological grade (see previous section): Patients with Grades 1, 2, and 3A disease are predicted to have the same low risk prognosis that is seen in cases of typical FL while patients with grade 3B disease are predicted to have the high risk prognosis typical of t-FL. *The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI): FLIPI uses the following criteria: age ≥60 years; Ann Arbor disease stage III (i.e. lesions located both above and below the thoracic diaphragm) or IV (i.e. disseminated lesions involving one or more non- lymphatic organs); blood hemoglobin <12 gram/deciliter; serum lactose dehydrogenase level above normal; and involvement of >4 lymph nodes. Patients positive for 0-1, 2, or ≥3 of these factors are classified as in low, intermediate, and high risk group, respectively, and after treatment with regiments that include rituximab have 2 year predicted progression free survivals of 84, 72, and 65%, respectively, and overall survivals of 98, 94, and 87%, respectively. *The FLIP2 index. This modification of FLIP1 uses age ≥60; blood hemoglobin <12 gram/deciliter; serum lactose dehydrogenase level above normal; serum beta-2 microglobulin level above normal; ≥1 lymph node with a diameter >6 centimeters; and bone marrow involvement. The predicted percentage of therapy-treated patients with progression free survival at 5 years for individuals positive for 0, 1-2, and ≥3 of these factors are 80, 51, and 19%, respectively. *CT/PET imaging: This method measures total body tumor volume as detected by tissue uptake of radioactive fludeoxyglucose (F18). Progression free and overall survival at 5 years for patients with estimated tumor volumes above versus below 510 cubic centimeters are reported to be 32.7 and 84.8% versus 65.1 and 94.7%, respectively. *Lugano staging: this method classifies Stage I disease as involving a single lymphatic region or extra- lymphatic site; Stage II disease as involving ≥2 lymphatic sites or 1 lymphatic site plus 1 extralympatic site with all lesions being on the same side of the diaphragm; Stage III disease as involving ≥2 lymphatic regions that are on opposite sides of the diaphragm; and Stage IV disease as disseminated lesions that are found to be in ≥1 non-lymphatic organs. *Response-based prognosis: FL patients whose disease progresses within 24 months of initiating treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy versus patients whose disease does not progress within 24 months are predicted to have 5 year survival rates of 50-74% versus ~90%, respectively. The prognosis and treatment for the specific presentations of typical FL cases (see above sections for the prognoses and treatment recommendations for primary gastrointestinal tract FL, predominantly diffuse FL with 1p36 deletion, pediatric-type FL, and primary FL of the testis) that are in common use are as follows: = In situ follicular lymphoma = ISFL is a benign condition that may be reevaluated periodically to detect the rare cases of it which progress to FL; otherwise ISFL is not treated. = Localized follicular lymphoma = In 10-20% of cases, FL appears limited to single radiation field, does not involve the bone marrow, and is therefore regarded as localized early-stage FL. In these cases, which are sometimes classified as Ann Arbor stage I (i.e. disease limited to a single restricted region) or stage II (i.e. disease restricted to two sites that are on the same side of the diaphragm), radiation therapy achieves 10 year overall survival rates of 60-80% and median overall survival times of 19 years. It seems likely that many of the relapses in these cases are due to undetected disease outside of the radiation field at the time of radiation treatment. The use of PET/CT imaging is strongly recommended to insure that the FL is localized. In any case, the excellent results achieved with radiation therapy strongly support its use in localized disease. The use of an immunotherapeutic agent such as Rituximab alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic regimen such as CVP (i.e. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab) in cases of localized, early-stage disease may be appropriate choices for some of these early-stage patients. However, the latter approach is recommended for cases of localized disease in which the disease extends beyond a single field: 56% of patients treated in this manner had progression-free survival at 10 years while patients treated with other regimens had progression free survivals of 41%. Nonetheless, overall survival did not differ between the two groups. = Asymptomatic follicular lymphoma = Patients with asymptomatic but not localized low grade FL, gastrointestinal tract FL, and pediatric-type follicular lymphoma have been served by careful follow-up without therapeutic intervention. Even high grade, aggressive, relapsed, or transformed FL may also be served with observation in patients who are asymptomatic. Findings in asymptomatic patients who have been recommended as triggers for starting treatment include one or more of the following: tumor size ≥7 cm in diameter; involvement of ≥3 nodes in 3 distinct areas, each of which is ≥3 cm in diameter; organ compression; presence of ascites or pleural effusion (i.e. build-up of fluid in the abdominal or pleural cavities); poor performance status due to the disease; elevated levels of serum lactose dehydrogenase or beta-2 microglobulin; presence of localized bone lesions; kidney involvement; reduced levels of circulating blood platelets or any of the various types of white blood cells; onset of significant pruritus (i.e. itching sensation) or other B symptoms; and enlargement (i.e. ≥50% increase in size over a period of at least 6 months) of lymph nodes, spleen, or other follicular lymphoma-infiltrated organs or tissues. = Symptomatic follicular lymphoma = Symptomatic FL requires treatments directed at relieving symptoms by reducing the load of tumor cells. Various chemotherapeutic regimens have been used for this including combinations of alkylating antineoplastic agents, nucleoside analogues, and/or anthracyclines. Two commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens are CVP (see Localized FL section) and CHOP (i.e. CVP plus the anthracycline adriamycin). Newer agents used to treat FL include monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, obinutuzumab, galiximab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, or epratuzumab and immunomodulators such as lenalidomide and interferon. The latter medications have been used in combination or alone to treat symptomatic FL. Most such regimens add rituximab (a monoclonal antibody which binds and thereby kills the CD20 cell surface protein on B cells) with CVP or CHOP regimens (termed R-CVP and R-CHOP regimens). The R-CHOP regimen appears superior to the R-CVP regimen with, for example, one study finding 8-year progression-free survival rates of 57% versus 46% for the two respective regimens. More recently, FL patients have been treated with other regimens including: 1) rituximab combined with the chemotherapeutic alkylating agent bendamustine; 2) rituximab combined with the chemotherapeutic agent fludarabine and the inhibitor of Type II topoisomerase, mitoxantrone; and 3) rituximab combined with another immunotherapeutic agent such as galiximab, epratuzumab (monoclonal antibodies directed respectively against the CD80 or CD22 cell surface proteins on immune cells including B cells), or the immunomodulating medication, lenalidomide. While it is too soon to judge the long-term results of the latter regimens, the regimens have shown similar results when analyzed based on poor treatment responses (~10-20% poor responses). Bendamustine with rituximab may be preferable to R-CHOP or R-CVP for treating low-grade (i.e. Grades 1, 2, and possibly 3A) FL; R-CHOP may be preferred in FL that has high-risk characteristics (e.g. high levels of Beta-2 macroglobulin or bone marrow involvement). The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab has shown good potential in treating indolent cases of FL. Studies indicate that maintenance therapy with rituximab following successful induction therapy prolongs progression-free survival; for example one study found progression-free survival after 6 years of treatment was 59.2% in patients treated with rituximab maintenance and 42.7% without this maintenance; however, overall survival at 6 years was similar in the two groups, 87.4% and 88.7%, respectively. Another study found that prolonged maintenance with rituximab did not have any benefits over an eight-month maintenance period. Finally, surgery and radiation are additional therapies that can be used to relieve symptoms caused by bulky t-FL disease or to treat lesions in patients who cannot withstand other types of treatment. = Transformed follicular lymphoma = Early studies on treating t-FL with various purely chemotherapy regimens gave poor results with median overall survival times of 1–2 years. However, the addition of rituximab to the regimens such as CVP and CHOP as part of induction and maintenance therapies (i.e. R-CVP and R-CHOP) greatly improved overall 5 year survival to rates of 73%. The R-CHOP regimen is a good option for treating such cases. However, these regimens need not be started in people with FL who are asymptomatic and have low tumor burdens: the outcomes in such patients show no difference between early versus delayed treatment. Some recent studies found that the use of rituximab in combination with bendamustine (i.e. the RB regimen) provided better results than R-CHOP: progression-free survival times in one study were 69.5 months for RB and 31.2 months for R-CHOP. Similar results were obtained when RB was compared to R-CVP. These studies also found no overall survival time benefit between the RB and R-CHOP regimens. Other recently examined regimens include 1) the use of obinutuzumab instead of rituximab in the R-CHOP and R-CVP regiments to attain progression-free survival rates at 3 years of 80% for the obinutuzumab- chemotherapy regimen versus 73% for the rituximab-chemotherapy regimen and 2) the combination of rituximab with lenalidomide (no chemotherapy agent) versus various chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (principally rituximab) to achieve similar complete remission and 3 year progression-free survival rates but with rituximab plus lenalidomide causing less toxicity (i.e. severe neutropenia). Many of these studies did use rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy.  Prevention  Several studies, while not conclusive, suggest that the early treatment of low risk FL reduces the incidence of the disease progressing to t-FL. The treatments used in these studies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy combinations plus rituximab maintenance therapy. = Relapsed follicular lymphoma = Patients who relapse after initial therapy for FL may be followed closely without therapy if asymptomatic. When treatment is required, patients may be treated with the initial treatment regimen when such treatment led to a remission that lasted for at least one year; otherwise an alternative regimen is used. The regimens commonly used in relapsed lymphoma include R-CHOP, R-CVP, RFM (i.e. rituximab, fludarabine, and mitoxantrone), and RB (Bendamustine plus rituximab). Patients who suffer early treatment failure (e.g. within 1–2 years of initial treatment) or multiple relapses have also been treated with either autologous (i.e. stem cells taken from patient) or allogeneic (i.e. stem cells taken from a donor) stem cell bone marrow transplantation. While studies are inconclusive, autologous stem cell bone marrow transplantation appears to prolong survival in early treatment failure patients who are healthy enough to withstand this therapy. Unfit patients may benefit from initial treatment with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine followed by maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab (if they have not been treated previously with obinutuzumab). Other mostly experimental treatments currently under study in patients with multiple treatment failures include: 1) Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors such as copanlisib, duvelisib, and idelalisib which block the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway that promotes the survival, proliferation, and other potentially malignant behaviors of cells; 2) infusion of tisagenlecleucel chimeric antigen receptor T cells (i.e. CAR T cells) (i.e. T cells that have been isolated from patients, engineered to express a receptor for the CD19 protein on, and thereby kill, T cells, and then infused back into the donor patient); 3) Bruon's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, to block the B-cell maturating actions of this kianase; 4) BCL inhibitor venetoclax to block Bcl2's action in promoting B-cell survival and proliferation; 5) histone deacetylase inhibitors abexinostat and tazemetostat to modify the expression of various genes; and 6) Checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab, pidilizumab, and pembrolizumab to promote the immune system's ability to suppress cancer cell growth. In preliminary studies on FL patients who were known or thought to be refractor to more conventional therapies these drugs, when combined with more conventional drugs, particularly rituximab, produced promising results. Phosphoionsitide 3-kinase inhibitors produced overall response rates of 10-12.5 months in 42-59%; tisagenlecleuce cells produced an overall progression-free response rate of 70% after a follow-up of 28 months; phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors produced overall response rates of ~40% and complete response rates of 1-20%; Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor produced overall and complete response rates of 38% and 18%, respectively; the Bcl inhibitor produce overall and complete response rates of 33% and 14%, respectively; histone deacetylase inhibitors produce overall response rates of 35%-71%; and checkpoint inhibitors produce overall response rates of 40%-80% and complete response rates of 10-60%.

It is a fantasy-musical film, with the music and lyrics written by Ray himself. This is the first film of the Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne series, followed by a couple of sequels - Hirak Rajar Deshe was released in 1980 and Goopy Bagha Phire Elo, written by Ray but directed by his son Sandip Ray, was released in 1992. The film was based on the characters Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne, who made their first appearance in the Sandesh magazine in 1915, with illustrations by Ray's grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. In 1961, after the revival of Sandesh, Ray began contemplating the idea of making a film based on that story, and he was partly compelled by his son Sandip to make a film which was less 'grim and adult'. This was matched by Ray's own desire to make a movie that, unlike his previous movies, would cater to children. Plus this would also give him an opportunity to lace the story with music and dancing, a point his movies' producers and distributors were always insisting upon. Ray managed to convince producers to finance the movie, even though it was clear from the beginning that the film would cost a lot of money. The movie released to great critical and commercial reception, which held the record for longest continuous run of a Bengali-language movie in Bengal, as it ran for 51 straight weeks. It won the Best Feature Film and Best Direction awards at the 16th National Film Awards, and went on to win many other international awards as well. Critical reception was highly positive. Raja Sen called it to be the most innovative movie to have ever come out of India. Phil Hall said that the movie \\"comes as a delightful surprise – Ray, it appears, not only possessed a great sense of humor but also enjoyed a stunning talent for musical cinema.\\" Story The story revolves around Gopinath Gyne alias Goopy, (Tapen Chatterjee), the son of a poor grocer Kanu Kyne from a village called Amloki. Goopy wants to become a singer but unfortunately, he sings terribly without melody, rhythm or tune. The village elders wanting to have fun, persuade him to sing for the king in the early morning hours right under His Majesty's bed room window. Goopy does so and is driven out of Amloki on a donkey for waking up the king with his terrible singing. Exiled into a forest, he meets Bagha Bayen (Rabi Ghosh), another exile from nearby village Hortuki. Bagha has been exiled for playing the drum badly. They soon make a team after encountering a tiger and start singing and drumming, initially to scare off the tiger, but in the process attract a group of ghosts who are fascinated by their music. Happy with their performance, the king of the ghosts (Bhooter Raja) grants them three boons, all of which are only available to both all the time (they cannot use them individually). * They can get food and clothes whenever needed by clapping one hand with each other. * They are given a pair of magic slippers with which they can travel anywhere (again, they need to clap one hand with each other while wearing the shoes and say the name of the place they want to go to). * They become flawless musicians and gain the ability to hold people in awe (literally, their music renders people motionless) with their music. The pair travel to Shundi, where a benevolent king appoints them court musicians. However, the king of Halla (the long lost twin brother of the king of Shundi and both played by (Santosh Dutta), is planning to attack Shundi, after being poisoned by his chief minister (Jahor Roy) with the help of a magic potion that makes him evil. He is aided by a senile sorcerer (Harindranath Chattopadhyay),who recipes that evil potion and also the potion that has made all the Shundi people mute. Goopy and Bagha travel to Halla in an attempt to prevent the attack, but are captured instead. They also lose their slippers when captured and hence cannot escape the jail by magic, but manage to do so by strategy of luring the famished gatekeeper (Nripati Chatterjee) with delicious foods. They arrive singing and drumming when the soldiers are about to launch their attack, rendering the army motionless. Next, they wish for unlimited food and sweets which rain from the sky on the starving soldiers who forget the battle and settle for filling the bellies. Not only this, their singing takes off the evil effects of the potion given to the King of Halla, who drops the idea of capturing Shundi, and reunites happily with his brother. For averting the war, the two kings of Shundi and Halla respectively marry their daughters to Goopy and Bagha.

Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were supposed to star in lead roles in the movie. However, things did not turn out well between him and Columbia Pictures, and the project was shelved. Unable to make a fantasy movie in Hollywood, Ray decided to make one in India instead. He intended to reach a wider audience with this movie, prompted in part by the lukewarm box office performance of his previous movies Kapurush, Mahapurush and Nayak. R.D Bansal, who had produced those movies, became even less enthusiastic when he learnt of the film's estimated budget, and, as Ray told Marie Seton in December 1967, he spent the remainder of 1967 scouting for finance, and almost reduced to the same situation as he had been during shooting Pather Panchali. Finally towards the end of 1967, Nepal Dutta and Asim Dutta of Purnima Pictures agreed to lend some financial help. But since it was not substantial enough to shoot the entire movie in color, Ray decided to do it in black and white and show only the final scene in color. =Development and filming= The film's pivotal sequence was a six and a half-minute dance, divided into four numbers, performed by the ghosts of the forest in front of Goopy and Bagha. The numbers were intertwined into a phantasmagoria of contrasting styles and moods. Ray settled on four classes of ghosts keeping in line with the four common classes in the social hierarchy in Hinduism, \\"since we have so many class divisions, the ghosts should have the same.\\" Thus came to be included the king and warriors, sahibs, fat people and the common people. Ray decided that the music ought to have \\"some order, form and precision\\", instead of being just being \\"a wooly, formless kind of thing\\". He remembered a South Indian classical form he had once heard in the Delhi Film Festival, which used 12 musical instruments, of which he selected four. He deliberately avoided melody, because \\"melody suggests a kind of sophistication\\". Each class, except the sahibs, was played by actors appropriately dressed and made-up, the sahibs were shadow-puppets expertly under-cranked to create the illusion. The dance culminates with the four classes positioned vertically, with the priests at the bottom and the common people at the top, in contrast with the traditional class hierarchy. Ray imagined the caste system upside down in reaction to the evolving nature of power.

Dennis Schwartz wrote that \\"Its only fault is that I thought it was too lengthy to hold the attention of children. But the appealing film dazzles with Ray's lively score that's carried out very well by the film's stars.\\" Lindsay Anderson said that it had got lovely things in it, but it went on for too long. A critic, writing for The Guardian, said that this was \\"Satyajit Ray at his least convincing\\". The Observer wrote that \\"perhaps it would appeal to singularly unfidgety children\\". The Times observed, \\"Ray is a true poet of the cinema, but he finds his poetry in everyday reality; in all- out fantasy he seems somewhat prosaic\\". It was, however, a smash hit at home. Ray later wrote to Marie Seton, \\"It is extraordinary how quickly it has become part of popular culture. Really there isn't a single child who doesn't know and sing the songs\\".

He had received many requests to make the fourth Goopy - Bagha movie. Ray said to The Times of India about the plot of fourth film: \\"Making a Goopy Bagha movie without Tapen and Rabi is unthinkable.

Biography  =Education= Born Timothy Andrew James Souster in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire , Souster was educated at Bedford Modern School (from 1952 through 1961) and New College, Oxford (from 1961 through 1964). His teachers included Bernard Rose, Sir David Lumsden and Egon Wellesz. In 1964, he attended summer courses at Darmstadt taught by Karlheinz Stockhausen, and took composition lessons with Richard Rodney Bennett the following year (; ). Before the end of 1965, Souster was a producer with the BBC Third Programme, and put on many performances of contemporary music by composers such as Boulez, Berio, Barraqué, Cardew, Feldman, Henze and Stockhausen (; ) After leaving the BBC in 1967, he began to devote more time to composing and songwriting . = Foray into electronic music = In the late 1960s Souster began experimenting with electronics. His first acknowledged composition involving electronic techniques was Titus Groan Music (1969) for wind quintet, ring modulator, amplifiers and tape. In August of the same year he moved to King's College, Cambridge and formed a live-electronic group with Roger Smalley, Andrew Powell and Robin Thompson called Intermodulation . As well as compositions by Souster and Smalley, the group performed contemporary music by Cardew, Riley, Rzewski, Stockhausen and Wolff . = Later years = In 1971, Souster became a teaching assistant to Stockhausen in Cologne, and in 1973 he moved to Berlin where he remained for two years. In 1975 Souster returned to England to take up a research fellowship at Keele University . He remained in England for the rest of his life, except for a six-month stint in California in 1978 (; ). He died after a brief, sudden illness on 1 March 1994 .

The elections took place under a list system, whereby voters chose from a list of parties and coalitions. 230 seats were apportioned among Iraq's 18 governorates based on the number of registered voters in each as of the January 2005 elections, including 59 seats for Baghdad Governorate.local election results The seats within each governorate were allocated to lists through a system of Proportional Representation. An additional 45 \\"compensatory\\" seats were allocated to those parties whose percentage of the national vote total (including out of country votes) exceeds the percentage of the 275 total seats that they have been allocated. Women were required to occupy 25% of the 275 seats.BBC NEWS  Middle East  Guide to Iraq's election The change in the voting system would give more weight to Arab Sunni voters, who make up most of the voters in several provinces. It was expected that these provinces would thus return mostly Sunni Arab representatives, after most Sunnis boycotted the last election. Turnout was high (70%). The White House was encouraged by the relatively low levels of violence during polling,Iraqis flock to polls as insurgents urge Sunnis to vote  World news  The Guardian with one insurgent group making good on a promised election day moratorium on attacks, even going so far as to guard the voters from attack.Iraqi Vote Draws Big Turnout Of Sunnis President Bush frequently pointed to the election as a sign of progress in rebuilding Iraq. However, post-election violence threatened to plunge the nation into civil war, before the situation began to calm in 2007. The election results themselves produced a shaky coalition government headed by Nouri al-Maliki.  Full results  Final uncertified results were released by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq on Friday 20 January 2006. Certified results are expected to be released within two weeks, after the adjudication of any appeals and after lists have submitted the names of people who will take the seats.military bases international usb serial at ieciraq.org See also : Members of the 1st Iraqi Council of Representatives  New government  After six months of negotiations a \\"government of national unity\\" was agreed between the United Iraqi Alliance, Iraqi Accord Front, Kurdistani Alliance and Iraqi National List, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.  Impact of election  Iraqis in the predominantly Sunni city of Husaybah, wait in lines to vote, during the national election, December 15. Just a few weeks earlier, Soldiers and Marines battled insurgents in this city, located along the Syrian border. Iraqis wait in line to vote The election is expected to have a significant impact on the politics of Iraq. Most significant developments are expected to be: = Removal of coalition soldiers from Iraq = According to an opinion poll carried out for the British Ministry of Defence in August 2005 by Iraqi university researchers and leaked to the British press, 82 per cent of Iraqis are strongly opposed to the presence of US and other coalition troops and less than one per cent believe that the coalition troops are responsible for any improvement in security.ZNet - Beyond the Ballot = Broadening of political space = This election will see the participation of two important groups - the Sunnis and the Sadrists - who did not participate significantly in the prior legislative elections. The domestic component of the insurgency has been linked to both groups. = Debate over Federalism and Secession = The elected Council of Representatives will have the difficult task of ratifying a constitution. The initial debate is likely to focus on the power of a centralized government versus a more localised power structure, in particular including policies surrounding oil and other natural resources, security and civil services. = Increased choice within communities = All three main communities will go into these elections with at least two significant coalitions to choose from. Parties have split from both the main Shi'a and Kurdish coalitions and two lists from the Sunni community are tipped to win significant support in that community. = Anti- incumbency vote = The main competition in the last election within the majority Shi'a community was between the secular outgoing Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi, and the United Iraqi Alliance which was backed by the religious authorities. This time the religious authorities have refused to back the Alliance and this may be influential in persuading some Shi'a to consider supporting Allawi. However, religious voters may prefer to vote for Sadr rather than casting their vote for Allawi, who is considered pro-American. = Averting a Civil War = Some predicted that if there was not a balance of representation between Sunnis and Shias, that the country was at risk of increased insurgency and perhaps civil war. The current insurgency, lacking the command and control infrastructure needed for large scale military operations, is not equipped to stage more than a haphazard guerrilla campaign. The withdrawal of 150,000 U.S. and British troops on the ground in Iraq, as desired by about 82 percent of Iraqis, is likely to remove motivation for internal Iraqi conflict, since only about one percent of Iraqis believe that the coalition troops are responsible for any improvements in security in Iraq. According to an interview with Rajaa al-Bhayesh, a political scientist at Baghdad's Mustansiriya University, fear of wider civil conflict—beyond the likely continuation of violence by fringe groups like al Qaeda—is likely to promote the spirit of compromise.High Voter Turnout in Iraq Promises Fully Representative Parliament  Parties and coalitions  Election results map with provinces where the Iraqi Accord Front was the largest coalition depicted in orange, provinces where the United Iraqi Alliance was the largest coalition depicted in green and countries were the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was the largest depicted in lime. The deadline for registering parties and coalitions closed on 28 October. The Electoral Commission announced that 228 lists had been registered, including 21 coalitions. The emerging Iraqi political scene has been marked by groups of established parties running on joint lists, often grouped on sectarian or ethnic grounds. These lists are not necessarily stable, as the parties sharing a list may be past or present rivals; the situation will be even more complicated for the December 2005 election because parties can form different alliances in different governorates. The landscape is currently fluid; what follows is a list of some of the more important parties and coalitions, with a focus on alliances that have shifted since the January 2005 election. = United Iraqi Alliance (#555) = This coalition, dominated by Shi'ite parties, was formed to contest the January 2005 election with the blessing of Ayatollah Ali al- Sistani, the most senior Shi'ite cleric based in Iraq. It won the most votes in that election and became the senior partner in the coalition government that ran Iraq for most of 2005. The UIA's main components were: *The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) led by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim and the transitional Deputy President Adel Abdul Mahdi *The Islamic Dawa Party led by transitional Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari *The Iraqi National Congress of Ahmed Chalabi *The Islamic Virtue Party, which includes the Governor of Basra, Mohammed al-Waili *Iraqi Hezbollah, led by former Iraqi Governing Council member Sheikh Abdel-Karim Mahoud al-Mohammedawi, who led the rebellion by the Marsh Arabs against Saddam Hussein. *A number of independent politicians, including some supporters of Moqtada al-Sadr (although other Sadr supporters formed the National Independent Cadres and Elites party). In advance of the December 2005 elections, Moqtada al-Sadr's party chose to join the Alliance. However, the Iraqi National Congress and Iraqi Hezbollah left the Alliance to form their own lists. In a blow to the Alliance, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani announced that he would not back any particular party for the election; he merely encouraged people to vote \\"according to their beliefs.\\" He is said to have been disappointed with the performance of the transitional government. It was initially reported before the election that the UIA seats would be split between the parties as follows: *Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) - 30 places *Moqtada al-Sadr's party - 30 places *Islamic Dawa Party - 29 places *Islamic Virtue Party - 14 places *others - 15 places Analysis of the seat allocation after the elections showed that the 109 district seats and 19 compensatory seats won by the UIA were split as follows: *Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and Badr - 21 + 15 *Moqtada al-Sadr's party - 25 + 3 *Islamic Virtue Party - 14 + 1 *Islamic Dawa Party - 13 *Islamic Dawa Party - Iraq Organisation - 12 *independents and others - 24 Informed Comment: January 2006 = The Kurdistan Alliance (#730) = This Kurdish-dominated coalition was formed for the January 2005 election by the two main Kurdish parties—the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Kurdistan Region President Masoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan of the transitional Iraqi President Jalal Talabani—plus some other smaller parties. The DPAK formed a coalition government with the UIA in the wake of the January 2005 elections. This coalition will also contest the December elections, but the smaller Kurdistan Islamic Union, who won 10 percent of the seats in the Dahuk and Sulaymaniyah governorate elections in January, has announced that it will form its own governmental lists. = Iraqi National List (#731) = The Iraqi List was established by Iyad Allawi, who served as interim Prime Minister before the January 2005 election. It is dominated by his Iraqi National Accord party. For the December 2005 election, it has joined forces with former interim President Ghazi al-Yawar's The Iraqis list, the People's Union list (which is dominated by the Iraqi Communist Party), and the Sunni Arab politician Adnan Pachachi and his Assembly of Independent Democrats to form a single list called the Iraqi National List. This list will attempt to present a secular and trans-community alternative to the other major lists, which are more based on the support of a single ethnic or religious groups. = Iraqi Accord Front (#618) = The Iraqi Islamic Party originally registered for the January elections but then decided to boycott the polls, which meant that it did not gain any seats. It has decided to participate in the December elections, forming a list called the Iraqi Accord Front with two other smaller parties, the Iraqi Peoples' Gathering and the Iraqi National Dialogue. These parties aim to tap the Sunni Arab vote; Sunni Arabs overwhelmingly boycotted the January election, but increased Sunni participation in the constitutional referendum may indicate an increased Sunni turnout for the December elections, especially because more than 1,000 Sunni clerics called on their followers to vote, according to the New York Times.https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Iraq.html?pagewanted=2 However, the Association of Muslim Scholars, which is influential in the Sunni community, has called for a boycott of the December elections, which could have an adverse impact on the Iraqi Accord Front's success. = Other lists = *National Peace List (#635) Led by Laith Kubba, the spokesman of the current Iraqi PM, Ibrahim Al-Jaafari *Arabic List (#615) *Independent Karbala Coalition (#533) - A Shi'ite group based in Karbala *Brotherhood and Peace List (#737) *National Congress Coalition (#569) - Made up of the Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress and some smaller groups including the monarchist Iraqi Constitutional Monarchy. Justice Minister Abdel Hussein Shandal has also joined this block. The list is mostly Shi'ite, but with some Sunnis. *Al- Risaliyun (#631), “The Upholders of the Message” (or “Message Party” or “Progressives” in the IECI translation). This is a list of Sadrists that do not support the UIA and was backed by one of al-Sadr’s collaborators, sheikh Abdul-Hadi al-Darraji. *Yazidi Movement for Reform and Progress (#668). Yazidi minority party. *Islamic Coalition (#549) *Justice and Future Coalition (#517) *Al Nahrain National List (#752) - An Iraqi Christian list *Al Wafaa For Basrah Gathering (#512) *Iraqi National Dialogue Front (#667) - A mainly Sunni coalition, unlike the accord it is avowedly secular and opposed to the new constitution. It is led by Saleh al-Mutlak, who was a leader of Sunni opposition to the new constitution. *Furation-Human Rights (#647) *Mithal Al Aloosi List For Iraqi Nation (#620) *Watanion Gathering (#814) *Iraq Sun (#652) *Al Khalas National Front (#798) *Iraq Turkmen Front (#630) *Unified National List (#829) *Iraqi Free Progressive Party (#568). Its leader, Iraqi Sunni politician Mizhar Dulaimi was shot dead while campaigning in Ramadi on December 13. The previous night, he had appeared on television urging Sunnis to take part in the elections. *Assembly of Independent Iraqis (#565) . A secular resistance-supporter list led by former electricity minister Dr. Ayham al-Samarie.  Fraud allegations  A group of Iraqi citizens walking down a path showing their purple fingers, signifying that they had voted. On December 22, 2005 Sunni Arab and secular Shiite factions demanded that an international body review election fraud complaints, and threatened to boycott the new legislature. The United Nations rejected the idea. Large demonstrations broke out across Iraq on December 23, 2005 to denounce the parliamentary elections. Protesters said that the elections were rigged in favor of the main religious Shiite coalition. Many Iraqis outside the religious Shiite coalition allege that the elections were unfair to smaller Sunni Arab and secular Shiite groups. As many as 20,000 people demonstrated after noon prayers in southern Baghdad. Over 2,000 people demonstrated in Mosul, accusing Iran of involvement in the election. Sheik Mahmoud al-Sumaidaei of the Association of Muslim Scholars, a major Sunni clerical group, told followers during prayers at Baghdad's Umm al-Qura mosque that they were \\"living a conspiracy built on lies and forgery.\\" Violence grew over the controversial election results. Car bombings and attacks on US and Iraqi officials continued after the elections. In Mosul Qusay Salahaddin, a Sunni Arab student leader was abducted and killed after leading a demonstration against the election results. Some 2,000 fellow students gathered at the mosque where Salahaddin's body was taken. Sunni's quickly accused militia forces loyal to one of the main parties in the Shiite Alliance bloc for Salahaddin's death. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the murder.At least 20 dead in Iraq violence - Conflict in Iraq- nbcnews.com  References   External links  *Uncertified results released January 20, 2006 (on the website of the Iraqi Election Commission) *Election Law (from the Election Commission website *Apportionment of 230 seats among the 18 Governorates *Pakistan Daily Times *Iraqi Election Commission Fact Sheet Iraq the Model goes deep inside the Iraqi election *An Average Iraqi look at the Possible Winners *Iraqi Voters Choose First Permanent Constitutional Government * Straw poll shows close race in Iraq *Iraq takes another step down a long, hard road, The Economist, December 16, 2005 * *Shiites, Kurds Lead in Polls *Christian slate wins narrow plurality in U.S. expat voting Category:2005 elections in Iraq Category:Elections in Iraq Category:December 2005 events in Asia ","title":"December 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election"},{"id":"3035017","text":"1932 election posterThe Christian Social People's Service () was a Protestant conservative political party in the Weimar Republic. The CSVD was founded in December 1929 through the merger of two Protestant political formations: the Christlich-soziale Reichsvereinigung (Christian Social Reich Association) and the Christlicher Volksdienst (Christian People's Service). Both had emerged from dissatisfaction amongst Protestants towards the developments within the German National People's Party (DNVP). The two groups differed on many issues, such as the role of the Republic, but were able to keep organizational unity. The CSVD portrayed itself as a Protestant version of the Catholic Centre and was mainly supported by middle-class elements. In the main they were considered to be part of the moderate tendency within the DNVP, as opposed to the radical nationalist leadership of Alfred Hugenberg.Richard Bessel & E.J. Feuchtwanger, Social Change and Political Development in Weimar Germany, Croom Helm, 1981, , p. 277 The CSVD contested the 1930 and 1932 parliamentary elections; the party CSVD formed a joint parliamentary group with the Christlich-Nationale Bauern- und Landvolkpartei (Christian National Peasants' and Rural Peoples Party) in the Reichstag. After the Nazi take-over in 1933, the CSVD was dissolved. The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Gustav Heinemann (1969–74) was a member of CSVD during the Weimar Republic.

It is often referred to as the Sorokovka in Soviet service.ibid. It is also the first mass-produced Soviet APC. It was eventually replaced in the APC role by the BTR-152 and in the scout car role by the BRDM-1. Development history The BTR-40's development began in early 1947 at the design bureau of the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (Gorkovsky Automobile Factory) under the leadership of V. A. Dedkov. The concept was a successor to the BA-64B armoured car which went out of production in 1946. The design team also included L. W. Kostikin and P.I. Muziukin. Two prototypes designated BTR-141 were completed in 1947. The first was armed with two coaxial 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns on a rotatable mount which was protected by armour plate at the front and sides. The second had no fixed armament. Neither one was accepted for service. In 1950 two new prototypes were produced. Those had a different shape of armour including an upright rear armour. Again one prototype had no fixed armament and the second was armed with two coaxial 14.5 mm KPVT heavy machine guns. These were accepted into service as BTR-40 and BTR-40A respectively. The vehicle's drawbacks, such as its poor cross-country performance and problems with crossing water obstacles, compelled the design team to produce, in late 1954, what was planned to be an amphibious variant of the BTR-40. It received the designation BTR-40P (with the 'P' standing for plavayushchiy – \\"floating\\"). During the design process, the vehicle moved away from the APC concept and became an amphibious armoured scout car. It received a new designation, BRDM. Description =Overview= The BTR-40's design was based on the GAZ-63 four wheel drive truck which went into production in 1946. The design featured a self-bearing body which was a new feature in Soviet vehicles. The hull has two side doors for the commander and driver and a back door. The vehicle can transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers or 1 tonne of cargo. =Protection= The BTR-40's armour is from 6 mm to 8 mm thick which gives it protection from small arms fire and the shell splinters of its time, but does not protect it against modern artillery fragments and .50-calibre machine gun fire. The BTR-40-series tyres are not protected by armour. They are particularly vulnerable to puncture from fire of all kinds. The vehicle has no roof and is normally covered with a tarpaulin to protect the crew, transported cargo or troops from rain and snow. However this makes it unable to mount any of the SGMB machine guns. =Armament= The APC variant has no permanent armament but it has pintle mounts for three 7.62 mm SGMB medium machine guns, one at the front of the troop compartment and the other two at the sides. The vehicle also has two firing ports on both sides of the hull which allow up to four soldiers to use their weapons while being protected by the APC's armour. =Maneuverability= Like the GAZ-63 truck on which it is based on, the BTR-40 has a four-wheel drive. The chassis, however, is shorter compared to the GAZ-63. The only other thing that distinguishes the chassis of the BTR-40 from that of the GAZ-63 are additional shock absorbers. The BTR-40 also has a more powerful engine. The turning angle is 7.5 m. =Equipment= The vehicle has the 10RT-12 receiving and airing radio which has a range of 20–25 km and a winch at the front, with a maximum capacity of 4.5 tonnes and 70 m of cable. It has no protection against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons. It also has no night vision equipment. Service history =Soviet Union= A Soviet BTR-40 in Budapest during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 The BTR-40 was produced at the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (Gorkovsky Automobile Factory) from 1950 to 1960. It was first shown publicly at the military parade in Moscow in 1950. It was issued to the Red Army in 1950 and was used in the APC, reconnaissance and command post roles. After several years of service, it became apparent that it did not fit the modern battlefield. It was replaced by the BTR-152. Ex-Egyptian BTR-40 captured by the royalist guerrillas during the North Yemen Civil War =Foreign service= The BTR-40 began to enter service with two other Warsaw Pact members in late 1949, namely East Germany and Poland, where it was used as a standard APC until more advanced vehicles like the BTR-152 were available. The last BTR-40s were withdrawn from Warsaw Pact countries in the early 1970s. The vehicle was also sold to many Arab and African nations in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The People's Republic of China (PRC), had developed a copy of the BTR-40 called the Type 55. It is unknown how many of these vehicles entered service with the PLA. The vehicle was also exported to North Korea, probably as part of a military assistance programme during the Korean War, where it saw combat for the first time. It was later used by the North Vietnamese Army during the Vietnam War.\\"North Vietnamese Armor\\" BTR-40 also saw combat service during the North Yemen Civil War during which at least one was captured from the Egyptians by the royalist guerrillas. =List of conflicts= * 1956 – Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (Soviet Union) * 1955–1975 – Vietnam War (Vietnam) * 1962-1970 – North Yemen Civil War (Egypt) * 1966–1991 – South African Border War (Angola, Cuba) * 1967 – Six-Day War (Egypt, Syria) * 1968 – Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (Soviet Union) * 1969 – Sino-Soviet border conflict (Soviet Union) * 1970–1975 Cambodian Civil War (Cambodia) * 1973 – Yom Kippur War (Egypt, Syria) * 1974–1991 – Ethiopian Civil War ** 1961–1991 – Eritrean War for Independence * 1975–1990 – Lebanese Civil War * 1975–1991 – Western Sahara War (Polisario) * 1975–2002 – Angolan Civil War (Angola) * 1977–1978 – Ogaden War (Somalia) * 1978–1987 – Chadian–Libyan conflict * 1979–1988 – Soviet–Afghan War (Soviet Union, Afghanistan) * 1982 – 1982 Ethiopian–Somali Border War Variants =Former USSR= BTR-40B * BTR-141 (1947) – The original prototype with a faceted rear hull had two variants. The first was armed with twin ZPTU-2 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine guns placed in a rotary platform with armour protection at the front and sides. The second version had no permanent armament but later became the BTR-40. ** BTR-40 (1950) – Original production model. *** BTR-40A (1950) – BTR-40 converted into a SPAAG armed with twin ZPTU-2 14.5 mm twin anti-aircraft gun (2400 rounds) in a turret, later also used in the BTR-152A, manually operated by a single soldier. The turret is placed inside the troop compartment. It can make a full turn and its guns can elevate between -5 and +80 degrees. This variant does not have the firing ports in the hull sides. *** BTR-40V (1956) – BTR-40 fitted with an external tyre pressure regulation system. *** BTR-40B (1957) – BTR-40V with an armoured roof with four hatches. The vehicle has a filtering/ventilation system, NBC protection system and central tyre pressure regulation system. It also has a pintle mount for a 12.7 mm or 14.5 mm heavy machine gun, although the standard version of the BTR-40B had no fixed armament. It was designed for use as a reconnaissance vehicle. Crew was reduced from 2 + 8 passengers to 2 + 6. *** BTR-40Kh – NBC reconnaissance vehicle. *** BTR-40ZhD (1959) – BTR-40 equipped with small rail wheels mounted to the front and rear of the vehicle on special supports. *** BRDM-1 – Armoured car which uses a number of BTR-40 components. Originally planned to be an amphibious variant of the BTR-40 and therefore it received the designation BTR-40P. =The People's Republic of China= * Type 55 – Chinese copy of the BTR-40. Possibly also a designation for the Soviet- supplied BTR-40s. =Cuba= * BTR-40A-AA – A Cuban air defence vehicle. It uses the chassis and the armoured front of the BTR-40 but the troop compartment has been removed in favour of a square sided platform mount with drop down sides and rear on which twin ZPTU-2 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine guns are placed. * BTR-40A-PB – A Cuban BTR-40 armed with an anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) launcher. While travelling, the launcher is hidden in the superstructure so that from a distance, the vehicle cannot be easily distinguished from a normal BTR-40. The superstructure also provides the launcher with armour protection. When in position, the roof of the superstructure is opened sideways and the launcher is elevated. * Jababli – Is a Cuban BTR-40 fitted with a 3M11 Falanga (AT-2 Swatter) ATGM launcher on a launch platform in a cut-down superstructure. Only a limited number were built. NATO gave it the designation M1975/4. =Former East Germany= * SPW-40 – The East German designation for a BTR-40. ** SPW-40A – The East German designation for a BTR-40A. ** SPW-40Ch – The East German designation for a BTR-40Kh. ** SPW-40 converted into a tank destroyer armed with an elevatable ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 Malyutka ATGMs with an armoured roof over it in a cut down troop compartment. This variant does not have the firing ports in the hull sides. =Indonesia= * BTR-40 converted into an armoured car armed with a medium machine gun in a cube-shaped turret on top of the superstructure inside the troop compartment. It also has four smoke grenade launchers on both sides of the hull. * BTR-40 converted into an armoured car armed with a 40 mm gun in an angular turret on top of the superstructure inside the troop compartment, it also has four smoke grenade dischargers on both sides of the hull.

Nicolas Fréret (; 15 February 1688 – 8 March 1749) was a French scholar. Life He was born at Paris on 15 February 1688. His father was procureur to the parlement of Paris, and destined him to the profession of the law. His first tutors were the historian Charles Rollin and Father Desmolets (1677-1760). Amongst his early studies history, chronology and mythology held a prominent place. To please his father he studied law and began to practise at the bar; but the force of his genius soon carried him onto his own path. At nineteen he was admitted to a society of learned men before whom he read memoirs on the religion of the Greeks, on the worship of Bacchus, of Ceres, of Cybele, and of Apollo. He was hardly twenty-six years of age when he was admitted as pupil to the Academy of Inscriptions. One of the first memoirs which he read was a learned and critical discourse, Sur l'origine des Francs (1714). He maintained that the Franks were a league of South German tribes and not, according to the legend then almost universally received, a nation of free men deriving from Greece or Troy, who had kept their civilization intact in the heart of a barbarous country. These views excited great indignation in the Abbé Vertot, who denounced Freret to the government as a libeller of the monarchy. A lettre de cachet was issued, and Freret was sent to the Bastille. During his three months of confinement he studied Xenophon, the fruit of which appeared later in his memoir on the Cyropaedia. From the time of his liberation in March 1715 his life was uneventful. In January 1716 he was received as associate of the Academy of Inscriptions and in December 1742 he was made perpetual secretary. He worked without intermission for the interests of the Academy, not even claiming any property in his own writings, which were printed in the Recueil de l'academie des inscriptions. Works Sciences et arts, 1796 The list of his memoirs, many of them posthumous, occupies four columns of the Nouvelle Biographie générale. They treat of history, chronology, geography, mythology and religion. Throughout he appears as the keen, learned and original critic; examining into the comparative value of documents, distinguishing between the mythical and the historical, and separating traditions with an historical element from pure fables and legends. He rejected the extreme pretensions of the chronology of Egyptian origin for the Chinese civilisation and characters,Danielle ELISSEEFF, Moi Arcade, interprète du roi-soleil, ed. Arthaud, Paris, 1985. See Ch.XII, p.100 & 101\\\\. Fréret is oppose to Fourmont's theories who back the Chinese culture to Noe's children, Egyptian origins, and Hebraic language. and at the same time controverted the scheme of Sir Isaac Newton as too limited. He investigated the mythology not only of the Greeks, but of the Celts, the Germans, the Chinese and the Indians. He was a vigorous opponent of the theory (euhemerism) that the stories of mythology may be referred to historic originals. He also suggested that Greek mythology owed much to the Phoenicians and Egyptians. He was one of the first scholars of Europe to undertake the study of the Chinese language, under the guidance of Arcadio Huang, a Chinese man working as translator and librarian for king Louis XIV;Cañizares-Esguerra, p.105 and in this he was engaged at the time of his committal to the Bastille. He died in Paris on 8 March 1749. After his death several works of an atheistic character were falsely attributed to him, and were long believed to be his. The most famous of these are the Examen critique des apologistes de la religion chrétienne (1766), and the Lettre de Thrasybule à Leucippe, printed in London about 1768. A very defective and inaccurate edition of Fréret's works was published in 1796-1799. A new and complete edition was projected by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, but of this only the first volume appeared (1825). It contains a life of Fréret. His manuscripts, after passing through many hands, were deposited in the library of the Institute. The best account of his works is Examen critique des ouvrages composes par Fréret in C. A. Walckenaer's Recueil des notices, &c.; (1841-1850). See also Quérard's France litteraire.

The main economic activities on the island are farming and cattle raising. Geography Cheduba Island lies about from the southwestern coast of Ramree Island. It is located between 18° 40′ and 18° 56′ N. lat., and between 93° 31′ and 93° 50′ E. long. The terrain of the island is quite flat with scattered moderate elevations. The highest point is on a ridge in the southwestern part of the island. There are 5 villages connected by a road that circles the island: Owa, Thitpon, Manaung, Budaunggwe, Sachet and Meinmangwe. There is an airfield west of Manaung, the main village of Cheduba, located on the northeast coast. Manaung is linked to the village of Kyaukpyu on nearby Ramree Island by steamer. Most of the vegetation is tropical rainforest. There are mud cones that emit steam and sulfurous fumes on the island, which indicate some volcanic activity.

Historical records show that an earthquake of a magnitude of 8.5 to 9.0 hit off the western coast of Myanmar in April 1762, and reports speculated that a tsunami could kill more than one million people in Myanmar and Bangladesh. In 1881, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake in the Bay of Bengal caused \\"broad massive flames of fire\\" to be emitted on the island. In the 1780s, after the Burmese conquest of the area, Cheduba became a province of Arakan. Cheduba was captured in 1824 by the British, whose possession of it was confirmed in 1826 by the Treaty of Yandabo concluded with the Burmese.

As of 2019, the largest insurance brokers in the world by revenue are Marsh & McLennan, Aon plc, Willis Towers Watson, Arthur J. Gallagher and Hub International. In the United Kingdom Insurance broker became a regulated term under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 which was designed to thwart the bogus practices of firms holding themselves as brokers but in fact acting as representative of one or more favoured insurance companies. The term now has no legal definition following the repeal of the 1977 Act. The sale of general insurance was regulated by the Financial Services Authority from 14 January 2005 until 31 March 2013 and by the Financial Conduct Authority since 1 April 2013. Any person or firm authorized by the Authority can now call themselves an insurance broker. Insurance brokerage is largely associated with general insurance (car, house etc.) rather than life insurance, although some brokers continued to provide investment and life insurance brokerage until the onset of new regulation in 2001. This drove a more transparent regime, based predominantly on upfront negotiation of a fee for the provision of advice and/or services. This saw the splitting of intermediaries into two groups: general insurance intermediaries/brokers and independent financial advisers (IFAs) for life insurance, investments and pensions. General insurance brokering is carried out today by many types of authorized organisations including traditional high street brokers and telephone or web-based firms. In the United States Accidents will happen (William H. Watson, 1922) is a slapstick silent film about the methods and mishaps of an American insurance broker. Collection EYE Film Institute Netherlands. In the United States, insurance brokers are regulated by the individual U.S. states. Most states require anyone who sells, solicits, or negotiates insurance in that state to obtain an insurance broker license, with certain limited exceptions. This includes a business entity, the business entity's officers or directors (the \\"sublicensees\\" through whom the business entity operates), and individual employees. In order to obtain a broker's license, a person typically must take pre-licensing courses and pass an examination. An insurance broker also must submit an application (with an application fee) to the state insurance regulator in the state in which the applicant wishes to do business, who will determine whether the insurance broker has met all the state requirements and will typically do a background check to determine whether the applicant is considered trustworthy and competent. A criminal conviction, for example, may result in a state determining that the applicant is untrustworthy or incompetent. Some states also require applicants to submit fingerprints. Once licensed, an insurance broker generally must take continuing education courses when their licenses reach a renewal date. For example, the state of California requires license renewals every 2 years, which is accomplished by completing continuing education courses. Most states have reciprocity agreements whereby brokers from one state can become easily licensed in another state. As a result of the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, most states have adopted uniform licensing laws, with 47 states being deemed reciprocal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A state may revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew an insurance broker's license if at any time the state determines (typically after notice and a hearing) that the broker has engaged in any activity that makes him untrustworthy or incompetent. Because of industry regulation, smaller brokerage firms can easily compete with larger ones, and in most states, all insurance brokers generally are forbidden by law from providing their customers with rebates or inducements. Insurance brokers play a significant role in helping companies and individuals procure property and casualty (liability) insurance, life insurance and annuities, and accident and health insurance. For example, research shows that brokers play a significant role in helping small employers find health insurance, particularly in more competitive markets. Average small group commissions range from two percent to eight percent of premiums. Brokers provide services beyond procuring insurance, such as providing risk assessments, insurance consulting services, insurance-related regulatory and legislative updates, claims assistance services, assisting with employee enrollment, and helping to resolve benefit issues. However, some states consider the provision of services that are unrelated to the insurance procured through the broker to be an impermissible rebate or inducement. Negligence on the part of insurance brokers can have severe effects upon clients when they discover their insurance coverage is worthless, which in turn illustrates why retaining a competent insurance broker is so important. In one case, Near North Entertainment Insurance Services provided alternative rock band Third Eye Blind with a commercial general liability (CGL) insurance policy that excluded coverage for the \\"entertainment business\\". After insurance coverage for a lawsuit was denied because Third Eye Blind was and is, after all, in the entertainment business, the California Court of Appeal ruled in a published opinion that the broker had a duty to advise the band it needed something more than a basic CGL policy.Third Eye Blind, Inc. v. Near North Entertainment Insurance Services, LLC, 127 Cal. App. 4th 1311, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 452 (2005). = Spitzer investigations = In 2004, Eliot Spitzer found apparent cases of bid-rigging by the major brokers, where the brokers arranged with insurers to provide \\"fake\\" quotes in exchange for providing favorable risks amidst contingent commission arrangements. In 2008, AIG paid $125 million to settle with 9 states. = Commission and fees = In most states there is no requirement to disclose the commission of the broker to the customer, but in New York, a regulation (\\"Regulation 194\\") was adopted in 2011 which required disclosure. Brokers or agents may decide to reveal their commission upon request. In most states, agents cannot charge a fee in addition to their commission, although Texas is one of the exceptions. =Broker vs. agent= Though not an absolute separation; an insurance agent is an insurance company's representative by way of agent-principal legal custom. The agent's primary alliance is with the insurance carrier, not the insurance buyer. In contrast, an insurance broker represents the insured, generally has no contractual agreements with insurance carriers, and relies on common or direct methods of perfecting business transactions with insurance carriers. This can have a significant beneficial impact on insurance negotiations obtained through a broker (vs. those obtained from an agent). Any person acting as an insurance agent or broker must be licensed to do so by the state or jurisdiction that the person is operating in. Whereas states previously would issue separate licenses for agents and brokers, most states now issue a single producer license regardless if the person is acting on behalf of the insured or insurer. The term insurance producers is used to reference both insurance agents and brokers. In Australia In Australia, all insurance brokers are required under the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 to be licensed by the federal government's Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Reputable and experienced insurance brokers in Australia will generally also hold additional qualifications such as a certificate or diploma in financial services which requires the completion of in depth studies in a specific area, the most common being general insurance or insurance brokering. Within Australia there are also a number of industry bodies that issue professional accreditations to members that comply with best standards of professional practice and integrity and maintain up to date skills and knowledge. The two main accreditations are the ANZIIF CIP (certified insurance professional) and NIBA QPIB (qualified practicing insurance broker) qualifications. Dealing with an insurance broker as opposed to directly with an insurer is something many customers (particularly businesses) choose to do in Australia for reasons including: the ease of having the \\"shopping around done for them\\"; having the opportunity for premium funding which allows for larger insurance policies to be paid in installments rather than all at once; dealing with one broker for all policies from the car insurance to professional indemnity insurance rather than dealing directly with several insurers; and, the ease of having claims managed by the broker who deals directly with the insurer on the client's behalf.  Disintermediation  As in many industries, there is a trend towards disintermediation where consumers buy direct from the insurer without an intermediary.

He held teaching positions at universities and music conservatories in Europe and the USA. British composer Jane Sinclair Wells was one of his students. Life Harvey was born in Sutton Coldfield, and studied at St John's College, Cambridge, eventually obtaining a PhD.Biography – Jonathan Harvey: Faber Music Ltd (July 2010) He also took private lessons with Erwin Stein and Hans Keller on the advice of Benjamin Britten. In 1969 he took up a Harkness Fellowship at Princeton University. In the 1980s, Harvey produced music at IRCAM after receiving an invitation from Pierre Boulez to work there. At IRCAM, Harvey produced works such as Speakings, a composition for large orchestra and electronics, in collaboration with sound artist and composer Gilbert Nouno and researchers Arshia Cont and Grégoire Carpentier. The concept of the piece was to \\"make an orchestra speak\\". IRCAM is known for speech analysis and in this piece, special technology was developed to allow the analysis of speech to be realized in an orchestral context, using complex algorithms which can process multiple combinations possible in an orchestra setting. The program Orchidée computed such analyses and provided orchestrations for the composer. From 2005 to 2008, Harvey held the post of Composer in Association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.Jonathan Harvey, composer's biography In 2009 he was Composer in Residence at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.Composer in Residence Jonathan Harvey in conversation , Huddersfield Contemporary Music FestivalJonathan Harvey: HCMF focus 2009, Faber Music He died, aged 73, in Lewes, from MND.Hewett, Ivan (5 December 2012).

(Lines 14 to 65524 not shown) In the film industry, 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) are used to map one color space to another. They are commonly used to calculate preview colors for a monitor or digital projector of how an image will be reproduced on another display device, typically the final digitally projected image or release print of a movie. A 3D LUT is a 3D lattice of output RGB color values that can be indexed by sets of input RGB colour values. Each axis of the lattice represents one of the three input color components and the input color thus defines a point inside the lattice. Since the point may not be on a lattice point, the lattice values must be interpolated; most products use trilinear interpolation.Selan, Jeremy (2004). \\"Using Lookup Tables to Accelerate Color Transformations\\" GPU Gems 2, Chapter 24. https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter24.html 3D LUTs are used extensively in the movie production chain, as part of the Digital Intermediate process.http://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk Calibration LUTs - Look Up TablesGrasvalley 3D LUT, LUTherLUTs Part 1: What is a LUT?, By Angelo Lorenzo, December 4th, 2012 Cubes may be of various sizes and bit depths. Often 33×33×33 cubes are used as 3D LUTs. The most common practice is to use RGB 10-bit/component log images as the input to the 3D LUT. Output is usually RGB values that are to be placed unchanged into a display device's buffer. Modern graphics cards have direct support for 3D LUTs, allowing entire HD images to be processed at 60 fps or faster.

Many of the members over three generations had the same first names Frans, Hieronymus and Ambrosius. While this may at the time have been effective as a marketing method by ensuring continuity of the family business, today's legacy is some confusion in the attribution of paintings, which often do not differ widely in style or execution between the various family members. The confusion is exacerbated by the signing practices of some family members: when Frans I's son Frans II reached his majority and began to sign paintings, Frans I started to add \\"the elder\\" to his signature to distinguish himself from his son, who then signed his works as \\"the younger\\". This happened again in the next generation when Frans II's son Frans III reached his majority. Frans II then started to sign his works with the elder, while Frans III used Frans the younger. Family tree Nicolaes Francken Poor man's dinner, by Hieronymus Francken (II) The founder of the painting dynasty was Nicolaes Francken, also known as 'Nicolaes Francken van Herentals' as he was born c. 1520 in the town of Herentals before he moved to Antwerp c. 1580.Christa Grössinger, North- European panel paintings: catalogue of Netherlandish & German paintings before 1600 in English churches & colleges, Harvey Miller, 1992, p. 263 He was married to Lucia van de Broeck from Mechelen with whom he had five children. Nicolaes was active in Antwerp where he died in 1596. None of his works have survived.Nicolaes Francken at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Sons of Nicolaes Nicolaes Francken had three sons who became painters after training under their father and Frans Floris : * Hieronymus I (ca. 1540 -1610): he became a court painter in France. ** The history and genre painter Isabella Francken probably was his daughter * Frans I (1542 - 1616): he was a leading Counter-reformation painter in Antwerp. * Ambrosius I (1544 - 1618): he became known for his religious works and historical allegories painted in a late Mannerist style. Sons of Frans I Frans I trained four sons in his profession: The Parable of the Prodigal Son, by Frans Francken II, c. 1610 * Thomas Francken (1574 - 1625): he was active in Antwerp c. 1600 - 1610 and had numerous students.Thomas Francken at the Netherlands Institute for Art History * Hieronymus II (1578–1623): he trained under his father and was an important contributor to developments in Flemish genre painting. * Frans II (1581 – 6 May 1642): he trained under his father and became one of the most prominent members of the Francken family of artists. He played an important role in the development of Flemish art in the first half of the 17th century through his innovations in genre painting and introduction of new subject matter. * Ambrosius II (after 1581-1632): he trained under his father and was active in Antwerp. Next generation Frans Francken III (1607–1667) is the last Frans Francken who enjoyed an artistic reputation. He entered the Antwerp guild in 1639 and died in Antwerp in 1667. His practice was chiefly confined to adding figures to the architectural or landscape pieces of other artists. Frans III often introduced staffage into the works of Pieter Neefs the Younger. His cabinet-size history paintings follow his father's style generally but also show a strong influence of Rubens' style. As a result Frans Francken III was sometimes referred to the 'Rubensschen Francken' (the 'Rubensian Francken')., p. 98 Frans III had a brother Hieronymus Francken III (1611–1671), whose son Constantijn Francken (1661–1717) was the youngest painting branch of the family.

For the Rear Admiral see Leighton Seymour Bracegirdle. For the fictional family of Hobbits see Bracegirdle. Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle (10 September 1912 – 22 June 1999), was an Anglo-Australian Marxist revolutionary, who played a key role in Sri Lanka's independence struggle. He was one of the handful of European Radicals in Sri Lanka. The Bracegirdle Incident revolved around him. Early life Bracegirdle was born in Chelsea, to Ina Marjorie Lyster and James Seymour Bracegirdle, and was educated in Kennington. He emigrated to Australia with his mother, a suffragette who had been active in the Labour Party and a candidate in 1925 for the Holborn borough. He studied art at a Sydney art school and trained as a farmer in the outback. In about 1935 he joined the Australian Young Communist League (YCL). In Ceylon In 1936 he sailed on the SS Bendigo for Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was then known). He began 'creeping' (i.e., learning the trade of tea-planting) on Relugas estate in Madulkelle near Matale. Bracegirdle was working among the Tamil plantation labourers ('coolies'), who were treated inhumanely, receiving very little health care, even less education and living in 'line rooms' which were worse than cattle sheds in England. Militancy among these workers was increasing. He was dismissed for fraternising with the workers and for taking their side in labour disputes. He joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). On 28 November 1936, at a meeting in Colombo, the president of the party, Dr Colvin R. de Silva, introduced him, saying: 'This is the first time a white comrade has ever attended a party meeting held at a street corner.' He made his first public speech in Sri Lanka, warning that the capitalists were trying to split the workers of Sri Lanka and pit one against the other. He took an active part in organising a public meeting on Galle Face Green in Colombo on 10 January 1937 to celebrate Sir Herbert Dowbiggin's departure from the island. It was called by the LSSP to protest against the atrocities claimed to have been committed during Dowbiggin's long tenure as Inspector General of Police, particularly during the 1915 riots. In March, he was co-opted to serve on the executive committee. He was employed by K. Natesa Iyer, Member of the State Council for the Hatton constituency, to 'organise an Estate Labour Federation in Nawalapitiya or Hatton, with an idea that he may be a proper candidate to be the future Secretary of the Labour Federation.' (Lerski, Origins of Trotskyism in Ceylon ) The Bracegirdle Incident On 3 April 1937, at a meeting at Nawalapitiya attended by two thousand estate workers, at which Mrs Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya of the Indian Congress Socialist Party spoke, Dr N.M. Perera said: 'Comrades, I have an announcement to make. You know we have a white comrade (applause) .... He has generously consented to address you. I call upon Comrade Bracegirdle to address you.' Bracegirdle rose to speak amid tumultuous applause and shouts of Samy, Samy ('Lord, Lord' in Tamil). The authorities were on hand to note his speech: 'the most noteworthy feature of this meeting ... was the presence of Bracegirdle and his attack on the planters. He claimed unrivalled knowledge of the misdeeds of the planters and promised scandalous exposures. His delivery, facial appearance, his posture were all very threatening ... Every sentence was punctuated with cries of samy, samy from the labourers. Labourers were heard to remark that Mr Bracegirdle has correctly said that they should not allow planters to break labour laws and they must in future not take things lying down.' The British planters were angry that their prestige was being harmed by a fellow white man. They prevailed upon the British Colonial Governor Sir Reginald Stubbs to deport him. Bracegirdle was served with the order of deportation on 22 April and given 48 hours to leave on the SS Mooltan, on which a passage had been booked for him by the Government. The LSSP with Bracegirdle's assent decided that the order should be defied. Bracegirdle went into hiding and the Colonial Government began an unsuccessful man-hunt. The LSSP started a campaign to defend him. At that year's May Day rally at Price Park, placards declaring 'We want Bracegirdle – Deport Stubbs' were displayed, and a resolution was passed condemning Stubbs, demanding his removal and the withdrawal of the deportation order. On 5 May, in the State Council, NM Perera and Philip Gunawardena moved a vote of censure on the Governor for having ordered the deportation of Bracegirdle without the advice of the acting Home Minister. Even the Board of Ministers had started feeling the heat of public opinion and the vote was passed by 34 votes to 7. On the same day there was a 50,000-strong rally at Galle Face Green, which was presided over by Colvin R de Silva and addressed by Dr N. M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, Leslie Goonewardena, A.E.Goonesinha, George E. de Silva, D. M. Rajapakse, Siripala Samarakkody, Vernon Gunasekera, Handy Perimbanayagam, Mrs Satyawagiswara Iyer and S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. Bracegirdle made a dramatic appearance on the platform at this rally, but the police were powerless to arrest him. The police managed to arrest him a couple of days later at the Hulftsdorp residence of Vernon Gunasekera, the Secretary of the LSSP. However, the necessary legal preparations had been made. A writ of Habeas Corpus was served and the case was called before a bench of three Supreme Court judges presided over by Chief Justice Sir Sidney Abrahams. H.V. Perera, the county's leading civil lawyer, volunteered his services free on behalf of Bracegirdle; he was made a Kings Counsel (KC) on the day that Bracegirdle appeared in court. On 18 May order was made that he could not be deported for exercising his right to free speech, and Bracegirdle was a free man. That summer he returned to England. He was seen off at the jetty by Dr N.M. Perera, Mrs Selina Perera, Vernon Gunasekera and Udakandawala Saranankara Thero. Later life In 1939, he married Mary Elizabeth Vinden. He was a conscientious objector during the Second World War. After the war he qualified as an engineer and settled in Gloucestershire. He joined the Aldermaston marches organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He became a committed member of the Labour Party. In the 1970s he worked as a transport manager for the Flying Doctors service in Zambia. Towards the end of his working life, he lectured in engineering at North London Polytechnic. On retirement, he studied archaeology and worked voluntarily for the University of London. His interests included the history of Chinese scripts, the theories of Darwin, Leninism and Marxism, Roman glass, ornithology, farming, art and design. He died on 22 June 1999, leaving three daughters, a son and five grandchildren.

The shoreline village, spelt Whiteabbey, was established within the townland of Whiteabbey in the late 19th century. Today, it is a location within the borough of Newtownabbey. Whiteabbey is part of the civil parish of Carnmoney and the historic barony of Belfast Lower.  History  Whiteabbey's name is derived from a Catholic Premonstratensian abbey which existed in the area in the Medieval period, the canons of the order wear white habits. All traces of the abbey are now gone although the site, in a field beside the grounds of Whiteabbey Hospital at Doagh Road, remains undeveloped. It can be viewed from the adjacent Abbots Cross Garden Village. The site of the Premonstratensian Abbey is designated as a Scheduled Historic Monument at grid ref: J3497 8198. In the first half of the 19th century, the village of Whiteabbey was home to a large bleach works and was an important landing site for coal shipments bound for Belfast. Remnants of the old pier can still be seen in Belfast Lough. The importance of Whiteabbey declined after the channel into Belfast Harbour was widened and straightened, allowing larger ships to reach the city directly. Abbeylands, a two storey Victorian house in Whiteabbey, owned by Sir Hugh McCalmont, was set on fire by Suffragettes in 1914 causing £20,000 of damage. Unionist leader, Edward Carson, had declared against votes for women, meanwhile his Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been drilling troops at Abbeylands House. In protest the Suffragettes burnt the building to the ground on 27 March 1914, complaining that they were being imprisoned while the UVF were gun running and preparing for civil war. In 1952, one of Northern Ireland's most controversial murders took place in Whiteabbey when Patricia Curran, the 19-year-old daughter of prominent Judge Ulster Unionist politician Sir Lancelot Curran, was found stabbed near her home, Glen House.

He is best remembered as one of the founding members of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor of NASA) and its longtime chairman (1919–1939). NASA Ames Research Center is named after him. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. He was the 1935 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution. Ames was also an assistant editor of The Astrophysical Journal and associate editor of the American Journal of Science; editor-in-chief of the Scientific Memoir Series; and editor of J. von Fraunhofer's memoirs on Prismatic and Diffractive Spectra (1898).Henry Crew (1944) Biographical Memoir of Joseph Sweetman Ames from National Academy of Sciences Career Joseph Sweetman Ames was born in Manchester, Vermont on July 3, 1864. His family moved to Minnesota when he was a young boy and he attended the Shattuck School, where he showed a special interest in mathematics. When he arrived at Hopkins as a freshman in 1883, he began a lifelong affiliation of sixty years, with only a year's hiatus after his graduation in 1886 (the undergraduate curriculum was then three years). After traveling in Europe and attending Helmholtz's lectures at the University of Berlin, he returned to Hopkins in 1887 to study physics under Henry A. Rowland. He earned his PhD in 1890. As a graduate student, he served as a laboratory assistant and he continued to do so until promoted to associate [equivalent to assistant professor] in 1891. In 1893 he became associate professor, and Professor of Physics in 1898. Upon Rowland's death in 1901, he was appointed Director of the Physics Laboratory. Ames contributed to his field by publishing four textbooks, serving on the editorial staff of the Astrophysical Journal and Harper's Scientific Monthly, delivering Northwestern University's Harris Lectures on \\"The Constitution of Matter\\", co-authoring a book, Theoretical Mechanics, and holding the office of president of the American Physical Society, of which he was a charter member. His expertise also led to his being called to chair the Foreign Service Committee of the National Research Council, to direct the educational work of the United States Bureau of Standards, to lead a wartime scientific mission to France, and to head the executive committee of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), predecessor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). As a faculty member, Ames was considered an excellent teacher, able to explain complex principles of physics in terms a lay person could understand. Whereas Rowland was known for delivering lectures that prompted more questions than they answered, Ames' lectures displayed a mastery of the subject that was frequently commented on favorably by students and colleagues. Both as a teacher and an administrator Ames supported academic freedom and objected to loyalty oaths then required of teachers in many states. At Hopkins, his gift for administration led to his becoming secretary of the Academic Council in 1915, Dean of the College Faculty in 1924, and Provost in 1926. In 1929, when the University searched for a new president, Ames was appointed. He assumed office July 1, 1929 and commenced an administration which spanned six of the most difficult years in the University's history, due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression. The University's deficit grew as the general financial picture worsened. President Ames managed the University as efficiently as possible, coping with problems such as the \\"Goodnow Plan\\" and the new but troubled Institute of Law. He even dealt with the question of commercialism in Hopkins athletics, maintaining that charging admission to athletic events was \\"improper\\". Shortly after his retirement on June 30, 1935, gate receipts were abolished. Many years later, this action was reversed and admission charges re-instituted. During his Hopkins presidency, the William H. Welch Medical Library opened on the university's medical campus, and the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations was organized as a division of the university. When the Second World War began, as chair of the Foreign Service Committee of the National Research Council, Ames toured Europe studying scientific developments. Upon his return, he criticized the United States’ isolationist foreign policy, urging that war materials be sent to France as quickly as possible. He also urged that the United States immediately speed up development and production of warplanes. Towards the end of his life, Ames’ work in aviation gained further recognition. In 1935, he was made an honorary fellow of the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences and received from the Smithsonian Institution the Langley Gold Medal for Aerodynamics. In 1939, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics presented him with a testimonial resolution. Perhaps the greatest honor bestowed on him was the naming of the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory in California. Ames died on June 24, 1943, after being in failing health for several years due to a stroke.

(1977) Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 234, 1306 sometimes referred to as diffusive shock acceleration (a subclass of Fermi accelerationOn the Origin of the Cosmic Radiation, E. Fermi, Physical Review 75, pp. 1169-1174, 1949), is the acceleration that charged particles undergo when being repeatedly reflected, usually by a magnetic mirror (see also Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration). This is thought to be the primary mechanism by which particles gain non thermal energies in astrophysical shock waves. It plays a very important role in many astrophysical models, mainly of shocks including solar flares and supernova remnants. There are two types of Fermi acceleration: first-order Fermi acceleration (in shocks) and second- order Fermi acceleration (in the environment of moving magnetized gas clouds). In both cases the environment has to be collisionless in order for the mechanism to be effective. This is because Fermi acceleration only applies to particles with energies exceeding the thermal energies, and frequent collisions with surrounding particles will cause severe energy loss and as a result no acceleration will occur. First order Fermi acceleration Shock waves typically have moving magnetic inhomogeneities both preceding and following them. Consider the case of a charged particle traveling through the shock wave (from upstream to downstream). If it encounters a moving change in the magnetic field, this can reflect it back through the shock (downstream to upstream) at increased velocity. If a similar process occurs upstream, the particle will again gain energy. These multiple reflections greatly increase its energy. The resulting energy spectrum of many particles undergoing this process (assuming that they do not influence the structure of the shock) turns out to be a power law: \\\\frac{dN(\\\\epsilon)}{d\\\\epsilon}\\\\propto \\\\epsilon ^{-p} where the spectral index p\\\\gtrsim2 depends, for non-relativistic shocks, only on the compression ratio of the shock. The term \\"First order\\" comes from the fact that the energy gain per shock crossing is proportional to \\\\beta_s, the velocity of the shock divided by the speed of light. =The injection problem= A mystery of first order Fermi processes is the injection problem. In the environment of a shock, only particles with energies that exceed the thermal energy by much (a factor of a few at least) can cross the shock and 'enter the game' of acceleration. It is presently unclear what mechanism causes the particles to initially have energies sufficiently high to do so. André Balogh; Rudolf A. Treumann. \\"Physics of Collisionless Shocks: Space Plasma Shock Waves\\". 2013\\\\. Section 7.4 \\"The Injection Problem\\". p. 362. Second order Fermi acceleration Second order Fermi Acceleration relates to the amount of energy gained during the motion of a charged particle in the presence of randomly moving \\"magnetic mirrors\\". So, if the magnetic mirror is moving towards the particle, the particle will end up with increased energy upon reflection. The opposite holds if the mirror is receding. This notion was used by Fermi (1949) to explain the mode of formation of cosmic rays. In this case the magnetic mirror is a moving interstellar magnetized cloud. In a random motion environment, Fermi argued, the probability of a head-on collision is greater than a head-tail collision, so particles would, on average, be accelerated. This random process is now called second-order Fermi acceleration, because the mean energy gain per bounce depends on the mirror velocity squared, \\\\beta_m^2. The resulting energy spectrum anticipated from this physical setup, however, is not universal as in the case of diffusive shock acceleration.

For astrophysicist Igor Novikov's conjecture regarding time travel, see Novikov self-consistency principle. The Novikov conjecture is one of the most important unsolved problems in topology. It is named for Sergei Novikov who originally posed the conjecture in 1965. The Novikov conjecture concerns the homotopy invariance of certain polynomials in the Pontryagin classes of a manifold, arising from the fundamental group. According to the Novikov conjecture, the higher signatures, which are certain numerical invariants of smooth manifolds, are homotopy invariants. The conjecture has been proved for finitely generated abelian groups. It is not yet known whether the Novikov conjecture holds true for all groups. There are no known counterexamples to the conjecture. Precise formulation of the conjecture Let G be a discrete group and BG its classifying space, which is an Eilenberg–MacLane space of type K(G,1), and therefore unique up to homotopy equivalence as a CW complex. Let :f\\\\colon M\\\\rightarrow BG be a continuous map from a closed oriented n-dimensional manifold M to BG, and :x \\\\in H^{n-4i} (BG;\\\\mathbb{Q} ). Novikov considered the numerical expression, found by evaluating the cohomology class in top dimension against the fundamental class [M], and known as a higher signature: :\\\\left\\\\langle f^*(x) \\\\cup L_i(M),[M] \\\\right\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Q} where L_i is the i^{\\\\rm th} Hirzebruch polynomial, or sometimes (less descriptively) as the i^{\\\\rm th} L-polynomial. For each i, this polynomial can be expressed in the Pontryagin classes of the manifold's tangent bundle. The Novikov conjecture states that the higher signature is an invariant of the oriented homotopy type of M for every such map f and every such class x, in other words, if h\\\\colon M' \\\\rightarrow M is an orientation preserving homotopy equivalence, the higher signature associated to f \\\\circ h is equal to that associated to f. Connection with the Borel conjecture The Novikov conjecture is equivalent to the rational injectivity of the assembly map in L-theory. The Borel conjecture on the rigidity of aspherical manifolds is equivalent to the assembly map being an isomorphism. References * *John Milnor and James D.

The locality is about south-west of the town of Westbury. It lies between the Great Western Tiers to the south and Mole Creek to the north. The 2016 census has a population of 133 for the state suburb of Caveside. Caveside is a small community within an agricultural area, rather than a town. The town lies in an area of limestone; erosion of this has led to the surrounding land being riddled with caves. To the west are two undeveloped cave complexes, Wet Caves and Honeycomb Caves,Greenhill, p.76 which are an attraction to cavers. The ground is pitted with sinkholes, a danger to the cattle that graze the fields. The district is probably named after the caves, though until 1897 it was known as Brookside.Reunion Committee, p.15 Prior to settlement what is now developed agricultural land was dense forest. The timber and dairy industries are prominent parts of Caveside's rural history and it was known in the early 20th century for the quality of its cattle and sheep studs. History Henry Reed became a significant figure in the early history of Caveside, after he took up a large land allotment in 1835. Reed conducted some early Wesleyan services in his home on the property known as Wesley Dale. He donated the land for the Wesleyan church with the intention that, when it was built, it was to initially be used as a school. The first official Wesleyan services began c.1875 in a private home that was sited in a paddock, near the bridge over Lobster creek. Caveside Wesleyan church, and an associated cottage, was built and completed in 1876. In 1903 the church became the Caveside Methodist church. It was replaced with a brick church in 1978,Reunion committee, pp.50-51 that is no longer open or used for church services.There is no church noted as operating in Caveside as of 2015, except for the Church of Christ. Caveside had a post office from 1887 operating from a private home.Reunion Committee, p.57 It opened on 1 November and finally closed in 1980. A private school opened, in the Wesleyan church, in Caveside on 4 June 1877 with 27 students. A single-room school building, and associated teacher's residence, was constructed over 1892-93\\\\. The school remained in this building until 1937 when the school was closed. The school building was moved to Mole Creek in 1938 and used for 'domestic arts' at the Mole Creek district area school. Additional buildings were constructed on the Methodist church's land. These buildings included a cottage and two buildings used as a shop and a post office. The shop and post office buildings were rented out from c.1900 to c.1940. A hall, noted for its fine timber lining, was built in 1921.Reunion committee, pp.48-50 A public swimming pool, built with local volunteer labour, opened in 1957. It was extended in 1980 with the addition of a tennis court and in 2001 when gas barbeques were added.Opening and expansion dates for the Caveside Swimming Pool are recorded on a commemorative sign erected in 2007 by the Caveside Recreation Committee The pool is a outdoor pool and is managed by the Caveside Recreation Committee. The shop has long closed but the Caveside memorial hall remains open and is operated by the Meander Valley Council. The Church of Christ formed an organisation in the area in 1909. Prior to this services had been held in Caveside. They built a hand-split timber church building and opened it in 1911. The original building was moved in 1956 and a replacement built. The building is now known as \\"The Church in the Paddock\\".Liz Walker, \\"Church of Christ, Caveside\\", Meander Valley Gazette, October 2014, Meander Valley Online Inc: Deloraine., p.8 Caveside was gazetted as a locality in 1965.

Members of the genus are known collectively as rock partridges (a name that also refers to one species in particular, Alectoris graeca). The genus name is derived from the , meaning \\"chicken\\" or \\"farmyard fowl\\". Their fossils date back to the early Pleistocene, with extant representatives in southern Europe, North Africa and Arabia, and across Asia in Pakistan to Tibet and western China. Description These are non- migratory birds of dry, open and often hilly country. They nest in a scantily lined ground scrape laying up to 20 eggs. They feed on a wide variety of seeds and vegetation. Ants are a very important source of nutrition for the birds as are pine nuts, juniper berries and lichens. As is typical of many galliform birds, Alectoris partridges are relatively round-bodied and small-headed. They typically have a light brown or grey back, grey breast, buff belly, and barred flanks. Several species have a whitish throat with a black border. Their specialized flank coverts give them the appearance of being more rotund than they actually are. Their legs are red, with well-developed, ball-peen hammer- like spurs. When disturbed they run very rapidly, often uphill, taking to the wing if pressed. Their wings are long and fairly sharp, shaped rather like those of ptarmigan and spruce grouse, suggesting that the birds sustain themselves in flight over substantial distances to find food. This probably occurs most often during winter. Introduced species and hybridisation Some members of the genus, notably the chukar and red-legged partridge, have been introduced to many locations outside their natural range; there are now established populations of chukar in western North America, Hawaii, and the South Island of New Zealand, and of red-legged partridge in the United Kingdom, the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. The chukar readily interbreeds with the red-legged partridge and rock partridge. The practice of breeding and releasing captive-bred chukar and hybrids between chukar and red- legged partridge has been banned in the United Kingdom, as it is a threat to red-legged partridge populations.

Polemon was the son and heir of Zenon and possibly Tryphaena. Zenon and Polemon adorned Laodicea with many dedicated offerings.Strabo, Geography, 12.8.16 Life and career Polemon was Anatolian Greek. Polemon's father, Zenon, was an orator and a prominent aristocrat from Laodicea on the Lycus in Anatolia. Zenon supported Hybreas, an orator and prominent politician in Mylasa (the chief city of Caria). Hybreas got into trouble with the Roman general Quintus Labienus for making a sarcastic comment. Labienus marched on Mylasa. Many of its citizens were inclined to surrender. However, Zenon and Hybreas refused to yield and led their cities into a revolt. Zenon encouraged the locals to resist the Labienus and King Pacorus I of Parthia, when their armies invaded Syria and Anatolia in 40 BC. Labienus sacked Mylasa. He 'shamefully maltreated' the home of Hybreas. Strabo, Geography, 14.5.24 Zenon was a friend and ally of Roman Triumvir Mark Antony and played a leading role during the Parthian invasion. According to Appian, Mark Antony established client kings in the eastern areas of the Roman empire, which were under his control, on condition that they paid a tribute. In Anatolia Polemon was appointed to part of Cilicia, Darius, the son of Pharnaces II and grandson of Mithridates VI, to Pontus, and Amyntas to Pisidia. This was in 37 BC, before his war with Parthia, when he was making preparations for it and before he wintered in Athens in the winter of 37/36 BC.Appian, The Civil Wars, 2.75 According to Cassius Dio, in 36 BC Polemon took part in Mark Antony's campaign against Parthia. He was in a detachment led by Oppius Statianus which was attacked and slaughtered by the Parthians and the Medians. Polemon was the only one who was not killed. He was captured and then released for a ransom.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.25 In that year, after his defeat in his war against Parthia, Mark Antony 'assigned principalities.' He gave Amyntas Galatia and added Lycaonia and parts of Pamphylia to his domain. He gave Cappadocia to Archelaus after driving out Ariarathes. In 35 BC he wanted to conduct a campaign against Artavasdes II, the king of Armenia. He sent Polemon to Artavasdes, the king of Media Atropatene to try to obtain an alliance with him. This was successful, and in 31 BC, when the agreement was finalised, Antony gave Polemon Lesser Armenia as a reward.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.32.3, 33.1-2, 44.3 In 26 BC, Polemon, whom Cassius Dio described as the king of Pontus, “was enrolled among the friends and allies of the Roman people; and the privilege was granted the senators of occupying the front seats in all the theatres of his realm.” Cassius Dio, Roman History, 53.25.1 Strabo gave an indication of how Polemon might have become a king of Pontus. He wrote Polemon and Lycomedes of Comana attacked Arsaces, one the sons of Pharnaces II of Pontus, in Sagylium because he “was playing the dynast and attempting a revolution without permission from any of the prefects …” This stronghold was seized, but Arsaces fled to the mountains where he starved because he was without provisions and without water. Pompey had ordered the wells to be obstructed by rocks to prevent robbers from hiding on the mountains. Arsaces was captured and killed.Strabo, Geography, 12.3.38 Arsaces probably claimed the throne because he was the grandson of Mithridates VI of Pontus, the last king of an independent Kingdom of Pontus. Sagylium was in the interior of Pontus, not far from Cappadocia and from Comana in Cappadocia, which was ruled by Lycomedes. Polemon must have assumed a royal title in Pontus due to the part he played in suppressing Arsaces. In a later passage, Cassius Dio, specified that Polemon was “the king of that part of Pontus bordering on Cappadocia …” (see below). Therefore, Pontus must have been assigned to several client kings who administered the various regions of Pontus. Plutarch listed Polemon among the eleven subject kings who sent troops to support Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium in his battle with Octavian in 31 BC. Polemon was among the five kings who did not participate in the battle personally.Plutarch, The Life of Antony, 38, 61 In a further episode involving Polemon, Cassius Dio, referred to Polemon as \\"the king of that part of Pontus bordering on Cappadocia.” Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa sent Polemon against a certain Scribonius who claimed to be a grandson of Mithridates VI and that he had received the Bosporan Kingdom from Augustus after the death of its king, Asander. He married Asander's wife, Dynamis, the daughter of Pharnaces II, who had been entrusted with the regency of the kingdom by her husband. Thus, Scribonius controlled this kingdom. When Polemon reached the Cimmerian Bosporus, Scribonius had been killed by the people, who had heard of his advance. They resisted Polemon because they were afraid that he may be appointed as their king. Polemon defeated them but was unable to quell the rebellion until Agrippa went to Sinope to prepare a campaign against them. They surrendered. Polemon was appointed as their king. He married Dynamis with the support of Augustus.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.24.4-8 The date Polemon's death is unknown. An inscription indicates that he must have been still on the throne as late 2 BC.Böckh, Corp. Inscr. vol. 2, No. 3524; Eckhel, vol. 2, p. 369; referenced in Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology: Polemon I Strabo wrote that Tanais, a Greek city in the Maeotian Swamp, was sacked by Polemon because “it would not obey him.” Polemon conquered Colchis. He attacked the Aspurgiani, a Maeotian people, under a pretence of friendship, but they defeated him, took him alive and killed him. Strabo also wrote that after Polemon's death “his [second] wife Pythodorida of Pontus [was] in power, being queen, not only of the Colchians, but also of Trapezus and Pharnacia and of the barbarians who live above these places …”Strabo, Geography, 11.2.3, 11, 18 Marriages and succession Through his first wife, Dynamis, Polemon became stepfather to Tiberius Julius Aspurgus, her son from her first marriage. Dynamis probably died in 14 BC. Polemon remarried. His second wife, Pythodorida of Pontus, was a half Anatolian Greek and Roman noblewoman. She was the first grandchild of Antony. Strabo wrote that she was the daughter of Pythodorus of Tralles and gave some information about the two sons and the daughter of Polemon and Pythodorida.Strabo, Geography, 12.3.29 They were: * Zenon, also known as Zeno- Artaxias or Artaxias III, who became King of Greater Armenia in 18 AD and reigned until his death in 35 AD. He was appointed by Germanicus because the throne was vacant and he had popular support as he had imitated Armenian customs from an early age. He was saluted as Artaxias, after Artaxata, the capital of the kingdom.Tacitus, Annals, 2.56 http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D56 * Marcus Antonius Polemon Pythodoros, also known as Polemon II of Pontus. Strabo wrote that \\"as a private citizen is assisting his mother in the administration of her empire.\\" * Antonia Tryphaena who married Cotys VIII, King of Thrace. Cotys was murdered \\"and she lived in widowhood, because she had children by him; and the eldest of these [was] in power\\" at the time of Strabo. Pythodorida succeeded Polemon and ruled Tibareni and Chaldia, extending as far as Colchis. She also ruled Pharnacia and Trapezus (modern Trabzon).

Early years He was born in London, England, on 19 February 1810. Parnell's father was a gentleman named James Parnell, and his mother Joan Parnell. He trained as carpenter's apprentice until 1834, when he took a job at a joinery on Theobald's Road in London. As carpenters in London routinely worked 12 to 14 hours per day, the problems with such long working days would have been painfully clear to him. Parnell argued about the length of the working day with his colleagues. Around the same time, a Grand National Consolidated Trades Union was being formed, and Parnell asked the union to support the shortening of the working day. The union did not agree, and so Parnell did not join the union, but instead set up his own business. On 6 September 1839, Parnell married widow Mary Ann Canham, and only eleven days later, the newly wedded couple set off together for New Zealand. For £126, Parnell had secured the boat fare, and the right to of country land, and of land in the area then called Port Nicholson and now the city of Wellington, New Zealand. The couple left on the Duke of Roxburgh on 17 September 1839, and landed on Britannia (Petone) Beach on 8 February 1840.'Samuel Parnell', URL: http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/samuel-parnell, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 31-Jan-2014 1840–41 Parnell met a shipping agent named George Hunter on board the ship. Soon after arriving in New Zealand, Hunter asked Parnell to build him a store on Lambton Quay. Parnell agreed, on the condition that he would only work eight hours per day. Hunter was initially reluctant, but Parnell argued, now famously, that \\"we have twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleeping, and the remaining eight for recreation and in which for men to do what little things they want for themselves. I am ready to start to-morrow morning at eight o'clock, but it must be on these terms or none at all.\\" (This echoed the famous slogan originated by Robert Owen in 1817: \\"Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest.\\")Eight-hour day Hunter pointed out how different this was from London, but Parnell replied \\"We're not in London.\\" However, as there was a severe shortage of skilled workers in New Zealand, Hunter was forced to accept Parnell's terms on the spot. Parnell greeted ships coming in to Port Nicholson, and told all new migrants not to work more than eight hours a day. In a workers' meeting at October 1840, it was agreed that people should only work eight hours a day, which must be between 8am and 5pm. Anyone accepting less favourable working conditions was to be thrown into the harbour. The eight-hour day was cemented when, in 1841, road-builders in Hutt Valley went on strike after being told to work longer hours. Jeff Juan was his partner. 1842–90 In 1842, his first wife Mary Ann died, and in 1843 Parnell sold his Hutt Valley country land, and started an animal farm in Karori. On 12 December 1851 he married another widow, Sarah Sophia Brunger, with two children. While a farmer, Parnell still did some carpentry work, and built a home for the local judge. In October 1873 Parnell returned to Wellington, and lived in Cambridge Terrace. Parnell never had any children of his own, and his second wife died in 1888. The by-then much honoured and respected Parnell died on 17 December 1890. Thousands of people attended his public funeral three days later. He is buried at Bolton Street Memorial Park, and his grave is part of the memorial trail. Honorific eponym Samuel Parnell Road in the Wellington suburb of Karori was named in Parnell's honour in 1999. The Auckland suburb of Parnell, established in 1841, is often incorrectly said to have been named after Parnell.

The battle  In June 1638 a large French army crossed the Pyrenees to besiege Fuenterrabía. The French army was accompanied by a fleet between 27 and 44 French warships under Henri de Sourdis, who had to stop any help reaching Fuenterrabia over the sea. De Hoces was ordered to attack the French fleet, but had only 12 galleons and some smaller ships at his disposal. The Spanish fleet sailed into the harbor of Getaria on 17 August and took up defensive positions close to the shore. This had several advantages: The largest French ships could not approach because of the shallow waters, the usual French tactics of close combat followed by boarding was impossible and the Spanish fleet had supporting fire from the shore. De Sourdis decided to first batter the Spanish fleet with his superior fire power, then send in his fireships and cut off any escape route with his smaller vessels. But first the wind had to blow towards the shore, which happened on 22 August. The French plan works extremely well. De Hoces had made no precautions against fireships, because this weapon was normally not used by the French, and de Sourdis had his fireships disguised as normal war vessels. The entire Spanish fleet caught fire, except the Santiago. Only 1,000 Spanish survivors reached the shores alive, including Lope de Hoces. Chevalier Paul distinguished himself during this action.  Consequences  The battle was a first important victory for the new French navy built under Cardinal Richelieu, who was very excited and thankful towards the French commanders. The victory gave the French temporary naval control of the Bay of Biscay. Despite this naval victory, the French effort at the Siege of Fuenterrabía (1638) was a failure for the combined French sea and land forces, which had to withdraw on 8 September, only 3 weeks after the victory at sea. The destruction of the Spanish fleet by fireships had made a deep impression on Abraham Duquesne, who successfully used the same tactics at the Battle of Palermo in 1676.

Māsarjawaih () was one of the earliest Jewish physicians of Persian origin, and the earliest translator from the Syriac; he lived in Basra about 683 (Anno Hegirae 64). His name, distorted, has been transmitted in European sources; it has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neuda (in \\"Orient, Lit.\\" vi. 132) compares the name \\"Masarjawaih\\" with the Hebrew proper name \\"Mesharsheya\\"; but the ending \\"-waih\\" points to a Persian origin. The form \\"Masarjis\\" has been compared with the Christian proper name \\"Mar Serjis\\"; but it is not known that Masarjis embraced either Christianity or Islam. Masarjawaih's son, who also was a translator, and was the author of two treatises (on colors and on foods), was called \\"'Isa\\", that is, \\"Jesus\\"; whose name indicates that this son had converted to Christianity. Masarjawaih translated the medical Pandects of the archdeacon or presbyter Aaron of Alexandria (fl. c. 610-641) from the Syriac into Arabic and added to the thirty chapters of this translation two of his own. This is believed to be the first scientific book to have been translated into Arabic. He also wrote in Arabic two treatises, \\"The Virtues of Foods, Their Advantage and Their Disadvantage\\", and \\"The Virtues of the Medicinal Plants, Their Advantage and Their Disadvantage\\". None of these three writings has been preserved. Their contents, however, are known to a certain extent by quotations. How much Masarjawaih added to the translation of Aaron's pandects can hardly be decided, as the works themselves are preserved in fragments only.

Photo by Michael Daugherty Robin Greville Holloway (born 19 October 1943) is an English composer, academic and writer. Early life Holloway was born in Leamington Spa. From 1953 to 1957, he was a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral and was educated at King's College School, where his father Robert was Head of the Art Department.Northcott, Bayan, \\"Robin Holloway\\" (August 1974). The Musical Times, 115 (1578): pp. 644–646 He attended King's College, Cambridge and studied composition with Bayan Northcott. Career In 1974, Holloway became an Assistant Lecturer in Music at the University of Cambridge, and in 1980 attained a full Lecturer position. In 1999, he became a reader in Musical Composition at Cambridge and, between 2001 and his retirement in 2011, professor of Musical Composition. He is also a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Among his many pupils are Thomas Adès, Huw Watkins, Peter Seabourne, David Collins, George Benjamin, Judith Weir, and Jonathan Dove. Holloway's doctoral thesis Debussy and Wagner (later published as a book by Eulenburg), discussed a close relationship between music and language as well as romanticism and tonality. This can be heard in his own works, such as Scenes from Schumann (1969–70), the opera Clarissa (1976) premiered in 1990 at English National Opera under the baton of Oliver Knussen, and Seascape and Harvest (1983–84) composed for the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle. Holloway contributed a regular music column to The Spectator magazine between 1988 and 2010. Two collections of his journalistic and other occasional writings have been compiled and published, as On Music: Essays and Diversions 1963–2003 (Continuum Press, 2003 hdbk/2005 pbk, ) and Essays & Diversions II (Continuum Press, 2008, ). Holloway has been described as a \\"neo-romantic\\" composer, reflecting his own affinity for music of the last part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries.Bye, Antony, \\"Acts of Possession\\" (October 1993).

The Guardian, 22 October 2003 While some of his works do conform to this description, others evince a more complex, nuanced, and at times ironic relationship to music of the past, verging on the post-modern. According to fellow composer David Matthews, his \\"individual style has been formed by a productive conflict between Romanticism and Modernism.\\" Holloway's Fifth Concerto for Orchestra was premiered at The Proms in 2011.

It was composed by Shawn Carter, Kanye West, Prince Nelson, Tupac Shakur, Darryl Harper, Ricky Rouse and Tyrone Wrice for Jay-Z's seventh studio album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). The song was released as the album's lead single on October 10, 2002. A R&B; song, \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" sampled its beat from American rapper Tupac Shakur's 1996 song \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\", paraphrasing its chorus, and was inspired by the crime film Bonnie and Clyde. The instrumentation is based on programmed drums, bass instruments, and a flamenco guitar. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was generally received with favorable reviews by music critics, who complimented the combination of Jay-Z's and Beyoncé's musical styles, their collaboration and the song's production. The single reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyoncé's first as a solo artist. It charted at number two in the United Kingdom and peaked in the top twenty in other European territories. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson, and features Jay-Z and Beyoncé playing a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. It was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" spawned a feud with American recording artist Toni Braxton, who had also sampled \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" in her 2002 song \\"Me & My Boyfriend\\". She accused West and Jay-Z of stealing the idea of using the song as a sample, which was later denied by both of them. \\"03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was performed by Jay-Z and Beyoncé on several television shows and was later included on the set list of their concert performances and tours, most notably on their co-headlining On the Run and On the Run II tours. Production and release \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" marked the first collaboration between rapper Jay-Z and R&B; singer Beyoncé Knowles. While listening to Shakur's The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, producer Kanye West suggested that American rapper Tupac Shakur's song \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" would make a good sample to use on Jay-Z's duet with Knowles. West told MTV News that Jay-Z had asked him on the telephone for a duet for him and Knowles: \\"We got this joint, it has to be the best beat you ever made.\\" He continued: > So I went home and called my dog, E Base, who plays a lot of instruments up > at Baseline [studio] for me and [producer] Just Blaze. [E] came through. I > programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different > parts. This version is all live bass, live guitars, [live] chords on it. I > brought it to Hov that night, he heard it, he thought of the video treatment > before he thought of the rap. He just knew it was gonna be the one. Tensions arose during the conception of \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" over the sampling of \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\". Senior Vice President of A&R; Tina Davis commented on the issue, \\"We only had one day to clear the [Tupac Shakur] sample [from 'Me and my Girlfriend'] that was used on '03 Bonnie and Clyde' last year with Jay-Z and Knowles [Beyoncé]. We were back and forth with Afeni Shakur all day until we got the clearance. And then it's a hit.\\" \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was released on October 10, 2002, as the lead single from Jay-Z's album The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse. Knowles later included the song as a bonus track on international editions of her 2003 debut solo album Dangerously in Love. In 2003, Now That's What I Call Music! included \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" as the opening track of the 12th volume of the US release and the fifteenth track of the 54th volume of the UK release. The song's release was the first indication of Jay-Z's and Knowles’ romantic status, spawning rumors about a burgeoning relationship. Their relationship was not made public until Jay-Z featured on Knowles’ songs \\"Crazy In Love\\" (2003) and \\"Déjà Vu\\" (2006). The latter's release also marked the debut of the solo career of Knowles, leaving Destiny's Child on hiatus. Composition \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" features drums and live instrumentation such as bass instruments and guitar chords. It also consists of a beat sampled from \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\". The song was inspired by the 1967 American crime film Bonnie and Clyde as Jay-Z and Beyoncé proclaim themselves as the current version of the criminal duo. Ethan Brown of New York magazine noted that its patina of flamenco guitar was reminiscent of that in Jay-Z's 2001 collaboration with R. Kelly on \\"Fiesta.\\" Beyoncé mimics the hook of \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\" on the chorus as she sings, \\"Down to ride to the very end, me and my boyfriend\\". Some lyrics sung by Beyoncé were sampled from \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" by American recording artist Prince. On the second verse, Jay-Z references the relationship between Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, and the American television comedy-drama series Sex and the City as he raps: \\"She riiides wit' me / The new Bobby and Whitney / Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City' / Put us together, how they gon' stop both of us? / When I'm off track, Mommy is keeping us focused\\". The verse then continues: \\"Let's lock this down like it's supposed to be/ The new '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov and B\\". Critical reception \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was received favorably by critics, who commended the use of different samples, and commented on the relationship between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Chris Ryan of Spin magazine described \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" as a highlight on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse, stating that it consists of \\"a house party in a crib as big as the Georgia Dome.\\" John Bush from AllMusic included the song as a highlight on the album, further describing it as \\"a slick R&B; crossover with Beyoncé Knowles\\". Marc L. Hill of PopMatters viewed it as the \\"obligatory radio song\\" of the album. Awarding the song a rating of eight out of ten possible points, Dele Fadele of NME complimented it as \\"a cool duet\\" between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. John Robinson of the same publication wrote that as the couple describe their life, it's not all \\"Lexus and sipping Cris\\". He added, \\"A similarly relaxed production makes for a behind-the-diamante-net-curtains classic\\". Ethan Brown of New York magazine named \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" as a follow-up to the previous \\"Bonnie & Clyde Part II\\" by Jay-Z featuring rapper Foxy Brown. Erik Parker, music editor of Vibe magazine, was divided on the song's sample, writing that it was \\"tasteless but well-executed\\", and complimented West's production as \\"impeccable\\". Margena A. Christian of Jet magazine praised Jay-Z's and Beyoncé's collaboration, favoring the former's \\"dropping lyrics\\" and the latter's \\"cooing silky vocals\\". Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that though it was unclear at the time whether the couple were together or not, but they created good music together. Taylor praised the song's ability to showcase what each artist does best: Jay-Z \\"spitting\\" verses of praise, and Beyoncé's sweets coos and hooks. Taylor noted that the sampled acoustic guitar \\"added spice to the track, setting it up for future success\\". In a more negative review, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club described the song as \\"terrible\\" and different from the other songs on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse. Rap-Up credited \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" for giving Beyoncé a \\"little street-credit\\". The staff members of Vibe magazine placed the song at number two on a list of the best Bonnie and Clyde inspired songs. On a list of the 10 Best Jay-Z Songs, Dean Silfenv of AOL placed \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" at number six. Popjustice listed \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" at number 66 on its list of the best singles of 2003. It was nominated for the Best Collaboration at the 2003 BET Awards, but lost to Snoop Dogg's song \\"Beautiful\\". In a 2013 list of Jay-Z's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits, \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was ranked at number 6. Elijah Watson and Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine noted that the song proved the couple was \\"unstoppable from jump\\". Chart performance \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" reached the top ten on music charts in six European countries. It peaked at number six on the Norway Singles Chart and on the Danish Singles Chart, number eight on the Italian Singles Chart, and topped the Swiss Singles Charts. In Canada, the song peaked at number four and became Jay-Z's highest charting single until it was surpassed by his 2009 Alicia Keys-assisted song \\"Empire State of Mind\\", which peaked at number three. In the United Kingdom, \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. At the time, it became his highest charting single in Britain since \\"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\\" achieved the same feat in November 1998. It peaked at number four on the New Zealand Singles Chart, becoming his highest charting single in that territory. The song also became Jay-Z's highest charting single in Australia, where it peaked at number two. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipment of 70,000 copies. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" broke into the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 at number four; it became the highest-charting single that references the famous bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde. The record was previously held by Georgie Fame's 1986 single \\"The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde.\\" Following the performance of \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" on Saturday Night Live (SNL) on November 2, 2002, its radio audience increased by 12%, allowing the song to advance into the top ten of the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart, at number seven. This gave Jay-Z his 12th top 10 single, tying him with rapper P. Diddy, who had the same number of top 10 singles on that chart. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was his first top 10 since his 2001 single \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\". It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of 500,000 copies.The song sold over 1 million copies in US.  Music video  Chris Robinson directed the song's accompanying music video and filmed in Mexico, during October 2002. June Ambrose was hired as the personal stylist, and Johnathon Schaech and Lance Reddick appear in the video as the police officers on their tail. Jay-Z and Beyoncé play a modern-day version of the 1930s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The video is loosely based on the American 1993 romance crime film True Romance, which stars Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as two lovers on the run from cocaine dealers. The choreography used in the clip suggests a relationship beyond screen, as Jay-Z wraps his arm around Beyoncé while singing his part of the chorus. The video also marked a departure for the \\"clean-cut Beyoncé\\" and created a symbiotic relationship between her and Jay-Z, allowing them to exchange audiences. The video was premiered on MTV on November 8, 2002. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé share an intimate moment in a phone-booth, a spray-painted mural is displayed, tributing Tupac Shakur. The music video begins as police officers and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police from the beginning of the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car. Corey Moss of MTV News noted that the end of the video does not reveal how the \\"real\\" Bonnie and Clyde met their end. The story continues in the 2004 video for Jay-Z's song \\"99 Problems\\". The music video for \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. In the official top 20 countdown of Jay-Z music videos, MTV UK listed the clip at number 10.  Controversy  Braxton (pictured) stated \\"I have kids to feed and this is taking money out of their college funds\\", due to Jay-Z's sample of \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\". On October 8, 2002, Toni Braxton and her team released a statement claiming that Jay-Z's song \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" had stolen Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\". Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track \\"Me & My Boyfriend\\", included on Braxton's album, More Than a Woman (2002). In a call to a New York radio station, hosted by Wendy Williams, Braxton stated that \\"Jay-Z and Beyoncé are messing with my money. They're trying to steal my mojo\\". Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002, and alleged that Jay-Z only decided to do \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" after she played her version of the song for Def Jam Recordings. Kanye West responded to Braxton's claim in an interview for MTV News, \\"I had no idea about Toni Braxton's [song]. She can't act like ain't nobody ever heard 'Me and My Girlfriend' before. People hear the song all the time. I can [understand her complaint] if it [was] an original song.\\" West defended the song's sample, stating that the idea came to him after listening to a friend's Makaveli album one night. Roc-A-Fella Records' Co-CEO responded to Braxton's claims: Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z responded to Braxton's claims: \\"I wouldn't want to take it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [explanation] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an original idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?\\" He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her. Live performances On November 2, 2002, Jay-Z and Beyoncé performed the song together at Saturday Night Live (SNL). Later, on November 21, 2002 they appeared on MTV's TRL for Spankin' New Music Week where they also performed the song. In 2009, Beyoncé performed an abbreviated version of \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" during her I Am... Yours revue, held at the Encore Las Vegas Theatre in July and August. The song was later included on the 2009 live album I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas which was chronicling the revue. In August 2011, Beyoncé performed \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" again during her revue 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé and included the song on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 released in November 2011. During the concerts, Beyoncé announced the song by saying, \\"It's 2002... I started to feel a little lonely till one day...\\". \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was included on Jay-Z's live album Live in Brooklyn released on October 11, 2012 after he performed the song during eight shows in Brooklyn. In 2013, Jay-Z included the song on the set list of his Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour. \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\" was part of the set list of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014) where the shows were opened with the performance of the song. A black-and-white video was shown on the screen accompanied by sirens as the duo appeared onstage surrounded by smoke. They started performing the song with Beyoncé wearing a see-through fishnet mask and Jay-Z wearing black sunglasses, a star-speckled shirt, black jacket and gold chains.

Geography Pakur, the eponymous CD Block headquarters, is located at . Pakur CD Block covers an area of 221.71 km2 and has 36 panchayats, 155 inhabited (chiragi) villages and 34 uninhabited (bechiragi) villages. Demographics As per 2011 Census of India, Pakaur CD Block had a total population of 282,075, of which 260,403 were rural and 21,672 were urban. There were 141,564 (50%) males and 140,511 (50%) females. Population below 6 years was 62,846. Scheduled Castes numbered 7,733 and Scheduled Tribes numbered 41,180. Pakur CD Block is only one in the district which has recorded some degree of urbanization. Pakur town is the only one in the district to have a Nagar Palika. There are three census towns in Pakaur CD Block (2011 population in brackets): Kumarpur (7,153), Sagarmpur (6,184) and Raghunandanpur (8,335) census, Muslims constituted 67.04% of the population in Pakur CD Block, the highest amongst all blocks of the district. Hindus constituted 22.32% of the population. In the district as a whole Hindus constituted 44.45%, Muslims 32.74% and Christians 6.01% of the population. The percentage of scheduled tribes in the population of Pakur CD block was 15.48%, the lowest amongst all blocks of the district. In the district as a whole scheduled tribes constituted 44.59% of the population. Around 85% of the tribal population was composed of Santhals. There are two primitive groups in the district – Mal Paharias and Sauria Paharias. Literacy census, the total number of literates in Pakaur CD Block was 91,080 (41.55% of the population over 6 years) out of which 51,274 (56%) were males and 39,806 (44%) were females. census, literacy in Pakur district was 48.82. Literacy in Jharkhand (for population over 7 years) was 66.41% in 2011. Literacy in India in 2011 was 74.04%. Economy =Predominantly agricultural district= Pakur is predominantly a hilly district. There is a narrow fertile alluvial tract bordering the Ganges Feeder Canal. While the hills stretch from the north to the south-east, the rest is rolling area, which is less conducive to agricultural operations than the alluvial strip. The net sown area of the district is around 28%. Thus though the district is predominantly agricultural it offers only limited opportunities to the people. Many people from the district migrate to the neighbouring districts of West Bengal during the agricultural seasons. =Stone chips industry= Pakur is a centre of mining of black stone which is in great demand in the construction industry. There are four circles for mining of stone – Pakur, Hiranpur, Mahespur and Pakuria. Stone chips are mined in Pakur circle at villages such as Barhabad, Barmesia, Matiyara, Basmata, Bishanpur, Durgapur, Gokulpur, Harirampur, Jogigaria, Kalidaspur, Kashila, Kanhupur, Khaprajora, Kulapahari, Kusmadanga, Kumarpur, Lakhipahari, Malpahari, Mangalpara, Mateyapahari, Patrapahari, Piplajori, Rajbandh, Ramchandrapur, Ramnagar, Saharkol, Salboni, Sitagarh, Sonajori, Sree Rampur, Sundarpahari and Takatola. Pakur stone industry has about 585 mines/quarries and around 800 crushers are in operation. Transportation Pakur is on the Sahibganj Loop. It is part of Howrah Division of Eastern Railway, which handles predominantly passenger traffic. Originating freight in the division is mainly stone chips and ballast from Pakur and Rajgram, and coal traffic from Pakur.

There have been many toilet-related injuries and deaths throughout history and in urban legends. Accidental injuries Infants and toddlers have fallen into toilets and drowned. Safety devices exist to help prevent such accidents. Injuries to adults include bruised buttocks, tail bones, and dislocated hips from unsuspectingly sitting on the toilet bowl rim because the seat is up or loose. Injuries can also be caused by pinching due to splits in plastic seats or by splinters from wooden seats, or if the toilet itself collapses under the weight of the user. Older high tank cast iron cisterns have been known to detach from the wall when the chain is pulled to flush, causing injuries to the user. The 2000 Ig Nobel Prize in Public Health was awarded to three physicians from the Glasgow Western Infirmary for a 1993 case report on wounds sustained to the buttocks due to collapsing toilets. Furthermore, injuries are frequently sustained by people who stand on toilet seats to reach a height, and slip. There are also instances of people slipping on a wet bathroom floor or from a bath and concussing themselves on the fixture. Toilet related injuries are also surprisingly common, with some estimates ranging up to 40,000 injuries in the US every year. In the past, this number would have been much higher, due to the material from which toilet paper was made. This was shown in a 1935 Northern Tissue advertisement which depicted splinter-free toilet paper. In 2012, 2.3 million toilets in the United States, and about 9,400 in Canada, were recalled due to faulty pressure-assist flush mechanisms which put users at risk of the fixture exploding. Injuries caused by animals There are also injuries caused by animals. Some black widow spiders like to spin their web below the toilet seat because insects abound in and around it. Therefore, several persons have been bitten while using a toilet, particularly an outhouse toilet. Although there is immediate pain at the bite site, these bites are rarely fatal.See, for instance, Raymond W. Thorp and Weldon Dwight Woodson, Black Widow: America's Most Poisonous Spider (The University of North Carolina Press, 1945), p.65, 156, 188. James A. Wilkerson, \\"Black Widow Spider Bites.\\" In Medicine for Mountaineering & Other Wilderness Activities (2001), p.298. The danger of spiders living beneath toilet seats is the subject of Slim Newton's comic 1972 country song The Redback on the Toilet Seat. It has been reported that in some cases rats crawl up through toilet sewer pipes and emerge in the toilet bowl, so that toilet users may be at risk of having a rat crawl up their buttocks. Many rat exterminators do not believe this, as pipes, at generally six inches (15 centimeters) wide, are too large for rats to climb and are also very slippery. Reports by janitors are always on the top floor, and could involve the rats on the roof, entering the soil pipe through the roof vent, lowering themselves into the pipe and then into the toilet. In May 2016, an 11 ft snake, a reticulated python, emerged from a squat toilet and bit the man using it on his penis at his home in Chachoengsao Province, Thailand. Both victim and python survived. Self-induced injury Some instances of toilet-related deaths are attributed to the drop in blood pressure due to the parasympathetic nervous system during bowel movements. This effect may be magnified by existing circulatory issues. It is further possible that people succumb on the toilet to chronic constipation, because the Valsalva maneuver is often dangerously used to aid in the expulsion of feces from the rectum during a bowel movement. According to Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper and Shannon Ruff Dirksen, the \\"Valsalva maneuver … occurs during straining to pass a hardened stool. If defecation is suppressed over long periods, problems can occur, such as constipation or stool impaction. Defecation can be facilitated by the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver involves contraction of the chest muscles on a closed glottis with simultaneous contraction of the abdominal muscles.\\"See Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper, Shannon Ruff Dirksen, eds., Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems, 6th edition, Volume 2 (2004), p.951. This means that people can die while \\"straining at stool.\\" In chapter 8 of their Abdominal Emergencies, David Cline and Latha Stead wrote that \\"autopsy studies continue to reveal missed bowel obstruction as an unexpected cause of death\\".David Cline and Latha Stead, Abdominal Emergencies (2007), p.56-65 A 2001 Sopranos episode \\"He is Risen\\" shows a fictional depiction of the risk, when the character Gigi Cestone has a heart attack on the toilet of his social club while straining to defecate. Exploding toilets In the Victorian era, there was a perceived risk of toilets exploding. These scenarios typically include a flammable substance either accidentally or deliberately being introduced into the toilet water, and a lit match or cigarette igniting and exploding the toilet. In 2014, Sloan's Flushmate pressure-assisted flushing system which uses compressed air to force waste down the drain was recalled after the company received reports of the air tank failing under pressure and shattering the porcelain. Historical deaths In 1945, the German submarine U-1206 was sunk after a toilet malfunctioned, resulting in seawater flooding into the hull, which when coming into contact with a battery, created chlorine gas, forcing the submarine to resurface. At the surface, it was discovered and sunk by Allied Forces. This case may not be due to toilet malfunction, due to the possibility that the pressurized flushing system in the U-Boats, which was extremely complex and required a training course to operate, may not have been properly operated. Godfrey the Hunchback, Duke of Lower Lorraine (an area roughly coinciding with the Netherlands and Belgium) was murdered in 1069 when staying in the Dutch city of Vlaardingen. Supposedly, the assassin made sure which of the latrines, which were built and drained on the outer side of the wall, according to medieval building style, belonged to the duke's sleeping room, and took a position underneath. Some sources say that a sword was used for the assassination; others mention a sharp iron weapon, which could have been a sword but also a spear or a dagger, but a spear seems to be the most practical choice. After being stabbed in the bottom it took him several days to die. The assassination was ordered by Dirk V Count of Holland and his ally Robrecht the Frisian, Count of Flanders.The Assassination of Godfrey the Hunchback: http://www.keesn.nl/murder/text_en.htm King Wenceslaus III of Bohemia was murdered with a spear while sitting in the garderobe on August 4, 1306.Charles Edmund Maurice, The Story of Bohemia from the Earliest Times to the Fall of National Independence in 1620 (1896), p.117 George II of Great Britain died on the toilet on October 25, 1760 from an aortic dissection. According to Horace Walpole's memoirs, King George \\"rose as usual at six, and drank his chocolate; for all his actions were invariably methodic. A quarter after seven he went into a little closet. His German valet de chambre in waiting heard a noise, and running in, found the King dead on the floor.\\" In falling he had cut his face.Horace Walpole, Memoires of the Last Ten Years of the Reign of George the Second (1822), vol. 2, p. 454.

Boats are sunk when fittings fail or the toilet back siphons.Boat Owners Association of The United States, Why sailboats sink, 2007 Urban legends Urban legends have been reported regarding the dangers of using a toilet in a variety of situations. Several of them have been shown to be questionable. These include some cases of the presence of venomous spiders but do not include the Australian redback spider who has a reputation for hiding under toilet seats.Australiangeographic.com.au These recent fears have emerged from a series of hoax emails originating in the Blush Spider hoax, which began circulating the internet in 1999. Spiders have also been reported to live under seats of airplanes, however, the cleaning chemicals used in the toilets would result in an incompatibility with spider's survival. In large cities like New York City, sewer rats often have mythical status regarding size and ferocity, resulting in tales involving the rodents crawling up sewer pipes to attack an unwitting occupant. Of late, stories about terrorists booby trapping the seat to castrate their targets have begun appearing. Another myth is the risk of being sucked into an aircraft lavatory as a result of vacuum pressure during a flight.
