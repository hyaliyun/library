AlkD (Alkylpurine glycosylase D) is an enzyme belonging to a family of DNA glycosylases that are involved in DNA repair. It was discovered by a team of Norwegian biologists from Oslo in 2006. It was isolated from a soil-dwelling Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, along with another enzyme AlkC. AlkC and AlkD are most probably derived from the same protein as indicated by their close resemblance. They are also found in other prokaryotes. Among eukaryotes, they are found only in the single-celled species only, such as Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum. The enzyme specifically targets 7mG (methyl-guanine) in the DNA, and is, therefore, unique among DNA glycosylases. It can also act on other methylpurines with less affinity. It indicates that the enzyme is specific for locating and cutting (excision) of chemically modified bases from DNA, exactly at 7mG, whenever there are errors in replication. It accelerates the rate of 7mG hydrolysis 100-fold over the spontaneous depurination. Thus, it protects the genome from harmful changes induced by chemical and environmental agents. Its crystal structure was described in 2008. It is the first HEAT repeat protein identified to interact with nucleic acids or to contain enzymatic activity. Structure AlkD (green) recognizes DNA (multi-coloured) through HEAT repeat motifs. AlkD is made up of 237 amino acids, and has a molecular size of 25 kDa. It is composed of a tandem array of helical repeats reminiscent of HEAT motifs, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions and have not yet been associated with DNA binding or catalytic activity. It is a single-stranded protein with α-helical domain. The entire protein domain is composed of HEAT repeat domains, similar to those found in other proteins. Twelve of the fourteen helices (αA-αN) pair in an antiparallel pattern, and form six tandemly repeated α-α motifs, such as αA/αC, αD/αE, αF/αG, αH/αI, αJ/αK, and αL/αM. These helical repeats are stacked into a superhelical solenoid in which helices B, C, E, G, I, K and M form a concave surface with an aromatic cleft at its center. Residues within this cleft are crucial for the base excision activity. The concave surface is positively charged and is presumed to be the binding site of DNA, as well as for protection against bacterial sensitivity to alkylating agents. Mechanism of action AlkD has a unique mechanism for base excision in DNA. Instead of interacting directly with the damaged (alkylated) DNA portion, it acts on the nearby undamaged region. It then induces flipping of the alkylated and opposing base accompanied by DNA stack compression. The exposed DNA portion can then be enzymatically removed, by hydrolysis of the 7mG.

It is the only species in the genus Parapolynemus and it is found in Australia and New Guinea. Description The dwarf paradise fish is the smallest species of threadfin which has an elongated body woth a large oblique and turned down mouth. It has two separate dorsal fins, the first of which has 8 spines and the second which has a single spine and 11-14 soft rayswhile the anal fin has 3 spines and 10 -12 soft rays. The base of the anal fin is shorter than that of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has long lobes with the lower usually being the longest; normally it is longer than the distance from the snout to the start of the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins have 12 to 14 simple raysand are located near the midline of the body and may extend beyondthe rear end of the anal fin's base. It has 6 or 7 pectoral filaments; with the fifth filament, the farthest back, being the longest, sometimes reaching past the end of the caudal fin. The pelvic fins reach beyond the anus. There are 50*60 scales in the lateral linewhich nds between the centre of the fork of the caudal fin and its first lower ray.

Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries described it as Agaricus pudorinus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum. It became Hygrophorus pudorinus with the raising of Hygrophorus to genus rank. The species name is the Latin word pudorinus \\"blushing\\". The species is classified in the subsection Pudorini of genus Hygrophorus, along with the closely related species H. erubescens and H. purpurascens. The fruit body (mushroom) is a fair size, with a diameter pink to golden convex cap with a downrolled margin that is lighter in colour. The cap surface is sticky. The pink to yellow-white gills are decurrent. The thick stipe is tall and wide. The spore print is white and the oval spores measure 7–10 × 5–6 micrometres. The thick flesh is pale pink or orange to white. The mushroom does not bruise red and has no distinctive odour, though it can taste like turpentine. Hygrophorus pudorinus is found in coniferous woodlands under fir and spruce trees across western and northeastern North America; it is particularly common in Canada and the Rocky Mountains. The mushrooms appear in groups or fairy rings in late summer and autumn. They often grow in boggy places in sphagnum moss. Despite its taste, it is edible after cooking. Its variable appearance makes identification difficult and hence raises risk of misidentification.

Taxonomy Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen described the species as Agaricus sanguineus in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the fir tree forests around Klagenfurt and Ebenthal and in October. He noted that it was very pretty but not edible. The specific epithet is the Latin word sanguineus, meaning \\"bloody\\". Samuel Frederick Gray established Cortinarius as a genus in the first volume of his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants, recording the species as Cortinaria sanguinea \\"the bloody curtain-stool\\". Friedrich Otto Wünsche described it as Dermocybe sanguinea in 1877. Most mycologists retain Dermocybe as merely a subgenus of Cortinarius as genetically all the species lie within the latter genus. It is closely related to Cortinarius puniceus, which grows under oak and beech from England and France. Description The dark blood- red cap is convex, and later flattens, measuring 2–5 cm (0.8–2 in) across, its surface covered in silky fibres radiating from the centre. The stipe is usually the same colour as the cap or paler. Long, slim, and cylindrical, it is 3–6 cm high by 0.3–0.8 cm wide. The veil (cortina) and its remnants are red. The gills are adnate. They are initially blood-red, but turn brown upon aging as the spores mature. The purple-red flesh has a pleasant smell. The spore print is rust-coloured, while the oval spores themselves measure 7 to 9 µm by 4 to 6 µm, and are rough. C. sanguineus grows in conifer woodlands in autumn. It is not edible. Its pigment can be used as a dye for wool, rendering it shades of pink, purple or red. The major pigments in C. sanguineus are emodin, dermocybin and dermorubin.https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2015/653740/ See also *List of Cortinarius species References External links * sanguineus Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi described in 1781 Category:Inedible fungi ","title":"Cortinarius sanguineus"},{"id":"48430956","text":"Yeşilyurt is a village in Alaplı District, Zonguldak Province, Turkey.

It is housed in a late 16th-century warehouse located near the St. Andrew's Bastion in Valletta, Malta. The centre was opened in 2013, and it aims at communicating Malta's military architecture in an interactive way. The building was formerly known as the Biagio Steps Examination Centre. History The idea to establish a museum about Malta's military architecture goes back to the 1960s, when British architect Quentin Hughes proposed to set up such a museum in Fort San Lucian. Military historian Stephen C. Spiteri also made plans to establish a military architecture museum, and he proposed setting it up at the Ospizio in Floriana. In November 2008, the Ministry for Resources and Rural Affairs under Minister George Pullicino took the initiative of setting up the museum at the former Biagio Steps Examination Centre in Valletta. The project was led by Spiteri. Entrance to the FIC Works to convert the former examination hall began in 2010 under the direction of the architect Norbert Gatt, and the completion date was set to be sometime in 2011. The project was originally expected to cost €436,000, but it eventually amounted to €1.7 million. 85% of the funds were provided by the European Regional Development Fund. The centre was opened by Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi on 16 February 2013. It is run by the Restoration Directorate of the Ministry for Resources and Rural Affairs, and its curator is Stephen C. Spiteri. The conversion of the dilapidated warehouse into the centre won the Din l-Art Ħelwa Silver Medal Award in 2012, and the centre was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by TripAdvisor in 2015. The building The building (centre) in 1860; photo by Giorgio Sommer Façade of the FIC, with the coat of arms of Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle in the centre The FIC is housed in a large 16th-century building located at St. Mark's Street in Valletta, close to St. Andrew's Bastion and the now-demolished Marsamxett Gate. It has a plain façade adorned with the coat of arms of Grand Master Hugues Loubenx de Verdalle, suggesting that the building was built sometime between 1582 and 1595. The building's original purpose is not known, but it might have been a bombproof magazine or warehouse. The upper floor was used as an artillery school (). The upper floor of the building was damaged by aerial bombardment in World War II and its roof was subsequently demolished. The rest of the structure was later used as an examination hall known as the Biagio Steps Examination Centre. At some points it was also used as a rehearsal space. The building was chosen to house the FIC because of its large interior spaces and its location adjoining the fortifications of Valletta. Between 2010 and 2013, the building was restored and its upper floor was rebuilt, while an annexe was constructed. The new parts of the building were built in line with sustainable principles. It has been re constructed due to fails in the rocks. Display and exhibits Porta Reale (scheduled as Class B) The Fortifications Interpretation Centre contains exhibits relating to both military architecture in general as well as the various fortifications of Malta, starting from the Bronze Age walls at Borġ in-Nadur to the pillboxes built by the British in World War II. Exhibits include a number of detailed scale models, which are presented along with audio-visual presentations and informative charts. A few artifacts, such as a 17th-century drawbridge that was probably originally installed at Valletta's Porta Reale, are also displayed. The bridge is scheduled with a status of Class B.https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/DOI/Government%20Gazette/PA%20GN/Documents/2008/GG%2028.3.pdf Medieval stone block bearing the coat of arms of Guglielmo Murina, discovered at Mdina in 2012 The centre also contains a lecture hall and a reference library, which are intended for researchers. Another section is dedicated to children. The centre occasionally houses art exhibitions. The centre is open everyday except for Sundays and public holidays.

They are Poland's largest immigrant community whose culture is not European, and are often perceived by the Polish public as being one of the largest, if not the largest, minorities in Poland; the factual verification of that claim is difficult due to lack of precise data.

History Poland–Vietnam relations grew from the 1950s and 1980s student exchange programs, during which time both Poland and Vietnam were communist countries.Nowicka, p.216-217 Following the Polish transition to a capitalist economy in 1990, Poland became a more attractive immigration destination for the Vietnamese people, in particular, small entrepreneurs; this triggered a second, larger wave of Vietnamese immigrants to Poland.Nowicka, p.216-217 Many began as vendors in the open air market bazaar at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium selling clothes or cheap food; , there were between 1,100 and 1,200 Vietnamese-owned stands in the area. in Warsaw there were an estimated 500 Vietnamese restaurants, mostly serving fast food. The 10th-Anniversary Stadium has been called the center of the Vietnamese-Polish community. The Vietnamese community is also served by a number of non-governmental organizations, run by the community itself. =Historical similarities= Both Poland and Vietnam are two countries with large and an undeniable history, and also being invaded and ruled by two larger communist countries: Russia and China, therefore, Poles and Vietnamese share a history together against foreign invasions. Many Polish experts are very excited on cooperating with Vietnam in counter to the threats from Russia, as Vietnam also wants to cooperate with Poland to fight China as well.

Other missionary organizations, including the Finnish Lutheran Mission (FLM), the Finnish Lutheran Overseas Mission (FLOM), and the Lutheran Evangelical Association of Finland (LEAF), joined the efforts to run the school.

It opened on 30 December 2018. Until Sheremetyevskaya opens in 2022, this station will serve as the terminus of both lines. During planning and construction, this station was named \\"Nizhnyaya Maslovka\\" () for the street on which it is located. Before opening, the metro changed the name to be consistent with the other connected stations. History Construction on the station began in 2012. At first, the city intended to use typical underground tunneling methods for the station, which is 65 meters underground. Project engineers suggested a new technology that would involve a single-vaulted design that is more commonly used for shallow stations constructed using cut-and-cover methods. This could reduce the construction time from 36 to 24 months. The city originally expected the station to be ready by 2016. This later was pushed to 2017 and, eventually, the beginning of 2019. Because of the time and difficulty of building such deep stations, the Head of Construction for Moscow Marat Khusnullin said that this would be the last deep station built in Moscow.  Location  It is in the near Nizhnyaya Maslovka and Butyrsky Val streets in the Maryina roshcha District of Moscow near the Moscow Savyolovsky railway station. There is a free interchange to Savyolovskaya station on the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya line, which provides access to central Moscow.Постановление Правительства Москвы №564-ПП от 24 июня 2008 г. It also serves the nearby Savyolovsky railway station. Passengers are able to access the station through two underground lobbies. Design The walls of the station are not covered in panels or concrete; rather, they are covered in glass such that passengers can see the structure of the tunnels. Otherwise, the platforms and vestibules have marble and granite floors and walls.

It is part of the \\"Affinity trinity\\" alongside Affinity Designer and Affinity Publisher. Affinity Photo is available for purchase in the macOS App Store, iOS App Store, and the Microsoft Store.  Functionality  Affinity Photo serves as a successor to PhotoPlus, which Serif discontinued in 2017 in order to focus on the Affinity product range. It has been described as an Adobe Photoshop alternative, and is compatible with common file formats such as Adobe's PSD (including Photoshop Smart Objects). Functionality includes RAW processing, colour space options, live previews as effects are applied, as well as Image stitching, alpha compositing, black point compensation, and optical aberration corrections. Working in Affinity Photo is always live, with pan and zoom at 60fps and non-destructive editing. It supports unlimited layers and a dedicated workspace for developing RAW photos; as well as RGB, CMYK, LAB, Greyscale colour spaces with ICC colour management and 16-bit per channel editing. Affinity Photo is not an image organiser like Apple Aperture or Adobe Lightroom, however Serif have confirmed they are developing one. Development Affinity Photo began as a raster graphics editor solely for macOS. It was Serif's second macOS app, and (like Affinity Designer) was built from the ground up to leverage core native technologies, including Grand Central Dispatch, Core Graphics, OpenGL and Metal 2 hardware acceleration. Serif established an R&D; team for Affinity Photo in 2009, headed by lead designer Andy Somerfield. A free beta test version of the Affinity Photo app was released to the public on 9 February 2015. The initial stable release of Affinity Photo, version 1.3.1, launched on the Mac App Store 9 July 2015 for macOS 10.7 and later. At that time, Serif's raster graphics application for Windows was PhotoPlus; however, following the release of Affinity Photo for Windows, this product has now been discontinued. Version 1.3.5 of Affinity Photo, released in August, provided numerous bug fixes and improvements. Serif announced its first major update to Affinity Photo in December 2015. Version 1.4 added panorama photo stitching as well as support for macOS 10.11 El Capitan, including six Affinity extensions for Apple Photos. Updates to both Affinity apps (Designer and Photo) provided language support for Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Japanese and Chinese (Simplified). These augumented the four languages in previous versions: English (US and UK), German, French and Spanish. Stability and bug fixes were released with Affinity Photo 1.4.1 and 1.4.2, in January and June 2016. Version 1.4.3 in September 2016 optimised Affinity Photo for macOS 10.12 Sierra. In December, 2016, Serif launched Affinity Photo for Windows, and released an update to the macOS version at the same time, Affinity Photo 1.5.1 added a 32-bit RGB editing mode with support for 32-bit file formats and more than 70 new camera RAW file formats, as well as the ability to develop RAW files directly into a 32-bit document. Version 1.5.1 also added support for the new MacBook Pro with Touchbar. Serif launched Affinity Photo for iPad during the keynote at Apple's WWDC in San Jose on 5 June 2017. In September 2017, the iPad version was updated for compatibility with Apple's new iOS 11. Serif released major updates to Affinity Photo, as well as Affinity Designer, in November 2017. Affinity Photo 1.6.6 was optimized for macOS 10.13 High Sierra (and Metal 2 acceleration), better integration with Apple Photos, improved Photoshop Plugins support and added an option to switch between a dark or light user interface. In February 2020, version 1.8 of Photo added support for Photoshop smart objects in PSD files, and expanded plug-in compatibility, with focus on DxO's Nik Collection of plug-ins. Reception The macOS version of Affinity Photo was received favourably by professional photographers, and Apple named it as the best Mac app of 2015. In 2016, Affinity Photo was awarded the prize for Best Imaging Software by the Technical Image Press Association (TIPA) at Photokina. In November 2017, the iOS app was named by Apple as its best iPad app of the year, and Tom's Guide selected Affinity Photo for their first list of Best Tech Values. In February 2019, Affinity Photo received Amateur Photographer's Software of the Year award, followed by Photography News' Best Software award in March 2019.

This facility was run by the National Security Agency (NSA) until 2004 as part of ECHELON, and later, after transfer to the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), was used by the Special US Liaison Activity Germany, where the NSA and BND jointly analysed data captured under Operation Eikonal. Operation Eikonal is a collaboration between the National Security Agency (NSA) and Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) for the sharing of telephony and internet data captured in Germany. It is based on an agreement that dates to 2002, and is part of the NSA operation \\"RAMPART-A\\". Surveillance started in 2003, telephony data was collected from 2004 onwards, and all internet traffic from the Deutsche Telekom (DT) switching center in Frankfurt was captured starting in 2005. To obtain the data, the BND and DT worked together. The agents rented two rooms in the DT data center in Frankfurt where the fiber optic data cable owned by DT was spliced into, and a copy of the data was captured. DT received 6000 euros monthly for its role in giving access to data. A filtering program named Dafis was used to prevent the sharing of data from German citizens; however, that filter was estimated to be only 95% effective, meaning that 5% of data was obtained in breach of Germany's constitution (Grundgesetz). Later, during parliamentary hearings conducted on November 6, 2014, one witness claimed that the 95% figure was only correct for the initial testing and that during operation, 99% of data from German citizens was filtered out. In January 2006, the Bad Aibling branch of the BND reported to its headquarters in Pullach that the \\"selectors\\" (search terms) used by the NSA under the programme included some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and the Eurocopter project as well as French administration. These selectors were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue; their October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations. The BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court – instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a \\"person of trust\\" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-page report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) – including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude. While the magnitude differs, there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states. Klaus Landefeld, member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system. Information on Operation Eikonal was first unveiled by Süddeutsche Zeitung, Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Westdeutscher Rundfunk on October 3, 2014. Although some documents suggested that the operation had been completed in 2008, it was revealed that in December 2012, there were still transfers of 500 million metadata per month being made. Of these 500 million datasets, 180 million were captured using XKeyscore. Austrian member of parliament Peter Pilz described the operation as \\"the first successful attempt at mass surveillance of European telecommunications\\".

These are typically carved from bamboo or jade with ornate motifs symbolising concepts such as longevity. Antique examples are now valued highly. The brushes would be rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape and point.  Background  = In China = Bamboo curved brush pots were likely to be first produced in China, given that the use of bamboo to create articles originated there. = In Korea = After Neo-Confucianism was welcomed as the formal doctrine in Korea at the beginning of the Joseon era, the new intellectually aware and literate yangban replaced aristocrats and Buddhist monks. These yangban consisted of civil servants and military officials. This new elite ruling class spent a significant part of their time in writing calligraphy alongside reading. To satisfy this new demand, production of brush pots started in Korea.  Structure  Made in wood, stone, porcelain and bamboo, brush pots were mostly cylindrical and were often decorated with traditional symbols inscribed on their body. During the Joseon era the royal family exclusively used the dragon motif for their brush pots. Later on the dragon decoration became a common theme. In China, Ivory for its plain but jade-like texture is considered an excellent material for brush pots. Ivory is used in Chinese brush pots because of its resemblance to bamboo.  Value  High quality period Chinese brush pots can fetch high prices. In 2012, a Chinese brush pot made of bamboo was donated to a Bristol-based charity shop. When the shop sold the brush pot to raise funds for St Peter's Hospice, it was sold for £360,000 even though the rim had been mended with glue and the bamboo frame had a substantial crack. Examination of the brush pot discovered that it was made between 1662 and 1722 by Gu Jue, a well known old master of the time. In the Skinner Asian Arts Auction, an 18th-century bamboo Chinese brush pot was sold for $539,500. The pot was inscribed with detailed figures of immortals and animals set in mountainous landscapes. In March 2019, the Art Institute of Chicago de- accessioned 22 Chinese jade carvings at a sale at Sotheby’s New York. A white jade “Imperial Procession” brushpot from the Qing dynasty was sold for US$2,060,000.  Uses  Brush pots were used by Chinese and Korean scholars between the 18th and 19th century. Calligraphy brushes were generally kept in the brush pots but intermittently, they were also used to stock paper rolls (rolled-up papers) hence they are sometime also called paper holders.

The messroom girl Margit Johnsen from Ålesund in centre, receiving British Empire Medal from Rear Admiral J.S.M. Ritchie. Margit Johnsen Godø, , nicknamed Malta- Margit, (31 January 1913 – 20 July 1987) was a Norwegian sailor in the merchant navy. For her service on a merchant vessel in convoy to Malta in 1942 she was awarded the St. Olav's Medal with Oak Branch and several other gallantry decorations. Johnsen continued her work in the Norwegian merchant fleet until 1960. Her story is told in maritime and wartime history as an example of Norwegian women's effort during World War II. Torpedoed in June 1940 Johnsen worked for the Norwegian shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen as a messroom girl.«Do or die» , WW World, nr. 3–4, 2009, pp. 38–39. She worked on board MV Tudor, which was in the Mediterranean Sea when Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940.\\"M/S Tudor\\", from the website warsailors.com. The ship left Gibraltar on 12 June and sailed in convoy for United Kingdom. On 19 June 1940 MV Tudor was torpedoed and sunk northwest of Cape Finisterre by the German submarine . Johnsen and the rest of the crew, except one, survived the sinking. Suicide convoy to Malta 1942 HMS Cleopatra and HMS Euryalus have engaged Italian warships on 22 March 1942. Smoke is dispersed between the convoy and the Italian attackers, so the merchant vessels can escape. As the Axis powers laid siege to the strategically important British colony of Malta in 1942, Johnsen was sailing on MV Talabot, a general cargo vessel trading in the Mediterranean Sea. While in Alexandria in Egypt her vessel was ordered to join a convoy for Malta.Rasmussen 1964, pp. 77–81, 89. Due to great losses the Malta Convoys were known as the death convoys.Rasmussen 1964, pp. 64–65. The convoy that Margit Johnsen's vessel was about to join, with the codename MW10, was known as a suicide mission.\\"M/S Talabot\\", from the website warsailors.com Albert Toft, the captain on MV Talabot, granted Johnsen permission to leave the vessel in Egypt, but she declined the offer and choose to stay with her shipmates on the dangerous voyage. The four general cargo vessels in the convoy were three British; MV Breconshire, MV Clan Campbell, MV Pampas and the Norwegian MV Talabot. They were loaded with supplies such as ammunition, gasoline, paraffin, coal and grain as well as other goods that the besieged island needed. The importance of the convoy was shown by the fact that the four merchant ships was escorted by 20 British warships (4 cruisers and 16 destroyers) under the command of Rear admiral Philip Vian; an escort of 4 warships for 20 merchant ships was usually viewed as good.Dannevig 1968, pp. 80–81, 141. The convoy departed Alexandria on 20 March 1942 and was attacked two days later by Italian warships and Italian and German aircraft. The engagement is known as the Second Battle of Sirte. MV Breconshire was heavily damaged and MV Clan Campbell was sunk, but MV Pampas and MV Talabot reached Malta. In the harbour of Valletta MV Talabot met new attacks from German and Italian aircraft while the unloading proceeded. The ship was hit by bombs, caught fire and was scuttled by its crew to avoid explosions of ammunition and fuel. Both during the passage from Alexandria and while in harbour in Valletta, Johnsen stood out for her courage and braveness in her support for the crew. The captain calculated her behaviour to be of great importance for maintaining morale. Together with the captain and the ship's cat, Johnsen was the last from the crew to leave MV Talabot when the ship was evacuated on 27 March 1942. The story of Margit Johnsen is told in books about the Norwegian merchant navy during World War II as an example of women's contribution to the war effort.Steen 1948, s. 295.Hjeltnes 1995, pp. 293–294, 311.Lønnå 2010, pp. 103–105. After the sinking Johnsen was sent from Malta to the United Kingdom. She continued to work on Norwegian merchant ships and served on MV Tarifa, MV Tai Yin, MV Toulouse and finally the MT Fagerfjell, which she returned with to Norway in December 1945.Lønnå 2010, p. 104. After the war Johnsen sailed on Norwegian merchant vessels until around 1960.\\"Minneord. Margit Johnsen Godø\\", Sunnmørsposten, 28 July 1987, p. 8. She married and took the surname Godø.

The phrase \\"long march\\" is a reference to the prolonged struggle of the Chinese communists, which included a physical Long March of their army across China.

Reported as a subspecies of Persoonia nutans in 1981, it was described as a species by Lawrie Johnson and his colleague Peter Weston in 1991. Two subspeciesP.t.terminalis and P.t.recurvaare recognised; both are found on well-drained acidic soils in sclerophyll forests, and P.t.terminalis is also found on granite outcrops. Although similar in appearance, they differ in leaf length and curvature. Both have a restricted range, with P.t.terminalis found in an area of under . P.terminalis grows to , with an upright or spreading habit, and narrow short leaves up to in length. The yellow flowers mainly appear in December and January (Australia's temperate zone summer), and are followed by purple- striped green drupes (stone fruit). The fruit of persoonias are edible, and dispersed by wild vertebrates.  Taxonomy  Persoonia terminalis was first reported by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of Flora of New South Wales.The citation is collected in Flora of New South Wales, Volume 2, , p. 14 He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of Persoonia nutans, a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed P.terminalis as part of Persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work Flora of South-eastern Queensland. They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the P. oxycoccoides from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining Persoonia nutans and Persoonia oxycoccoides, Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that Persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected south of the Torrington pub on the Emmaville–Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of New South Wales, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name Persoonia is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name terminalis refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung. It is classified within the genus as within the Lanceolata group, which consists of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other in areas where two members of the group occur. P.terminalis has been reported to interbreed with Persoonia cornifolia and Persoonia sericea, two other members of the group. Two subspecies are recognised: P.t.subsp.recurva has shorter leaves, with margins more curved downwards, that reach a maximum of in length, while P.t.subsp.terminalis has longer, straighter leaves measuring a maximum of long.  Description  Persoonia terminalis subsp. recurva Persoonia terminalis grows as a shrub reaching a height of , with an upright or spreading habit. It has smooth bark, although new growth is covered in fine hair. The small, narrow leaves are wide and long, with a convex upper surface and margins curved downwards. New leaves can be hairless or slightly hairy; if the latter, they lose the hair with age. They are concolorousthat is, both leaf surfaces are the same colour, or slightly discolorous (surfaces slightly different). The leaves are rougher than those of other persoonias. The yellow flowers mainly appear in December and January (summer in the temperate zone of Australia), although occasional flowers have been seen as late as July. They are terminal, that is, arising at the ends of branchlets, where they appear in groups of one to five. P.terminalis is described as mostly anauxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a scale leaf at its junction with the stem. A proportion of flowers have a true leaf at this junction instead, and are described as auxotelic. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth that splits into four segments or tepals, and contains both male and female parts. Within this, the central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located at the tip of the style. Flowers are followed by the development of the fleshy purple-striped green drupes. These are long by wide, with the remnant style at the end.  Distribution and habitat  Persooniat.subsp.terminalis is found in the Torrington-Binghi area on the western parts of the far Northern Tablelands in New South Wales, roughly halfway between Glen Innes and the Queensland border, at an altitude of between above sea level. It grows on acidic, sandy or stony granite soils in dry sclerophyll forest. The region is dotted with granite outcrops, where the subspecies is a component of Babingtonia odontocalyx'Brachyloma saxicola shrubland and Prostanthera staurophylla'Kunzea bracteolata low shrubland in the Torrington area, and Allocasuarina brachystachya shrubland in the Severn River Reserve. It is rated 2R on the ROTAP list. Persooniat.subsp.recurva has two disjunct populations. One is found on the North Western Slopes in New South Wales, near Warialda north west of Inverell, and the other is southwest of Inglewood in southeastern Queensland, between above sea level. It grows on acidic sandstone-based sandy soils in dry sclerophyll forest. Within the Warialda State Conservation Area, it is found in black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri)dirty gum (Eucalyptus chloroclada) woodland and smooth-barked apple (Angophora leiocarpa)black cypress pine woodland. Although P.t.recurva has not been recorded from Kings Plains National Park, it could be expected to be found there due to the availability of suitable habitat. It is rated as 3R on the ROTAP list. Both subspecies are commonly found near the Severn River Nature Preserve, as well as in the Arakoola Nature Reserve, where they are components of a woodland ecological community dominated by smooth-barked apple and long-fruited bloodwood (Corymbia dolichocarpa), which grows on sandstone soils.  Ecology  Persoonia terminalis grows in a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is essential for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less than five years, which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire. Colletid bees of subgenus Cladocerapis within the genus Leioproctus exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, but do not appear to be effective pollinators. The fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds.  Cultivation potential  Horticulturists and scientists Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones have proposed that cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, and is expected to fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by any means in cultivation.

Persoonia laxa grew as a spreading or prostrate shrub with smooth bark. The flat leaves were 8–15 mm long and 1–1.8 mm wide and linear in shape. The leaf margins were recurved. The new growth is covered in sparse hairs. P. laxa is described as auxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a leaf at its junction with the stem. Known as pedicels, these smooth and measure 6–8 mm in length. The flowers occur in groups of one to three. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused for most of their length, within which are both male and female parts. The tepals are long and smooth on the outside. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. Two specimens were collected in what are now Sydney's Northern Beaches—one from Newport in November 1907 and the other from Manly in June 1908. The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995, and P. laxa was placed in the Lanceolata group, a group of 54 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur, A third specimen, collected in 1922 from Dee Why, appears to be intermediate between (and is possibly a hybrid of) P. laxa and P. levis. Because of limited observation and its disappearance and presumed extinction, little is known about its flowering and fruit. Occurring in Newport and Manly in central- eastern N.S.W, P. laxa was thought to have been a component of heath or dry sclerophyll eucalypt woodland or forest on sandstone soils, or possibly in sandy soils on the coast. P. laxa grew at an altitude of 0–20 m with an annual rainfall of 1200–1400 mm. Persoonia laxa is listed nationally as extinct under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

Cheyney George Waldron Cheyney (September 1, 1854August 14, 1903) was an American businessman and politician. While living in Tombstone, Arizona Territory he served four years as the territory's Superintendent of Public Instruction and was twice elected to the territorial legislature. In his later years he was postmaster for Tucson, Arizona before being elected a probate judge. Life and career Cheyney was born to Weldon J. and Frances (Potts) Cheyney on September 1, 1854 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of eight children, his father was a businessman who had served as a captain during the American Civil War and his mother was from an old Quaker family. While growing up, Cheyney was educated in local public schools. He moved to New York City in 1871 where he worked for an optician. Cheyney returned to Philadelphia in 1877. In 1879, Cheyney went to Atchison, Kansas before continuing on to Leadville, Colorado. He moved to Tombstone, Arizona Territory in 1881. There he became superintendent for the Tombstone Mill & Mining Company. Cheyney married Annie Neal of Atchison, Kansas on September 20, 1882. The union produced six daughters: Bernice, Frances, Mary, Ruth, Edith, and Eleanor. Socially, Cheyney became a Mason in Tombstone. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen and Knights Templar. Politically, Cheyney was active in Republican politics. He was a member of the Cochise county and territorial central committees. Cheyney was elected to represent Cochise county in the Council (upper house) during the 15th Arizona Territorial Legislature. During the session, he fulfilled two campaign promises by voting to block any new subdividing of counties and for moving the territorial capital from Prescott to Phoenix. Cheyney was sworn in as Superintendent of Public Instruction on April 11, 1889, having been appointed to the office three days earlier. He was appointed to a second two-year term in 1891. In 1890, Cheyney was the Republican challenger to Arizona's territorial delegate to Congress, Mark Smith. While his vote to move the territorial capital to Phoenix was considered hostile by the residents of Prescott, Cheyney's supporters used his vote as an example of his loyalty to the people he represented. They also argued that a Republican delegate would have more influence with the Harrison administration. Despite these arguments, he lost the election to Smith. Cheyney was a delegate to Arizona's 1891 constitutional convention. His second term in the territorial legislature came during the 1893 session. Cheyney resigned as superintendent to serve in the legislature. In June 1898, Cheyney was appointed postmaster for Tucson. He arrived in Tucson to assume his new duties at the end of the month. In 1902, Cheyney was elected probate judge for Pima County and took office on January 1, 1903. In his final weeks, he traveled to San Francisco, California to seek medical treatment from George E. Goodfellow. Cheyney died as a result of edema on August 14, 1903. He was buried in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Beyond his varied business interests, he was a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature and served one term as Mayor of Tucson. Biography Hoff was born to Charles F. and Ernestine (Korth) Hoff near Dresden, Saxony on December 7, 1852. His family moved to Yorktown, Texas in 1855. Young Hoff received the bulk of his education in Yorktown schools. In 1865, during the turbulence following the American Civil War, his family returned to Germany. He attended a local gymnasium for two years before his family returned to the United States. In 1874, Hoff joined his father driving mule teams in Utah's Little Cottonwood Canyon. The next year his family moved to San Bernardino, California. Hoff worked with his father in the freight business until 1877, when his father left to work in mining in Arizona and New Mexico territories. Following the breakup of the family business, the younger Hoff worked as a clerk for Hellman, Haas & Co. of Los Angeles for three years. On September 11, 1880, Hoff married Alice A. Ford. The union produced five children: Mamie, Pearl, Clara, Florence and Louis. Hoff moved to Tucson, Arizona Territory to work for the German Fruit Company in 1881. Nine months later he was in the employ of C. Seligmann & Co. When that business closed he joined with his brother, Charles, to form Hoff Brothers. The partnership lasted about a year before failing. Hoff then went to work for L. Zeckendorf & Company. Fraternally, Hoff was a Mason and held memberships in the Ancient Order of United Workmen, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Spanish-American Association, Woodmen of the World, and Knights of Pythias. His wife is credited as being the first Christian scientist in Tucson and after the couple purchased a house in 1887 their home became the city's first meeting place for the Christian Science Church. In 1888, Hoff served one term on the Tucson city council. Following his term on the city council, Hoff's friends arraigned for a Democratic party nomination for a seat in the territorial legislature. Hoff won election and represented Pima County in the House of Representatives (lower house) during the 1891 session. During his term, he served as a member of the judiciary committee, as chairman of the ways and means committee, and as chairman of the special committee in charge of the funding act. The session saw Hoff introduce more bills than any other member of the House. He successfully guided a bill instituting the Australian ballot (secret ballot) into law. His support of a women's suffrage bill resulted in him being labeled \\"Petticoat Hoff\\". In 1892, Hoff formed the Tucson Grocery Company with partners L.G. Radulovich and A.V Grossetta. Five years later he became a founder of the Tucson Hardware Company. In this role he advertised himself as \\"Hoff of Tucson\\". His other business interests included being organizer and secretary of the Citizen's Building and Loan Association, secretary of the Tucson Board of Trade, and various mining interests. Politically, he was a member of the Pima County Central Democratic Committee. Hoff served as Mayor of Tucson from January 1899 till January 1901. The biggest accomplishment during his term was the city's purchase of the local waterworks. Other accomplishments included construction of graded roads, installation of cement sidewalks, and creation of a new sewer system. After leaving office, Hoff became a manager for L.H. Manning Co., a firm that operated stores from El Paso, Texas to Portland, Oregon along the Southern Pacific Railroad. Hoff died in Tucson on February 18, 1930. He was buried in Tucson's Evergreen cemetery. Tucson's Hoff Street (now Hoff Avenue) was named for him and his brother.

It is a redundant church and a Grade II* listed building. The church was built by Henry Goodridge for Charles Daubeny, the Archdeacon of Sarum. At that time Rode Hill was in Wiltshire while the adjacent village of Rode was in Somerset, and Daubeny wished to deter parishioners from attending Rode's church, St Lawrence, which was over the border and within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Therefore he raised subscriptions for the building of the new church at Rode Hill. The design with a tall nave and chancel was inspired by King's College Chapel, Cambridge. The church was a chapelry of North Bradley until 1933, when it was reassigned to the parish of Rode. A bell cast for the church by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1823 did not have enough room to swing and was used for static chiming. When the church was declared redundant in 1995 and sold into private hands, the bell was obtained by the Keltek Trust and is now in a church in Menangle, New South Wales. In the 1990s the fabric of the church was in need of repair and in 1993 a corbel fell into the church. Following this, insurance cover was withdrawn and insufficient funds could be found for the repair. After the church was made redundant, repairs were needed to the south steeple and roof which were supported by a grant from English Heritage. The church now serves as a house and shop for Andrew Hooker Violins. It is also used for music concerts.

Moving to Arizona Territory with his brother in 1867 to open a mercantile business, his business interests expanded into financial services and he was a co-founder of Tucson's first bank. Politically he was a member of the Arizona Territorial Legislature and served as territorial treasurer. Early years Jacobs was born in London, England on July 10, 1840 to Mark Israel and Hannah (Solomon) Jacobs. He was the third of twelve children. His family moved to Baltimore in 1844 and young Jacobs was educated in local schools. His father went to California as part of the California Gold Rush with the rest of the family joining him in San Diego by 1851. There, the younger Jacobs helped establish the San Diego Lyceum and Debating Club and served as the group's first secretary. His family moved to San Bernardino in 1859, where, with the help of a partner, they operated two stores and a hotel. Relocation to Tucson In April 1867, Jacobs' father spotted an announcement in the San Francisco Chronicle that the capital of Arizona Territory would be relocated to Tucson on November 1 of that year. Realizing the influx of governmental and military would likely cause Tucson's population to double to over 5,000 inhabitants, the elder Jacobs decided to send Lionel and his brother Barron to establish a branch of the family store in the new capital. Upon their arrival in Tucson, the brothers spent a day surveying the town, introducing themselves to the locals, and locating a store to rent. They initially saw great success, quickly selling the load of merchandise they had brought with them along with two additional shipments from California. In June 1868, a shipment of merchandise was lost when the ship carrying it sank after striking a log embedded in a sandbar. The loss of the shipment forced the family business to declare bankruptcy. For a month, Lionel worked to fix problems with the way the business had shipped merchandise from California while his father came to terms with their creditors. In September 1868, the brothers received another shipment of merchandise and were back in business. To improve business, the brothers spent their evenings in the town's saloons getting to know their customers. Lionel quickly learned enough Spanish to converse with the Mexican population. The brothers also became known for their ability to obtain hard to find items. They obtained \\"uncommon items like mirrors, violin and flute sheet music ... everything from hairpins to harmonicas\\" for their customers. By 1870, the brothers were able to invest their profits from the store into other ventures. Expansion into financial activities Due to the expense of transporting goods to Tucson, most goods sold there demanded very high prices. A barrel of flour that could be purchased for $4 or $5 in San Francisco could go for $25 in Tucson. Due to these high prices, Tucson merchants were often forced to accept payment in instalments. Taking their father's advice to remember \\"the great power of money\\" and to \\"deal less in calico and more in money\\", the brothers began to offer other financial services to their customers. At the time, Arizona Territory faced a shortage of hard currency. Banks outside the territory refused to ship money to Tucson due to the risk of robbery. Meanwhile, people in the territory avoided using banknotes because it was difficult to determine the fair value of a note issued by a distant bank. This limited the supply of currency to greenbacks and gold or silver coins. Between these two option, coins where the preferred currency. Greenbacks traded at a discount in Tucson, usually being worth between 65¢ and 85¢ on the dollar. In California, where hard currency was relatively abundant, greenbacks commanded a higher price. Seeing an arbitrage opportunity in early 1870, the brothers opened a currency exchange within their mercantile business. Their father began mailing $200 in gold coins every week. The brothers exchanged the gold for greenbacks and shipped the paper money back to their father in San Francisco where it was used to buy more gold coins. By the end of they year the brothers were exchanging $4000/month, generating roughly $1000/month in profits. At the same time, the southern Arizona economy benefited from an increased availability of hard currency. From their currency exchange, the brothers expanded into other financial services. In 1871, six years before the territory's first bank opened, they began offering loans. In 1875, they began to accept deposits and storing personal items in their company's safe. The same year, with the retirement of their father, the store name was changed to L. M. Jacobs & Company. A debt collection service was later added. Founding of Pima County Bank By November 1877, Tucson was quickly growing and developments such as the railroads reaching Yuma and Ed Schieffelin's discovery of silver at Tombstone promised to accelerate the trend. The brothers decided to invest their resources and found a bank operating separately from their mercantile business, but were initially unable to raise the needed capital. They eventually partnered with Pinckney R. Tully, E. B. Gage, and others to open the Pima County Bank on January 2, 1879. While Phillip William Smith was elected the bank's first president, Jacobs was named as cashier and placed in charge of the bank's day-to-day operations. A rival bank, established by Anson P. K. Safford and James Henry Toole and others, opened three months later. Despite concerns that Tucson lacked the resources to support two banks, both establishments thrived for several years. In January 1880, Jacobs turned over his position as cashier to his brother Barron. With the growing demand imposed upon them by being bankers, the Jacobs brothers ended operation of their mercantile business in February 1880. Jacobs and his brother continued to work at the Pima County Bank for the next three decades. From 1882 to 1885, the bank operated as the First National Bank of Tucson under a national charter. Between 1883 and 1890, Jacobs oversaw the Tombstone branch of the bank, which became an independent venture under the Cochise County Bank name. An economic downturn during the mid-1880s lead to the Tucson branch being renamed the Bank of Tucson before it found additional investors and became the Consolidated Bank of Tucson. The Cochise County Bank was closed in early 1890 following the closure of the Tombstone's mines. Political activity Besides his business interests, Jacobs became active in civic matters. He was appointed to the Pima County Board of Supervisors on January 3, 1871. A week later he was elected the board's chairman. Jacobs was elected to the 1873 session of the territorial legislature. This was followed closely by him being appointed territorial treasurer. The appointment occurred after his brother, Barron, vacated the position because the territorial legislature refused to confirm his nomination. Jacobs signed his oath of office on March 7, 1873 and resigned on July 9 to allow Pinckney R. Tully to take the position. Jacobs was one of three delegates sent to Washington, D.C. in 1901 to lobby the U.S. Congress for Arizona statehood and he represented the territory at the Trans- Mississippi Commercial Congress. Personal life Beyond his business interests, Jacobs was socially active. He was active in the Arizona Social Club and Tucson Literary Society while being an off and on member of Tucson's Owls Club between 1891 and 1899. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he oversaw Tucson's victim relief fund. Jacobs married Bertha Frank of San Francisco on June 15, 1909. Lionel and Bertha had no children.

Early life and marriage Rouse was born to Joshua and Tabitha (Souther) Rouse in Florence, Kentucky, on January 4, 1843. While he was still a child, his family moved to Monroe County, Missouri. He was educated in local schools before he began reading law under a local attorney. He graduated from the Union Law School in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1867. Following graduation, Rouse practiced law in Paris, Missouri, before moving to Moberly. He was a member of the Missouri State Senate from 1880 until 1884. While in office, he served as chairman of the committee on criminal jurisprudence. Rouse married Louisa Mosley in the early 1870s. The union produced one son, Charles Oma Rouse. Career Following the inauguration of President Grover Cleveland, Rouse requested appointment as a judge in either Utah or New Mexico Territory. He expanded his list to include Arizona Territory several months later. He was appointed Arizona's United States District Attorney on November 2, 1885. Justice William Wood Porter administered Rouse's oath of office on November 20. On May 24, 1889, following the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison, Rouse submitted his resignation. He remained in Tucson, and established a private legal practice. Fraternally, he was a Mason and served as grand commander for the Knights Templar. President Cleveland returned to office and nominated Rouse to become an Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on April 25, 1893. He was assigned to district two, comprising Gila, Graham, and Pinal counties. Rouse lived in Solomonville during his years on the court. When rumors circulated in 1895 and 1896 that Chief Justice Albert C. Baker planned to resign, Rouse's friends began lobbying for him to be made the new Chief Justice. As a member of the territorial supreme court, Rouse wrote over two dozen opinions covering a wide range of topics. In Gray v. Noonan, 5 Arizona 167 (1897), he dealt with attachment of property during the execution of a judgement while In re Sydow, 4 Arizona 207 (1894) involved the licensing of shopkeepers. Arizona Lumber and Timber Company v. Mooney, 4 Arizona 366 (1895) dealt with the impact of a hierarchical employment relationship in personal injury cases. Meyers c. Culver, 4 Arizona 145 was concerned with the elections for justices of the peace. In The United States v. Chung Sing, 4 Arizona 217 (1894), Rouse set a pair of precedents. First, he found that while either party in a jury trial could request a particular item be included in a set of jury instructions, the trial judge was not required to honor all requests. Second, a trial judge could set aside a jury's verdict without being overruled by an appellate court provided the judge had evidence to support his actions. Rouse's ruling in Harwood v. Wentworth, 4 Arizona 378 (1895), held that the version of a legislative act certified by the territorial secretary was authoritative even if it differed from version in the legislative journal. This decision was later confirmed by the United States Supreme Court. In Dunbar v. Territory of Arizona, 5 Arizona 184 (1897), Rouse overturned journalist John O. Dunbar's conviction for libeling the governor and territorial secretary because the trial court had both fined and sentenced the defendant to time in a county jail instead of following the normal procedure of sending a convicted defendant to the territorial prison. Rouse was close to completing his four- year term when his replacement was appointed. After leaving the bench, Rouse returned to his private legal practice in Tucson. In 1911, he was a candidate for a seat on the Arizona Supreme Court. He continued working at his legal practice until his death. Death Rouse died on September 8, 1919 in Tucson, Arizona, after suffering a stroke. He was buried in the Masonic section of Tucson's Evergreen Cemetery.

In addition to his political career, he was a Union officer during the American Civil War and served as editor for a number of publications in Nebraska and California. Biography Van Arman was born to Richard R. and Elizabeth (Roberts) Van Arman on February 17, 1839 in Euclid, Ohio. His family moved to Galena, Illinois in 1846 where the younger Van Arman received his education. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Van Arman became a lieutenant in the 58th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson and was severely wounded during the Battle of Shiloh. As a result of his wounds, he was medically discharged from the military on June 20, 1862. For the remainder of the war he served as a military recruiting superintendent for Illinois's 2nd congressional district. In 1868, Van Arman moved to Nebraska where he served as an immigration agent. He held that position until 1871 when he became editor of Lincoln's Nebraska State Journal. Van Arman married Isabella Haines in Lincoln on August 20, 1868. The couple had no children. Three years later Van Arman moved to San Francisco, California and became an editor for the Evening Post. Shortly thereafter he made his home in Oakland. In addition to his work for the Post, Van Arman was an editor for the Chronicle Bulletin and the Golden State Sentinel, the Ancient Order of United Workmen's official publication, and the sporting paper Pacific Life. During this time he wrote a book about the public lands of California and was active in Republican politics. President Chester A. Arthur nominated Van Arman to become Secretary of Arizona Territory on February 14, 1882. While he was under consideration for the position, one Arizona newspaper described him as \\"forty three years old, weighs two hundred and three pounds avoirdupois, stands five feet eight and a half inches high, wears a seven and a quarter hat, and number eight boots.\\" A less friendly newspaper described him as \\"a man of mediocre ability, a good absorber of whiskey and considered a little 'off' among his acquaintances.\\" In late March, Van Arman passed through Arizona on his way from California to Washington D.C. before returning to take his oath of office in Prescott on April 17. Upon taking office, Van Arman discovered a severe shortage of funds with which to perform his duties. Outgoing secretary John J. Gosper informed him that only $550 remained for his office of the funds allocated for 1881–2. This included no money for postage. Compounding this problem, Van Arman had no access to his predecessor's records. An example of the problems Van Arman faced came during the summer of 1882 when a shipment of one hundred rifles was sent by the War Department to Prescott. It was traditional for the territory to pay the shipping fees and it fell to Van Arman, in his role as Acting Governor during Governor Tritle's absence, to locate the needed funds. It took some time to find the money and afterwards he sent a telegram to the U.S. Treasury Department saying, \\"I have found a way out of the difficulty and will get the guns. The territory is quite poor in purse although rich in mineral wealth. All the citizens have a holy horror of being assessed, or paying taxes.\\" Initially, Van Arman's office was located in a school building away from Prescott's business district. The school wished for him to leave the building and he located new office space on June 1. The territorial secretary found there was no insurance on the territory's property despite Prescott being constructed entirely from wood and possessing minimal fire protection. To address this concern, Van Arman purchased a $2000 policy for $18. He also acquired a double-door safe for $450, allowing the territory a place to store incorporation documents and other archival records. Locating the money to pay this expense again presented a difficulty. For the convening of the 1883 session of the territorial legislature, Van Arman made arraignments for the session to meet in Prescott's city hall. A privately owned building, the structure delighted the legislators by providing freshly wallpapered walls, carpeted hallways to deaden sounds, lamps, stoves, and an ample supply of firewood. Following the practice of the day, Van Arman attempted to have all territorial printing jobs contracted to newspapers that favored his party. Towards this end he wrote to the legislature, saying \\"I do not wish to aid in sustaining party papers, which lampoon not only the Republican party generally, but all Federal officials indiscriminately and personally. In this stand I hope that I shall have your support and do not compel me to aid Democratic newspapers.\\" In the end, printing contracts for the session went to firms in San Francisco and Nebraska. Van Arman's problem with the Nebraska printing company was they did not follow his orders to bind all but twenty- five copies of the legislative journal in a paper binding costing 10¢ a copy but instead used a half-sheep binding costing 40¢ for all 250 copies. The territorial secretary later said, \\"How such a blunder could have been made is beyond my comprehension.\\" The convening of the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature presented Van Arman with another financial problem when members of the session demanded $4000 more in travel expenses than the secretary felt they were entitled. The secretary finally settled with most of the session's members based upon estimated travel distances, but had difficulty with the Council President, F. K. Ainsworth, who lived in the capital but claimed he could demand travel expenses from any county in the territory. With the approach of the 1884 elections, Van Arman was recommended to become the Republican nominee for territorial delegate to Congress by the Arizona Sentinel. The Democrats won the White House during the 1884 election, signalling the territorial secretary's term would soon end. Van Arman submitted his formal resignation on November 6, 1885 When the incoming secretary, James A. Bayard, arrived in Prescott, Van Arman met him at the rail station. Shortly after completing the transfer of office, Van Arman returned to California. In 1886, Van Arman was working as a traveling passenger agent for the Southern Pacific Railroad. He initially covered an area west of Detroit and Toledo, east of the Mississippi River, and north of St. Louis, but was soon reassigned to Chicago. Following the election of President William McKinley, Van Arman was a leading candidate to become Governor of Arizona Territory. Van Arman died in Oakland, California on April 28, 1904. His body was cremated. While his family owned a plot in Oakland's Mountain View Cemetery, his cremains were never placed there.

Wright began his first session as chief justice on March 21, 1887, having arrived in Prescott two days earlier. He received a salary from the Federal government of $3,000/year. The territory supplemented this with an additional $900/year. When Washington officials asked about the chief justice's high level of travel, Wright reminded Attorney General William H. H. Miller that his judicial district covered an area the size of Miller's home state of Indiana. As chief justice, Wright wrote fifteen majority opinions. He also wrote five dissenting opinions, an unusually large number for the era. His dissents could be rather lengthy. In 'Cheyney v. Smith, 3 Arizona 143 (1890), Wright wrote an eleven page dissent while his dissent in Bryan v. Pinney, 3 Arizona 34 (1889) reached twelve pages and the chief justice's dissent in a case determining if the territorial legislature's authorization for a maximum of 60 days referred to calendar days or working days. Two of the chief justice's majority opinions involved water rights. In Hill v. Normand, 2 Arizona 354 (1888), Wright found that while riparian rights were established under Common law, they were not the norm along the U.S. Pacific Coast while in Dalton v. Rentaria, 2 Arizona 275 (1887) he ruled against a party attempting to block access to the Santa Cruz river on the basis that territorial law was intended to promote development of the territory. The court ordered the local sheriff to seize a property after determining in O'Doherty v. Toole, 2 Arizona 288 (1887) that a defendant's attempt to sell ownership of his real property to his wife for one dollar was done fraudulently. Wright's opinion in Reilly v. Clark, 2 Arizona 299 (1888) determined the territorial supreme court would not overrule the discretionary power of a probate judge unless the judge clearly abused his authority. King v. Hawkins, 2 Arizona 258 (1888) dealt with a territorial official who attempted to reassign a portion of his salary to another person while United States v. Hart, 2 Arizona 415 (1888) involved an Indian agent who was allegedly misappropriating funds. Two of Wright's opinions were appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The appeals resulted in Ely v. New Mexico and Arizona Railroad Company, 2 Arizona 420 (1888) being reversed while Alta Mining and Smelting v. The Benson Mining and Smelting Co., 2 Arizona 362 (1888) was upheld. Following the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison, critics of the chief justice began calling for his removal. Accusations included charges that Wright was \\"arbitrary\\", that he displayed \\"very strong prejudges\\" and was part of the territorial Democratic machine. In addition to Wright's denials of the accusation, Buckey O'Neill came to his defense calling the accusations \\"outrageous and cowardly attacks\\" designed to place someone friendly to the railroads on the bench. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated the claims, and issued a report recommending Wright's removal. In a reference to Arizona's practice of paying a supplemental salary the report found \\"that he unlawfully received and still retains additional compensation for his services as Judge.\\" The primary reason for his removal instead appears to have been a personal letter that Wright sent to a friend, and which later became public, in which the chief justice called the 1888 Republican National Convention a \\"howling mob composed of thieves, bribers, and bribe takers, scoundrels, and unprincipled persons who, if they had their dues, would be in prison\\". Wright's replacement, Henry C. Gooding, was sworn in on May 7, 1890. Later life and death After leaving the bench, Wright remained in Prescott and returned to private legal practice. He was also active in Democratic politics, giving talks on various political questions, and was a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. His wife was active in the Episcopal Church. Wright died on January 17, 1905. Despite his service to the Confederacy, he was given a military funeral with U.S. Army soldiers from Fort Whipple marching at the head of the procession. Wright's widow died on March 31, 1908. Both husband and wife were buried in Prescott's Citizens Cemetery.

Established as a mental asylum, the original building was designed by a British architect and supervised by the British physician Dr. Morden Carthew.Scull, Andrew (ed.) (2014). \\"Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness: An A-to-Z Guide.\\" SAGE Publications As the first psychiatric hospital and the second oldest hospital in Thailand, the hospital became well known for being the pioneer in the country for the humane treatment of mentally ill patients. History Founded at the behest of King Chulalongkorn in 1889, the hospital initially occupied a five rai plot of land on one side of the Chao Phraya River. A decade later, it transferred to its current 44 rai campus. The institution's original name was the \\"Mental Hospital\\" (Rong Phayaban Khon Sia Sati). It was changed to the \\"Thon Buri Psychosis Hospital\\" (Rong Phayaban Rok Jit Thon Buri). When Phon Sangsingkeo assumed directorship of the Mental Hospital, he changed its name to \\"Somdet Chao Phraya Hospital\\" in 1954 to remove the stigma associated with the hospital's former name. Its new name was the name of Somdetchaopraya Road where the institute is found. In 1955, the hospital started to offer training programs in order to increase expertise in the field of psychiatry and mental health. Shortly after, the Psychiatric Association of Thailand was founded. A mental hygiene clinic was opened in Somdet Chao Phraya Hospital following the successful training of a team of experts who studied mental hygiene, child psychiatry, clinical psychology, and psychiatric social work. This was expanded further to provide outpatient mental services. When the Child Mental Health Center was established, the hospital begun to provide outpatient mental services, cut short in 1970 due to a staff shortage. The hospital was upgraded to the status of a division following a royal decree in 1974 to restructure the Department of Medical Services. In 2002, the hospital was renamed the \\"Somdet Chaopraya Institute of Psychiatry\\". The institute's campus is home to trees more than a century old. Hospital director Dr. Sinngern Suksompong believes that greenery helps calm mental patients. Management refuses to cut trees for expansion and invites VIPs to plant trees on special occasions.

The specific epithet (saccata) is derived from the Latin word sacca meaning \\"bag\\". German botanist Otto Kuntze proposed the binomial name Linkia saccata in 1891, from Cavanilles' original description of the genus Linkia but the name was eventually rejected in favour of Persoonia.* The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995, and P. saccata was placed in the Teretifolia group, a group of 10 species with distinctive flowers. Their hooked pistils are much shorter than those of other persoonias, with the stigma sunk into a hollow within the tepals. Distribution and habitat This persoonia grows in forest or woodland dominated by jarrah or marri, sometimes banksias. It is found in near-coastal districts between Lake Pinjar and the Blackwood River in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest, Swan Coastal Plain and Warren biogeographic regions. Ecology The species regenerates vigorously after bushfire from its woody lignotuber. The following summer it produces large groups of flowers, but the number decreases in subsequent years, until the plant only produces short shoots and no flowers. Conservation Persoonia saccata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The battle broke out as Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) units launched diversionary attacks in support of the Chinese invasion in the major fronts of Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng and Lào Cai. However, the Chinese failed to attract any Vietnamese reinforcements into the battle. Battle Initiated earlier than the overall invasion, Chinese operations in Quảng Ninh area began at around 23:00 on 16 February with artillery shelling and an infantry assault against Hoành Mô, Bình Liêu District. On 17 February, the township of Móng Cái and the Xuan Hoa state farm were also subjected to Chinese artillery bombardment. Later on the day, PLA troops contested the six-kilometer perimeter within the vicinity of Móng Cái, as well as positions in Quảng Hà District near Pò Hèn.O'Dowd, p. 64. Citing from FBIS, Southeast Asia, 21 February 1979, p. K-7. Attacks against Móng Cái were renewed on 20 and 21 February from assembly positions in Dongxing, Guangxi.O'Dowd, p. 64. Citing from FBIS, Southeast Asia, 27 February 1979, p. K-10. Fighting waned until 2 March, when Chinese forces stormed Hill 781 in Bình Liêu District. On 3 March, the PLA struck Hill 1050. Both of the attacks were repulsed at a loss of 750 casualties, according to a Vietnamese report.O'Dowd, p. 64. Citing from FBIS, Southeast Asia, 5 March 1979, p. K-27. Chinese artillery continued pounding Vietnamese positions until 10 March in coordination with infantry raids in smaller scales. On 10 March alone, 3,000 shells were fired against Móng Cái and other border points in Quảng Ninh.O'Dowd, p. 64. Citing from FBIS, Southeast Asia, 12 March 1979, p. K-13. Aftermath As Quảng Ninh was a place of virtually no strategic importance, Chinese attacks in the province could have proved wrong and wasteful, unless they had been explained as an attempt to distract the Vietnam People's Army from the major offensives. In fact, however, the assaults failed, not only to draw Vietnamese reinforcements to the area, but also to capture or retain any positions from the enemy.O'Dowd, p. 64. The lack of military skills was illustrated by Chinese combat performance in the battle for Cao Ba Lanh, a strategic peak located 9 km from the border crossing at Hoành Mô: a regiment-sized Chinese force, after five hours staging numerous waves of mass formation attacks and the toll of 360 casualties, were eventually able to capture a height defended by a single Vietnamese platoon.O'Dowd, p.64-65. The defeat in Quảng Ninh Province was clearly perceived by Chinese leadership. Among China's announcements about the war, there was no mention about the fighting in Quảng Ninh.O'Dowd, p. 65.

Captain Richard Percival Fortune RNVR was the founder of the Scouting movement in Ireland. Fortune hosted the first Boy Scout patrol meeting at his home in Dame Street. His troop quickly took to water activities, and it appears his troop evolved into the 1st Port of Dublin Sea Scout Group as part of the Port of Dublin Sea Scout Association. The 1st Port group received training from the Coastguard at Ringsend. The London Gazette of 23 March 1915London Gazette shows Fortune was granted a temporary service commission as a Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 16 March 1915. He was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant in March 1916 The Navy List while in command of ML580, the highest numbered of the World War I motor launches, a 37 tonne vessel with a crew of 8. During World War I, he served as part of the Royal Navy Motor Boat Reserve, aboard HMS Thalia, a Juno-class wooden screw corvette used as a base ship from 1915 and in command of various motor launches in the period directly after the war. Fortune's Royal Naval Volunteer service card shows he was demobilised from 31 December 1919, having been earlier had orders cancelled and leave granted to sit for examination as a merchant Master.National Archives His service record notes Fortune as \\"Scout Master, in charge of Sea Scouts of Spec. Serv Squad.\\" His son was Captain Desmond Fortune, the founder of the Irish Institute of Master Mariners, in whose name the annual senior seamanship competition for Scouting Ireland is awarded. Growth of Scouting Fortune's troop registered in 1908 as a member of the Dublin City Boy Scouts Association and in 1912 as a member of the Port of Dublin Sea Scout Association. In 1921, the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty established the Irish Free State. At this time, the name of Irish Free State Scout Council was adopted, as the association expanded its reach outside of the greater Dublin area, becoming a national organisation. The name of the association was changed again with the foundation of the Republic of Ireland. Taking on the title of the Boy Scouts of Ireland. At this time, the association also gained the recognition of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) Some statistics / National Scout Organisations / Countries / Around the world / Home - World Organization of the Scout Movement becoming Ireland's only officially recognised Scout association. In 1927, the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland (CBSI) was formed under the guidance of the Catholic Church as a means of imprinting a Catholic ethos on the young men of Ireland. Originating with Fr. Ernest Farrell, a curate in Greystones, Co. Wicklow in 1925/1926, the association was hastened in its initiation by his brother Fr. Tom Farrell, a curate in the Pro-Cathedral. The association continued to work through the 1950s and 60's during which it adapted to the development of Ireland as an independent republic. In 1965, the SAI formed the Federation of Irish Scout Associations (FISA) with the CBSI. This enabled the two associations and their members the recognition and resources of WOSM. All Scouts in Ireland were thus able to play an active role in International Scouting. Developments following the late 60's saw the association take on the name of the Scout Association of Ireland. This was subsequently changed to Scouting Ireland (SAI) in advance of the merging of the association with the CBSI. From 1 January 2004, both the SAI and the CSI ceased operations. Scouting in Ireland from this point forward would be overseen by the unified Scouting Ireland. First Scout meeting in Ireland The first recorded Scout meeting took place at Fortune's home at 3 Dame Street, Dublin on 15 February 1908 where four boys were enrolled in the Wolf Patrol of the 1st Dublin Troop. Fortune's 1st Dublin Troop would go on to become the first group to register as part of the Port of Dublin Sea Scout Association in 1912, becoming 1st Port of Dublin Sea Scouts (Ringsend).

L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan for The Smart Set literary magazine and adapted by Willard Huntington Wright during his short tenure as editor. The pseudonym was used to critique American (“Puritan”) traditions and ideals, such as marriage, religion, and academe, while protecting Mencken and Nathan's own reputations. First with the “Pertinent & Impertinent” column and eventually the “Americana” column, Hatteras observed and denigrated American institutions, frivolity and sentimentalism, materialism, racism, censorship, and conservatism. History Owen Hatteras debuted in April 1912 and appeared regularly until Mencken and Nathan's resignation in 1923, and in April 1919, he was presented as “Major” Owen Hatteras, denoting his decorated service in World War I. During his service, he was still able to write twelve pieces for The Smart Set during the war years, despite Mencken's claim that “Hatteras was too proud to write,” mocking President Woodrow Wilson’s statement that “there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight.”Harrison, S. L., ed. a.k.a. H. L. Mencken: Selected Pseudonymous Writings. Miami: Wolf Den Books, 2005. Print. p. 162 The creation of Owen Hatteras was meant to be an experimental prelude to Mencken and Nathan's desired weekly, The Blue Review. In The Blue Review, they intended to lambast traditional American morals and ideologies, mostly using satire, but the magazine never came to fruition. The Smart Set’s publisher, John Adams Thayer, was excited by the idea, but suggested that they first try out the critical tone on their current audience. Thus, they created the “Pertinent and Impertinent” column in April 1912 pseudonymously, though their own signed writings revealed much of the same sentiment. Owen Hatteras, however, could be freely raffish and acerbic. He attacked religion, marriage, morals, manners, capitalism—staples of American life. These American tropes came to be identified by Mencken as “Puritanism,” stripped of the Calvinist implications and loaded with the dated and passé mores instilled by the early American Puritans. Though Hatteras preceded Willard Huntington Wright's editorship, Wright used Hatteras as one supply of the “truth” Wright promised his readers: real characters and people who complicated America's idea of morality and virtue. When Mencken and Nathan needed to defend themselves against accusations of being communist supporters, contrarily “accused...of being both agents of the Kaiser and the Bolsheviks,”Curtiss, Thomas Quinn.

Hatteras mocked with false respect the small towns’ editorial efforts, denigrating their inherent racism, pro-War sentiments, Fundamentalism, Prohibition, etc. The “Americana” series continued with Mencken and Nathan in American Mercury, but they dropped Owen Hatteras because he was too playful for their new serious tone. Though he never became the household name that Mencken and Nathan hoped he would become, Owen Hatteras had a fan following, and he responded regularly to fan mail and invitations to events (that he respectfully had to decline). In the December 1923 issue of Mencken and Nathan's new magazine endeavor, American Mercury, they announced that Owen Hatteras had died, and in response, other magazines and newspapers wrote obituaries of him.Adler, Betty.

He was Minister of Justice in 1952–53 and then Minister of the Interior in 1953–54. He was violently anti-communist, and was opposed to granting autonomy or independence of the North African colonies. His hard-line views caused him to be expelled from his party in 1955, and he failed to be reelected the next year. Early years Léon Jean Martinaud-Déplat was born in Lyon on 9 August 1899, the son of a teacher. His surname combines the surnames of his stepfather and his father. After his secondary education in Lyon he enrolled in the Faculty of Law in Aix-en-Provence, where he obtained his license. He then joined the Paris Bar. He was president of the association of young advocates in 1925–26. He joined the Radical party, and in 1929 was appointed secretary-general of the executive committee of the Radical-Socialist Party. He was counted among the \\"young Turks\\" of the party. Pre-war politics Martinaud-Déplat was a deputy from 8 April 1932 to 31 May 1936, elected on the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist list. He won by a narrow margin in the second round of voting for the 2nd district of the 19th arrondissement of Paris. He joined the committees on Algeria, Colonies & Protectorate and on Commerce & Industry. On 30 January 1934 he was appointed under-secretary of state for the President of the Council in the short-lived cabinet of Édouard Daladier, which resigned on 6 February 1934. He ran for reelection in 1936 but was defeated. However, he remained among the party leaders. At the start of World War II (1939–45) he was appointed press director in the High Commission of Information headed by Jean Giraudoux. He retired from politics in 1940 during the German occupation of France. Post-war politics After the Liberation of France Martinaud-Déplat worked to reorganize the Radical Party along the lines defined by Édouard Herriot. At the 34th congress of the party in Paris in July 1945 he defended private enterprise against excessive intervention by the state. He edited La Dépêche de Paris, the official journal of the Radical Party, then in 1947 edited the L'Information radicale socialiste, a journal funded by Émile Roche. In December 1948 he succeeded Henri Queuille as administrative secretary of the Radical Party. As effective leader of the party he committed it to playing a permanent role in government. He persistently demanded a return to the pre-war electoral system, opposed government interference in business and was violently anti-communist. Martinaud-Déplat was a deputy from 17 June 1951 to 1 December 1955 for Bouches-du-Rhône, again on the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist list. He was appointed to the committees on Foreign Affairs and on Shipping. He joined the cabinet of Edgar Faure as Minister of Justice when it was formed on 17 January 1952. He retained this office under Antoine Pinay and René Mayer, leaving office on 28 June 1953. Martinaud-Déplat told the attorneys general to treat the activities of communists with great severity. He joined with the Minister of the Interior, Charles Brune, to invent charges against Jacques Duclos. After the fall of the Mayer cabinet Martinaud-Déplat was appointed to the cabinet of Joseph Laniel as Minister of the Interior on 28 June 1953. While he held that position there was a wave of strikes in the summer of 1953 and violent demonstrations in Paris on 14 July 1953, 15 December 1953 and 4 April 1954. He played a key role in the deposition of Sultan Mohammed V of Morocco on 20 August 1953, in which he acted with General Augustin Guillaume and Georges Bidault without obtaining the full agreement of Laniel or his cabinet. Martinaud-Déplat was the main spokesman for the North African Lobby in the Assembly. He advocated the colonial policies that were implemented by Bidault and Maurice Schumann. These allowed some control over internal administration but no authority over foreign policy and no right to leave the French union. He left office on 19 June 1954. Martinaud-Déplat considered that Algerians were French citizens, with the same rights as every other citizen of metropolitan France. He said in 1954 that \\"we must put an end to the misery and exploitation that North Africans suffer.\\" He opposed the proposal by Pierre Mendès France, head of the new government and also a Radical Party member, to give internal autonomy to Tunisia. In May 1955 the neo-Radical supporters of the North African lobby lost power in the Radical Party, until then the main party supporting French North Africa. Martinaud-Déplat lost his position as administrative president. He was expelled from the party. On 8 July 1955 he was among the 44 stubborn supporters of colonial rule who voted against the 2 June 1955 convention that gave internal autonomy to Tunisia. Martinaud-Déplat ran as an independent on 2 January 1956 but failed to be reelected. He returned to his career as a lawyer, and was mayor of Saint- Antonin-sur-Bayon until his death on 5 October 1969.

Built in 1892, it is an extremely well- preserved and little-altered example of a Queen Anne railroad depot. It served as a passenger depot until 1960 and as a freight depot thereafter. It is owned by the Brooks Historical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The former railroad depot of the Maine Central Railroad is near the southern fringe of the village of Brooks, on the west side of Moosehead Trail (Maine State Route 7) just south of the railroad tracks, which are separated from the village center by Marsh Stream. It is a single-story wood-frame structure, with a hip roof and a mostly granite stone foundation. The roof has a deep overhang, which is supported by large, decoratively-cut brackets. The building is sheathed in a variety of materials, with diagonally set tongue-and-groove planking at the lower level, clapboards at the central level, and decorative cut shingles at the upper level. Its interior is divided into three rooms: the agent's office, a large waiting area, and a restroom. Outside the station stands a semaphore signal that is still mechanically operable by controls in the agent's office. The rail line that passes through Brooks was built in 1870 as part of a project by the city of Belfast to develop a railroad serving the Canadian province of Quebec. Conceived as the Belfast and Moosehead Lake Railroad, the tracks were built by the Maine Central Railroad (MEC) to connect Belfast to coastal communities further south. The MEC built its first station in Brooks in 1881 and the present station in 1892 after the first was destroyed by fire. The station served as an important element of the local economy for many years, serving as a passenger depot until 1960 and as a means by which the products of a local cheese factory reached market. After 1960 the building was used for a time as a freight depot, and ownership was reverted to the city of Belfast. The stations is owned by the Brooks Historical Society, which also operates restored rolling stock as a heritage railroad in the summer months.

The texts come from different sources, and the scoring is for four to eight parts. They were published by Boosey & Co in 1905. The works, some of Stanford's few settings of church music in Latin, have remained in the choral repertoire internationally and are performed in liturgies and concert.  History  Stanford may have composed the three motets at the end of the 19th century, possibly when he was a teacher at the Royal College of Music in London. John Bawden assumes that he wrote the works even earlier, in 1892, when he left his position as the organist of Trinity College, Cambridge, dedicating them to Alan Gray, his successor, and the college choir. Stanford's biographer Jeremy Dibble noted performances of the first motet at the chapel of Trinity College during Evensong on 24 February 1888 and 24 February 1892, and of the last one likely there on 1 February 1890, and therefore deduced that they were written around 1887/88. In a letter dated 18 November 1888, Stanford wrote to the publisher Novello of his interest in setting introits from the Catholic missal, which he felt were \\"admirably suitable and always lyrical (not didactic) in character\\". In 1891, he wrote to the publisher requesting the return of the scores that were not published, because he wanted to reuse them. These pieces were probably the subsequently published motets, because other than these, Stanford wrote music for the Anglican Church in English. Stanford did not set introits but rather Latin texts of different origin. His autographs are lost. The pieces were published as motets in 1905 by Boosey & Co, which made them suitable for both Catholic and Anglican usage. Three Latin Motets comprised Justorum animae, Coelos ascendit hodie and Beati quorum via. The motets became a staple of Anglican church music, frequently performed and recorded, both as a set and individually.  Motet descriptions  The three a cappella motets are all based on Latin texts, but with different background, scoring and character: # Justorum animae (The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God) for four-part choir SATB # Coelos ascendit hodie (Today, Jesus Christ has ascended into the heavens) for two four-part choirs # Beati quorum via (Blessed are those that are undefiled) for six-part choir SSATBB = Justorum animae = In Justorum animae, Stanford set verses from the beginning of chapter 3 of the Book of Wisdom, \\"Justorum animae in manu Dei sunt, et non tanget eos tormentum malitiae. Vissi sunt oculis insipientium, illi autem sunt in pace\\" (But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, but they are in peace). In the Catholic missal, it is an offertory hymn on All Souls' Day. Brahms, whom Stanford admired, used the same passage for the fugue ending the third movement of Ein deutsches Requiem. Stanford composed the text for a mixed unaccompanied four-part choir, SATB. The piece is in G major and common time, marked Andante moderato. Its outer sections consider the souls, in peace in God's hand, while a contrasting middle section reflects the torment mentioned. The reprise adds sustained notes to the first theme. = Coelos ascendit hodie = In Coelos ascendit hodie, Stanford set an Ascension hymn which is well known in German as \\"Gen Himmel aufgefahren ist\\" from the 14th century. Stanford composed the text for a two mixed unaccompanied four-part choirs, both SATB. The piece is in A major and common time, marked Allegro. Stanford wrote an antiphonal setting, with choir II interrupting choir I by inserted Alleluja calls to the first line, with switched positions for the second line. The piece has a strong rhythmic element, and closes with both choirs united on \\"Amen\\". = Beati quorum via = Stanford set a paraphrase of the first verse of Psalm 119 in Latin, \\"Beati quorum via integra est, qui ambulant in lege Domini\\" (Happy are they that are upright in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD). He composed the text for a mixed unaccompanied six-part choir, SSATBB. The piece is in A-flat major and 3/4 time, marked Con moto tranqillo ma no troppo lento (In calm movement but not too slow). The three upper voices begin, imitated by the three lower voices. For the second part of the text, the lower voices begin with different material. Dibble noted that the piece is reminiscent of the sonata form, with these two themes, which are then combined. He called the motet a \\"pastoral prayer\\", and it was also described as \\"meditative in character\\". R. J. Stove wrote in his review of Paul Rodmell's Stanford biography: \\"his finest unaccompanied motets, such as Beati quorum via, attain neo-Brucknerian sublimity\\", comparing Stanford's work to that of Hubert Parry and Anton Bruckner.  Recordings  The three motets were recorded in 2012 by the Winchester Cathedral Choir, conducted by David Hill, in a collection of Stanford's sacred choral music. They appeared, sung by the Trinity College Choir Cambridge conducted by Stephen Layton, on a 2017 collection of choral music by Stanford.  Legacy  Of Stanford's works, his church music, and particularly the Three Latin Motets, continues to be frequently performed and recorded, while his music in other genres, such as opera and orchestral music, is rarely performed. The Stanford Society presents a recording of Beati by Voces8 on its web page.

The movie stars Malhar Thakar, Yash Soni, Mitra Gadhvi, Aarjav Trivedi, Rahul Raval, Janki Bodiwala, Kinjal Rajpriya, and Netri Trivedi. The plot revolves around the lives of eight friends in their last year of college. The film premiered on 20 November 2015 with positive reviews from critics and commercial success. The film was remade in Hindi as Days of Tafree. Plot The film starts with five college friends going to the restaurant in a car after their college last year exam. One of the friends Vicky is badly hit and injured by a car in an accident. He is taken to hospital as an emergency. The film then shows the entire story in the flash back. One day in the morning, Vicky is being called repeatedly by his friend Nikhil who is waiting for him in the college. Vicky was still asleep in his home and keeps bluffing Nikhil that he is on his way to college, he has taken a turn to the lane joining the college, he is parking his bike. After almost 45 minutes since Nikhil is waiting, he gets very angry and decides to give a good hearing to Vicky. Unfortunately, Vicky's father picks up the call because Vicky went to attend a doorbell. Nikhil, unaware of this, openly abuses thinking its Vicky, and cuts the call when he realised that all time he was abusing his father! Nikhil called himself \\"father of Vicky\\" (tera baap). Vicky's father gets very angry after the call and sarcastically asks Vicky \\"How many fathers do you own?\\". Vicky signals his mother to answer this and gets slapped hard by his father. Later, Vicky meets Nikhil and hurts him badly by hitting him with a bottle for abusing his father. They then go to a tea vendor where they meet Naresh, who bugs both of them by his non-stop blabbering. Loy joins both of them for the tea and later they meet Dev and Dulha (Dhruval). Nikhil, Vicky and Loy, all were portrayed as jolly friends, somewhat double-minded and mad for love, while Dev was shown as a decent boy. Dulha was an aggressive boy who hated people messing with him or speaking nonsense. Later, in a classroom, all of them meet Pooja and Isha. Nikhil falls for Pooja and tries to maintain a romantic relationship with her. In one scene, Isha collides with Dulha accidentally. Dulha doesn't like this, thinks she did it intentionally and pushes Isha hard, due to which she fell on the ground. Later, Dulha apologises to Isha but forcefully asks her to forgive him. In Accounts tuition, Vicky gets attracted to the tuition teacher. However, on explaining Dulha the problem five times, Dulha still doesn't understand. When she beats Dulha, he didn't like it and in turn bashes her head on the table. On the next day, the teacher refuses to teach, which irritates Vicky and blames Dulha for that. Now, Loy's father decides to get him married to a girl named Nisha. Because her parents' complexion was dark, Loy assumed even Nisha would be dark. Hence he was against this marriage and asked Vicky and Nikhil to accompany him and help him force Nisha to refuse for marriage. However, all three were astonished to find that Nisha was indeed very beautiful and attractive. All of them fell for her instantly. Vicky and Nikhil made sure that Loy did not get engaged to Nisha by speaking irrelevant things and trying to irritate Nisha and her parents. Nisha expressed her wish to get admission in HD College. Vicky's Uncle was a trustee of that college, so he helped Nisha get admitted there. This led to Vicky and Nisha getting into a relationship. All of them realised about the college's last day. Dev convinced Nikhil to propose Pooja. However, Nikhil is little hesitant because Pooja is the friend of his ex-girlfriend Vandana. They convince him to not think about all that, else he would repent on not doing that after college ended. Meanwhile, when Vicky jokingly called Nikhil a \\"Baila\\" if he did not gather guts to propose to a girl, he asked Dulha if he agreed. Dulha realised that he loves Isha and confessed his love for her. Isha was shocked to hear about this, but stayed quiet. Again, Dulha forced Isha to accept his proposal. Isha, although accepted the proposal, but wasn't seriously into it. She was scared of Dulha and thus did whatever Dulha wanted. Vicky later realised that the Accounts tuition teacher who attracted him married their college sports professor. Now, fast forward to the present night after their last year exam, Vicky is finally survived and recovered from the car accident. Toward the end of the film, Nikhil tries to propose to Pooja, but frequent intervention of his friends stopped him from proposing. However, Pooja herself confessed her love to Nikhil. Isha starts celebrating this in joy, but the chocolate she was eating got stuck in her throat. When Pooja tapped her back to enable her to get rid of chocolate, Dulha objected this and went to hit Isha's back hard...however the film ended there.

Wilkes, who served as a city commissioner of West Palm Beach, Florida, from 1976 to 1988, became the city's first female Mayor in 1978. Wilkes was born Helen Barbour in Fort Valley, Georgia. She had five siblings. Wilkes, a young nurse, relocated to West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1952 to accept a position as a registered nurse at the city's St. Mary's Hospital. She earned just $175 a month at St. Mary's. However, by taking no days off, she saved her enough of her income to purchase $3,500 in a house in nearby Lake Park, Florida, which she converted into a nursing home with a capacity for nine residents. Wilkes later recalled in an interview, \\"For seven years, I worked without a day off. I had a dream and I wanted to fulfill it.\\" She expanded the facility into the Helen Wilkes Nursing Home, an 85-bed nursing home over the next few decades. Wilkes sold her nursing home in the late 1980s for $3.36 million. Wilkes next acquired the George Washington Hotel, a troubled, declining flophouse hotel located on Flagler Drive in downtown West Palm Beach during the 1970s. She renovated the hotel, which was in disrepair at the time, and reopened it under a new name, the Helen Wilkes Resident Hotel. She owned and operated the residential retirement hotel for more than 30 years, until the building was purchased by the city government of West Palm Beach and demolished in 2005. She was best known for her political career in city government. She first joined the West Palm Beach City Commission in 1976, ultimately serving on the commission from 1976 to 1987. She simultaneously elected West Palm Beach's first female Mayor by the City Commission on March 30, 1978. In a 1987 interview, Wilkes considered her greatest political achievements to be the creation of West Palm Beach's first crime watch patrol. Wilkes also worked with Eva Williams Mack, who was elected West Palm Beach's first African-American Mayor by the City Commission on March 25, 1982, to improve relations between the city's black and white communities. Wilkes retired from the City Commission on Thursday, March 24, 1988. Helen Wilkes died on October 7, 2015, at the age of 88. She was survived by her husband, Hector Rodriguez.

It was one of the first filtered Indian cigarettes to be launched as Wills Filter'.' History Wills Navy Cut was originally manufactured by W.D. & H.O. Wills in the United Kingdom. Named after the Wills surname (of Wills family) of W.D. & H.O. Wills, the cigarette was one of the most notable products of the company in the UK. In 1910, ITC Limited (then called \\"Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited\\") commenced its operations in Kolkata. ITC started manufacturing cigarette brands. Wills Navy Cut Filter Tipped, was launched in July 1963 in India at the price of 10 Annas for a packet of 10 cigarettes. At this time, the biggest task was to assure people that the addition of the filter was meant to enhance the taste they were accustomed to, since many Indians at the time were used to traditional unfiltered cigarettes. In the years since, Wills Navy Cut was launched in a flat 10s pack with a distinctive red band. The W leaf was also a part of the pack. One of the biggest changes in the brand was to give Navy Cut its due prominence, over time the Wills Crest was replaced by the classic unicorns as well. In 1988, W.D. & H.O. Wills went defunct and as a result production of Wills Navy Cut stopped in the U.K. Being an independent company, ITC continued to manufacture and market the cigarette in India. Despite W.D. & H.O. Wills becoming defunct, ITC still has \\"From the House of W.D. & H.O. Wills\\" printed on the cigarettes and its packaging. Navy Cut was given a new look in 2012. The brand name \\"Wills Navy Cut\\" is an official registered trademark, registered under class 34. Marketing In the beginning, the marketing was aimed for the creation of the perfect match of filter and tobacco, to drive home the idea that a filter was the perfect addition to a cigarette. This communication was also one of the first to have women as a part of the marketing campaign. The years 1968/69 saw a huge growth in competition with lower-priced filter cigarettes, however, Navy Cut continued to retain its market share. In 1965, ITC Limited introduced the \\"Made for each other\\" advertising campaign. The print ad featured a happily married couple reading a Polish joke book. The idea was to highlight how tobacco and filter were perfectly matched in the brand's cigarette, with the aim to encourage couples in the urban centers to start smoking Wills Navy Cut, hence giving the idea that Wills Navy Cut makes for the \\"perfect match\\" and making the brand both emotional and aspirational. In 1969 ITC introduced the \\"Wills Made for Each Other\\" contest to select the perfectly matched couple. Which half forms the paper rolled tobacco and who's the filter is a topic of an unending debate. Many posters were hung up on prominent street corners until the 1990s and disappeared completely when tobacco advertising was banned in India in 2004. The \\"Made for each other\\" campaign went on to become one of the longest-running and most recognisable advertising campaigns in India. With the changing times, the brand changed too and 2009 saw the entry of Navy Cut Kings. ITC also released various limited edition packs. Some of the limited edition packs include: \\"The Cricket Edition\\" that captured the essence of cricket during the 1996 Wills World Cup After that, the \\"New year edition 2009\\" and the \\"Hallmark of Quality\\", a take on the quality and class of Navy Cut in red and gold. A special edition \\"40 years of Navy Cut\\" pack was also made to commemorate on the 40-year existence of the Wills Navy Cut brand, with the slogan \\"Made for each other\\" engraved on the pack. Markets Wills Navy Cut is mainly sold in India, but also was or still is sold in the United Kingdom, Kuwait and Pakistan.
