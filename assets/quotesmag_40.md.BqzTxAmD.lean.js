The first stone was discovered in 1857 in the Agua Suja stream, a tributary of the Bagagem River. A chapel was built to honor Our Lady of Abadia and an image was brought from Portugal. By 1926 there were already around fifty thousand pilgrims (romeiros) coming to worship the statue of the Virgin and the construction of a sanctuary was begun. The celebration takes place from August 6 to 15 and it attracts thousands of pilgrims who fill the small town.Ferias.tur.br Economic activities The most important economic activities are cattle raising for meat and dairy, commerce, and agriculture, with the main crops being coffee, corn, rice, and citrus fruits. The GDP in 2005 was R$70 million, with 16 million generated by services, 03 million generated by industry, and 48 million generated by agriculture. Romaria is in the middle tier of municipalities in the state with regard to economic and social development. As of 2007 there were no banking agencies in the town. There was a modest retail infrastructure serving the surrounding area of cattle and agricultural lands. There were 391 automobiles in all of the municipality (2007), about one for every 08 inhabitants.IBGE Romaria has a small municipal area but had a large agricultural production especially in coffee, corn, and soybeans. In the rural area there were 175 establishments (2006) occupying 27,000 hectares (planted area: 14,000 ha,; natural pasture: 7,000 ha.; and woodland: 5,000 ha.).

Background In 1976, Art Brambila, a television and music producer from Los Angeles, was looking for a sponsor for his new Latin music television show, The Mean Salsa Machine. He had heard that Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers, had a relationship with Coca-Cola and asked him for help to secure a deal with the company. When Chavez succeeded in getting the sponsorship for the show, Brambila wanted to repay him. Brambila decided to put together an album of songs honoring Chavez and the United Farm Workers, and chose Los Lobos, then a local Mexican folk combo called Los Lobos Del Este De Los Angeles, to be the backing band for the project. They would accompany a variety of vocalists performing songs celebrating Chavez's accomplishments and the struggle of farm workers. Vocalists Carmen Moreno from Fresno, Geri Gonzales of East L.A., the Salas brothers of Lincoln Heights, Ramon \\"Tiguere\\" Rodriguez from Phoenix, Brambila's brother Raul, and a Los Angeles school choir agreed to participate.

The park contains a section of the Bad River and its tributary the Tylers Forks, which flow through a gorge and drop over several waterfalls. Old Copper Culture Indians and later European settlers mined copper in the area. The state park was created in 1929 and amenities were developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. In 2005 the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a site with 10 contributing properties. Activities and amenities *Loon Lake: The lake offers swimming, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and boating with electric motors only.

Trails are used for hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. *Camping: The campground has 24 sites with electric hookups. A camper cabin is accessible to persons with disabilities. History Copper Falls Park lies near the west end of the Penokee-Gogebic Mineral Range, a ridge of rock formations that stretches from Ashland County 80 miles to Lake Gogebic in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Copper was mined in the area during the Civil War, and in the 1880s there were two copper mines near where the log footbridge now is. With . Around 1900 Wells M. Ruggles had a crew digging for copper at what is now the southeast corner of the picnic grounds. The Bad River repeatedly filled his shaft with water, so he dynamited rock to divert the river. Ashland County was heavily logged from 1886 to 1920, stripping both pine and hardwood and leaving a wasteland of stumps and brush. Some of this cutover land was sold to immigrants to farm, but the acidic soil left by pine forests and the short summers of northern Wisconsin made it difficult to grow many crops, and many farms were abandoned by the 1920s and 30s, leaving the area vulnerable to fire and erosion. In 1907 Ruggles and his Ashland County Land Company sold 130 acres around the falls to investors from St. Louis. In the following years, local efforts were made to improve the site for visitors. The county improved the road to the park, and in 1922 WWI vets Nick Stilin and Henry Kritz built three swinging footbridges for viewing the falls. During summers, Mr. and Mrs. August Froming sold food and drink at the falls. The state of Wisconsin bought 520 acres at the falls in 1929 and additional land in 1935. Starting in 1933, Mayor Maxeiner of Mellen and Congressman B.J. Gehrmann pushed the Conservation Commission in Madison to assign a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp to develop a park at Copper Falls. In 1935, a master plan for a park was completed by a team of surveyors, landscape architects, architects and engineers from various government agencies. The park was a challenge to design, since the roads and trails had to work around the river gorges and ravines. CCC Company D-692 moved into Camp Copper Falls in November 1935. They were 164 men - mostly young men from Illinois - including masons, carpenters, furniture makers, and blacksmiths. Before Copper Falls, they had worked on Giant City State Park in southern Illinois. In the following 23 months they built Copper Falls' recreational lodge, its granite fireplaces, its benches and tables. They started building the contact station, built a pump house, built water reservoirs, built the observation tower, laid water lines, and ran telephone and electric lines. They cleared areas for parking, camping and picnicking. They cleared park trails and roads (removing many stumps in the process), built log footbridges, and lots of guardrail. In the summer of 1936 northern Wisconsin saw a bad drought, and the CCCs focused on fire suppression in the surrounding area. The camp closed in September 1937. After the CCC left, work continued under the WPA - another New Deal program which employed unemployed local men on public projects. (An unskilled worker made about 50¬¢ a day.) One CCC foreman remained to supervise the WPA men as they continued the CCC's projects. WPA reports show that they worked on improving the trails, a bathing pond, the custodian's house, a playground, park lights, and tree thinning, and completed the contact station, among other things. The WPA work continued until August 1941, when funds ran out. A flood of the Bad River on August 30, 1941 damaged the bathing pond, bath house, dressing cabin, and two bridges over the Bad River. Another flood June 24, 1946 destroyed the swimming pond and bathhouse, and wrecked the flight of wooden steps across from the combination building.

That is, deposits laid down by volcanism or by deposition of sediment derived from weathering detritus (clays, sands etc.). This includes all its fossil content and the information it yields about the history of the Earth: its past climate, geography, geology and the evolution of life on its surface. According to the law of superposition, sedimentary and volcanic rock layers are deposited on top of each other. They harden over time to become a solidified (competent) rock column, that may be intruded by igneous rocks and disrupted by tectonic events. Correlating the rock record Horseshoe Canyon near Drumheller, Alberta At a certain locality on the Earth's surface, the rock column provides a cross section of the natural history in the area during the time covered by the age of the rocks. This is sometimes called the rock history and gives a window into the natural history of the location that spans many geological time units such as ages, epochs, or in some cases even multiple major geologic periods--for the particular geographic region or regions. The geologic record is in no one place entirely complete for where geologic forces one age provide a low-lying region accumulating deposits much like a layer cake, in the next may have uplifted the region, and the same area is instead one that is weathering and being torn down by chemistry, wind, temperature, and water. This is to say that in a given location, the geologic record can be and is quite often interrupted as the ancient local environment was converted by geological forces into new landforms and features. Sediment core data at the mouths of large riverine drainage basins, some of which go deep thoroughly support the law of superposition. However using broadly occurring deposited layers trapped within differently located rock columns, geologists have pieced together a system of units covering most of the geologic time scale using the law of superposition, for where tectonic forces have uplifted one ridge newly subject to erosion and weathering in folding and faulting the strata, they have also created a nearby trough or structural basin region that lies at a relative lower elevation that can accumulate additional deposits. By comparing overall formations, geologic structures and local strata, calibrated by those layers which are widespread, a nearly complete geologic record has been constructed since the 17th century. Discordant strata example USGS correlation diagram Correcting for discordancies can be done in a number of ways and utilizing a number of technologies or field research results from studies in other disciplines. In this example, the study of layered rocks and the fossils they contain is called biostratigraphy and utilizes amassed geobiology and paleobiological knowledge. Fossils can be used to recognize rock layers of the same or different geologic ages, thereby coordinating locally occurring geologic stages to the overall geologic timeline. The pictures of the fossils of monocellular algae in this USGS figure were taken with a scanning electron microscope and have been magnified 250 times. In the U.S. state of South Carolina three marker species of fossil algae are found in a core of rock whereas in Virginia only two of the three species are found in the Eocene Series of rock layers spanning three stages and the geologic ages from 37.2-55.8 MA. Comparing the record about the discordance in the record to the full rock column shows the non-occurrence of the missing species and that portion of the local rock record, from the early part of the middle Eocene is missing there. This is one form of discordancy and the means geologists use to compensate for local variations in the rock record. With the two remaining marker species it is possible to correlate rock layers of the same age (early Eocene and latter part of the middle Eocene) in both South Carolina and Virginia, and thereby \\"calibrate\\" the local rock column into its proper place in the overall geologic record. Lithology vs paleontology Consequently, as the picture of the overall rock record emerged, and discontinuities and similarities in one place were cross-correlated to those in others, it became useful to subdivide the overall geologic record into a series of component sub-sections representing different sized groups of layers within known geologic time, from the shortest time span stage to the largest thickest strata eonothem and time spans eon. Concurrent work in other natural science fields required a time continuum be defined, and earth scientists decided to coordinate the system of rock layers and their identification criteria with that of the geologic time scale. This gives the pairing between the physical layers of the left column and the time units of the center column in the table at right.

Life After completing his high-school studies he attended the universities of Freiburg, T√ºbingen, Heidelberg, and Munich, where he devoted himself to the study of modern languages and history. His first position was that of teacher of French and English at the high-school for the sciences at Freiburg; in 1848 he was appointed by the Government of Baden lecturer on history at the University of Freiburg. In 1848, the year of revolution, he was a strong adherent of the Catholic party. In 1850 he became editor of the Freiburger Zeitung; in 1852 he became involved in a quarrel with the Government of Baden and, on this account, accepted a call as professor of Austrian history from the University of Graz, where he remained during the years 1853-91. For a time he was tutor in history to Archduke Charles Louis and the archduke's travelling companion in journeys to France and Constantinople. In 1899 Weiss was ennobled and made a knight on the Order of the Iron Crown. In 1892 he was appointed a life-member of the House of Lords and in 1893 he received the title of court councillor. Works Weiss wrote the \\"Geschichte Alfreds des Grossen\\" (Schaffhausen, 1852), careful but unoriginal; he also issued \\"Maria Theresa und der √∂sterreichische Erbfolgekrieg\\" (Vienna, 1863). His chief work is his summary of the history of the world in thirty-two volumes (last edition, Graz, 1900‚Äì06). It extends to the close of the Congress of Vienna and gives special attention to the eighteenth century and the French Revolution, both of which it treats exhaustively on the basis of contemporary literature. The work is written from a distinctly Roman Catholic point of view and is partisan in its account of the conflict between the Empire and the Papacy in the medieval era, of the Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, and of the Rationalism of the eighteenth century.

Dresen-Coenders, p. 227 It caused the death of sixty four people by burning. Earlier witch trials in Roermond Before the 1613 trials there were other trials. They mainly came from peasants who felt they, their family, or their cattle or crops had been bewitched. They would then go to the accused and demand from them to bless them or their children, animals or crops. This was meant to dispel the bewitching. It did mean that the accused would be held responsible for the bewitching and to dispel would be seen as admittance of guilt, so usually these blessings would be denied. The witch could also start her own slander trial against the accusers, which could prevent a witch trial. If the witch's honour could not be restored in this way, a formal witch trial would follow. The accusers would have to show evidence to the court. Damages would have to be proved with the help of witnesses, or otherwise the witch would go free. If the accused could find enough witnesses (about four to eight) in his or her defense, the witch would usually be declared not guilty and released. Judgment could depend on the influence or popularity of the accused. These trials were usually less about the bewitchings and more about the heretical pact with the devil. Torture would only be used if the guilt of the witch was considered proven and all that was needed was a confession. During these trials the accused were not forced to name other witches yet. * 1522 ‚Äì Trijn van der Moelen was suspected of witchcraft before. She was arrested because she had bothered someone on the street. She admitted she had bewitched people and animals and having closed a pact with the devil. She was condemned to burn at the stake. * 1525 ‚Äì Two women were accused of having bewitched people, horses, cows and sheep. Both accusations came from peasants. The accusation of having closed a pact with the devil only appeared after a painful questioning. They were condemned to burn at the stake. In 1572 Roermond had passed from Spanish hands to the hands of Orangists and Protestants, but in 1580 it had been reconquered by the Catholic Spaniards. The mercenaries of both armies had stayed around and were still pillaging the area. * 1581 ‚Äì Kael Merrie was suspected of witchcraft: a child had fallen ill, a pig was paralysed, the milk of a cow could not be churned into butter, etc. She kept denying the charges and was convicted to be banished. Just outside Roermond she was intercepted by mercenaries and drowned in the Maas river. Two more women suspected of witchcraft had come to Roermond to plead their innocence (a good idea as it increased the chance of acquittal): they, too, were drowned by the Spanish mercenaries in the Maas. The justices tried to remain sceptical to the peasants' accusations but were powerless against the lynchings in which the mercenaries played a big part. From then on the accused were forced with torture to admit they were heretics who had closed a pact with the devil and had even had sexual intercourse with him and danced during witch's sabbaths together with other witches. * 1587 ‚Äì During a few trials (the outcome of which is unknown) six women were accused, among whom was Ummel Heynen. During a day without wind linen had flown out of the garden and into the Ruhr river. A Dutch soldier had seen her faint, which must have been because she had had intercourse with the devil. The daughter of the mayor died after Ummel had given her something to drink. Ummel had sighed and cursed when she was forced to step over a broom that a corporal had put down in front of her as a test (folklore held that witches couldn't step over broomsticks). Someone had heard the sound of a thousand cats (during witch's sabbaths witches came together in the form of cats to dance and have sex with the devil). Ummel's neighbours were two sisters whose mother had been burnt as a witch, and that alone was enough to suspect Ummel of witchcraft. In the peasants' accusation there wasn't just the accusation of bewitching but now also having intercourse with the devil, as the church's lore had apparently been added to folklore. * 1594 ‚Äì There was probably also a witch trial in Roermond. The accusation was the witches came together in witch's sabbaths as cats and had sex with the devil in the form of a tomcat. There was also a devil in the form of a goat. The witches could change into dogs, cats, hares, wolves, and other animals. * 1611 ‚Äì Itgen Heudders accidentally touched a child that then got a rash. She had to appear in front of the justices and dispel the bewitching. When she refused she was thrown into a dungeon, but when it was shown she came from a well-to-do family she was let go. The trials of 1613 Een warachtige beschrijvinge van 64 tooveressen) These infamous trials are only known about because of a pamphlet. The actual process papers have been lost. 64 witches were arrested. The charges were: miscarriages, diseases in animals and fish, diseases in crops, and many people losing their livelihood. The witches had allegedly bewitched all these people. The charges no longer came from the peasants, but from the church and government who had investigated the complaints themselves and made the charges. There was now a true inquisition. The accusations were not only of bewitchings but also of heresy and forming a pact with the devil, and having danced and had intercourse with him. The witches were forced by means of torture to reveal the names of other witches that had partaken in the sabbath. Giving up the names of other witches was the main cause of the large number of trials. Tryntjen van Zittaert was the first to be arrested, together with her daughter, who purportedly learned witchcraft from her. While playing with children on the street she was said to have showed her crafts to other children. The 12-year-old girl apparently magically made things appear out of her mouth, like coins. A magistrate noticed and mother and daughter were taken into custody. The girl said she had learned everything from her mother. Both of them were from Sittard, where things like prestidigitation were allowed, but in the more Protestant Roermond this was not tolerated. Tryntjen was tortured and admitted to killing 41 children with magic, and also three men and seven women, and many crops and animals. She also accused the surgeon Jan van Ool of being a wizard. This Jan van Ool was from Gulik which was also less strictly religious than Roermond. After four days in custody the mother was burnt to death, and the daughter was locked into a convent for the rest of her life. The ten other witches were taken into custody together with Jan van Ool. He admitted to having tried to convince his wife to seal a pact with the devil, which she refused. He claimed he then became scared she would turn him in, so he cut her into pieces and threw her down a well and told everyone she ran away. He was forced by the devil to kill one patient with magic for every ten he healed. In 16 years he would have killed 150 people. That would mean he would be treating about 100 people a year. During his torture he accused 41 other people of being witches. He was burnt alive. These 41 alleged witches were also taken into custody. They admitted to having killed children, crippled or diseased people, including their own families. They said they had been forced into these actions by the devil. Near Straelen the magistrates arrested another 10 alleged witches, who in their turn accused a midwife named Entjen Gillis. Entjen Gillis confessed to having killed the foetuses of 40 pregnant women, and 150 babies just after birth. She had also supposedly killed their mothers and her husband and children with witchcraft. She was burnt alive. Altogether there were 63 witches and Jan van Ool, so during a month two people were burnt to the stake every day. The trials were handled in a very short period of time. The magistrates decided this needed to be done because over 600 newborn children and 400 old people, and over 6000 animals were purportedly killed by witchcraft.  References  * L.

The distillery's windmill tower is a Category B listed structure.WINDMILL TOWER, GLENUGIE DISTILLERY INVERNETTIE - Historic Environment Scotland History The Glenugie Distillery was established in 1831 by Donald McLeod & Co Ltd and was originally called Invernettie. In 1884, Simon Forbes purchased the distillery and enjoyed some success with it. He operated it until 1915. The distillery was silent for most of World War I, but opened for a short time in 1923-1924 as the Glenugie Distillery Ltd, but again remained silent from 1925 to 1937. Seager Evans & Co Ltd then re-opened it in 1937. Scheney International acquired Seager Evans & Co Ltd in 1956 and decided to improve the equipment and used an oil system to replace the coal-fired boiler, as well as introducing a pair of new stills with condensers. This led to production doubling. The solution on the resultant strain on the workshop was to cease site malting and also to convert the malt house to warehouse space. Closure Glenugie was one of a number of distilleries that failed to continue past the 1983 market. This was because there was too much competition at the time, leading to about a dozen single malt distilleries closing in this year. The distillery was dismantled and the premises were taken over by Score Group plc, who have built their workshops on this site.

They are especially known to be used by Colombian drug cartel members to export cocaine from Colombia to Mexico, which is often then transported overland to the United States. Concerns have also been raised that such vessels could be utilized for purposes of terrorism. The capabilities of these crafts has noticeably increased (some are now capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean); their operating places and circles have widened; and their numbers have taken a great jump. Newer narco-submarines are nearly fully submersible, designed specifically to be difficult to detect visually or by radar, sonar and infrared systems. Cargoes carried are typically several tons of cocaine. For example, in 2015 a cargo of was seized on a semi-submersible which had been tracked by aircraft, the largest ever recorded.  History  In 1980s, go- fast boats became the drug-smuggling vessel of choice in many parts of the world, though radar could detect these boats. As radar coverage improved, Colombian drug cartels began to develop semi-submersibles in the 1990s to avoid radar detection. An unmanned submarine was found off Boca Raton, Florida in 1988. It was designed to be towed by a boat, and submerged by remote control. The sub was empty, but authorities suggested that it must have been designed for smuggling contraband, since the hatch could only be opened from the outside. = 2000s = In November 2006, a narco-submarine was seized southwest of Costa Rica carrying three tons of cocaine. The U.S. Coast Guard dubbed it Bigfoot because they had heard rumors that such things existed, but none had actually been seen at that time. In 2006, United States officials say they detected three vessels in total. Experts estimated that 25 to 40 cocaine semi-subs departed from South America in 2007. A narco-submarine being seized by the U.S. Coast Guard off the Coast of Guatemala on September 17, 2008.By 2008, authorities were spotting an average of ten per month, but only one out of ten was intercepted. In the first six months of 2008, the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy detected 42 drug subs heading north towards the United States and off the coast of Central America, but few seizures resulted. The service estimated that 85 individual events would bring in about 544 tonnes cocaine by the end of 2008. On July 16, 2008, the Mexican Navy intercepted a 10 m-long narco-submarine travelling about southwest of Oaxaca. Mexican Navy Special Forces rappelled from a helicopter on to its deck and arrested four smugglers before they could scuttle their vessel. The vessel was found to be loaded with 5.3 tonnes of cocaine and was towed to Huatulco, Oaxaca, by a Mexican Navy patrol boat. On September 12, 2008, the U.S. Coast Guard captured a semi- submersible about west of Guatemala; it was carrying 7 tonnes of cocaine. The 18 m long steel and fiberglass craft was detected by a U.S. Navy aircraft as part of Operation Panama Express and was intercepted by Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment 402 which was deployed aboard USS McInerney. Five days later, an 18 m semi-submersible was seized by the Coast Guard cutter Midgett about 322 km south of Guatemala.Videos and images of these two seizures are available at the U.S. Coast Guard web site: Few other narco-submarines were seized as their crews scuttled them upon interception, with the vessels often sinking within a few minutes. In 2009, the United States detected as many as 60 narco-submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 tonnes of cocaine per year. On June 1 and 2, 2009 the Colombian authorities seized three narco-submarines on the shores of the Pacific coast, one of them loaded with 1.5 tonnes of cocaine. The Colombian navy had intercepted or discovered 33 narco-submarines by 2009. = 2010s = After the November 5, 2010 arrest of Harold Mauricio Poveda,The mafia rabbit (November 25, 2008) a key Mexican‚ÄìColombian link, it was suspected that FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) is behind the construction of narco- submarines and is collaborating with the Sinaloa Cartel to fund its armed activities.Detienen al Conejo, proveedor de El Barbas El Universal.

On 24 November, 2019, Spanish police apprehended a 20 m semi- submersible off Galicia, Spain containing 3,000 kg of cocaine. A narco- submarine was captured by the Peruvian Navy on 8 December 2019 carrying over 2,000 kg of cocaine off of the coast of the Department of Piura in Peru. =2020= By now, their suspected numbers are close to 1,000. Types of vessels Costing up to two million dollars each to construct, submarines can move enough cocaine in a single trip to generate more than 100 million USD in illicit proceeds for the traffickers. = Semi-submersible = Semi- submersible vessel moments before interception by the U.S. Coast Guard in August 2007. Colombia's Pacific coastline, where muddy rivers loop into the ocean, has long been a smugglers' paradise. Behind the jagged cliffs that jut into the ocean is a vast jungle, laced with mangrove-fringed coves and thousands of miles of waterways, easy to use as clandestine shipyards. A Colombian Navy Commander stated that it is most striking to notice the logistical capacity required of these criminals in order to take all the material into the heart of the jungle, including heavy equipment such as propulsion gear and generators. Sometimes they are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations under the jungle canopy, in camps outfitted with sleeping quarters for workers. The narco-submarines can cost about $2 million USD and take upward of a year to build. Despite the costs, some of the craft are intended for one-time use, being abandoned at sea after a successful delivery, given that their cargoes carry a street value of up to $400 million. On other seized craft however, officials found zinc bars used as sacrificial anodes, reducing corrosion on metal parts exposed to seawater. As corrosion would not be a concern on a single trip but is a factor influencing long-term durability, this is a clear indication that multiple use was intended. This, in turn, opens up the question of any illicit return cargo, like weapons, that they might carry back to Colombia. The design and manufacturing techniques employed in their construction have improved over time: the boats have become faster, more seaworthy, and of higher capacity than earlier models. An long narco-submarine can reach speeds of and carry up to 10 tons of cocaine. They are typically made of fiberglass, powered by a 225‚Äì260 kW diesel engine and manned by a crew of four. They have enough cargo space to carry two to ten tons of cocaine, carry large fuel tanks which give them a range of , and are equipped with satellite navigation systems. There is no head (toilet), and accommodation is cramped. Because much of its structure is fiberglass and it travels barely under the surface, the vessel is nearly impossible to detect via sonar or radar, and very difficult to spot visually. The newer models pipe their exhaust along the bottom of the hull to cool it before venting it, making the boat even less susceptible to infrared detection. They are most easily spotted visually from the air, though even that is difficult as they are camouflaged with blue paint and produce almost no wake. They have ballast tanks to alter the vessel's buoyancy so that they ride low in the water. Typical characteristics These are the typical characteristics as stated by the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South: *Hull material: wood, fiberglass, or steel *Length 12‚Äì24 m *Freeboard 0.5 m *Engines: single or twin diesel *Fuel capacity: 5.6 cubic metres *Range: 3200 kilometers *Speed: 11 km/h or more *Crew: 4 *Capacity 4‚Äì12 metric tons *Control: human or remote = True submarines = A true submarine seized in Ecuador in July 2010 Narco-submarines were considered by officials to be an oddity until 2000, when Colombian police discovered what was reported to be a half-built 36 m-longEl 'narcosubmarino' Colombiano. El Pais. 11 September 2000. true submarine in a warehouse outside Bogot√°. The double-hulled steel vessel could have traveled 3,700 kilometers, dived 100 m, and could have carried about 15 tonnes of cocaine. On 3 July 2010 the Ecuadorian authorities seized a fully functional, completely submersible diesel electric submarine in the jungles bordering Ecuador and Colombia. It had a cylindrical fiberglass and Kevlar hull 31 m long, a 3 m conning tower with periscope, and air conditioning. The vessel had the capacity for about 10 tonnes of cargo, a crew of five or six people, the ability to fully submerge down to 20 m, and the capacity for long-range underwater operation. Ecuadorean authorities seized the vessel before its maiden voyage. On 14 February 2011 another submarine was seized by the Colombian navy. The 31 m-long fiberglass and Kevlar vessel was found hidden in a jungle area in Timbiqu√≠, in south-western Colombia. It was capable of travelling 9 m below water and it could carry four people and up to 8 tonnes of cargo. = Torpedo = In August 2005, U.S. authorities discovered an unmanned semi-submersible in the Pacific Ocean. What they discovered was a \\"torpedo\\"-style cargo container (instead of a full-featured self-propelled ship). It used a ballast tank (submersion control) to keep it at about 30 m under water while being towed by a boat. This particular \\"torpedo\\" was planned to be towed by a fishing vessel. If a patrol ship is spotted, the \\"torpedo\\" cargo container is released. While still submerged, it was designed to automatically release a buoy concealed as a wooden log so as to be mistaken for marine debris by authorities. This log-buoy was equipped with a location transmitter system. This allowed the original towing vessel to retrieve the torpedo if the vessel and her crew were released by authorities. If the original vessel was detained, or otherwise unable to retrieve the cargo torpedo, the location transmission system also allowed for a second support fishing vessel to retrieve it and continue the narcotics delivery. Such a log- buoy was designed to be used as a last resort, as there would be inherent risks involved with the deployment of said buoy. Authorities could notice the sudden appearance of the \\"log\\", and investigate. Additionally, authorities could have possibly picked up signals from the buoy's transmission systems, and may have attempted to locate such signal(s). Therefore, crew involved in the towing would be instructed to operate under the guise of a normal fishing vessel. Indeed, the intention would be to ensure no suspicions were aroused, thus avoiding the risks associated with deploying the log-buoy, by avoiding deployment altogether. The buoy contains a mechanism to temporarily raise and then lower its antenna and transmit its coordinates in encrypted form a few times per day. Encrypted codes were used in the event that a buoy was deployed, and authorities intercepted its signals. Such an encryption could, at a minimum, delay authorities in their attempt to reach the cargo, ostensibly allowing the narco-traffickers to reach it first. This system was adapted from existing buoys used on tuna fishing nets. One of its designers claims a 90% shipment delivery success rate, and stated that the \\"torpedo\\" development was heading towards a remote control feature using encrypted signals transmitted via satellite.  Operations  = Operators = * Clan del Golfo * National Liberation Army (ELN) * Oliver Sinisterra Front * Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) * Sinaloa Cartel = Routes = The western Colombian shore topography is near ideal for transporting the cocaine produced in clandestine laboratories in nearby Nari√±o department. About a third of the 550 metric tonnes of cocaine coming out of Colombia each year leaves via the Pacific coast and a significant amount is being carried in semi-submersibles. The U.S. Homeland Security estimates that drug submarines now account for 32 percent of all maritime cocaine flow between Latin America and the United States. While the subs are most frequently used from the Pacific coast of Colombia, they are showing up elsewhere as well. The Coast Guard says drug runners have devised a complete logistics system, with fishing boats stationed along the way to warn the crews against patrols and provide them with food and water and resorting to putting refueling vessels far offshore so drug-carrying boats can avoid coastal areas. For traffickers, reaching Mexico is well worth the trouble, as a 9 metric tonne load can fetch nearly US$200 million wholesale. Fishermen hired specifically for the task are often at the controls, and those who complete the trip successfully are paid about US$3,000. Smugglers normally unload their cargo onto fast power boats for the final leg to shore and the semi-submersible is scuttled. None have been sighted unloading at North American ports or beaches. In 2006, a 10 metre long sub was found abandoned on the northern coast of Spain, where the authorities suspect the crew had unloaded a cargo of cocaine before fleeing. In March 2006, the Calabrian Mafia ('Ndrangheta) ordered a shipment of 9 tonnes of cocaine to be transported by a narco-submarine from Colombia to Italy, but the vessel was discovered by the Colombian police while it was still under construction. During 2007, thirteen of the vessels were seized on Colombian dry land or stopped at sea by Colombian or U.S. patrol boats, more than in the previous fourteen years combined, but arrests are rare. When clandestine shipyards were discovered, workmen escaped into the jungle. In some instances semi-subs are towed behind other vessels and are scuttled if detected. Authorities are investigating reports that some semi-submersibles are unmanned and are operated remotely.  Countermeasures  = Surveillance = In 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard was adjusting its underwater acoustic sensors to listen to a narco-submarine's engine over long distances. As of 2019, the United States Coast Guard reported that it captures only about 11% of narco-submarine vessels. = Legal = When semi-submersibles are stopped at sea, their crews usually scuttle them, sending both the boat and the cocaine to the bottom within minutes and leaving no evidence of trafficking. Until 2008, in accordance with maritime law, the crew was rescued and, if there was no physical evidence of wrongdoing, released without criminal charges. To address this legal loophole, the US Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act was enacted in September 2008, making it a \\"felony for those who knowingly or intentionally operate or embark in a self-propelled semi- submersible (SPSS) that is without nationality and that is or has navigated in international waters, with the intent to evade detection\\". The penalty is a prison term of up to twenty years in the U.S. The bill does not apply to flagged vessels (i.e., that have been registered with some nation). The bill grants extraterritorial jurisdiction over international waters, and also makes it illegal to lack relevant documents. Instead of an anti-narcotics operation turning into a rescue mission when the submarines are scuttled and sink, the crew can be arrested and charged. Some alleged narco-submarine smugglers are now facing criminal charges in the US for operating an unflagged semi- submersible. Colombia's Congress passed a law in June 2009, punishing the building of semi-submersible vessels with up to twelve years in prison, and transporting drugs in them with up to fourteen years in prison. National security issues related to torpedo style cargo containers, semi-submersible vessels, and submarines used for smuggling and/or terrorist activities were reviewed in an August 2012 article in Homeland Security Affairs. Also presented are behaviors indicating shifts in methods of operating by drug traffickers and the corresponding risk to national security.

Four representatives of Guyana qualified to take part in the Beijing Games- Adam Harris, Marian Burnett, and Aliann Pompey in track, and Niall Roberts in swimming-and Pompey advanced past the first round in her event, progressing to semifinals. Meanwhile, Alika Morgan (track & field) and Geron Williams (cycling) took part in the Games‚Äô Youth Olympics camp, held in Beijing at the same time as the Olympics. Along with coaches and administrative members, Guyana sent a total of ten people to Beijing. The appearance of Guyana's delegation in Beijing marked the fifteenth Guyanese Olympic delegation to appear at an Olympic games, which started with their participation as British Guiana in the 1948 Summer Olympics. There were no medalists from Guyana at the Beijing Olympics. Roberts was Guyana's flagbearer at the ceremonies in Beijing. Background Guyana is a former British colony that extends from the northern coast of South America. It is adjacent to Venezuela, Brazil, and Suriname, and is within the vicinity of the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. Athletes from Guyanese delegations have appeared at the Olympics since the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and have participated at every Summer Olympic games between 1948 and 2008 except for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montr√©al. Guyana declared independence from the British Empire in 1966, and participated in all previous games (from 1948 to 1964) under its colonial name, British Guiana. Overall, Guyana's appearance in Beijing marked its fifteenth Olympic appearance. The country has not sent delegations to participate in any Winter Games. In all of its history, the only case in which a Guyanese athlete has medaled at the Olympics was when Michael Anthony won a bronze medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. The size of Guyana's delegation peaked at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when it sent ten athletes, but (as of Beijing) had never risen past seven athletes other than in the 1980s. In Beijing, swimmer Niall Roberts bore Guyana's flag at the ceremonies. A total of ten people constituted the Guyanese delegation to Beijing: the four Olympic athletes, two Youth Olympic athletes (sprinter Alika Morgan and cyclist Geron Williams), chef-de-mission Noel Adonis, swimming coach Stephanie Fraser, track and field team manager Cornel Rose, and track and field coach Joseph Ryan. Six of the delegation's members were based in Guyana and departed from their nation on 2 August 2008 for Beijing. Athletics =Men's competition= Men's 200 meters The Beijing National Stadium, where Harris, Burnett, and Pompey competed in their events Adam Harris, who was 21 at the time of the Beijing Olympics, was the sole male track athlete participating on Guyana's behalf in 2008. Born in the Chicago area, Harris previously participated as an athlete at the University of Michigan. In Beijing, Adam Harris participated in the men's 200 meters dash, marking the first time he ever participated in any Olympic event. Harris participated in the first heat during the 17 August qualification round of his event, and finished the race in sixth place at 21.36 seconds. Harris placed ahead of Jordan's Khalil Al Hanahneh (21.55 seconds) and behind Botswana's Fanuel Kenosi (21.09 seconds).

Her final film appearance was in Love 'Em and Leave 'Em (1926), starring Evelyn Brent and Louise Brooks. On May 1, 1939, Sisson and her husband Rosson were arrested on a charge of espionage in Vienna, Austria with two other British nationals, by the Gestapo, allegedly for filming military hardware. They were held in solitary confinement for 34 days and released. On May 31, 1953, Richard Rosson committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. A year later, on August 6, 1954, Sisson committed suicide by barbiturate overdose. She is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery near her brother in law Arthur Rosson.

During his military tenure, he was given the title of King of Shi (‰æçÁéã) (meaning \\"Servant Prince\\"). In the latter part of the Taiping rebellion, he led Taiping forces to many military victories.

Victories =Army Group Jiangnan= Army Group Jiangnan (Ê±üÂçóÂ§ßÁáü) of the Qing empire had encircled the Taiping capital of Nanjing twice, laying siege in an attempt to end the war. The second siege consisted of nearly 200,000 Qing soldiers by March 1858, but they were routed when Li Shixian's Taiping force broke out of the capital in May 1860. With the Qing routed, Li Shixian was able to occupy all of the rich Zhejiang Province. Defeats =Versus Zuo Zongtang= In 1862, the Qing ordered Zuo Zongtang to attack Li Shixian in Zhejiang province. The Qing were successful, and after a number of hard-fought battles they recaptured all of Zhejiang. Li Shixian's rebel forces were reduced from about 350,000 at the outset of the campaign to around 200,000 in 1864, when the Taiping capital of Nanjing fell. After the capital fell, Li Shixian again successfully broke out with his remaining army and escaped along the coast to Fujian Province (Battle of Fujian). =The last Taiping forces= October 1864 around 12,000 pro-Taiping forces commanded by the Shi King Li Shixian captured Zhangzhou.[Men-at-Arms] Ian Heath, Michael Perry - The Taiping Rebellion 1851-66 (2010, Osprey Publishing) They held the city for several months until surrendering in the next summer. Li, and his remaining force of 40,000, came back to eastern Guangdong province, the Guangdong had been home to many Taiping forces of the first generation before they were driven out of their homeland during the first Battle of Nanking. Zuo Zongtang ordered six major generals to lead 70,000 soldiers of the Qing army, staging them for an invasion in Jiaoling County. On May 1, 1865, 20,000 Taiping forces surrendered to this army. Li disguised himself as a monk and escaped. On May 23 he came back to Taiping, however the army he had led no longer trusted him. He was betrayed, and assassinated on August 25, 1865.

In spring 1939, Joe (an elevator operator in his apartment building) took him upstairs to Ruth's apartment on the 18th floor. He was in his Boy Scout uniform. A newspaperman handed him a pile of baseball diplomas which the Babe would give out the next day at the 1939 World's Fair to raise money for poor school kids. The picture appeared on the front page of the Sunday edition of the New York Daily News.] Barnstone's daughter and son are also poets, translators, and scholars Aliki Barnstone and Tony Barnstone. Career = Teaching Positions = Willis Barnstone's first teaching position was instructor in English and French at the Anavryta Classical Lyceum in Greece, 1949‚Äì50, a private school in the forest of Anavryta north of Athens, attended by prince Constantine, the later ill-fated king of Greece, who was then nine years old. In 1951 he worked as a translator of French art texts for Les √âditions Skira in Geneva, Switzerland. He taught at Wesleyan University, was O'Connor Professor of Greek at Colgate University, and is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Spanish at Indiana University where he has been a member of East Asian Languages & Culture, and the Institute for Biblical and Literary Studies. He started Film Studies and courses in International Popular Songs and Lyrics and Asian and Western Poetry at Indiana. = Anthologies of Women's Literature and World Literature From Antiquity to Now = Barnstone co-edited sweeping literary anthologies from antiquity to modern day, with his children Aliki Barnstone and Tony Barnstone. The 1980 anthology A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now opens with the Sumerian language poet Enheduanna (2300b) and features women poets from each continent and literary epoch until 1980; later editions of the anthology end with a section on contemporary American poets, including Audrey Lorde, Lucille Clifton, Joy Harjo, June Jordan, Brenda HIllman, and Leslie Scalapino. The 1999 Prentice Hall anthology Literatures of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, 1990 pages in length, opens with a section on Asia from Vedic period (1500 to 200 B.C.) to Haruki Murakami (1940-). The section on Near Eastern and North African literature opens with The Shipwrecked Sailor (2040 B.C.) and ends with writings by Mohamed Mrabet (1940-). The Sub-Sahara spans oral creation myths to ends modern era writers Ben Okri, Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, J.M.Coetzee, Mia Couto, Dambudzo Marechera. The Americas section features Pre-Columbian era poems in Quiche-Maya and Quechuan languages through to the 20th Century Latin American and Caribbean authors, including Derek Walcott, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Isabel Allende, Laura Esquivel, V. S. Naipaul and Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams (poetry collection). The 2003 anthology Literatures of Latin America traces the history and evolution of literature in Latin America and the Caribbean. The book contextualizes literatures in Quechuan, as well as in Carib, Quich√©-Maya, and Nahuatl languages. Much of the anthology, however, features Spanish language writers, as varied as Spanish Conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, Cuban nationalist leader Jos√© Mart√≠, and 20th century playwright Reinaldo Arenas. Among the scope Latin American women poets and intellectuals, the anthology spans religious and secular writings from Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz to 20th Century authors Gabriela Mistral, Clarice Lispector, Julia de Burgos, Giannina Braschi, Luisa Valenzuela, Isabel Allende, and Laura Esquivel. Barnstone also edited Artes Hisp√°nicas/Hispanic Arts, a bilingual journal he founded on Spanish and Portuguese art, literature, and music (published biannually by Macmillan Books and Indiana University). Two of its issues were published simultaneously as books: The Selected Poems of Jorge Luis Borges, guest editor Norman Thomas di Giovanni, and Concrete Poetry: A World View, guest editor Mary Ellen Solt. In 1959 he was commissioned by Eric Bentley for the Tulane Drama Review to do a verse translation of La fianza satisfecha, an obscure, powerful play by the Golden Age Spanish playwright Lope de Vega; his translation, The Outrageous Saint, was later adapted by John Osborne for his A Bond Honoured (1966). In 1964 the BBC Third Programme Radio commissioned him to translate for broadcast Pablo Neruda's only play, the surreal verse drama Fulgor y muerte de Joaquin Murieta (Radiance and Death of Joaquin Murieta), which was also published in Modern International Drama, 1976. = Translations of The Restored New Testament = Barnstone's biblical work is The Restored New Testament, Including The Gnostic Gospels of Thomas, Mary, and Judas. In this annotated translation and commentary, he restores the Latin, Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew names to their original form. For Pilate, Andrew, Jesus and James, one reads Pilatus, Andreas, Yeshua, and Yaakov. To reveal the poetry of the New Testament, in the gospels he lineates Jesus's words as verse and renders Revelation and the Letters of Paul into blank verse. In his introduction he calls Revelation (Apocalypse) the great epic poem of the New Testament. The Library Journal in its 7/15/09 issue wrote, \\"In an achievement remarkable by almost any standard, and surely one of the events of the year in publishing, renowned poet and scholar Barnstone has created a new and lavish translation‚Äîalmost transformation‚Äîof the canonical and noncanonical books associated with the New Testament. In part a continuation of his work in The New Covenant, Commonly Called the New Testament (2002) and The Other Bible (2005), and in many ways the completion of the pioneering efforts of other modern translators like Robert Alter, Reynolds Price, and Richmond Lattimore,... The high bar Barnstone has set for himself is the creation of an English-language Scripture that will move poets much as the 1611 King James Version moved Milton and Blake. Only time will tell if Barnstone has achieved his goal, but his work is fascinating, invigorating, and often beautiful.\\" With Borges Jorge Luis Borges had already lost his sight in 1968 when Barnstone met him backstage at the 92nd Street Poetry Center in New York after a poetry reading he had arranged for the Argentine poet. This resulted in a long-standing literary friendship and partnership that lasted for most of their lives. In 1975-76 in Buenos Aires he collaborated with Borges on a translation of his sonnets into English. In his poem ‚ÄúA Blind Man‚Äù, the viewpoint character (a blind Borges) looks at an infinite mirror: :::I do not know what face looks back at me :::When I look at the mirrored face, nor know :::What aged man conspires in the glow :::Of the glass, silent and with tired fury. :::Slow in my shadow, with my hand I explore :::My invisible features. A sparkling ray :::Reaches me. Glimmers of your hair are gray :::And some are even gold. I‚Äôve lost no more :::Than just the useless surfaces of things. :::This consolation is of great import, :::A comfort had by Milton. I resort :::To letters and the rose‚Äì‚Äìmy wonderings. :::I think if I could see my face I‚Äôd soon :::Know who I am on this fare afternoon. After returning to the United States, they went together to the universities of Indiana, Harvard, Columbia, and Chicago to give talks (charlas) that appear in Borges at Eighty: Conversations (1982). In his memoir biography of Borges, Barnstone describes the genesis of a short story that would appear posthumously. One morning at dawn he went to poet's apartment. From there to the airport to fly to the Andean city of C√≥rdoba: > \\"These were days of the Dirty War with bombs exploding off all over the > city. When I arrived, Borges was wide awake, tremendously excited. He told > me his dream. ‚ÄòI wasn‚Äôt wakened by my usual nightmare, but by a bomb, a few > buildings away. So I remembered the dream and knew it would be a story. I > was tramping through downtown London, looking for a bed-and-breakfast place. > Above a chemist‚Äôs shop I found a shabbily respectable place and took a room. > The owner, a tall, ugly, intense man had me alone and said, \\"I have been > looking for you.\\" > His glare paralyzed me but in the hour of my dream I could see him > perfectly well. > You can‚Äôt get what I don‚Äôt have,‚Äù I said defiantly. > \\"I‚Äôm not here to steal. I'm here to make you the happiest man in the world. > I have just acquired Shakespeare‚Äôs memory.‚Äù > I took his bundle of papers, read one gloriously lucent page clearly from > an unknown play, picked up the phone and wired Buenos Aires for my savings, > cleaning out my miserly lifetime account. I heard the bomb and woke. By then > I could not remember a word of the burning text of Shakespeare's memory. The > words in gold on velum were there, in beautiful script but intelligible. I > came out of my Shakespeare business quick, clean, and empty handed. Except > for the story.\\" > With Borges on an Ordinary Evening in Buenos Aires (Bloomington/London: > Indiana University Press,1993), 70. In 1996 Barnstone published a sequence of 501 sonnets, including this poem on Adam and Eve who live the first morning of the globe: > :::THE GOOD BEASTS :::On the first morning of the moon, in land :::under the > birds of Ur before the flood :::dirties the memory of a couple banned > :::from apples and the fatal fire of blood, :::Adam and Eve walk in the > ghetto park, :::circling a tree. They do not know the way :::to make their > bodies shiver I the spark :::of fusion, cannot read or talk, and they > :::know night and noon, but not the enduring night :::of nights that has no > noon. Adam and Eve, :::good beasts, living the morning of the globe, :::are > blind, like us, to apocalypse. They probe :::the sun, deathray on the red > tree. Its light :::rages illiterate, until they leave. Borges commented: ‚ÄúFour of the best things in America are Walt Whitman‚Äôs Leaves, Herman Melville‚Äôs Whales, the sonnets of Barnstone‚Äôs The Secret Reader: 501 Sonnets, and my daily corn flakes--that rough poetry of morning.‚Äù Works =Poetry= *Poems of Exchange with Six Poems Translated from Antonio Machado, Athens: l‚ÄôInstitut fran√ßais d‚ÄôAth√®nes, 1951. *From This White Island, New York: Bookman, 1960. *Antijournal, Vancouver, British Columbia: Sono Nis Press, 1971. *A Day in the Country, New York: Harper & Row, 1971. *New Faces of China, Bloomington, IN/London: Indiana University Press, 1972. *China Poems, Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press,1977. *Stickball on 88th Street, Illustrated by Karmen Effenberger, Boulder, CO: Bonus Book of Colorado Quarterly, 1978. *Overheard, With 27 Drawings by Helle Tzalopoulou Barnstone.

The company is currently seeking out foreign partners either from Russia or Europe's Airbus Helicopters, with which the company has ambitions of developing the MLH and for producing around 350 medium lift helicopters. The three branches of Indian armed forces are envisioned to be major customers for the type. According to HAL, the MLH is to be in the same class as the Russian Mil Mi 17. Development =Origins= During the late 2000s, Indian aerospace manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which was interested in expanding their rotorcraft offering beyond that of the existing HAL Dhruv programme, began to explore the potential for the production of a conceptual 10-tonne class helicopter; this concept came to be known as the Medium Lift Helicopter (MLH). If produced, the 10-tonne MLH shall hold the distinction of being the largest rotary-wing aircraft to have ever been produced by India. Early on, it was recognised that the type would be primarily marketed towards military customers, especially the Indian armed forces, and that the tentative programme would greatly benefit from the involvement of a foreign manufacturer in a partnership arrangement. Speaking in September 2008 on the company's ambitions for the MLH, HAL Chairman Ashok Baweja stated: \\"We plan to develop and build 10-tonne class helicopters in partnership with either the Eurocopter or the Russians... This would be a joint venture between the selected company and HAL\\". At this point, there were public estimates of producing around 350 helicopters in the 10-tonne class, which was dependent upon the military market for medium-lift helicopters. HAL were also keen to explore the potential for export sales of the MLH, the prospects of which being recognised to greatly depend upon the foreign partner select to participate in the programme. During the late 2000s, HAL issued a formal invitation for bids from major rotorcraft manufacturers across the world to co-develop the MLH. However, during July 2009, HAL reportedly cancelled its active tender for the helicopter's co-development; by this stage, both Eurocopter and Mil Helicopters had been shortlisted as potential technology and investment partners. Allegedly, HAL informed the two companies that the tender had been scrapped because of the qualitative requirements of the armed forces having substantially changed. Speaking at a national seminar held in December 2014, HAL's chief test pilot, Wing Commander Unnikrishna Pillai, gave a talk on the design challenges posed development of medium and heavy lift helicopters in India. He said that, following on from the expertise gained in earlier projects, the Rotary Wing Research and Design Centre (RWR&DC;) of India has become confident and is well poised to develop medium lift helicopters.\\"HAL chief calls for stepping up indigenous helicopter production to meet demand.\\" The Hindu Business Line, 28 December 2014. =Relaunch= During early 2017, HAL reportedly re-launched its MLH proposal, now seeking to produce a 12-tonne twin-engine multipurpose helicopter; a new project name, the Indian Multi-Role Helicopter (IMRH) was also applied to the programme.Mathews, Neelam. \\"HAL Proposes an Indian Multirole Helicopter.\\" AIN Online, 16 February 2017. The IMRH has been conceived for performing various missions, including troop transport, combat search and rescue, VVIP transport, ground and offshore operations, air ambulance, casualty evacuation, and cargo carriage, including under-slung loads. It is to be capable of flying at altitudes of up to 20,000 feet while transporting either a maximum of 24 personnel or a payload of 3,500 kg.\\"This Indian Multi Role Helicopter By HAL Aims To Take On Russian Imports.\\" India Times, 17 February 2017. According to HAL, the proposed helicopter can lift double the capacity that is currently available using its Dhruv advanced light helicopter, which falls within the five-tonne class. One HAL official stated that the Indian Army is estimated to require up to 400 helicopters within the MLH's class. During February 2017, a full-scale mock up of the MRH was publicly displayed at Aero India 2017; according to a HAL spokesman, the mock up was largely based upon the existing Russian Mil Mi-17. By this point, HAL anticipated the first flight of the helicopter to occur during 2019; however, the engine to power the MRH is yet to be finalised. Likewise, the rotorcraft's finer details have yet to be fully defined, and are to only be finalised after specifications have been received from the intended users. Additionally, operator acceptance trials have been expected to take about 7-8 years before induction.\\"HAL hopes to fly multi-role chopper by 2019, yet to finalise engine.\\" Financial Express, 19 February 2017. In February 2017, the MLH proposal remained in the conceptual stage; it was yet to be cleared by HAL's board; accordingly, at the time, it was yet to commence formal design work. The intended engines to power the type are yet to be identified, while the helicopter is intended to be equipped with automatic flight control system, modern mission systems, advanced cockpit displays, and other contemporary avionics. At the time, HAL is in the process of developing a large, ‚Çπ600-crore helicopter manufacturing complex in Tumakuru; this is to be the hub of the company's rapidly expanding rotorcraft division.D.S.

During May 2017, HAL issued requests for information (ROIs) in regards to elements of the Indian Multi-Role Helicopter (IMRH); the requests involved the turboshaft engines, along with assistance in the development of a blade- folding mechanism and external reviews of the rotorcraft‚Äôs landing gear and transmission.\\"HAL issues RFIs for new 12t helicopter.\\" Flight International, 26 May 2017. The landing gear is planned to be retractable and use an active steering system and self-centering capability, while the engines are to be imported, equipped with dual-channel full authority digital electronic controls (FADEC) and be capable of above-average high-altitude performance. Both the main and tail rotors are to be made of composite materials and are to be coated with radar absorbent/infrared resistant paints. Operational history During 2008, HAL stated that it intends to offer the 10-tonne MLH to the Indian Navy for the purpose of meeting its established requirement for a fleet of heavy-lift helicopters.\\"HAL looks at foreign partners for chopper project.\\" The Economic Times, 29 September 2008. According to an official statement made during early 2017: ‚ÄúHAL will target export orders, aiming to replace ageing fleet of similar class of helicopters that are operational in more than 40 air forces‚Äù. As of 2017, a total of four distinct versions of the MRH have been planned, including a navalised maritime variant and a civilian- orientated model, for which HAL intends to achieve civil certification of. HAL has commented that the company has been examining the prospects of the indigenously-developed MLH essentially replacing the Mil Mi 17 helicopters that are in widespread use both abroad and in India, especially by its heavy use by most frontline operations by the Indian Air Force; possessing broadly specifications, the fledgling rotorcraft is to be capable of performing a greater number of roles than the Russian Mi 17.Singh, Rahul. \\"India-made multi-role choppers to match Russian Mi-17s: All you need to know.\\" Hindustan Times, 9 May 2017. While there has been no officially-stated requirement for a 10-12 tonne rotorcraft; however, the company has intentions for the IMRH to ultimately start replacing India's older Mi-17s after 2025. On August 5, 2019, it was reported that the process for securing government approvals for the helicopter has started. Full scale work will commence as soon as the project is approved, with first flight expected in 2 years. The requirement for such helicopters is reportedly of around 550 units.

History The incline at Price's Hill, c. 1906 Before the Symmes Purchase of the 1780s, the area of Price Hill was sparsely populated Indian territory. The remains of Indian burial mounds and lookout posts have been found in the region. Most of Price Hill was once part of Delhi Township. Cincinnati became heavily populated in the 19th century, due to steamboat traffic and hog packing, and some of the city's wealthier residents settled in the nearly inaccessible hill country to the west. This region was high enough and far enough away to escape the pollution and crowdedness of the inner city. One such resident was General Rees E. Price, who purchased and developed large parts of the hill. The area was then called \\"Price's Hill\\", later shortened to \\"Price Hill\\".A Brief History of Price Hill, Price Hill Historical Society A funicular called locally \\"the Incline\\" or \\"the Incline Plane\\" was built to help make the region more accessible. With its base on the corner of 8th Street and Glenway Avenue, the Incline climbed 350 feet over the top of the hill. Thanks to the Incline, by the 1870s there were thousands of residents. Most of the residents were Irish or German, and Catholic. The Eighth Street Viaduct was built by the end of the century, and the more accessible region became a thriving upper-middle- class suburb, with a commercial center along Glenway Avenue. Many of the houses that still stand in the district were built in the early years of the 20th century. Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West was first established on a site at the northwest corner of Grand and Warsaw Avenues. The site was converted to a Catholic school devoted to the care and training of orphaned, dependent, and underprivileged girls. Holy Family Parish was also located on this site. Seton High School was founded as Mount St. Vincent Academy, Cedar Grove in 1854 by the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati. Union Baptist Cemetery was founded in 1864, it is the oldest Baptist African-American cemetery in Cincinnati.Price Hill History , Price Hill Will When Cincinnati was plagued by tuberculosis in the early 20th century, Price Hill housed the Cincinnati Tubercular Hospital, one of the nation's leading centers for treatment and research.

Opened as a boys' grammar school in 1930, it became a co-educational comprehensive school in 1975. It then became an all-through school with the addition of a primary phase in 2014. History A new school called the Derby Municipal Secondary School for Boys was founded in Abbey Street, Derby, and opened on 12 September 1902. In December 1923, a new site for the school was acquired in Uttoxeter Road, Derby, and for some years was used for games. New school buildings designed by the architect Alexander Macpherson were built on the new site in 1928‚Äì1930 at a cost of ¬£71,746, and when the school moved into them in 1930 it was renamed Bemrose School, in honour of the services to education of the Bemrose family of Derby, and in particular of Dr Henry Howe Bemrose. The new school was officially opened on 11 July 1930 by Sir Charles Trevelyan, President of the Board of Education. A memorial to the sixty-eight old boys of the former Derby Municipal Secondary School who died in the First World War was moved to the new school's main corridor where it remains to this day. The school was originally divided into seven houses, each with its own colour and motto: Burke (Nil nisi bene), Drake (Semper audacter), Gainsborough (Vis unita fortior), Nelson, Newton (Consilio et animis), Sidney (Animo et fide), and Wellington (Pactum serva). By 1968 these seven houses had been reduced to four: Burke, Newton, Sidney and Wellington. In present times, the houses remain but they are now named after stately homes in Derbyshire ‚Äì Chatsworth, Hardwick, Haddon, Kedleston. The school became a grammar school, until in 1975 it was merged with Rykneld Boys' Secondary Modern School to make a new comprehensive school, when girls were first admitted, named Bemrose Community School. When Bemrose became a Foundation Trust school, its name was changed to The Bemrose School. In 2015, a new building was built and a Primary Phase was opened, making Bemrose an all-through school for ages 3‚Äì19. Work began in 2017 on a ¬£14 million three-year refurbishment and expansion programme that will create places for an additional 700 pupils at the school. Headteachers *1930‚Äì1951: Mr W. A.

They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, they remain in natural caves and a museum in Kabayan.  Description  Scientists believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the Ibaloi between 1200 and 1500 AD in five towns in Benguet and buried in caves. Others believe that the process of mummification began at 2000 BC. What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of mummification. That mummification began shortly before a person died, where he would digest a very salty drink. After his death, his corpse was washed and set over a fire in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. Smoke from tobacco was blown into the mouth to dry the body's inside and internal organs. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body. Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches. The practice of that mummification ended, since Spaniards colonized the Philippines in the 16th century. = Discovery = When the Fire Mummies were 'discovered' in the early 20th century by Westerners (the mummies have been known to local communities for hundreds of years), many of them were stolen, because the caves were mostly unprotected. Because of this, Monument Watch, a nonprofit organization, declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.  Today  After logging operations intensified in the area, the location of many caves became known. Unfortunately this has led to looting, as unconscientious visitors have been eager to leave their mark, including graffiti, on the Kabayan mummies. The Kabayan Mummies were listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. Funding through American Express was used for emergency conservation and the creation of a comprehensive management plan. Additionally, local authorities from surrounding municipalities collaborated in cultural awareness campaign to introduce the Mummies to Filipinos. Tourist facilities were also constructed in order to control visitation and prevent harmful intrusions. The Fire Mummies remain in natural caves with relatively small security and have been designated as one of the 100 world's most endangered heritage sites. Officials know 50-80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations because of their fear of vandalism. A small museum in Kabayan, Benguet also displays a few mummies.  Declarations  The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves are listed as National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum of the Philippines pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 374. It is also under consideration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Scholars are also pushing for the inclusion of the mummy burial caves in neighboring Buguias town in the Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves nomination of the Philippines in the UNESCO Tentative List. The caves in Buguias is home to one of Benguet's folk hero, Apo Anno. The burial caves in Kabayan and Buguias will collectively be called as the Benguet Mummy Burial Caves or Mummy Burial Caves in Kabayan and Buguias.

A Book of Common Prayer, given as a gift to Lydia Leamy in 1854, refers to St. David's as \\"Radnor Church\\". It has grown to be the largest congregation in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, with some 950 active families and 3,000 members.Art Carey, \\"For rector, an anthem of dreams: Faithful to Phillies\\". The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 13, 2008. The original church building, built in 1715 and the subject of a Longfellow poem, still stands. It is in nearly the same condition as when it was built, several new buildings having been constructed to house the growing congregation. The adjacent graveyard is a part of the historic site. The church property is divided by the borders of three townships, in two counties, often causing confusion as to the church's location. The church office is located at 763 South Valley Forge Road in Wayne, Radnor Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. History =Founding= After the establishment of the Welsh Tract in the colony of Pennsylvania, the area was settled by numerous emigrants from Wales, particularly Welsh Quakers, although Welsh people of other faiths, drawn by Pennsylvania's religious toleration and the opportunity to conduct their affairs in their own language, settled the area as well. In those days, life on the frontier saw exercise of religious beliefs in a limited way (frequently without houses of worship or clergy), which became a concern to many. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, in London, sent the Welsh Anglican Rev. Evan Evans to the area as a circuit missionary. He began holding fortnightly services in private houses, including that of William Davis in the area known as Radnor, in the southern part of the Welsh Tract, starting November, 1700. Rev. Evans returned home in 1706, leaving the area with no clergyman. In 1708, John Oldmixon in his book The British Empire in America noted that After Rev. Evans' departure, the Welsh-speaking Anglicans of Radnor sent the Society a 100-signature petition requesting a shipment of Welsh-language prayer books and Bibles, and especially requesting another Welsh-speaking missionary. A complete response was apparently slow in coming; ten years later, upon meeting their new leader, the parishioners \\"heartily engaged themselves to build a handsome stone church to be named after the Patron Saint of Wales\\". The cornerstone of the new building was laid on May 9, 1715.Nellie Urner Wallington, Historic Churches of America, Duffield & Company, 1907, p. 74.St. David‚Äôs Church: Who We Are: History.

Robert Weyman, who served during the 1720s, were paid by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and shared duties between St. David's and Old Trinity Church, located about 20 miles to the east in Oxford (now part of Philadelphia). =Revolutionary and Federal periods= With the coming of the American Revolution in the colonies, a wave of resentment against the Church of England (which professed loyalty to the king) arose among the congregation. A leader of this opposition was Anthony Wayne, a lifelong member of St. David's who was later appointed major general of the American forces. The rector, the Rev. William Currie, bound by his oath of duty to the king, resigned his position, which remained officially vacant for 12 years (Rev. Currie performed marriages, baptisms, and the like privately until at least 1783). When the war reached Chester County, the church building provided shelter for soldiers of both sides. While St. David's left the organization of the Church of England, it remained in the Anglican Communion, and the church was represented at the first General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States in 1784, after the peace treaty was signed.St. David‚Äôs Church: Who We Are: History The church was formally incorporated and chartered in August 1792. A church school was organized in 1820. The first confirmation services were conducted by Bishop William White, who became the first Presiding Bishop. The first physical addition to the church holdings was the fieldstone \\"Old Rectory\\" in 1844. =Suburbanization= Photograph of St. David's Church circa 1907. After the construction of the \\"main line\\" of the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1832, the once-isolated community began to evolve more rapidly, particularly after the railroad built local stations and offered frequent train service in the Philadelphia area. One of the way stations on the Main Line was named St. Davids for the church (the station is approximately 3 miles/4 km from the church), and a community of the same name grew up around the station. The community has no post office of its own, and is served by the nearby Wayne post office. As Philadelphians began to live outside the city in the late 19th century, the church's parishioners became more suburban. Interior photograph of St. David's Church circa 1907. As the congregation grew, the parish expanded accordingly. A parish house (office building), with church school facilities, was built in 1924 and enlarged in 1950. Further growth of the congregation led to heated discussion over whether the parish should accommodate a burgeoning membership or retain its early character; this was resolved by the 1956 construction of a new worship building, several times the size of the original church. In a nod to history, the original building retained the name \\"church\\" (sometimes called the \\"old church\\" for clarity), while the new building was named the \\"chapel\\". As a result, the \\"church\\" is the small building, while the \\"chapel\\" is the larger one, to the unending confusion of visitors. A separate building was built for Sunday school classes in 1965, the year the parish celebrated its 250th anniversary at a service attended by the Bishop of St David's in Wales. The building is named the Knewstub Building for a former rector of the parish. Continued growth of the congregation rendered the chapel too small by the time it was 50 years old. A new, larger chapel, seating 650, was constructed adjacent to the old one in 2006. A three-manual, 48-stop, mechanical action organ was installed in 2007. The old chapel, its pews, etc., removed, is now named St. David's Hall, hosting receptions after services and other church-related activities, and serving as a connector between the new chapel and the parish offices. The church grounds lie at the intersection of three townships and two counties. The old church building, along with a small portion of the graveyard, is located in Newtown Township, Delaware County; the chapel and offices are located in Radnor Township, Delaware County; and most of the graveyard is in Easttown Township, Chester County.See coordinate A-4 All three townships were originally part of Chester County until Delaware County was created in 1789. This situation can cause problems for the editors and users of databases and directories. Longfellow poem In March 1880, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited St. David's. Struck by the peace and quiet of \\"this little church among its graves\\", he composed a poem about it: \\"Old St. David's at Radnor\\", which was published later that same year in the collection Ultima Thule. The poem refers to another poet, Welshman George Herbert, and the small Bemerton church of which he was rector.St. David; Facts and Legends; Other churches named after him.

Historic Structures St. David's in 1925; photo from the Historic American Buildings Survey A log church was erected early in the 1700s. The \\"old\\" church building, constructed 1715, was added to or modified a number of times, in 1767, 1771, 1786, 1813, 1830, and 1907. These modifications included the relocation of the altar, the addition of an enclosed stair to the choir loft, the addition of a vestry room to the north, and the construction of an enclosure for the main entry door. A horse shed was built in 1850, and added to in 1871. Note: This includes The horse shed has since been demolished. These structures were recorded in the Historic American Buildings Survey.

Open to all, it also serves as a quiet sanctuary for anyone who wishes to walk its paths or sit amongst the graves and trees. As might be expected from a churchyard of such an age, there are a number of prominent people buried at St. David's. These include: * Anthony Wayne (1745‚Äì1796), general in the American Revolution; he died in Erie, Pennsylvania, and was buried there.

It is located 407 km from Asunci√≥n by a paved detour of 22km from the Ruta Transchaco. It is the main town of the Menno Colony, one of the Mennonite colonies of the Paraguayan Chaco. Climate The temperature in summer reaches up to 44 ¬∞C and, in winter, can reach 0 ¬∞C. However, most winter days are fairly warm, though a jacket, long-sleeved shirt and pants are good to pack in the suitcase for a winter visit since the climate changes quickly. The average temperature is 26 ¬∞C. The rainy season is December through March; however, some years are very dry and others very rainy so the climate varies a lot. History In the 1760s Catherine the Great of Russia invited Mennonites from Prussia to settle north of the Black Sea in exchange for religious freedom and exemption from military service, a precondition founded in their commitment to non-violence. After Russia introduced the general conscription in 1874, about a third of the Russian Mennonites migrated to the US and Canada. The members of the Colonia Menno (of which Loma Plata is the largest town and administrative centre), settled first in Canada until a universal, secular compulsory education was implemented in 1917 that required the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community. 1743 pioneers came from Canada to Paraguay in 1927 and turned the arid Chaco into fertile farmland over the years. It was the first Mennonite colony in the region. Some years later more Mennonites immigrants arrived to the Chaco area from Germany and Russia and founded the Fernheim (1930) and Neuland (1947) colonies. At the beginning, these pioneers had to overcome many adversities. Not only was their arrival not properly prepared as was previously promised by the Casado company because the settlement complex should have been surveyed and a railway constructed up to the settlement location, the settlement on the promised land was delayed 16 months and the immigrants were forced to stay in a preliminary, overpopulated camp in Puerto Casado before being able to move into the interior of the Chaco wilderness and the land they had bought for their settlement. Many became sick due to the lack of medical care, whereof 121 died, 75 of them being children under 14 years. Some 60 families returned to Canada. Instead of riding up the railway to the settlement, the settlers were forced to travel with oxen vehicles on bumpy roads and under very primitive conditions. The gradual move to the settlement area started in April 1928. Some families then already lived in wilderness camps, still many lived in Puerto Casado. They entered a hostile wilderness with the aim of creating a new life for themselves. Throughout the settlement area, they formed 14 villages. Together they cleaned up the camps, constructed their houses, made roads and installed the first common buildings such as schools and church. Today the Menno Colony has about 9,000 inhabitants descendants of the first around 1,200 settlers. Together they form a multicultural society with indigenous people, Latin Paraguayans, Brazilians and a number of people from other cultural origins. In 1937 Loma Plata emerged as the colony center and a colony office was built (currently the Post office). Loma Plata is a Spanish name. Some wanted to keep it, others again rejected it and wanted a German name instead. For this reason this place was renamed \\"Sommerfeld\\". After about a dozen years the Mennonites resorted back to the name Loma Plata and that was also the publicly recognized name. Today Loma Plata is the main town of the colony and home to a thriving agricultural co-operative, La Cooperativa Chortitzer Ltda. with an impressive dairy and meat production. It is a modern town with shops, supermarkets, schools, churches etc. Church The first and biggest church building was built in Osterwick outside Loma Plata. Today there are several German speaking Mennonite churches as well as Spanish speaking Churches. Some examples of German speaking Churches are Emmanuelgemeinde, Elimgemeinde, Mennonitengemeinde, Bethelgemeinde, Hoffnung f√ºr Alle and Manoagemeinde (the newest addition to the German-speaking churches). Agua Viva is an example of a Mennonite Spanish speaking church. There are also Spanish/Portuguese speaking churches of Pentecostal origin. Economy Residents of Loma Plata are engaged in agriculture, livestock and industry. They are organized in La Cooperativa Chortitzer Ltda. There are large dairies in the region, about 5,000 persons living in Loma Plata. There are two large supermarkets and several smaller supermarkets and corner shops as well as hardware stores in Loma Plata. There is also a bookshop with German, English and Spanish books. There are many small clothes shops all over Loma Plata. At times, private people organize yard sales or auctions. Health Currently one of the 4 existing hospitals in the department of Boquer√≥n is in Loma Plata, which serves all residents of the area. It was constructed in 1948. The work and costs were largely covered voluntarily and with donations. The first building had a size of 17x50 feet with a consultation room, a laboratory, a pharmacy and three rooms for patients. Today the hospital in Loma Plata is a modern health facility and is part of the services provided by the Asociacion Civil Chortitzer Komitee. It is one of the most frequently visited hospitals of the Chaco. The services expanded a lot in the last years and keep expanding with new technology. It attends not only the colonists but also many indigenous people and Latin Paraguayans of the region. There are many family doctors working at the hospital as well as several full-time specialized employees. Outward specialists come to the colony on scheduled times throughout the year in order to provide a broad spectrum of services. The hospital provide good maternal care by specialists and with midwives assisting at birth. There is a laboratory at the hospital as well as a private laboratory (Laboratorio Sawatsky) in Loma Plata. Loma Plata has a Nursing school where students can obtain a degree as a licensed nurse in cooperation with Universidad Evangelica de Paraguay. There are also several private medical clinics in the town, some with doctors that work privately as well as in the hospital. There are many dentist clinics in Loma Plata with dentists who have finished a training at university level. Pharmacies are found on several places around Loma Plata and are all private, except the pharmacy at the hospital, which belongs to the Asociacion Civil Chortitzer Komitee. Tourism Loma Plata is an important commercial and industrial center and has the necessary infrastructure to receive visitors: hotels, restaurants and access to several places of great tourist attraction, for example: Campo Maria, Laguna Capitan, Chaco Lodge and others. The tourist office is situated in a traditional building on the main street, north of the cooperative's supermarket. It is open Mon-Sat 7am-11.30am. The tourism representative is happy to give information about the places to visit in and around Loma Plata as well as giving tours. A very interesting and informative video about the colony, its inhabitants and development from the foundation in 1927 until today is available for tourists to watch. Loma Plata has an excellent museum with an outdoor exhibit of early farming equipment and a typical pioneer house plus an outstanding photographic exhibit on the colony's history. Guided tours are given in German, Plattdeutsch,Spanish and English. Guided tours are also given in the milk plant \\"Trebol\\" for those interested in knowing how the production of dairy products is carried out. Visits can also be arranged to the meat works, Frigochorti, where the cattle is slaughtered and the meat is packaged or used for sausage production. The visitor can follow the whole process through glass windows. Visits to the Frigochorti have to be arranged together with the tourist office in Loma Plata. As for handicrafts, bags and hammocks they are made of Caraguat√° Enlhet in the indigenous community of Pozo Amarillo, located 70 km southeast of downtown Loma Plata. In addition, there are exhibited works in palo santo wood. The Rodeo Club Isla Po'i, which belongs to the breeders' association in Colonia Menno, 1984, seeks to improve the quality of livestock production in the area. Annually, June 12, there is an exhibition where the regional production is shown. The members of the association are also working in the recovery of lagoons through open channels to facilitate the drainage of water at times of lots of rain and to clean saline soils. In the Experimental Isla Po'i Chacra, studies and experiments are carried out in different areas of agriculture: cotton, peanut, sesame, tomato, as well as explaining the process of tillage, crop rotation and others. It is experimenting with the different species of pasture for livestock feed, fodder and tolerable soil, climate and other factors for livestock production. It also works with fruit trees and ornamental plants and trees native to the Chaco for reforestation. Transportation Loma Plata is accessible by a paved road 22 km long, branching off the Transchaco highway. Nasa and Golondrina provide bus services about three times a day from and to Asuncion. Loma Plata even has a small airport. References * Geography Illustrated Paraguay, Distributed Arami SRL, 2007. * Geography of Paraguay, First Edition 1999, Publisher Hispanic Paraguay SRL.

Long story short, there‚Äôs no story here, much less a full blown scandal.\\" Environmental Initiatives MTR Western is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. In 2008, they offset more carbon dioxide emissions than they created, achieving a net negative carbon footprint. The company has six major environmental initiatives: * They have reduced their emissions by more than 50% by purchasing new motorcoaches outfitted with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) engines. * They burn the most aggressive blend of biodiesel fuel allowed by the company's engine manufacturer. * They are the only motorcoach company on the West Coast to use European-style, fuel-saving, super single tires. * Their drivers are trained to conserve fuel and avoid excessive engine idling. * Their shops are heated with recycled engine oil. (A space heater burning used oil can emit more lead than is produced by 10,000 homes using clean burning fuel.) * They purchase forest carbon offsets from the Pacific Forest Trust, including 6,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reductions from the Van Eck Forest Project. In 2008, MTR Western was awarded the UMA inaugural \\"Green Highway\\" award, honoring a corporation for its dedication to improving the environment. Associated Companies =OC&W; Coachways= MTR Western purchased Eugene, Oregon-based Oregon Coachways in 2006 from owners Donald Moorehead and John Mikulvich. The company, now named OC&W; Coachways, provides no-frills charter bus service in Oregon, California, and Washington. =GeoGenius= GeoGenius was a company based in Seattle, Washington that produced travel-related audio and video content for GPS-enabled devices. GeoGenius was founded by CEO Darren Berg in 2007. The company's first client was the parent company, which contracted them to develop GPS-triggered audio and video content for use by their motorcoach tour customers. The GeoGenius proof of concept, a multiple channel, multiple interest, GPS-triggered 7-day tour from San Francisco to Seattle, commenced operation in May, 2007. Another video tour was scheduled to be installed on MTR Western's \\"hop on, hop off\\" city sightseeing tour of Vancouver, B.C. in April 2008. Historical and travel-related content is featured on other tours of Vancouver operated by MTR Western subsidiary Sightline Tours. The company was developing content for personal download to multiple platforms, allowing tourists to construct their own tours. GeoGenius development is overseen by Lorayne Deceour (Larayne Decoeur).

It was begun in 1986 by a small group of gay men under the directorship of Robert Read and led by him until 1992. Since 1986 the Chorus has rehearsed in the gymnasium of St. Thomas's Episcopal Church in New Haven.St. Thomas's Episcopal Church. \\"History\\" From 1993 to 2007 the CGMC also performed in September in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a town with a large gay population. The shows, sponsored by the Provincetown Business Guild, were sold out every year since the first year. The CGMC is a member of GALA, the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses,Membership list , Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses. and the Arts Council of Greater New Haven.Arts Council of Greater New Haven. Directory History =20th Century= The first concert given by the CGMC was in 1987. After performing for several years in small venues like churches in New Haven and Hartford, the CGMC moved into larger commercial performance spaces like the Shubert Theater in New Haven and the Bushnell Theater in Hartford under the long-time directorship of Winston Clark, who became music director in the fall of 1992. Clark changed the direction of the Chorus from \\"standing on risers and singing\\" to fully staged, fully costumed musical revues, and decreased the politically themed content in favor of more general entertainment in a successful effort to attract a larger audience, including the non-gay community. The Chorus became known for humor, as mentioned in a 1999 article in The New York Times, ‚ÄúAs is customary with the Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus, parody rules.‚Äù A major turning point came in May 1995, when the CGMC brought its very successful musical revue, \\"Victory Canteen,\\" to the Shubert Theater. The revue, a salute to the United States armed forces during World War II, had been performed 7 times at the Educational Center for the Arts, a much smaller theater in New Haven. When it was discovered that the Shubert Theater was available in May 1995, the 50th anniversary of V-E Day, the CGMC took advantage of the opportunity to mount the show there. New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano, Jr., issued an official proclamation that the day of the performance was ‚ÄúConnecticut Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus Day.‚Äù Many local and state dignitaries were in attendance at the performance, which was the first time the CGMC had ever performed at the Shubert Theater. The show was sold out. Since that time, nearly all of the Chorus's New Haven performances have been at the Shubert Theater. Another important event was the composition and debut performance of ‚ÄúOut! The Whole Story‚Äù, a full-length musical based on the true coming-out stories of various Chorus members. Originally conceived as the second act of a two-act program, ‚ÄúOut!‚Äù was expanded into a full-length musical, complete with choreography, and the full-length program was presented as part of the following year's performance season. A 25-minute version was also presented at the 1996 GALA Festival in Tampa, Florida, to a tumultuous reception. A compact disc of the full-length version was produced, and one song from ‚ÄúOut!‚Äù, entitled ‚ÄúI Have Something to Tell You,‚Äù was nominated for a Gay and Lesbian American Music Awards (GLAMA) Award in 1998 in the Cast Recording category. In 1986 the Chorus incorporated as Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus, Inc., a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation. In 2000 the legal name was changed to Charter Oak Performing Arts, Inc. The Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus and CGMC are still used as names under which the corporation does business. =21st Century= Another milestone came in 2002, when for the first time the Chorus performed in the then brand-new Belding Theater, part of the Bushnell Theater complex in Hartford, Connecticut. The CGMC had outgrown its previous Hartford venue, the Wallace Stevens Theater at The Hartford complex. Since that time, all Hartford shows have been at either the Belding Theater or the larger Mortensen Hall, both part of the Bushnell Theater complex. The CGMC also performs at many fundraisers for other nonprofit groups, and at local events such as the Molson Summertime Street Festival in New Haven in 1992 and the Hartford gay pride march for several years. The Chorus also gives away blocks of tickets to performances to social organizations whose members might otherwise not be able to afford the price of a ticket. The Chorus has performed with guest artists such as George Howe, Mark Hardy, Tommy Femia, Julie Halston, and Julie Wilson, and has given joint performances with Another Octave/Connecticut Women's Chorus, the Boston Gay Men's Chorus, and the Baltimore Gay Men's Chorus. It has also performed at benefits with Harvey Fierstein, Cyndi Lauper, and Scot Haney. Since 2002, the main fundraiser for the chorus has been \\"Bingomania,\\" a monthly bingo game with entertainment, hosted by \\"Joan Crawford,\\" a man dressed up as the famous movie star. As many as 400 people attend the monthly bingo/shows, which have themes such as \\"Redneck Bingomania,\\" \\"Bad Romance Bingomania,\\" and \\"Easter Bonnet Bingomania.\\" The bingo is staffed by Chorus members, and prizes are donated by local businesses. \\"Joan Crawford\\" now has over 2000 friends on 'her' Facebook page. In 2004 the Chorus merited a full page in the book How the Homosexuals Saved Civilization by Cathy Crimmins,Cathy Crimmins, How the Homosexuals Saved Civilization, Penguin (USA), 2005, as an example of \\"how gay-tolerant small towns in Connecticut have become.\\"{Page 52} In April 2013 three sold-out performances took place at Lyric Hall, a small, restored turn- of-the-20th-century theater in the historic Westville section of New Haven, CT. In December 2013 two sold-out performances occurred in the 325-seat theater at the Co-Operative Arts & Humanities High School in New Haven. April 2015 saw the CGMC perform the New England premiere of \\"I Am Harvey Milk,\\" an oratorio with words and music by Andrew Lippa. The two performances at the Co- Operative Arts & Humanities High School in New Haven were both sold out.

Based on sulfur oxidation and reduction, it is classified as a hybrid thermochemical cycle because it uses an electrochemical (instead of a thermochemical) reaction for one of the two steps. The remaining thermochemical step is shared with the sulfur-iodine cycle. The HyS cycle was initially proposed and developed by Westinghouse Electric Corp. in the 1970s,Lee E.

Even though Site Six lies within the Lake Havasu State Park, Lake Havasu City manages this facility. In 1942, after the United States entered WWII, the U.S. Army scouted for, and established, airfields nationwide for the purpose of training pilots and aircrew. Seven emergency airfield sites were developed in Mohave County and along the Colorado River, including what‚Äôs now known as Site Five and Site Six. In 1942, the U.S. military built the Havasu Auxiliary Airfield #6 to serve as an emergency landing strip as part of its World War II defense plan. In 1943, the military expanded this airfield to include barracks, officers‚Äô quarters and a mess hall. This location soon was used as an R&R; location (rest and rehabilitation) for Air Force personnel; with fishing, swimming, boating, skeet shooting, and hiking readily available for soldiers on leave. B-17 bombers landed weekly, dropping off a new load of personnel and picking up the previous week‚Äôs personnel to be returned to their bases.

In the background the windmill Svanem√∏llen, which delivered a small income until the death of the artist in 1964, is now restored, is part of the museum, and functions on special occasions Johannes Larsen (27 December 1867 ‚Äì 20 December 1961) was a Danish nature painter. Biography Larsen was born in Kerteminde on Funen, Denmark. He was the son of Jeppe Andreas L. and Vilhelmine Christine Bless. His father was a merchant. Larsen studied art at the Free School in Copenhagen under Kristian Zahrtmann (1843‚Äì1917) in the 1880s. There he met other painters from Funen, notably Fritz Syberg (1862‚Äì1939) and Peter Marius Hansen (1868-1928), both from the southern port of Faaborg, and the Funish Painters group (Fynboerne) was born. They went on to create an art colony that influenced many Danish and Swedish artists and brought them success. In 1898, he was married to the painter Alhed Maria Warberg (1872‚Äì1927). Between 1901-02, the artist couple built their home on M√∏llebakken in Kerteminde. Their home became the gathering place in summer months for many painters, particularly younger artists from Zahrtmann's school. Their ideal was to paint outdoors, not just sketching but painting in all kinds of weather. Their paintings have a freshness and energy not previously seen, except in sketches. Once they became successful, they were attacked by symbolist artists for being \\"farmer painters\\" in a newspaper debate in 1907. This only brought the Funish group more sympathy, especially from a group of authors working from the provinces in Jutland. Their chief spokesman was Johannes V. Jensen (1873-1950) who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930. In 1910, businessman Mads Rasmussen (1856-1916), who operated a successful cooperative canning factory in Faaborg, decided to start a museum for Funish Art next to his canning factory. He created the Faaborg Museum, which still exists, and gave the Funish painters a boost, both by making their works available to a broad public and by supporting them financially. Kristian Zahrtmann exhorted all his students to paint in Italy; now some of them could afford to do so, and the Syberg and Hansen families enjoyed extended stays there. Larsen and his wife, Alhed Warberg Larsen, built a large studio and traveled mostly in Scandinavia. Larsen was mainly heralded as a bird painter, before this was a familiar genre in Scandinavia. He popularized images of birds, particularly through his woodcuts and smaller paintings. Later he received commissions to illustrate books and paint large paintings for public buildings, such as the Queen's receiving room at Christiansborg Castle (seat of the Danish Parliament) and the City Hall of Odense, capital city of Funen. There were several female Funish painters, struggling to be considered along with their male counterparts with greater or lesser success. They were Alhed Warberg Larsen, Anna Hansen Syberg (1870‚Äì1914) and Christine Larsen Swane (1876‚Äì1960), the wives/sisters of Larsen, Fritz Syberg and Peter Hansen. Their paintings are considered worthy of inclusion in many museums and collections today, though at the time they had a hard time exhibiting on an equal footing with their male colleagues. Christine Swane, who lived the longest, became a member of the artist cooperative called Corner when she was 60 and enjoyed great success in her later years. The work of all these artists can be seen at the Johannes Larsen Museum in Kerteminde, the Faaborg Museum in Faaborg, the Statens Museum for Kunst (National Art Museum) in Copenhagen, Funen's Art Museum in Odense, as well as in many other museums and collections.

Following graduation he photographed at the Pittsburgh Photographic Library for Roy E. Stryker, the director of the Farm Security Administration‚Äôs photographic-documentation project of the 1930s. For two years he served as a Lieutenant (j.g) in the U.S. Navy, spending part of that time assisting refugees from North Vietnam. Upon his return in 1958, he joined WIIC-TV, an NBC station in Pittsburgh, as a reporter and film photographer. As a freelance photographer, Blair also had commissions from the U.S. Information Agency, Time, Life, and the National Geographic magazines. He put together a one- person show at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh and co-authored the book Listen With The Eye with poet Samuel Hazo. Success with the National Geographic assignments brought him to the staff in 1962, where he happily spent over thirty years; by 1994, he had accumulated 46 articles and over 2,000 pictures. His coverage took him to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, West Africa, Iran, Greece and across the United States. He covered agriculture, coal, astronomy, and the uses of photography in science, among other subjects. in 1983 he photographed Our Threatened Inheritance, the National Geographic Society‚Äôs benchmark book on the U.S. federal lands. His final article for the Magazine, published in 1994, dealt with the first foreign sailing voyage down the Volga River in Russia. In 1977, Blair received the Overseas Press Club of America Award for Best Photographic Reporting from Abroad for his 1976 coverage of South Africa. Over the years, he has received numerous awards from the National Press Photographers Association and the White House News Photographers‚Äô Association. There have been one-person shows of his work in Iran, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Washington DC and he has been included in group shows in Atlanta and Washington. His photographs are represented in the permanent collections of the National Portrait Gallery (Washington DC), the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Portland Museum of Art (Maine) and the Carnegie Museum of Art (Pittsburgh).

Notice that the rotor blades seem to be swept back more than usual due to the rolling shutter effect. Simulation of the rolling shutter effect on a rotating propeller and a moving car [ (click for SMIL animation)] Rolling shutter is a method of image capture in which a still picture (in a still camera) or each frame of a video (in a video camera) is captured not by taking a snapshot of the entire scene at a single instant in time but rather by scanning across the scene rapidly, either vertically or horizontally. In other words, not all parts of the image of the scene are recorded at exactly the same instant. (Though, during playback, the entire image of the scene is displayed at once, as if it represents a single instant in time.) This produces predictable distortions of fast-moving objects or rapid flashes of light. This is in contrast with \\"global shutter\\" in which the entire frame is captured at the same instant. The \\"rolling shutter\\" can be either mechanical or electronic.Shutter Operations for CCD and CMOS Image Sensors Kodak The advantage of this method is that the image sensor can continue to gather photons during the acquisition process, thus effectively increasing sensitivity. It is found on many digital still and video cameras using CMOS sensors. The effect is most noticeable when imaging extreme conditions of motion or the fast flashing of light. While some CMOS sensors use a global shutter, the majority found in the consumer market use a rolling shutter. CCDs (charge-coupled devices) are alternatives to CMOS sensors, which are generally more sensitive and more expensive. CCD-based cameras often use global shutters, which take a snapshot representing a single instant in time and therefore do not suffer from the motion artifacts caused by rolling shutters. Distortion effects A photo exhibiting partial exposure. Lighting conditions changed between the exposure of the top and bottom parts of the photo. Rolling shutters can cause such effects as: * Wobble. This phenomenon (also known as the jello effect) appears when the camera is vibrating, in situations such as hand-held shots at telephoto settings, or when shooting from a moving vehicle. The rolling shutter causes the image to wobble unnaturally. * Skew. The image bends diagonally in one direction or another as the camera or subject moves from one side to another, exposing different parts of the image at different times. Skew is a minor manifestation of the wobble phenomenon described above. * Spatial aliasing. Vertically adjacent pixels are sampled in violation of the sampling theorem, when the camera or object motion is too rapid. One example of this is imaging of a quickly rotating propeller. The smear of each blade is caused by the propeller rotating at the same or near the same speed that the frame is read by the camera. Viewed perpendicular to a fan spinning clockwise, the blades on the left side appear thinner than usual while the blades on the right side appear thicker, and can even appear as if they aren't connected at the center. * Temporal aliasing, including partial exposure. If a camera flash goes on for only part of the time of the exposure, the illumination of the flash may only be present for some rows of pixels in a given frame. For example, the top 1/3 of the picture may be brightly lit by a flash, while the bottom 2/3 of the picture is dark and unlit, as the flash was off by the time that part of the CMOS was sequenced. The difference between the two distinct parts of the frame can look odd. Similar problems can arise with fluorescent lighting, strobe effects, lightning, or any extreme situation where very fast motion or very fast bursts of light are seen in the time between when the CMOS chip sequentially records a frame. Simulated effect of a rolling shutter on a spinning disc [ (click for animation)] rectified AC powered light-emitting diode grow light The effects of a rolling shutter can prove difficult for visual effects filming. The process of matchmoving establishes perspective in a scene based on a single point in time, but this is difficult with a rolling shutter that provides multiple points in time within the same frame. Final results depend on the readout speed of the sensor and the nature of the scene being filmed; as a rule of thumb, higher-end cinema cameras will have faster readout speeds and therefore milder rolling shutter artifacts than low-end cameras. the cliff in the background remain as normal. Images and video that suffer from rolling shutter distortion can be improved by algorithms that do rolling shutter rectification, or rolling shutter compensation. How to do this is an active area of research .

The village of South Northbridge became known as Whitinsville in 1835, in honor of its founder. The WMW became one of the largest textile machinery companies in the world. Known as The \\"Shop\\" to locals, would operate well into the 20th century, long after many of the New England mills had moved South. By 1948, The company was operating at peak capacity, employing 5,615 men and women. The Shop was the center of life in the village of Whitinsville, Massachusetts for over 135 years, until 1976. Origins 1826 Brick Mill and Fletcher's Forge, Whitinsville, Massachusetts In 1809, Paul Whitin and his father-in-law James Fletcher and others from Northbridge and Leicester, established the Northbridge Cotton Manufacturing Company. This wood-framed spinning mill, two and one-half stories high had 200 spindles and was only the third cotton mill in the Blackstone Valley at the time. In 1815, Paul Whitin became a partner with Fletcher, and his two brothers-in-law, Samuel and Ezra Fletcher, under the firm name of Whitin and Fletcher. Then they built a second mill with 300 spindles on the opposite side of the Mumford River. Paul Whitin then bought out the Fletcher shares in 1826 and formed a new partnership with his two sons, Paul Jr. and John Crane Whitin. The new company was called Paul Whitin and Sons.Whitin Genealogy by Don Gosselin Also in 1826, a new brick mill was constructed, having 2000 spindles, which still stands today at Whitinsville, having been recently restored. The 1826 brick mill is perhaps the oldest surviving, unaltered textile mill remaining in Massachusetts. Colonel Fletcher's 1772 Blacksmith Forge is also still standing, next to the Brick Mill, on the west bank of the Mumford River. Later on, Paul Whitin's two other younger sons, Charles P. and James F. later also entered into the family-run business. Whitin died in 1831. Years later, with the cotton business on a solid basis and escalating in 1845, Betsey Whitin and her sons built a new, stone textile factory, largely of granite known as the Whitinsville Cotton Mill, which gave the family business 7,500 more spindles. The Whitinsville Cotton Mill would later be used as a testing facility for new equipment developed by the Whitin Machine Works, across the street. This is now called the restored Cotton Mill Apartments, in Whitinsville. Whitinsville: a company town A Whitin Spinning Frame In 1831, Paul Whitin's third son John Crane Whitin designed and had patented a new cotton picker machine that outperformed others in the previous mills. This was to be first of other successive inventions that would establish the Whitin Machine Works as a great textile machinery company. In 1847, the Whitins built \\"The Shop,\\" which consisted of a new textile production area that was four times larger than the brick mill. It contained machine shops, foundries, and other specialized structures. As the family textile businesses expanded, so did the village of Whitinsville. More housing was provided by the company for new workers on North Main St. and on other side streets as Irish workers poured into the labor pool that same year (1847). Just seven years prior, John C. Whitin had developed the first of stately mansions, which had occupied land where the Whitin Gymnasium now stands. During this time also, Paul Whitin Jr. had married Sarah Chapin and built a new Italian-styled home, along with his brother in 1856. Life in the village revolved around \\"the shop,\\" providing the means and the opportunity for successive generations of mostly Europeans to immigrate. The Whitin's built the entire village to support their expanding business operations. In all the company would erect 1,000 buildings (2200 units) to house their growing workforce. The work was hard and often dangerous. There were recorded incidents where workers lost their lives working in the shop foundry or the machine shop. But working and living in Whitinsville was much better than the average mill town. \\"The company\\" provided amenities unheard of in neighboring villages; such as heating coal at company cost, free snowplowing, landscaping and property maintenance. The Whitin's allowed any employee who heated their homes with wood access to their properties to cut down as many trees as needed, free of charge. The company constructed the first reservoir, creating meadow pond, (west of Main St.) which was the first system that pumped water directly into village homes. A typical sight on weekends would be the villager's sailing and fishing on the pond using equipment rented from the company provided facility. Through the 1860s the work schedule was 11 hours (7am-6pm) per day and 6 days per week. And yet, there was a long-standing tradition of allowing up to 4 unpaid personal days off per month. It is well known, for instance, that during slow times in the shop, John C. would hire idle employees to work on his property, farms, or, as in 1879, build the Town Hall as a memorial to his late father and mother. As the fortunes of the company grew, so would its generosity to the town. Many public buildings still in use today were built with Whitin funds and then donated to the town; the Whitin Community Center being a prime example. The Whitin family continued to hold the Whitin Machine Works privately until 1946. By 1948, the company was operating at peak capacity, employing 5,615 men and women. Its products were sold worldwide. However, the business declined over the next two decades. In 1966, Whitin Machine Works was sold to White Consolidated Industries. The plant would struggle along for another decade, when in 1976 the facility was shut up.Blackstone River Valley Article Today Referred to as \\"The Shop\\" in Whitinsville, for more than fifteen years, the massive facility converted into a complex that has been replaced with 26 different businesses employing approximately 2,000 people.

Many Russians were happy that John Paul had reduced the influence of atheistic Communism in Eastern Europe and contributed to a rebirth of Christianity in the country. However, many others did not like the fact that the fall of the Soviet Union had also provoked a loss of Russian influence in Eastern Europe.

A tributary of Aliso Creek, it drains a deep undeveloped valley to the west of Aliso Viejo. The Wood Canyon was populated by the Acjachemen tribe hundreds of years ago; many archaeological sites along the creek provide evidence of their habitation. Spanish explorers and colonists arrived in the mid-18th century, establishing missions and a rancho that extended around the Aliso Creek watershed. Wood Canyon was used first as a cattle grazing area; after California became part of the United States, it was used to graze sheep. From the 1960s onward, the creek's flow has been heavily affected by urban runoff from suburban residential development. The Wood Canyon watershed drains a portion of the San Joaquin Hills, a short coastal mountain range that uplifted beginning in the mid-Pleistocene (1.22 MYA). Course The Wood Canyon Creek now begins slightly south of California State Route 73. The original headwaters have been filled in and piped under residential communities. The creek proper begins at a storm drain in Canyon View Park, Aliso Viejo and flows into an artificial wetland designed to control and treat the runoff.Wood Canyon Emergent Wetland Project. City of Aliso Viejo. For its first , the creek flows south through a narrow forested gorge. Further downstream the valley widens to form grasslands and meadows, where the remains of sheep corrals built in the 1800s can be found. About halfway along its length the creek receives effluent from the Muirlands Storm Drain, then is joined by the intermittent Mathis Canyon Creek from the right. Flowing past Temple Hill, a peak of the San Joaquin Hills to the east, it crosses the Wood Canyon Trail three times. Several grouted riprap drop structures have been built here to protect the trail from stormwater erosion. It then passes under the Aliso Creek Trail through a series of culverts and cascades down into Aliso Creek.  Watershed  The Wood Canyon subwatershed is contained entirely within the San Joaquin Hills, a small coastal mountain range that follows much of Orange County's Pacific coast. It is a long, narrow valley about long and wide, bounded by arid slopes high, and covering about . Nearly 80% of the Wood Canyon watershed forms the northern arm of Aliso Canyon. It is the second largest tributary of Aliso Creek, following Sulphur Creek.Orange County California Watershed Running nearly parallel to Laguna Canyon in the west for much of its length, Wood Canyon Creek is bounded on the east and north by the city of Aliso Viejo. Except for a few bordering portions, the watershed is relatively undeveloped. The Wood Canyon Trail, which is partially paved but mostly a wide dirt road, follows the creek for its entire length. The Dairy Fork subwatershed of Aliso Creek borders Wood Canyon Creek to the northeast. Modified extensively by man-made runoff and erosion control measures, Wood Canyon Creek is referred to by the Watershed and Coastal Resources Division of Orange County as the Wood Canyon Channel. Some stretches of the creek are lined with riprap and there are three grouted riprap drop structures on the creek, each tall. The riparian zone surrounding the creek is one of the most prominent in the Aliso Creek watershed as a whole, although urban runoff has degraded its health.

It operates the E-3 Sentry aircraft conducting airborne command and control missions. The squadron's first predecessor was the 862nd Bombardment Squadron, a heavy bomber unit that saw combat during World War II in the European Theater of Operations, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. Toward the end of the war, the squadron operated fighter aircraft, acting as a scouting force for bomber formations. After V-E Day, the squadron returned the United States and was inactivated. The second predecessor of the squadron was activated at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts as the 962nd Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron in 1955. It performed surveillance and warning missions off the Atlantic coast until inactivating in 1969. The two squadrons were consolidated into a single unit in 1985. The consolidated squadron was activated in Alaska the following year and has provided surveillance, detection and control of airpower since then. Mission The 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron provides United States Indo-Pacific Command with long-range airborne surveillance, detection, identification, and command and control aircraft for both regional and deployed operations. It also supports North American Aerospace Defense Command's air defense of its Alaska NORAD Region. History =World War II= Initial activation and training in the United States B-24s of the 493d Bomb Group at Debach The squadron's first predecessor, the 862th Bombardment Squadron, was first activated at McCook Army Air Field, Nebraska as one of the original four squadrons of the 493d Bombardment Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 362-363 The formation of the squadron was delayed by an administrative error that caused some of the unit's cadre to report to Davis- Monthan Field, Arizona instead of McCook. It was not until January 1944 that all personnel were at McCook.Freeman, p. 262 By this time, the squadron had transferred on paper to Elveden Hall, England. The ground personnel of the squadron in the United States had been used to form Boeing B-29 Superfortress units being activated by Second Air Force, while the air echelon remained in Nebraska to conduct training on their assigned Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Meanwhile, Eighth Air Force formed a new ground echelon for the squadron in England from other units assigned to the 3d Bombardment Division. This ground echelon moved to the squadron's combat station, RAF Debach, in April 1944. The squadron's air echelon departed for England via the northern ferry route on 1 May, while a small ground component left McCook and sailed from Boston, Massachusetts on the SS Brazil on 12 May 1944. Combat in Europe 493d Bomb Group B-17 The squadron flew its first combat mission on D-Day, 6 June 1944. It continued to fly Liberators until 24 August 1944, when it was withdrawn from combat to convert to Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, along with other units of the 93d Bombardment Wing, as Eighth Air Force concentrated all its Liberators in the 2d Bombardment Division. It resumed combat missions with the B-17 on 8 September 1944. The squadron concentrated its attacks on military and industrial targets in Germany, attacking an ordnance depot in Magdeburg, factories near Frankfurt, and a synthetic oil manufacturing plant at Merseburg. It also attacked lines of communications, including a railroad tunnel at Ahrweiler, bridges at Irlich, and marshalling yards near Cologne. The squadron was occasionally diverted from the strategic bombing campaign to attack tactical targets. It supported Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion, striking artillery batteries, airfields and bridges. It struck enemy ground forces south of Caen and during Operation Cobra, the breakout at St Lo. It bombed German fortifications to support Operation Market Garden, airborne attacks attempting to secure a bridgehead across the Rhine in the Netherlands, and attacked communications during the Battle of the Bulge. Toward the end of the war, it also supported Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine in Germany. On 1 February 1945, the squadron designation replaced the 3d Scouting Force and moved to RAF Wormingford, while the squadron's personnel were distributed among the other squadrons of the 493d Group. The scouting forces had been established in each division of VIII Bomber Command to precede bomber formations and warn of adverse weather or enemy opposition. The force was equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs flown by experienced bomber pilots, while wingmen were fighter pilots.Freeman, pp. 162-163 After hostilities and the need for a scouting force ended, the squadron was reformed at Debach in the 493d Group in May. The squadron flew food-dropping missions in early May. The squadron air echelon departed Debach on 30 June, while the ground echelon sailed for home aboard the on 6 August 1945. In late August, the squadron assembled at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, where it was inactivated on 28 August 1945. =Airborne warning and control= Air Defense of the Atlantic coast Lockheed EC-121D The second predecessor of the unit, the 962d Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron, was activated at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts on 8 July 1955. The squadron's primary tactical aircraft was the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, although it flew other models of the Constellation as well. At Otis, it was assigned to the 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing of Air Defense Command (ADC). The squadron mission was to extend ADC's early warning system radar coverage seaward beyond that provided by ADC's land radars. The unit also provided navigation and communications assistance to U.S. and allied aircraft crossing the Atlantic Ocean and conducted search and rescue operations. The 962d was inactivated on 31 December 1969. Alaskan operations The 962d was consolidated with the 862d Bombardment Squadron as the 962d Airborne Warning and Control Squadron while inactive in 1985. The consolidated unit was activated on 8 July 1986, at Elmendorf Air Force Base. The 962d was assigned to the 28th Air Division at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, which controlled all Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft. The mission of the 962d was to provide the Eleventh Air Force commander (who also commanded the Alaska NORAD Region) with a survivable radar platform to extend the surveillance coverage of land-based radars operated by the Alaskan Regional Operational Control Center. The squadron's airborne radars could detect threats at ranges outside the ground- based radar coverage areas to position interceptors to intercept them before they enter U.S. airspace. Between 1986 and 2007, the squadron assisted in the interception of 68 Soviet Air Force aircraft. In May 1992, the 28th Air Division was inactivated and the squadron was briefly assigned to the 552nd Operations Group. This assignment was brief, since the Air Force had decided that units on a base should all be assigned to one wing under what was named the Objective Wing organization, In October 1992, the squadron was reassigned to the 3d Operations Group of Elmendorf's host 3d Wing at Elmendorf. It also acquired the mission of being ready to deploy in support of United States Pacific Command. In August 1994, the 962d was redesignated the 962d Airborne Air Control Squadron. On 22 September 1995, the squadron experienced its worst single accident. Aircraft Yukla 27 rolled for takeoff at 0746 Alaska Standard Time, remaining airborne only 42 seconds due to a massive birdstrike resulting in catastrophic damage. The crash resulted in the deaths of 22 U.S. Air Force and two Royal Canadian Air Force personnel. Today, squadron aircrews take part in exercises such as Red Flag - Alaska, Team Spirit, Green Flag, and Tandem Thrust.

There were nine European and ten native priests, the mission being confided to the Society of the Foreign Missions of Paris. The Right Rev. Mgr Desfl√®ches (1844‚Äì87), Titular bishop of Sinita, was elected first Apostolic vicar. Missionaries and Christians were subject to imperial persecutions, but after the Franco-Chinese War of 1860, they obtained entire freedom to preach. In 1860 the mission was divided into two Apostolic vicariates: Eastern - and Southern Szechwan. The missionaries obtained from Chinese officials a piece of ground in the city of Chongqing (Chungking), as compensation for the losses undergone by the mission. New persecutions broke out: at Yu-yang Father Eyraud was put in jail, Fathers Mabileau and Rigaud were murdered; at Kien-Kiang Fathers Hue and Tay were killed in 1873; on 8 March 1876, the settlements of the Christians were pillaged at Kiang-pe. Father Coupat, elected coadjutor in 1882, in 1888 succeeded Bishop Desfl√®ches, who was 'promoted' Titular Archbishop of Claudiopolis in Honoriade. In 1886 the buildings of the mission at Chongqing were pillaged and destroyed, the bishop and missionaries had to retire into the Chinese tribunal. In 1891 the Right Rev. Mgr Chouvellon, titular Bishop of Dausara, succeeded Bishop Coupat. In 1898 Fr.

During his career Rousseau has worked for various comic book companies, but is best known for his work on DC Comics titles like Harley Quinn, Batman Beyond and Impulse. He also worked for Disney Adventures (Kim Possible), Beckett (Ruule: Kiss and Tell, Ronin Hood of the 47 Samurai, The Cobbler‚Äôs Monster), Image Comics (Tellos: The Last Heist, Tales of Tellos, Invincible Handbook, Monster Pile-up) and Marvel Comics' Creative Services. He has additionally drawn, and co-created with Todd DeZago, The Perhapanauts for Dark Horse and Image Comics (Perhapanauts: First Blood and Perhapanauts: Second Chances). More recently, he has drawn Marvel's Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. Early career Growing up Craig Rousseau never saw comic books as a viable career option, instead wanting to explore a career as a commercial artist. \\"(I) wasn't planning on doing comics for a living. I grew up reading comics with a few of my good friends and never outgrew them. I always wanted to get into the art field and my parents were very supportive of that.\\"Alumni Titans of Comic Book Art at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth Rousseau began in comics in the mid-1990s while he was graduating from college with a double major in Painting/Illustration. His initial plan was to do freelance illustration and not comics, however he was hired to work at Marvel's Creative Service Department designing POGS and children's books and soon began illustrating comic books. Rousseau's influences are varied. In a 1998 interview he stated, \\"There are lots of guys whose work I like and try to take something from and use it in my own way - Art Adams, Mike Mignola, Walt Simonson, Teddy Kristianson, Mike Weiringo, and lots more.\\"Welcome To DCU: Next Generation - Interview With Craig Rousseau He has also drawn from non- comic book artists and has cited artists such as Norman Rockwell, NC Wyeth, Aubrey Beardsley, Egon Schiele and Mucha as being strong influences on his work. 1990s After sending his portfolio to various editors, Rousseau was hired by DC and assigned the book Impulse. \\"...after sending samples everywhere,\\" says Rousseau, \\"I got a fill-in issue of IMPULSE (22) and was asked to do 21 as well...next thing I knew, I had a full-time gig (which surprised me, 'cause those books looked TERRIBLE)!\\" He spent the bulk of the 1990s at DC and soon became the regular artist on Impulse from issue #27 and remained until issue #48. He returned for fill-in issues after that. After Impulse, DC assigned him as the semi-regular artist on Batman Beyond and Harley Quinn. He also worked on titles such as Young Justice and Batman titles, Gotham Adventures and Detective Comics. 2000s In 2001 Rousseau began work at Image Comics by drawing Tellos: The Last Heist, when he was paired with legendary inker Terry Austin. During this time he branched out and worked for companies such as Beckett (Ronin Hood of the 47 Samurai) and Portal Productions Studio (BOTS). He also began work at Marvel, illustrating an issue of X-Men: First Class, and Marvel Adventures Super Heroes. He also returned to DC to illustrate their children's safety book, Energy & Safety Adventures with the JLA. In 2008 he was the regular artist on the second series of Marvel's Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, a job that he relished for its change of pace. In a recent interview he stated, \\"It's a breath of fresh air since it's not so much costumes and superheroes. It's a lot of acting and facial expressions which can be a lot of fun. I'm at the point now where issue five is wrapping up and I'm going on to more mainstream superhero stuff, so it'll be nice to do more fight scenes and stuff like that. But the teenage girl stuff has been kinda fun.\\"Interview with Craig Rousseau, Wizard World Perhapanauts In 2001 Rousseau helped develop and co-create the series Perhapanauts with writer Todd DeZago. Rousseau and DeZago had previously worked together on DC's Impulse title and DeZago pitched the initial idea for Perhapanauts. \\"When I first pitched The Perhapanauts to Craig,\\" says DeZago, \\"I think I told him that it would be part X-Files, part Mission: Impossible, and part Archie comic. (I had imagined that it would be a Saturday morning cartoon of a comic book; a spooky Scooby-Doo-type adventure, and then a few pages of Archie-like jokes and gags.) As the first issues unfolded, however, with our concept still fairly ambiguous, we found that it was developing its own voice, its own 'flavor', and, like parents with a young child, we let it go and discover its own identity.\\" PiQ, May 2008 Together the duo took the concept to Dark Horse Comics where a mini-series was published, after which DeZago and Rousseau moved to Image Comics. The reasons for the move included a perception of apathy for the series on the part of Dark Horse. \\"Craig and I were feeling zero love from Dark Horse,\\" said DeZago, \\"They did nothing at all to promote our second series, Second Chances, when it came out and were very slow at getting back to us with any sales or financial information. People would come up to our table and claim that they had never even heard of the book. Craig and I would go to shows/conventions and find that Dark Horse didn‚Äôt even have our book at their booth!\\" Once the title had moved from Dark Horse, Image Comics subsequently discarded the mini-series concept and relaunched the title as an ongoing series and it now appears as a quarterly title. Rousseau has stated his admiration for both writer DeZago and the series on more than one occasion. \\"We share the same sensibilities and wanted to do something that we wanted to read--crypto-zoological creatures, action, adventure, humor. The stories and characters have taken turns we hadn't planned on, and honestly, that's some of the fun of working on the book.\\" Further career Rousseau remains active in comic books and also produces commissions when available.Craig Rousseau Commissions at Comic Art House His recent comic book work includes a four-part Marvel Comics series titled Iron Man and the Armor Wars,Iron Man & The Armor Wars at Comic Book Bin which Marvel has described as being, \\"Cash, cars, boats, houses‚Ä¶Tony Stark has got it all.

It is not universally observed. History The first feast in honour of the Crown of Thorns (Festum susceptionis coronae Domini) was instituted at Paris in 1239, when Louis IX of France brought there the relic of the Crown of Thorns, which was deposited later in the Royal Chapel, erected in 1241‚Äì48 to guard this and other relics of the Passion. The feast, observed on 11 August, though at first special to the Royal Chapel, was gradually observed throughout the north of France. In the following century another festival of the Holy Crown on 4 May was instituted and was celebrated along with the Feast of the Invention of the Cross in parts of Spain, Germany, and Scandinavia. It was later kept in Spanish dioceses and is observed by the Dominicans on 24 April. A special feast on the Monday after Passion Sunday was granted to the Diocese of Freising in Bavaria, by Pope Clement X (1676) and Pope Innocent XI (1689) in honour of the Crown of Christ. It was celebrated at Venice in 1766 on the second Friday of March. In 1831 it was adopted at Rome as a double major and is observed on the Friday following Ash Wednesday. As it is not kept universally, the Mass and Office are placed in the appendices to the Breviary and the Missal.

She was the third ship in her class and the second vessel to carry the designation . She was sold for scrapping in 2009. Design and description Based on the preceding design, the Restigouches had the same hull and propulsion, but different weaponry.Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 45 Initially the St. Laurent class had been planned to be 14 ships. However the order was halved, and the following seven were redesigned to take into improvements made on the St. Laurents. As time passed, their design diverged further from that of the St. Laurents.Milner, p. 248 The ships had a displacement of , at deep load. They were designed to be long with a beam of and a draught of . The Restigouches had a complement of 214.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 251 The Restigouches were by powered by two English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving a propellor shaft, using steam provided by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. They generated giving the vessels a maximum speed of . The Restigouches were equipped with SPS-10, SPS-12, Sperry Mk 2 and SPG-48 radar along with SQS-501 and SQS-503 sonar.Gardiner and Chumbly, p. 46 =Armament= The Restigouches diverged from the St. Laurents in their weaponry. The Restigouches were equipped with two twin mounts of Vickers /70 calibre Mk 6 dual-purpose guns forward and maintained a single twin mount of 3-inch/50 calibre Mk 22 guns aft used in the preceding class.Calibre denotes the length of the barrel. In this case, 50 calibre means that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter A Mk 69 fire control director was added to control the new guns.Boutiller, p. 323 They were also armed with two Limbo Mk 10 mortars and two single Bofors 40 mm guns. However the 40 mm guns were dropped in the final design. The destroyers were also equipped beginning in 1958 with Mk 43 homing torpedoes in an effort to increase the distance between the ships and their targets. The Mk 43 torpedo had a range of at . They were pitched over the side by a modified depth charge thrower.Milner, p. 225 =Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE)= As part of the 1964 naval program, the Royal Canadian Navy planned to improve the attack capabilities of the Restigouche class. Unable to convert the vessels to helicopter-carrying versions like the St. Laurents due to budget constraints, instead the Restigouches were to receive variable depth sonar (VDS) to improve their sonar range, placed on the stern, and the RUR-5 anti- submarine rocket (ASROC). The destroyers also received a stepped lattice mast. Called the Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE), Terra Nova was the first to undergo conversion, beginning in May 1965. The conversion took ten months to complete, followed by sea trials. The sea trials delayed the conversion of the next ship for four years.Milner, p. 259 By 1969, the budget for naval programs had been cut and only four out of the seven (Terra Nova, Restigouche, Gatineau and Kootenay) would get upgraded to IRE standards and the remaining three (Chaudiere, Columbia, and St. Croix) were placed in reserve.Milner, p. 265 The ASROC launcher replaced the 3 in/50 cal twin mount and one Mk 10 Limbo mortars aft. The ASROC was rocket-propelled Mk 44 torpedo that had a minimum range of and a maximum range of . The Mk 44 torpedo had a weight of , was long and carried a warhead. The torpedo itself had a maximum range of at . The torpedo was acoustically guided. =Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX)= The Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) refit for the four surviving Restigouches was announced in 1978. An effort by Maritime Command to update their existing stock of naval escorts, the DELEX program affected 16 ships in total and came in several different formats depending on the class of ship it was being applied to.Milner, p. 277 On average, the DELEX refit cost $24 million per ship.German, p. 317 For the Restigouches this meant updating their sensor, weapon and communications systems. The class received the new ADLIPS tactical data system, new radar and fire control systems and satellite navigation. They were also fitted with a triple torpedo tube mounting to use the new Mk 46 torpedo.Milner, p. 278 The ships began undergoing their DELEX refits in the early 1980s.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), pp. 251‚Äì255 However, by the time the ships emerged from their refits, they were already obsolete as the Falklands War had changed the way surface battles were fought. Construction and career Gatineau taking part in the naval exercise RIMPAC '72 Gatineau, named for a river in Quebec, was laid down on 30 May 1953 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec. The ship was launched on 3 June 1957.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 252 The ship was towed to Halifax, Nova Scotia by the tugboat Foundation Vigilant and completed there to avoid the freeze-up of the Saint Lawrence River.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 40‚Äì41 Gatineau was commissioned on 17 February 1959 at Halifax with the classification DDE 236. Following workups she joined the Fifth Canadian Escort Squadron. In August 1960, the destroyer escort, along with sister ships , and , took part in the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's death off Lisbon. In March 1965, Terra Nova and Gatineau participated in the search for a Royal Canadian Air Force Canadair CP-107 Argus that had disappeared north of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1966, Canada sent Gatineau and to the independence celebrations of the Bahamas, the only nation to send warships.Tracy, p. 147 In March 1968, Gatineau joined the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), the first Canadian warship to do so. She served for nine months in the role before returning to Canada. In 1969, Gatineau was transferred to the west coast as part of the re-ordering of naval forces following the Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968, where four Restigouche-class vessels were transferred to the west coast, to replace the s in the Second Canadian Escort Squadron.Zimmerman, p. 162 On 9 September 1969, Gatineau began her IRE conversion which took until 14 April 1971 to complete. Upon rejoining the fleet, the ship was assigned to the Second Canadian Destroyer Squadron. On 28 August 1972, Gatineau, and deployed to the South Pacific. During the four-month cruise, the ships made several port calls and took part in three major naval exercises. Gatineau underwent her DELEX refit between September 1981 and 12 November 1982. In 1987, Gatineau transferred to the east coast in exchange for the destroyer as part of the reorganization of the fleet.Gimblett, p. 179 In July 1988, the ship was assigned to STANAVFORLANT for five months. In September 1992, STANAVFORLANT took over the responsibility for patrolling the Adriatic Sea as part of the NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Gatineau had six .50 calibre machine guns, search lights, night vision equipment and a rigid-hulled inflatable boat installed aboard before departing for deployment with STANAVFORLANT as Canada's contribution.Tracy, p. 225 In July 1993, Gatineau escorted three Soviet warships that visited Canada, among them the cruiser . Later that year, Gatineau was deployed off Haiti as part of the force enforcing the United Nations-sanctioned blockade of the island returning to Halifax on 23 November. In 1995, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise Strong Resolve off the coast of Norway, acting as the Canadian flagship. In April 1995, Gatineau was at sea in support of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard who were enforcing the Canadian exclusive economic zone in a fishing dispute with Spain called the Turbot War. The ship was paid off on 1 July 1998. Gatineau was sold in October 2009, along with Terra Nova, for $4,258,529 to Aecon Fabco for scrapping. The ships were towed to Pictou, Nova Scotia in mid-November 2009 for breaking up.

Born near Kinsale, County Cork, O'Regan first played competitive Gaelic games during his studies at the De La Salla College in Waterford. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-three when he first linked up with the Offaly junior team. He made his senior debut for Dublin during the 1925 championship before becoming a dual player with Cork's senior teams the following year. O'Regan immediately became a regular in the inter-county scene and won four All-Ireland medals, four Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals as well as a Munster football medal. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial teams on a number of occasions, O'Regan won several Railway Cup medals as a dual player. At club level he enjoyed a distinguished career with various club teams such as Kinsale, Garda and Courcey Rovers. Throughout his career O'Regan made a combined total of 47 championship appearances for Cork. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1935 championship. In retirement from playing O'Regan became involved in team management and coaching. After serving as trainer with Courcey Rovers and St. Vincent's, he guided the Cork senior hurlers to All- Ireland success in 1966. O'Regan is widely regarded as one of Cork's greatest hurlers. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at centre-back on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century. Playing career =Club= O‚ÄôRegan played his club hurling with his local club in Kinsale; however, he enjoyed little in the way of success. After moving to Dublin he joined the Garda club and won a senior county title in the 1920s. =Inter-county= O‚ÄôRegan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Cork in 1926. That year Cork won the inaugural National Hurling League competition, giving O‚ÄôRegan his first major hurling title. Later that year Cork played Tipperary in the Munster final, but it took three games for the two sides to be separated. Cork won on the third occasion with O‚ÄôRegan collecting his first Munster. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny at a snow-covered Croke Park in October of that year. O‚ÄôRegan‚Äôs side took the lead at half-time and held on to win by 4-6 to 2-0. It was Cork‚Äôs first championship title since 1919 and O‚ÄôRegan‚Äôs first All-Ireland medal. Cork retained their Munster title in 1927, but O‚ÄôRegan did not play any part in the provincial final. He returned to the team for the subsequent All- Ireland final against Dublin. Cork fell behind by 2-3 to 0-1 at half-time; however, they fought back in the second-half. In spite of this ‚Äòthe Dubs‚Äô won the day. In 1928 Cork faced Clare in the Munster final. That game ended in a draw, but in the replay Cork triumphed with O‚ÄôRegan collecting his second Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, but the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6-12 to 1-0 gave Cork the victory and gave O‚ÄôRegan a second All- Ireland medal. In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford gave O‚ÄôRegan his third Munster title in four years. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year‚Äôs game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4-9 to 1-3 giving O‚ÄôRegan his third All-Ireland title. O‚ÄôRegan won a second National League title in 1930. However, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with O‚ÄôRegan collecting a fourth Munster winners‚Äô medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level ‚Äì 1-6 apiece. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, but Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level ‚Äì 2-5 apiece. The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5-8 to 3-4 giving O‚ÄôRegan his fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1932 Cork set out to defend the Munster and All-Ireland titles; however, Clare defeated O‚ÄôRegan‚Äôs side on that occasion. Cork went into decline following that defeat and failed to reach another Munster final until 1939. O‚ÄôRegan retired from inter-county hurling in 1936. =Provincial= O‚ÄôRegan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in the inaugural year of the Railway Cup competition in 1927. Leinster were the victors on that occasion. O‚ÄôRegan remained on the team and helped Munster to capture the next four titles in 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931. He last lined out for Munster in 1933.

It originates from the Bicol Region, where it is known simply as pinangat. Laing is also a type of ginataan (Filipino dishes cooked in coconut milk), and thus may also be referred to as ginataang laing. Laing is eaten paired with white rice or bread. It is also commonly eaten as a side dish to meat. Names Laing is the name of the dish in most parts of the Philippines, but it is more commonly known as pinangat in the Bicol region where it originated. However, the name can be confused with pinangat na isda, which is a different dish made with fish cooked in a slightly sour broth similar to sinigang. The confusion stems from the original meaning of the verb pangat in the languages of Southern Luzon, which simply means to cook fish or meat in a broth of water and salt. Laing is typical of Bicolano cuisine, which is known for their common use of chilis and coconut milk. Laing is also known as ginataang laing, pinangat na laing, pinangat na gabi and ginat-ang gabi , among other names. Description river crabs wrapped in whole taro leaves and cooked in coconut milk Tinumok, a variant of laing that uses a mixture of shrimp and fish flakes with grated coconut The original laing from the Bicol Region does not use shredded taro leaves, but rather a whole taro leaf (natong in Bicolano). This version is the one most commonly referred to as pinangat. The mixture usually consists of cubed pre- cooked pork, shrimp, or fish flakes (or all three) with bagoong alamang (shrimp paste), crushed labuyo chili, garlic, shallots, ginger, and kakang gata (coconut cream). It is wrapped with the leaf and tied with a coconut leaf midrib or twine. It is then steamed in gata (coconut milk) with a knot of tanglad (lemongrass) until the leaf pouches are fork tender and the coconut milk is reduced to a thick sauce. For the laing version served in Manila and elsewhere, it is cooked similarly, but with the leaves shredded. It also usually includes chopped leaf stalks. Laing is usually eaten with white rice, but it can also be eaten sandwiched in bread like pandesal or used as a stuffing for other dishes. It is also commonly eaten as a side dish to meat. The taro leaves to be used for laing must be prepared correctly, as they contain amounts of calcium oxalate crystals (raphides) that can sometimes cause itching and burning sensations in the mouth. They are usually washed and cooked thoroughly to avoid this. Drying can also lessen the amount of crystals. Variants Notable variants of laing include: =Inulukan= Inulukan or inulokan is a variant of laing made from the meat of river crabs (uluk or ulok) wrapped in whole taro leaves and cooked in coconut milk spiced with calamansi, black pepper, and lemongrass. It is a specialty of Camalig, Albay. It is also known as pinangat na ugama or pinangat na talangka, from ugama and talangka, other local terms for river crabs. =Linapay= Linapay also known as tinamuk, is a related dish from Aklan in the Western Visayas. It is made from pounded freshwater shrimp (ueang) mixed with gawud (grated young coconut meat) and wrapped with taro leaves (gutaw) and cooked in coconut milk. =Tinumok= Tinumok, tinomok, or tinulmok is another traditional variant from Bicol which uses whole taro leaves wrapped around a mixture of freshwater shrimp, fish flakes (and sometimes meat), shrimp paste, with minced or grated coconut meat, onions, chilis, lemongrass, garlic, and other spices cooked in coconut milk. It differs primarily in its use of coconut meat.

His career included All-Ireland Championship victories as a player and later as a selector with the Cork senior hurling team. Playing career =Kinsale= Barrett first played for the Kinsale club at adult level in the late 1920s. He claimed his first major silverware with the club in 1930 when Kinsale defeated Tracton by 6-04 to 3-03 to secure the South East Junior Championship. After surrendering the title to Passage the following year, Barrett won a second divisional championship winners' medal in 1933 after a 5-04 to 1-02 victory over Rochestown. He subsequently claimed a County Junior Championship title after lining out in the 5-04 to 0-01 defeat of Skibbereen. Barrett also lined out with divisional side Carrigdhoun in the County Senior Championship. =Cork= Barrett first played for Cork when he was drafted onto the junior team during the 1932 Munster Junior Championship.

Barrett's performances at junior level brought him to the attention of the senior selectors and he was drafted onto the team during the 1934 Munster Championship. He made his championship debut on 10 June 1934 in a 7-05 to 5-06 defeat of Tipperary. After five years as a first team regular, Barrett claimed his first Munster Championship medal after a 4-03 to 3-04 victory over Limerick in the 1939 Munster final. On 3 September 1939, he lined out as midfield partner to team captain Jack Lynch when Cork suffered a 2-07 to 3-03 defeat by Kilkenny in the \\"thunder and Lightning\\" All-Ireland final. Barrett collected his first national silverware when Cork defeated Tipperary by 8-09 to 6-04 to win the 1939-40 National League title. He was selected at left wing-back when Cork surrendered their provincial title to Limerick in the 1940 Munster final. After winning a second successive National League medal after a 4-11 to 2-07 victory over Dublin in the 1941 league final, Barrett lined out in the second All-Ireland final of his career on 28 September 1941 when he again partnered Jack Lynch at midfield against Dublin. He ended the game with an All-Ireland medal after the 5-11 to 0-06 victory. Barrett ended the season by lining out in Cork's 5-04 to 2-05 defeat by Tipperary in the delayed Munster final. He brought the curtain down on his inter-county career following this defeat. =Munster= Barrett had yet to make his championship debut for the Cork senior team when he was selected for the Munster inter-provincial team in advance of the 1934 Railway Cup final. He won his first Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute after Munster's 6-03 to 3-02 defeat of Leinster. After defeats in 1935 and 1936, Barrett claimed his second winners' medal as a non-playing substitute after a 1-09 to 3-01 victory over Leinster in the 1937 Railway Cup final. It was the first of four successive Railway Cup titles for Barrett, with the subsequent victories all coming on the field of play. Coaching career Barrett was added to the selection committee of the Cork senior hurling team in advance of the 1952 Munster Championship. The campaign was a successful one with Cork claiming the title after a 1-11 to 2-06 defeat of Tipperary. Cork subsequently claimed their first All-Ireland Championship in six years after a 2-14 to 0-07 defeat of Dublin in the final. Barrett was retained as a member of the selection committee for the following two seasons, with Cork securing three successive All-Ireland victories after defeats of Galway in 1953 and Wexford in 1954. Administrative roles In retirement from playing Barrett became involved in the administrative affairs of the Gaelic Athletic Association. In 1954 he became vice-chairman of the Cork County Board. He served in that capacity for five years until 1959. That year Barrett was elected chairman of the Munster Council. He served in that post until 1962.

Life She was born Eleanor (or Elinor) Whitney, daughter of James and Sybil (Parry) Whitney of Clifford. Although the main branch of the Whitney family had a castle at Whitney-on-WyeWhitney Castle, Whitney on Wye in Herefordshire, Eleanor was from a related branch of that family who resided in nearby Clifford, Herefordshire. Eleanor seems to have been a relation of Blanche Parry, a companion of Queen Elizabeth I. Blanche gave Eleanor a legacy of ¬£100 in her will in 1589. She married Richard Bull October 14, 1571 at St Mary-le-Bow, London. He was probably the son of the master-shipwright of that name. He held the post of sub-bailiff at Sayes Court and worked for the Clerk of the Green Cloth. He died in 1590.Park Honan, Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.344. After her husband's death, she stayed at their house on Deptford Strand, Deptford, which was in Kent, but is now within London. The house became a form of hotel or \\"rooming house in which meals were served\\". Her normal clientele included supervisors or inspectors at the dockyards, exporters of quality goods, and merchants involved in imports from Russia and the Baltic ports.\\" She died in Deptford and was buried on March 19, 1596. Death of Marlowe Eleanor is known because it was at her house in which Christopher Marlowe was killed by stabbing during a quarrel with Ingram Frizer. Also present were Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. All had spent most of the day at Bull's house, apparently engaged in conversation, eating and drinking. At the inquest it was stated that the quarrel was over the bill (known as \\"the reckoning\\") for the day's events. Leslie Hotson, who first identified the documents relating to the inquest described Bull's house as a \\"tavern\\", leading to accounts of her as a kind of Mistress Quickly of Deptford \\"who is always ready to let a room for some disreputable purpose\\".H.

Archbishop Ye was never recognized by the Holy See, his successor Archbishop James Lin Bingliang was recognized in 1998 only after Archbishop Deng's death in 1995. Thus the rift between the underground church and the Patriotic Church came for the Archdiocese to an end. The present archbishop Joseph Gan Junqiu won papal consent even before the consent of the Chinese authorities.

She first appears in Spawn #122. She reappears in issue #169 and plays a major role in subsequent issues, mainly as Spawn's sidekick. Fictional character biography Carrie Ann began practicing magic by herself when she was four. She took her pseudonym from the Nyx, the Greek Primordial goddess of night. During her first appearance, she helps Al Simmons recover his hellspawn suit, and the two become lovers. Wondering if her friend Thea is suffering in Hell, she asks Spawn to show her and suffers a seizure from the glimpse of Hell. =A Thousand Clowns= While Spawn faces Violator and loses, Nyx is tempted by Mammon, who finds her while looking for Spawn. With the help of Mammon, she steals a part of Spawn's Necroplasmic energy, gaining Hellspawn powers and a Symbiote suit. While in hell, she allies with the Redeemer, who helps her in her journey. She finally finds her friend's soul and releases both the soul and the Redeemer, who faces Spawn when he tries to take his revenge against Nyx. After Spawn defeats the Redeemer, Mammon reminds her that she betrayed Spawn for her own purpose, and he takes her magical powers away as a payment and punishment. =Voodoo Child= After the Armageddon and the White Light phenomena, she manages her way to New Orleans and meets a Voodoo Mambo called Suzanne Lef√®vre, who believes that the angel that saved the world is a Loa. Nyx visits a faux Houngan who possessed Zera's head, in an attempt to retrieve her lost magick. As soon as her severed head is seen, Zera possesses Nyx's body and kills the Houngan. As Spawn is summoned by Mambo Lef√®vre, he defends against Zera, refusing to actually harm Nyx. During the battle, Spawn states that he has forgiven Nyx for her actions. Mambo Lef√®vre takes Zera's head and throws it to Mammon's beasts, which rids Nyx of the possession. After the battle, Mammon returns Nyx's magick to her, and Nyx learns of Al Simmons' worst crime. =A Tale of Three Brothers= Nyx played a crucial role in the arc \\"A Tale of Three Brothers\\" when Spawn himself was taken captive by the sin eater demons who fed on the past faults of the victim. Using her magick - which has become more potent, surprising even her - she was able to overcome the several sin eaters to release Spawn and Richard Simmons, Al Simmons' brother. She then sets up a barrier preventing Ab and Zab from leaving the house where the conflict occurred. Her powers also became instrumental in finding Al Simmons' parents who were trapped in a curse set up by Mammon preventing them from leaving their house and backyard, while making them invisible to the rest of the world. =Monster in the Bubble= In the arc \\"Monster in a Bubble\\" Nyx assisted in combating a killer who preyed on the winners of a manga contest attacking Erskine's psychic emanations.Her powers also allowed Spawn/Al Simmons to gain the assistance of his brother Marc Simmons who was investigating the murders. =Bad Blood= When in a new effort to control Spawn, Mammon restores his individuality to the K7 Leetha necroplasm suit. This reveals that as a part of his centuries-long plan to create the perfect Hellspawn, he had forged an alliance with the suit. The suit, necessitating a temporary host, and acting out of spite, possesses Nyx, this time taking total control over the young woman and cutting her off from her nature-based magic. =The End= In issue 184, Nyx learns a spell that Cyan had obtained from the future. A power that she supposedly gains in the future. With this spell she seals away both Morana and Mammon, leaving them in web-like cocoons in limbo. She along with Cyan and Wanda return to Earth. =Return= Nyx later returns in the recent Spawn Issues. She was seen in hiding from the forces of heaven and hell.She was later killed in 300. Powers and abilities Nyx is a Wiccan, depicted by the pentagram she always wear around her neck. She uses a vast magic spells repertory. Although her magic ability is powerful, her spells and the way she uses them are mainly defensive. She is capable of healing, mind controlling, removing illusions and projecting magical force fields. At attacking, she only wields a knife. After stealing Spawn's energy, she gained access to a symbiote suit similar to a Hellspawn, with increased reflexes, strength and magical ability; also gave her the signature chains of a Hellspawn. However this does not make her a true Hellspawn due to the absence of a necroplasmic body. Nyx also has a sideckick raven named Nightbird. Although it doesn't provide any offensive support, it still helps in finding places and people. Spawn has the ability to see the world through other \\"dark natured\\" animals like rats, bugs, bats and crows, finding Nightbird quite useful when finding Ab and Zab in the Tale of three brothers arc. During the Suicide Bombers arc of Bomb Queen, whose canonicity is in question, Nyx is described as having retained a thread from the K7 Leetha necroplasmic suit of Spawn, and able to tap into its power to project her soul in the infernal dimension of Desaraak, granting herself part of the She-Spawn powers.

The battle took place on 14-15 November 1494. Fern√°ndez de Lugo had suffered defeat by Guanche forces at the First Battle of Acentejo. The Battle of Aguere was a Castilian victory; whereas in the First Battle of Acentejo the Guanches had been favored by their knowledge of the mountainous terrain, in this engagement, the native forces found themselves at a disadvantage on the plain of Aguere. The Battle of Aguere was later followed by the decisive Second Battle of Acentejo more than a month later, which resulted in the complete Castilian conquest of Tenerife. Preparations Map of Guanche menceyatos or kingdoms at the time of the Castilian conquest After the First Battle of Acentejo, Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo returned to Gran Canaria, practically without troops, as the Castilian forces had suffered between 1,000 and 2,000 casualties at the First Battle of Acentejo. At Gran Canaria, Fern√°ndez de Lugo established contact with the merchants Francisco de Palomar, Nicol√°s de Angelote, Guillermo del Blanco, and Mateo Vi√±a in order to seek financial support for his planned conquest of Tenerife. The group enlisted the aid of Juan Alfonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, who contributed 600 soldiers and 30 horsemen, veterans of the conquest of Granada.Buenaventura Bonnet, La Batalla de La Laguna y la muerte de Tinguaro. Estudio Hermen√©utica Hist√≥rica. Comisi√≥n provincial de Monumentos Hist√≥ricos de Canarias, Tenerife ,1916. (B√©thencourt Alfonso cites, however, 670 foot soldiers and 80 horsemenBethencourt Alfonso, J: Historia del Pueblo Guanche II Lemus editor, La Laguna, 1997). Five hundred Castilian soldiers were added to this force, a group that included survivors of the First Battle of Acentejo and a small contingent sent by Do√±a In√©s Peraza, a noblewoman of Lanzarote. Fern√°ndez de Lugo also had the support of Ferdinand and Isabella, who had given him ten more months to complete his conquest of the Canaries. During this time of regrouping, he also captured many slaves in Gran Canaria. The Castilian force embarked from Gran Canaria on 6 November in caravels and about a dozen smaller ships, and headed towards the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The total force numbered about 1,200 men, with a small company of knights and some artillery ‚Äìa force comparable in size to that which was defeated at Acentejo, but much more experienced and better trained and prepared. The Castilian advance Statue of Bencomo at Candelaria, Tenerife. The expedition, which Lugo had also funded with the sale of all of his properties, had landed at Santa Cruz, where he built two towers on the spot where he had constructed his first fort before his prior defeat. After fortifying Santa Cruz, the Castilian marched on 13‚Äì14 November towards La Cuesta, a strategic high point to which the forces ascended to San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna from the coast.Viera y Clavijo, Noticias de la Historia General de las Islas Canarias, tomos del I al IV The Castilians maintained Santa Cruz as their base of operations, with their fleet waiting there in case of a defeat. In terms of strategy, the tableland of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna was of vital importance to the conquest of the island. The path to reach the tableland from the coast, the path of La Cuesta, in those days was covered by thick vegetation that included Canarian pine, broom, beech, heather, palm trees, dragos, savin, and other species, and so the accession up the hill was a dangerous undertaking.Primera y Segunda Invasi√≥n de Lugo Fern√°ndez de Lugo garrisoned Santa Cruz to prevent a surprise attack. Meanwhile, the Guanches, alerted by inhabitants on the coast, gathered their forces. The mencey (the native term for a king) Bencomo sent emissaries to the other menceys, and gathered about 2,000 warriors at La Cuesta before the Castilians had reached that point. Bencomo sent two spies to observe the strength and size of the Castilian forces. However, the spies were discovered by the Castilians, and Bencomo could not benefit from any intelligence regarding the enemy forces. This gave the Castilians an early advantage, although they suffered from the disadvantage of advancing up a difficult height surrounded by Guanche warriors. However, having garrisoned Santa Cruz, Fern√°ndez de Lugo decided to take a risk in advancing this way, while Bencomo did not have sufficient forces to cover a possible retreat or defeat. Fern√°ndez de Lugo was able to determine the movements of the Guanche forces thanks to their campfires, and ordered the advance of his 70 horsemen and 1,000 soldiers up La Cuesta under the cover of darkness, gaining the highest point of La Cuesta without being seen by the enemy. The battle The next day the Guanche forces were surprised that the Castilians had ascended La Cuesta and were dominating the rising grounds in the midst of the plain of Aguere. The laurisilva-covered area called Aguere by the natives included Las Mercedes, parts of present-day San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, Ortigal, and other bordering regions. Bencomo reorganized his forces and with 5,000 men rushed to what are now the outskirts of San Crist√≥bal, intending to cut off the Castilians. However, before the Guanche forces could do this, Fern√°ndez de Lugo's army had already appeared before them. The Guanche center was commanded by Bencomo, the right flank by Acaymo, mencey of Tacoronte; and the left flank by Tinguaro. The Castilian army extended from the present-day hermitage of Gracia, which was selected by Fern√°ndez de Lugo due to its height, dominating the plain, to the positions on the field taken by Bencomo's contingent of troops. Based on this information, Buenaventura Bonnet believes that the battle took place in the area now known as Barrio del Timple, Barrio Nuevo or Vi√±a Nava, and the Urbanizaci√≥n de la Verdellada. Fern√°ndez de Lugo's forces included natives from the other Canary Islands, including the Christianized Guanche prince of Gran Canaria, Fernando Guanarteme; Fernando's brother Maninidra; Gomerans, Palmeros, and Guanches from the Christianized menceyato or kingdom of G√º√≠mar. The battle began with an assault by the Guanche troops, who were armed with traditional weapons like the banote or banot (a lance whose point was hardened by fire). They had no shields or armor, and wore the tamarco, a sheep or goat skin used for protection and warmth. The Guanche forces also hurled rocks. The Castilian vanguard consisted of harquebusiers and crossbowmen who mowed the attacking Guanche ranks with their projectiles. The Castilian pikemen and horsemen then attacked the Guanches who were fleeing the crossbow and harquebus fire. This first engagement lasted several hours, and consisted of continual frontal attacks by Bencomo's forces. The flat terrain of the plain of Aguere benefited the Castilians, and Bencomo's troops began to waver, suffering from a disorderly retreat, especially when the Guanche allies of the Castilians under Fernando de Guanarteme, arriving from Santa Cruz, began to arrive on the field of battle. The Castilian cavalry wreaked terrible losses on the Guanche forces. Miguel de Unamuno compared Fern√°ndez de Lugo's cavalry charge with the military actions of Hern√°n Cort√©s in Mexico: \\"And then into the fray entered the horse, that monster that always put so much fear into the poor Indians... The result of those battles was always inevitable... Bencomo and his troops had to abandon the field of La Laguna.\\"Miguel de Unamuno, La Laguna de Tenerife, (Las Palmas, agosto de 1909) Retreat of Guanche forces and Tinguaro's death Bencomo, Acaymo, and Tinguaro were all badly injured. They ordered their forces to retreat towards Tacoronte. The Castilians attacked again, preventing an orderly Guanche retreat. At the end of the day, Bencomo ordered a retreat towards the peak of San Roque, a move that would prevent cavalry attacks and where his men could defend themselves more effectively. Tinguaro, injured in battle, continued to defend himself against seven horsemen as he retreated up the peak of San Roque. However, at the height of San Roque, a Castilian soldier named Mart√≠n Buend√≠a was waiting for him on a cliff. Buend√≠a had arrived on the field of battle separately from the rest of the Castilian troops, and had walked from Santa Cruz via the ravines of Santos and Drago. Tinguaro, badly hurt and weakened by the loss of blood, spoke to Buend√≠a in the Guanche language, informing the Castilian of his status as a prince. Buend√≠a, ignoring Tinguaro's entreaty, ran the Guanche through with a pike.Espinosa,A. Historia de Nuestra Se√±ora de Candelaria, Goya ediciones, Tenerife. However, some historians contradict this account. Francisco P. De Luka writes, in the magazine Awa√±ac (no. 1, 2004, pp. 124‚Äì125), that on 14 November 1494, Bencomo, not Tinguaro, was killed by Buend√≠a. Francisco P. De Luka writes that on the slopes of San Roque in Laguna, Bencomo, armed with a lance, fought against ten Castilian soldiers, and that one Pedro Mart√≠n Buend√≠a mortally wounded Bencomo with a pike. Tinguaro was injured in the fight at San Roque as well, but died two days later at Taoro. As it happened, the body of the fallen Guanche prince was so badly disfigured that when the Castilians translated it to Santa Cruz and made inquiries amongst the Guanche prisoners, the Guanches were unable to determine whether the body was that of Tinguaro or Bencomo. In any case, Fern√°ndez de Lugo had the body decapitated. The head of the Guanche prince was placed on a pike and Fern√°ndez de Lugo ordered it to be taken to the enemy camp. The Guanches of Acentejo received the head to honor it in a funeral ceremony; a retinue, which included Tinguaro's wife Guajara, traveled to the kingdom of Taoro for this ceremony. In one last and final stand, the reduced Guanche forces, led by an injured Bencomo, tried to reach the heights of La Laguna, but they were cut to pieces by the Castilian cavalry. The cavalry was followed by the Castilian pikemen and rodeleros (\\"shield bearers\\"), who were equipped with steel shields or bucklers known as rodela and swords (usually of the side-sword type). One of these rodeleros killed Bencomo, and hundreds of Guanche warriors also fell at this time. The Guanche survivors headed towards Taoro, and the next day elected Bencomo's son Bentor as their new king. Some historians doubt that the death of Bencomo occurred at this time, but most historians base the fact that he died at this time on the testimony of witnesses such as Margarita Guanarteme, who declared in 1526 that in the battle, \\"they killed the Great King who was called King Venitomo [sic] of Taoro...\\"Revista de Historia 14 (82‚Äì83) 1948 P√°gs. 267‚Äì273 Universidad de La Laguna, La Laguna In terms of Guanche casualties, Mar√≠n y Cubas cites 2,600, while Viana has a lower figure: 1,700 casualties. Figures on Castilian casualties are held as being between 30 and 55 dead and dozens of injured. Guanche casualties are said to have been so high that it caused an epidemic, which is also said to have forced Fern√°ndez de Lugo to move towards Acentejo.  After the battle  By the end of the year, Fern√°ndez de Lugo would penetrate the north of the island at Taoro, where some 6,000 Guanches waiting for him at Acentejo. Fern√°ndez de Lugo would decisively defeat these forces at the Second Battle of Acentejo. Bentor would commit suicide, throwing himself off the cliff of Tigaiga.

Among her subjects have been the issues of women in medicine, relationships between doctors and patients, and children and literacy. She is the author of both fiction and nonfiction novels, stories, essays, and journalism. Klass is Professor of Journalism and Pediatrics at New York University, and Medical Director of Reach Out and Read, a national childhood literacy program that works through doctors and nurses to encourage parents to read aloud to young children, and to give them the books they need to do it. She is a member of the National Advisory Council of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and has been nominated by the President of the United States to the Advisory Board of the National Institute For Literacy. Early life and career Klass was born in Trinidad, where her father, Morton Klass, was doing anthropological field work. She grew up in New York City and Leonia, New Jersey.Neuhaus, Cable. \\"A Touch of Klass Is All It Takes to Be a Successful Author, Mom and Med Student at the Same Time\\", People (magazine), November 18, 1985. Accessed May 16, 2016. \\"Klass' childhood in Leonia, N.J. prepared her well for her dual career.\\" Her father was an anthropology professor at Barnard College, and her mother a novelist and professor of English at the City University of New York. Klass received her A.B. in Biology from Harvard University in 1979. Klass went on to earn her M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1986, and completed her residency in pediatrics at Children's Hospital, Boston, and her fellowship in pediatric infectious diseases at Boston City Hospital. Writing career During her years at Harvard Medical School, Klass began to chronicle her medical training. In 1984, as a third-year medical student, she wrote a series of columns, published in the New York Times in the series of ‚ÄúHers Columns,‚Äù describing, among other things, the uncertainty of drawing blood for the very first time, the peculiar locutions of hospital jargon, and the emotional subtext of crying in the hospital. She also wrote, in the New York Times Magazine, about the experience of having a baby while in medical school. She went on to write many articles and columns about her training, originally published in Discover Magazine, American Health, Massachusetts Medicine, and other magazines, and later collected in two books about medical training, A Not Entirely Benign Procedure: Four Years as a Medical Student, and Baby Doctor: A Pediatrician's Training. In addition to her accounts of medical training, her books include a memoir in two voices, Every Mother is a Daughter: the Neverending Quest for Success, Inner Peace, and a Really Clean Kitchen, coauthored with her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass; and Quirky Kids: Understanding and Helping Your Child Who Doesn't Fit In, coauthored with Eileen Costello, MD.

Her journalism has appeared in The New York Times Science Section, The New England Journal of Medicine, The Washington Post, Vogue, Gourmet, and many other magazines and newspapers. She writes a regular column in Knitters Magazine, and her knitting essays have been collected in the book Two Sweaters for My Father. Charity work Klass has combined her interest in medicine and literacy to help promote the importance of books to children, through her work with Reach Out and Read. She became involved with Reach Out and Read when it was a single program in a single hospital, and, through her leadership at the National Center, has helped it grow into a national program, now in more than 4,500 locations in all 50 states, distributing more than 6 million books every year to more than 3.8 million children. Klass has trained doctors and nurses around the United States and elsewhere, including Portugal and the Philippines, in strategies to incorporate books and literacy guidance into pediatric primary care.

Among the Bakkarwal of Jammu and Kashmir, aj·πõƒ´ normally refers to a hired shepherd: a member of the community who does not have a big enough herd to subsist on and so has to hire out his labour to bigger herd owners. The term has a different meaning in Swat, Pakistan. At the start of the 20th century, Grierson reported based on second-hand data that the Ajars there are a tribe closely related to the Gujjars, and that they speak a dialect called Aj·πõƒ´, which apart from minor variations, is \\"practically the same\\" as the one spoken by the Gujjars. This picture is contradicted by Barth, who conducted fieldwork in Swat in the 1950s. Noting the belief current among the Pathan majority that the Gujjars and Ajars are distinct ethnic subdivisions, he asserts that these two groups are only differentiated by their pattern of nomadism ‚Äì the Gujars practising transhumance and the Ajars being fully nomadic ‚Äì and that individual Gujjars can switch between the two.

The position works closely with a chief financial officer (CFO) or treasurer. A director of development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non- profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/director of development. A grants manager assists the CFO with grant reports and grant-related accounting. A development director is usually remunerated for his or her work, and in best practices for nonprofit organizations, development directors earn salaries. Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), but the practice of commission-based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.http://www.grantprofessionals.org/ethics The role of a development director is to develop and implement a strategic plan to raise vital funds for their organization in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. The development director's primary responsibility, however, is to oversee fundraising, rather than to actually raise money. This person may write grants, research foundations and corporations, and oversee or implement other fundraising strategies, but she or he works mostly behind the scenes, establishing a structure for effective fundraising. The development director may also be responsible for additional financial responsibilities, including developing business plans or strategic plans in collaboration with the board for the future of the organization. The development director is usually accountable to the executive director, chief operating officer, or CFO. The board often offers suggestions and ideas about how to increase the fundraising, including contacts, and the development director chooses how to implement these ideas to maximize inflow while keeping outflow at a minimum and keeping donors happy. A strong board often has a development/fundraising committee, makes personal donations to the non-profit, and assists with annual campaigns. The development director has an outreach role in the organization and often fulfills a public affairs role in addition to office-based work. Development directors motivate and satisfy donors, board members, staff and even the press. Many directors of development assist with communications such a non-profits annual report, development and communications section of website, newsletters, and donor databases. The structure of a development department varies greatly. A director of development may or may not have staff reporting to him or her, depending on the size of the organization. Some large non-profits have a development team including a grant writer, donor database specialist, grants manager, special events coordinator, communications staff, and planning giving staff. In some cases, an executive director serves as the lead grant writer of an organization. Some non-profits hire development staff on a part-time or consultant basis, instead of full-time. Median pay for development directors in the U.S. is around $62,000 annually. Total cash compensation ranges from $40,000 to $100,000; the final number includes potential for approximately $10,000 each from bonus and profit sharing in exceptional cases. While geography and years of experience impact pay for this group, the organization is the most influential factor. Earnings for this group are mostly affected by the particular organization, followed by the particular city and tenure. As the title suggests, the development director is concerned with the growth of the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and maximize the organization's profitability and profile.

Born of an old Yorkshire family on his father's side, he was related to a family of distinguished Quakers on his mother's side: his grandfather was Samuel Tuke, and James Hack Tuke and Daniel Hack Tuke were uncles. Henry Scott Tuke was a cousin. In 1870, aged 18, Meynell became a convert to Roman Catholicism. He married the writer Alice Thompson in 1877. The pair's first effort at periodical publishing was The Pen, a short-lived critical monthly review. In 1881 he accepted Cardinal Manning's invitation to edit the Catholic Weekly Register, and continued to do so until 1899. Meynell later founded and edited (1883‚Äì94) the magazine Merry England, in which he discovered and sponsored the poet Francis Thompson. In 1887 Wilfred was given the Westminster Press by Cardinal Manning. Wilfred was an urgent Catholic propagandist, and he promptly installed two new printing presses. At his suggestion the Cardinal baptized them. One of the presses was named 'The Cardinal', the other 'Lady Butler' after his sister-in-law, also a Roman Catholic, at that time famed as a painter. A main function of this press was the printing of The Weekly Register, founded in 1849 and also given to Wilfrid to own and edit.The Imprint, number one, reprinted for the members of the Wynkyn De Worde Society, The Curwen Press, 1972 Meynell wrote biographies of Manning, John Henry Newman and Pope Leo XIII. He contributed to a wide range of periodicals including the Contemporary Review, The Art Journal, The Magazine of Art, Athenaeum, the Academy, the Saturday Review, the Pall Mall Budget, Illustrated London News, the Daily Chronicle and The Nineteenth Century.Men and women of the time, 15th ed., 1899.

Wilfrid and Alice Meynell had eight children, including the writer Viola Meynell, and the founder of The Nonesuch Press, Francis Meynell. After his wife's death in 1922, Meynell lived out the last 25 years of his life mainly at Humphrey's Homestead, Greatham, near Pulborough in West Sussex. He was appointed CBE in the 1943 Birthday Honours for services to literature.'Birthday Honours List', The Times, 2 June 1943, p.4.

It began its national distribution through the PBS system in 1981, and more recently did a syndication run on the GoodLife TV Network. Cookin' Cheap contrasted itself with contemporary cooking shows of its time by not attempting to hide the tedious preparation work that goes into cooking a recipe, and by using common ingredients purchased at local supermarkets in Roanoke, Virginia, where the show was produced. Johnson stated that the idea for the show was born from the frustration he suffered when trying to recreate the recipes of Julia Child, lacking ingredients that are unavailable in a small southern town.  Laban Johnson's illness and death  Laban Johnson suffered from complications of congestive heart failure and diabetes in his later years.

Adverse effects Adverse events observed during clinical trials included constipation, diarrhea, drug rash, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  Mechanism of action Like other H2 receptor antagonists, lafutidine acts by preventing the secretion of gastric acid. It also activates calcitonin gene-related peptide, resulting in the stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) and regulation of gastric mucosal blood flow, increases somatostatin levels also resulting in less gastric acid secretion, causes the stomach lining to generate more mucin, inhibits neutrophil activation thus preventing injury from inflammation, and blocks the attachment of Helicobacter pylori to gastric cells.

It is the seventeenth book in the Famous Five series. Story Siblings Julian, Dick and Anne are at home with their cousin George and her dog, Timmy. The children are suffering coughs, which results in them being sent via a hired car to a farm named Magga Glen in the Welsh mountains to recover. The Five have nearly reached their destination when their driver takes a wrong turn, leading them to a building called Old Towers atop a desolate hill. They intend to ask for directions but are deterred by locked gates and a fierce guard dog. While exiting, the car inexplicably feels heavier, as if the brake is on. Upon reaching Magga Glen, they are greeted and fed by the owner, Glenys Jones. The next morning, the Five meet Mrs Jones's brusque son, Morgan, who is powerfully built. Although he says little, Morgan has a stentorian voice that he uses to call his seven dogs. When the Five go for a walk, Timmy gets into an altercation with three of the farm dogs and is bitten by one of them. Upset, George promptly resolves to leave the next day. Julian and Dick climb the hills and find the farm's guest chalet. They also encounter the shepherd's young daughter, Aily, with her dog, Dave, and her pet lamb, Fany. George is dissuaded from leaving when the children opt to spend the rest of their holiday in the chalet. They enjoy their first day there, but at night strange rumbling sounds, vibrations and a shimmering light emanate from the hillside. The next day, while out skiing, Julian and George see a woman's face in a window at Old Towers, but the building's caretaker curtly declares that he is the only resident. Aily befriends the Five and shows them a note, thrown from a window of Old Towers by the elderly owner, Mrs Thomas. The note states: \\"I want help. I am a prisoner here in my own house, while terrible things go on. They have killed my son. Help me, help me! Bronwen Thomas.\\" Julian and Dick show the note to Morgan, who takes it from them and orders them not to interfere. His attitude causes the children to suspect he is a villain. Aily takes the Five to a pothole with a tunnel leading to Old Towers. They locate Mrs Thomas, who tells them some evil men murdered her son, Llewellyn, and are exploiting a rare metal beneath the hill in order to make bombs. Back underground, the children spot Morgan and the shepherd and observe the subterranean mining operation. All of them are caught by the villains, who are led by Llewellyn Thomas. Morgan breaks free and calls his dogs, who come to the rescue. Back at the farm, Julian telephones the police. Morgan later returns with the shepherd and says the villains have been jailed. The group then celebrates Morgan's birthday.

Bird has been teaching for over 40 years on the secondary, collegiate home-school levels, at high schools in Alaska and Minnesota and at Kenai Peninsula College. He has been a radio broadcaster for KSRM radio in Kenai for Alaska Baseball League, high school hockey games and radio talk shows. Education Bird earned his B.S. degree from Bemidji State University in Minnesota, where he majored in Social Studies. He earned his Master's degree in history from Minnesota State University, Mankato in 1992. Political career Bird ran as a Republican in the 1990 Alaska primary against incumbent Ted Stevens, earning 34,000 votes to Stevens' 81,000. Bird's notoriety stemmed from organizing and leading the first two events of the Alaska Rescue Project in 1989, the largest civil-disobedience event in the state's history. He served as president of Alaska Right to Life from 1995‚Äì97, was a delegate to the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego as a Pat Buchanan supporter and the Reform Party in Long Beach, California in 2000, also as a Buchanan delegate. Bird joined the Alaskan Independence Party in 2004 and was a delegate to the Constitution Party's national convention as a supporter of Michael Peroutka. In 2008, the Alaskan Independence Party nominated Bird as their candidate for the United States Senate. Bird's opponents included Ted Stevens. On October 29, 2008, Bird was endorsed by former Republican U.S. presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. The November 4, 2008, general election featured five candidates for the U.S. Senate for Alaska: Mark Begich (Democrat), Bob Bird (Alaskan Independence), Ted Gianoutsos (Unaffiliated), Dave Haase (Libertarian), and Ted Stevens (Republican). The outcome was not resolved for two weeks until absentee, questioned and early voting results were tabulated. Begich defeated Stevens by 3,724 votes (150,728 to 147,004). Because Bird took 13,197 votes (4.15%), an article in The Washington Post' by Chris Cillizza and Paul Kane suggested that Bird \\"may end up being the most important third-party candidate in the 2008 race\\"Clinton, Hutchison and Feinstein Could Set Off Scrambles, washingtonpost.com; accessed May 14, 2017. Since the election Bird has been promoting nullification. His arguments can be viewed here and here. He references the Citizens Rule Book, Bird was instrumental in garnering statewide support in 2013 for HB 69, a nullification bill aimed at striking down any future federal gun control laws. Bird appeared on television, radio, and print columns throughout the state, as well as organizing large rallies that included a live presentation from Dr. Thomas Woods, explaining nullification's history. The bill passed, after watered-down modifications, and was signed into law by Governor Sean Parnell. Bird retired after forty-one years of secondary school instruction in 2015, and immediately signed a contract with Kenai Peninsula College as an adjunct faculty member. He debated Dr. Forrest Nabors of the University of Alaska/Anchorage on November 20, 2015, at the Loussac Library in Anchorage on the topic of \\"Lincoln's Legacy: Hero or Tyrant?\\", taking the libertarian position of Lincoln being a usurper of the Constitution.

The band was formed to back Oberst on his 2008 solo album but soon evolved into a band of its own with all members singing and providing songs for 2009's Outer South. History In November 2007, it was reported that Oberst would work on a solo record with Jake Bellows, and that he would form a band with M. Ward and perform two shows in late December 2007 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Contrary to this speculation, the shows were not played with M. Ward, but rather with Nik Freitas and Jason Boesel. (Oberst and M. Ward would, however, later form the group Monsters of Folk, which also includes Mike Mogis of Bright Eyes and Jim James of My Morning Jacket.) The band played 20 new songs and it was announced that these songs were not meant for Oberst's main project, Bright Eyes. In early 2008, Oberst and his band traveled to Tepoztl√°n, Morelos, Mexico and spent two months living and recording their debut album there. Before leaving the country, the band played a show in Mexico City. Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band played at the 2008 Reading and Leeds Festivals. In addition, they also performed at Connect Festival in Scotland and the Electric Picnic in Ireland in August 2008, the Austin City Limits festival in September and also at the Great Escape Festival in Sydney, Australia in early October 2008. The debut album, titled Conor Oberst, was released in the UK on Wichita on 5 August 2008 and 6 August 2008 on Merge Records in the U.S, billed as a solo album by Oberst. In October 2008 the band released the Gentlemen's Pact EP (again, billed as a solo effort from Oberst), which was available in limited quantities and sold only at shows. Conor Oberst & the Mystic Valley Band at Terminal 5 in New York City. November 8, 2008 On November 11, 2008, Conor Oberst & the Mystic Valley Band appeared on the Late Night Show with Conan O'Brien and performed a then-unreleased song, \\"Nikorette\\", which would later appear on their second album. Upon completing their touring schedule in late November 2008, the Mystic Valley Band spent time at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas. There they recorded more than a dozen new songs, many of which had become staples of their live set earlier in the year. On February 19, 2009, it was officially announced that the band's second album, entitled Outer South, would be released on May 5 on Merge Records. A number of the songs that appear on the album are written and sung by band members other than Conor Oberst. The band began their 2009 tour in Omaha on April 9 and toured through July 2009, with scheduled performances including stops at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. During their last several shows in southern California, Oberst was quoted to have called the tour \\"The Nail in the Coffin Tour\\". The band played what was presumed to be their final show on August 29, 2009; however on July 23, 2010, the band played with Rage Against the Machine at the latter's first US show in two years at the Hollywood Palladium. The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the SB1070 immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson projected that the concert had raised $300,000. In April 2010 it was announced that the Mystic Valley Band would be featured on the John Prine tribute album, Broken Hearts And Dirty Windows: Songs Of John Prine, which was released June 22 on Oh Boy Records. Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band played shows at the Slowdown in Omaha, NE, on July, 31 and August, 1 of 2013. Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band will reunite for a single show on December 31, 2017.

The resulting score is used to determine which leads a receiving function (e.g. sales, partners, teleprospecting) will engage, in order of priority. Lead scoring models incorporate both explicit and implicit data. Explicit data is provided by or about the prospect, for example - company size, industry segment, job title or geographic location. Implicit scores are derived from monitoring prospect behavior; examples of these include Web-site visits, whitepaper downloads or e-mail opens and clicks.DM News, ‚ÄúLead Scoring by the Numbers‚Äù Additionally, social scores analyze a person's presence and activities on social networks. Lead Scoring allows a business to customize a prospect's experience based on his or her buying stage and interest level and greatly improves the quality and \\"readiness\\" of leads that are delivered to sales organizations for followup. Key Benefits When a lead scoring model is effective, the key benefits are: * Increased sales efficiency and effectiveness: Lead scoring focuses sales attention on leads that the organization deems most valuable, ensuring that leads that are unqualified or have low perceived value are not sent to sales for engagement. * Increased marketing effectiveness: A lead scoring model quantifies for marketers what types of leads or lead characteristics matter most, which helps marketing more effectively target its inbound and outbound programs and deliver more high- quality leads to sales. * Tighter marketing and sales alignment: Lead scoring helps strengthen the relationship between marketing and sales by establishing a common language with which marketing and sales leaders can discuss the quality and quantity of leads generated. * Increase in Revenue: Lead scoring also ensures that sales goes first for leads that are qualified by their scores. The probability of a lead with higher scores closing is higher than one with a lower score. This indirectly contributes to a growth in revenue as well.  Lead Scoring Methodologies  Various lead scoring methodologies are employed: * Lamb or Spam: most often employed by small businesses who do not have a clear ideal customer profile (ICP), the lamb or spam model consists of filtering out low-quality leads and surfacing high-potential leads. Low- quality leads are identified by online businesses by personal email address domains (gmail, hotmail, yahoo) or temporary email generators used to send email spam or sign up anonymously. High-quality leads are identified by their corporate email domains as well as firmographic data points such as job title and company size. * Rule-Based: these lead scoring models assign point values to a lead's firmographic & behavioral attributes. Point thresholds are set for a lead to be considered a good or bad fit. There are rule based scoring solutions built into larger marketing automation platforms, as well as add-ons which act as complements to CRM's such as lead scoring solutions for Salesforce CRM. * Predictive Lead Scoring: predictive lead scoring models use machine learning to generate a predictive model based on historical customer data augmented by third party data sources. The approach is to analyze past lead behavior, or past interactions between a company and leads, and find positive correlations of such data to a positive business outcome (for instance, a closed deal). Businesses iterate on existing methodologies and change methodologies in an effort to better prioritize sales engagement. As businesses grow in headcount & the number of products they sell, predictive lead scoring methodologies are generally favored for their ability to ingest new customer data routinely and evolve its predictions.  Predictive Lead Scoring  With machine learning, lead scoring models have evolved to include components of predictive analytics, generating Predictive Lead Scoring models. Predictive Lead Scoring leverage first party data - such as internal marketing, sales & product data - as well as third party data - such as data enrichment & intent data - in order to build a machine learning model of the ideal customer profile. Predictive Lead Scoring models can also be used to identify, qualify & engage product-qualified leads based identifying statistically differentiating elements in historical user behavior which best predicts whether a user will spend above a certain threshold. Predictive Lead Scoring is particularly beneficial for SaaS businesses, which have a high Customer lifetime value & a plethora of customer data. Predictive lead scoring models enable businesses to identify high-value prospects early in the buyer journey, creating a FastLane experience for prospects predicted to be a good firmographic & behavioral fit. The success of Predictive Lead Scoring models is measured by their ability to identify a subset of prospective buyers who will account for a significant portion of sales opportunities. This is expressed in the following way: X% of leads represent Y% of conversions Optimal performance of a predictive lead scoring model sees X approaching 0, Y approaching 100 & conversions defined as a bottom-of-funnel metric such as opportunity created or opportunity won.

Background  Peter is the younger of the two sons of actress Loretta Young (1913-2000)Peter Lewis' tribute to his late mother is accessible here and writer-producer Tom Lewis (d. 1988),Primarily as a writer-producer of \\"The Loretta Young Show\\". and accordingly spent much of his childhood in Hollywood. His older brother Christopher Lewis (b. 1944) is a writer and producer of films primarily for television. The Lewis brothers are nephews of Young's sisters, actresses Polly Ann Young and Sally Blane. They are also half-brothers of Judy Lewis (d.2011), daughter of Loretta Young and Clark Gable. Musician David Lindley is their cousin.David Lindley's father Jack Lindley was a sibling (one brother, two sisters) of Peter Lewis' mother Loretta Young. See Interview with Peter Lewis by Jud Cost, 1995; www.sundazed.com. As a youth, Lewis attended military school; after a stint in the Air Force, he became a commercial pilot, initially working for Shell Oil.Matthew Greenwald, [ Peter Lewis Biography]; www.allmusic.com. As for his musical career, Lewis cites Tim Hardin and Fred Neil as important influences, and credits Linda McCartney (n√©e Eastman) with introducing him to their music., October, 2001. His first band was The Cornells. Lewis now lives in the Santa Ynez Valley, north of Santa Barbara, California, with his wife and two children.  Moby Grape: Lewis Sensitivity to Mosley and Spence Challenges  Beyond his work as a musician, Lewis has been noted for his efforts in assisting fellow Moby Grape bandmates Bob Mosley and Skip Spence (d. 1999) in battling the challenges of schizophrenia.Images of Peter Lewis, Bob Mosley and Skip Spence playing music together in later years are accessible here. (Below the gallery) Lewis has a personal sensitivity to psychiatric challenges. At age 11, while his parents were embroiled in an acrimonious divorce and custody dispute, he suffered a nervous breakdown in New York City and was involuntarily hospitalized for a period.Interview with Peter Lewis by Jud Cost, 1995; www.sundazed.com. As of 1969, he recalls, \\"I was under the care of a psychiatrist, taking all this Librium so I could stay with the band.\\"Interview with Peter Lewis by Jud Cost, 1995; www.sundazed.com. Mosley credits Lewis with helping him end approximately five years of homelessness in the 1990s. Mosley describes the circumstances as follows: \\"In 1996, Peter Lewis picked me up along the side of a San Diego freeway where I was living, to tell me a ruling by San Francisco Judge Garcia gave Moby Grape their name back. I was ready to go to work again.\\"Bob Mosley commentary in relation to the circumstances ultimately leading to his stabilization and the recording of his album True Blue (2005). With respect to Spence, Lewis was skeptical about him being labeled a schizophrenic because recognized treatments were not resulting in any noticeable improvements. As a result, Lewis sought and participated in alternative healing therapies with Spence involving metaphysics. \\"Through my dad, who'd become a born-again Christian, I'd met these monks in Lucia above Big Sur, who were really serious about rational metaphysics. Their faith beyond reason overwhelms you every time.Lewis is presumably referring to the Camaldolese Monks of Big Sur ; www.bigsurhermitage.com. Since the doctors couldn't help Skippy - they kept objectifying his problem: 'He's a paranoid schizophrenic' and were never going to heal him. All they were interested in was keeping him out of McDonald's with a machine gun, so it (the monastery) was the only place I could think of to take him.\\"  Recent career  In recent years, in addition to performing occasionally with Moby Grape, Lewis was a guitarist with the reformed Electric Prunes (2000‚Äì2003), contributing to their Artifact album.See , October, 2001.Lewis' connection to The Electric Prunes commenced in the 1960s, through the late guitarist Ron Morgan (1945-1989). Morgan, originally from Colby, Kansas, had relocated to Los Angeles and played with Lewis in one of Lewis' early bands, Peter and The Wolves. Morgan then went on to join The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, as well as an early version of Three Dog Night and, thereafter, a reformed version of The Electric Prunes, playing on the Just Good Old Rock and Roll album. See Interview with Bob Morgan (brother of Ron Morgan), 1999; www.shadwell.tripod.com. He has also developed a career as a solo artist.

He was convicted in a U.S. Federal court as a spy for the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on September 27, 2001. George Trofimoff is the most senior officer in U.S. military history to be charged with or convicted of espionage.  Background  George Trofimoff was born in Berlin, Germany on March 9, 1927.Byers (2005), The Imperfect Spy: The Inside Story of a Convicted Spy. Page 8. His paternal grandfather, Vladimir Ivanovich Trofimoff, a Brigadier General in the Imperial Russian Army General Staff, had been arrested and shot by the CHEKA in 1919. His father, Vladimir Vladimirovich Trofimoff, had attended the Page Corps military academy. During the Russian Civil War, Vladimir had served as a Major in the anti-communist White Army. George's mother, Ekaterina Kartali, had been a successful concert pianist before marrying Major Trofimoff in 1926.Byers (2005), pages 5-8. (The information incorrect: the rank of Brigadier in the Russian Imperial Army was abandoned in the early XIX century, the rank of Major - in the late XIXth century) After the death of his wife in 1928, Major Trofimoff descended into abject poverty. In response, he temporarily gave his son to be raised by Vladimir and Antonina Sharavov, both of whom were fellow White emigres. Antonina's son from a previous marriage was Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl.Byers (2005), pages 8-10. Even into his old age, Trofimoff continued to describe Susemihl as \\"my brother.\\"Byers (2005), page xiii. In 1943, Vladimir Trofimoff remarried and his son moved back in with him and his new wife. However, the family was soon forced to separate again due to Allied bombing raids on Berlin. They would not meet again until 1949, when George Trofimoff was a U.S. Army officer assigned to the occupation of Germany.Byers (2005), pages 15-16. In the fall of 1944, George Trofimoff was ordered to report for conscription into the German Army, or Heer (usually conflated with the Wehrmacht or German Military). Rather than comply, he fled to occupied Czechoslovakia and remained in hiding near Pilsen until the end of the Second World War. Trofimoff then fled the advancing Soviet Army into the American Zone of Occupied Germany.Byers (2005), pages 16-19. After working as an interpreter for the U.S. Army, Trofimoff made his way illegally to Paris, France. While staying there, he was embraced by Paris' community of White emigres, many of whom had known his father and grandfather. Soon after, Trofimoff was sponsored by the Society of Friends for emigration to the United States. In December 1947, he boarded a KLM Royal Dutch Airliner and flew from Amsterdam to New York City.Byers (2005), pages 17-31. Trofimoff enlisted in the United States Army in 1948 and received a commission in the United States Army Reserve in 1953. He received an honorable discharge from active duty in 1956, and retired from the United States Army Reserve with the rank of Colonel in 1987. From 1959 through 1994, Trofimoff was employed by the United States Army as a civilian working in military intelligence, serving primarily in the Kingdom of Laos and in West Germany.  Espionage  The Order of the Red Banner Throughout his career with the United States Army, Trofimoff held Secret and Top Secret clearances. In 1969, he became the Chief of the United States Army Element at the Nuremberg Joint Interrogation Center (JIC). The JIC, a center for questioning defectors and refugees from the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries, was jointly run by American, French, and West German intelligence services. Colonel Trofimoff had access to all classified information received by or produced by U.S. Army Intelligence at the JIC. His indictment statesGeorge Trofimoff Affidavit that, following his promotion to head of the U.S. Army at the JIC, Trofimoff renewed his acquaintance with his foster brother Igor Susemihl. Under the monastic name Iriney, Susemihl had become a hieromonk and a bishop within the Russian Orthodox Church. After learning that Trofimoff was chronically short of funds, Bishop Iriney \\"recruited him into the service of the KGB.\\" The indictment states that the KGB possessed several similar collaborators among Moscow Patriarchate clergy, both inside and outside of the USSR. At the time, Iriney was auxiliary bishop of Munich and West Germany, but later became the Metropolitan of Vienna and Austria in 1975. He continued to hold this position until his death in 1999.–ò—Ä–∏–Ω–µ–π (–ó—É–∑–µ–º–∏–ª—å) Biography information on the web-site of the ROC Beginning in the 1960s, Trofimoff and the Metropolitan met often and maintained a close personal relationship. In a 1999 conversation with an undercover FBI agent, Trofimoff described his recruitment as follows, > ... it must have been the '70s. But it was very informal. There were no > photographs, there was just talking. He would ask me something and I would > tell him something--verbal information. He had a few questions about current > events. First, it was just a conversation between the two of us. He would > ask my opinion on this and that--then, he would maybe ask me, 'Well, what > does your unit think about it?' Or, 'What does the American government think > about it?'\\"Byers (2005), pages 111-112. Upon being asked whether Bishop Iriney's actions made him suspicious, Trofimoff responded, > No, not in the beginning. I said I needed money. And I told him my wife > bought some furniture and I can't pay for it, I don't know how to get the > money. And he says, 'I tell you what, I'll loan it to you.' So he gave me, I > think, 5,000 marks and then, it wasn't enough, because I needed more, and > about three or four weeks later I said to him, 'You gotta help me one more > time, and I'll give it back to you when I have a chance.' And that was the > end of it. Then he talked to me a couple times. Always like this. Then he > says, 'Well, you know, I'll tell you what. You don't owe me any money. And > if you need some more, I can give you some more. Don't worry about it. > You're going to have to have a few things, this and that.' And this is how > it started.Byers (2005), page 112. In 1999, Col. Trofimoff boasted that he routinely smuggled every classified document he could obtain home to be photographed with a special camera and tripod. The film was passed on to KGB agents during meetings in Austria. According to former KGB General Oleg Kalugin, however, Colonel Trofimoff, who was given the codename \\"Markiz,\\" always received his money from Metropolitan Iriney. Trofimoff traveled frequently to Austria to meet Iriney and other K.G.B. operatives, according to the indictment.Onetime Army Employee Is Charged With Spying for Russia for at Least 25 Years. The New York Times, June 15, 2000. Trofimoff further explained that Metropolitan Iriney paid him a standard amount of 7,000 Deutschmarks per week. The payments were always made in used bills and when Trofimoff needed more money toward a down payment on his house, the Metropolitan \\"went to his contact in Moscow,\\" and returned with 90,000 DM. This sum was then worth 40,000 American dollars.Byers (2005), page 114. In 2001, General Kalugin testified under oath to having invited Metropolitan Iriney to visit his dacha in 1978. According to Kalugin \\"He did good work, particularly in recruiting Markiz. I wanted to thank him for what he had done.\\"Byers (2005), page 172. In 1999, Trofimoff further explained that Metropolitan Iriney ordered him to cease his espionage work for the KGB in 1987. According to Trofimoff \\"he told me to destroy the camera, so I smashed it with a hammer and I threw it in the garbage, far away.\\"Byers (2005), pages 113-114. The German BKA, the FBI, and U.S. federal prosecutors allege that Trofimoff was paid $250,000 over the course of his espionage career. According to Kalugin, Colonel Trofimoff was also awarded the Order of the Red Banner, which he describes as the USSR's \\"highest military award for meritorious and dangerous service.\\" General Kalugin further states \\"After all, he deserved the award for the work he did for us.\\"Byers (2005), page 172.  Arrest in Germany  In 1992, a retired KGB archivist named Vasili Mitrokhin defected to the United Kingdom, taking with him thousands of pages of classified papers and handwritten notes on KGB operations at home and abroad. Major Mitrokhin's information included evidence that a NATO interrogation center was being compromised by a mole, codenamed \\"Markiz\\". He handed over KGB records that showed classified documents that exceeded 80 volumes ‚Äì 50,000 pages taken over 25 years. Mitrokhin did not have a name, but he was able to produce a vague sketch of the traitor. Furthermore, the Soviet files he delivered described the spy as a \\"career American intelligence officer\\", and the courier who carried the secrets as a Russian Orthodox \\"clergyman\\". On December 14, 1994, Colonel Trofimoff and Metropolitan Iriney were arrested and interrogated by the German Federal Police, or Bundeskriminalamt, based on the mentioned sketch. While in custody, Trofimoff was informed by his commanding officer that his security clearance and pension had both been revoked. Shortly thereafter, Trofimoff and Iriney were brought before Dr. Bernhard Bode, a judge of the Federal Court of Justice of Germany, for a preliminary hearing. During the hearing, Metropolitan Iriney admitted to having loaned Trofimoff money, but denied having links to the KGB. He did admit, however, that \\"The KGB was everywhere, also in the Church\\".Byers (2005), page 80. The Metropolitan also admitted to having \\"a very strong, personal relationship\\", with his female housekeeper, Gudula Walker.Byers (2005), page 82. As Germany's espionage laws have a five-year statute of limitations, Dr. Bode refused to file charges. As a result, both Colonel Trofimoff and Metropolitan Iriney were released. The Colonel's fifth wife, Jutta Trofimoff, was devastated by her husband's arrest. She later recalled \\"I had no knowledge of any spying activities by George. I was completely surprised by his arrest and as soon as he got home that morning I asked him to tell me truthfully what happened. He said, 'I swear on my mother's and father's graves that I did nothing'\\".Byers (2005), page 83. Mrs. Trofimoff further states \\"If I had any doubt that he was telling me the truth I would have divorced him on the spot\\".Byers (2005), page 83. After this short vindication, Colonel and Mrs. Trofimoff left Germany to retire in a gated community in Melbourne, Florida. Retirement In Florida, Trofimoff was unable to control his spending. According to Colonel Andy Byers, who lived in the same gated community, Trofimoff also loved to entertain his new neighbors with gourmet meals and fine wine. Trofimoff later recalled \\"... we had therefore acquired considerable debts, especially on the so-readily available credit cards. I have to admit that I was the person responsible for getting us into this hole. Jutta kept cautioning me, but I just didn't want to listen to reason, and thought to be smart enough to get us out of this dilemma. I took out a second mortgage on the house, which temporarily relieved the burden ... but only temporarily.\\"Byers (2005), page 88. Their debts were compounded when Trofimoff insisted on buying a new Chrysler automobile despite his wife's insistence that they could not afford it. Trofimoff was soon reduced to bagging groceries in a local supermarket in the vain hope of getting out of debt. According to Byers, Trofimoff repeatedly said of Metropolitan Iriney \\"My brother tells me he will leave money for me when he dies. He says it will be difficult to send and it will have to come through Church channels.\\"Byers (2005), page xiii.  The Sting  Beginning on July 10, 1997, FBI Agent Dmitri Droujinsky contacted Trofimoff, seeking a meeting. Special Agent Droujinsky, a fellow Russian American, had spent his career impersonating a KGB operative in order to trick suspected moles into confessing their guilt. In 1988, Droujinsky had successfully finessed a confession from U.S. Army warrant officer James Hall III, who had been spying for both the KGB and the East German Stasi.John O. Koehler, The Stasi: The Inside Story of the East German Secret Police, Westview Press, 1999. Pages 225-236. Giving his name as \\"Igor Galkin\\", an SVR agent assigned to the Russian Embassy, Special Agent Droujinsky told Trofimoff that a defecting analyst had stolen or destroyed most of his file. In exchange for Trofimoff's assistance in rebuilding it, Droujinsky offered to compensate him financially. Although Trofimoff was originally deeply skeptical about the offer, Special Agent Droujinsky finally succeeded in gaining his trust. On February 24, 1999, Trofimoff met with \\"Galkin\\" inside the Comfort Inn at Melbourne, Florida. As video tapes rolled, Trofimoff made detailed descriptions of his services for the KGB and his desperate need for more money. As a rationalization of his conduct, Trofimoff said, > Actually, I tell you. In my soul, I'm Russian, I'm not an American ... I was > never an American, it's just ... help for the Motherland ... I said many > times that I was doing it for the Motherland, not for the Bolsheviks, not > for, not for the Communists.Byers (2005), page 112. In response, Agent Droujinsky promised that the SVR would assist Trofimoff financially, but warned that it would take time. On May 10, 2000, Agent Droujinsky telephoned Trofimoff after a silence lasting five months. When Trofimoff said that he had believed himself to have been forgotten, Droujinsky responded \\"No, no. We did not forget you, George. Listen, George, I have good news for you ... Everything has been approved ... And we're finalizing the last of the details. And can I meet you in Tampa on June 14? ... I will call you about one week before that ... to tell you exactly what time and place.\\"Byers (2005), page 126. Deeply moved, Trofimoff responded \\"Oh, Igor, you're, uh, saving my life ... I was ready to put a bullet in my head ... Wonderful ... I thank you very much ... Bye-Bye.\\"Byers (2005), page 126. On June 24, 2000, Trofimoff arrived at the Tampa International Airport Hilton Hotel to meet \\"Igor Galkin\\", who had promised to give him $20,000 in cash. Instead, Trofimoff was arrested by the FBI and charged with espionage. According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Furr \\"Droujinsky's work was masterful. This guy's the finest undercover agent I've ever seen. There's no one close to him ... He's an artist like Beethoven.\\"Byers (2005), page 105. Trial and conviction The trial of retired Army Colonel George Trofimoff began at the Sam E. Gibbons U.S. Courthouse in Tampa on June 4, 2001. Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Donna Bucella \\"declined to estimate the damage wrought\\" by Trofimoff's suspected spying, stating that \\"several factors suggested a major security breach, including the sensitivity of the Nuremberg center, a NATO facility staffed by Germans, British, French and Americans; ... Trofimoff's clearance to view virtually any documents, and his longevity in the job.\\" His court trial was unprecedented in that a witness for the prosecution was former KGB General Oleg Kalugin, who had been head of the foreign counterintelligence, or K branch, of the KGB First Chief Directorate. Upon being asked whether he knew the name of Agent \\"Markiz,\\" Kalugin responded \\"Yes. I did. His name was George Trofimoff.\\"Byers (2005), page 169. General Kalugin further described his own alleged meeting with Col. Trofimoff at a location in Austria. Another witness for the prosecution was former U.S. Marine Clayton Lonetree, who testified about his own experiences with the KGB's recruiting techniques.Byers (2005), pages 157-159. On June 26, 2001, a Federal jury in Tampa, Florida, convicted Trofimoff of spying for the Soviet Union. The jury foreman, Mark King, later said that an innocent man would have informed the FBI upon being contacted by \\"Galkin.\\" King also said of Trofimoff \\"He often seemed to be lying. His story did not jibe.\\"Byers (2005), page 189. Despite his attorney's plea for leniency, Trofimoff was then sentenced to life imprisonment. Even from Federal Prison, Trofimoff continuously maintained his innocence. Trofimoff said he had always been a loyal U.S. Army officer and \\"a patriot that served this country for 46 years and a half or 47 years.\\" He also recanted his admissions of espionage to Agent Droujinsky, saying he only made himself out to be a spy in order to obtain money from the Russian Orthodox Church. Trofimoff claimed to have believed Droujinsky would only help him only if he were in such a dire situation.

Johnson Organ Company of Westfield, Massachusetts, which later became Johnson & Son Organ Company, was a highly respected firm that built 860 pipe organs throughout the United States and in Canada and Bermuda. The company operated from 1844 through 1898. All Johnson organs were completely mechanical (tracker action) organs, with Barker lever tracker-pneumatic actions utilized in larger organs after 1871. History In 1843, William Allen Johnson operated a contracting business in Westfield, Massachusetts. While he was completing the construction of a new church building for his own Westfield church, an organ builder of the firm E. and G.G. Hook & Hastings arrived with wagon loads of parts, pipes and materials which were to be installed in the new church. When asked about the availability of a worker to help set up the organ, Mr. Johnson readily applied for the job. During the construction of the Hook organ, Johnson became interested in the art of organ building. The following winter he built a small parlor organ of just one rank. He continued his new craft, building seven more parlor organs in the next five years. In 1848, he built two small one-manual church organs of five or six ranks. Opus 345 Continuing with church organ construction, Johnson built organs of increasing size. His first two-manual organ was Opus 13, 1849, at the Congregational Church in Westfield, Massachusetts. This organ contained about 15 ranks. Further expanding his territory and size, Opus 40, a 34-stop three-manual organ, was built in 1855 for the Park Presbyterian Church in Troy, New York. Another 1855 organ is believed to be the oldest Johnson organ which still exists in its original form. It is Johnson's Opus 43, built at the First Ward Presbyterian Church (later the Westminster Presbyterian Church) in Syracuse, New York. In 1871, a fire destroyed the Johnson factory. All tools and materials, along with Opus 348, 349, and 350 that were under construction were destroyed. At the time of the fire, Opus 345, a typical William Johnson tracker pipe organ of about 18 ranks (Pictured) was being installed at the First Baptist Church of Penn Yan, New York. Most of its pipework, some the last to be built at the original factory, is still in use in the Church's present organ. After the fire, an old Westfield church building was utilized for a factory. About that time William A. Johnson's son William H. Johnson, who had worked in the shop since he was 16, became an official member of the firm. With a new name, \\"Johnson and Son\\", the company was back in operation soon enough to produce 52 new organs in Chicago, Illinois, after the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. A new factory was built in 1873, and another in the mid-1880s. Johnson and Son continued the work of the William A. Johnson Organ Company, building an additional 500 organs. Their largest organs were of around 55 ranks. Throughout the years, Johnson organs were well known for their \\"excellent balance, splendid dignity, and beautiful voicing\\". Highest quality materials and workmanship were used, and Johnson's organ pipes were always of the finest quality. Tracker organs eventually became less popular, and, not wishing to switch to tubular-pneumatic- or electro-pneumatic-action organs, the company ceased operations in 1898. Their last organ was a large 3-manual organ, Opus 860, at St. Paul's Church in Chicago.  Citations  External links *Video clip Johnson & Son Pipe Organ at Saint Stanislaus, Buffalo, New York.

It is believed to have been the last witch trial to take place in Ireland. In March 1711, in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, eight women were put on trial and found guilty of witchcraft. The women were put in stocks and then jailed for one year. The trial was the result of a claim by Mrs. James Haltridge that 18-year-old Mary Dunbar exhibited signs of demonic possession such as \\"shouting, swearing, blaspheming, throwing Bibles, going into fits every time a clergyman came near her and vomiting household items such as pins, buttons, nails, glass and wool\\". Assisted by local authorities, Dunbar picked out eight women she claimed were witches that had attacked her in spectral form.Andrew Sneddon. Witchcraft and Magic in Ireland. Palgrave Macmillan UK; 25 August 2015. . p. 70‚Äì. During the arrest of the eight, they were set upon by a frenzied mob and one of the accused lost an eye. On release, all of the women were ostracized from the community. According to Andrew Sneddon, history lecturer at University of Ulster, \\"Mary Dunbar was making up the whole thing\\". Sneddon wrote that \\"Mary Dunbar learned the part of a demoniac from accounts about Salem or Scotland, or someone told her about it. Remember, this was a time when people were pouring in from Scotland\\". Records of what happened to Mary Dunbar or those convicted of witchcraft may have been lost when the Public Records Office in question was burned down during the Irish Civil War. A memorial to the eight women convicted was proposed by the author Martina Devlin. However the memorial was objected to by TUV councillor Jack McKee who believed the plaque could become a \\"shrine to paganism\\" and furthermore stated that he wasn't convinced the women weren't guilty and that he believed the proposal to be \\"anti-god\\".

History =Jubaland= Trans-Juba (\\"Oltre Giuba\\") postage stamps of 1926 Italian Trans-Juba was established in 1924, after Britain ceded the northern portion of the Jubaland region to Italy as a reward for the Italians having joined the Allies in World War I. The territory thereafter had a brief existence as Trans-Juba (Oltre Giuba) under governor Corrado Zoli (16 July 1924 ‚Äì 31 December 1926). Italy issued its first postage stamps for the new colony on 29 July 1925, consisting of Italian stamps overprinted Oltre Giuba. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). In 1925, a year after its formation, Trans-Juba was integrated into Italian Somaliland.http://www.dcstamps.com/?p=1296 Oltre Giuba (Trans-Juba), Italian Colony (1924 ‚Äì 1926) The colony had a total area of 87,000 km¬≤ (33,000 sq mi), and in 1926, a population of 120,000 inhabitants. In the capital Kismayo (Chisimaio), there was a very little group of Italian settlers, mostly merchants. During this period, the city was the third largest in Somalia and served as a port of call for small military ships. =Bajuni Islands= The Bajuni Islands (\\"Isole Giuba\\") were part of British East Africa until World War I. They were later transferred to Italy in 1926. According to Wightwick Haywood, then a British official stationed in Kisimayo who visited the Bajuni Islands in 1913, the only inhabited islands in the chain were Tovai (i.e., Chovaye - the biggest island in the chain) and the nearby Tula (i.e. Chula). Each of these two islands were no more than three miles long and a mile wide. Maize, millet, sweet potatoes and coconuts were grown. The residents of the islands at the time, some of whom Haywood thought to be of Arab and/or Persian descent, built dhows, which the British official considered \\"excellent sea boats\\". However, the islands were mainly inhabited by the eponymous Bajuni people.

It was one of the Expansion Units originally established for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but has been a general workhorse unit ever since. History =Origins= The 15th Cavalry Regiment was formed in 1901 at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. Immediately upon its organization in 1901, the 15th Cavalry embarked for the Philippines to quell an insurrection in the United States' newly acquired territory. The regiment's next action was part of the Cuban Pacification from 1906 to 1909, followed by duty along the Mexican border and the hunt for Pancho Villa from December 1917 to March 1918. =World War One= When the United States entered World War I, the regiment sailed for France as one of the four mounted regiments on duty with the Allied Expeditionary Force. The fighting had already bogged down into trench warfare and the role of horse cavalry was nearly over. The 15th was called upon to dismount and relieve exhausted infantry units in the trenches. It was the tank that finally broke the trench lines to end both the war and the role of the horse soldier. The 15th served occupation duty after the war until June 1919 when it returned to the United States. The 5th Cavalry Regiment was deactivated on 18 October 1921, after 20 years of continuous active service, as part of the massive cutbacks in the Regular Army following \\"the war to end all wars\\". =World War Two= With the advent of the Second World War, the 15th was again called to service in March 1942, this time with new mounts, the armored car and tank. After undergoing training at the Desert Training Center in California, the regiment sailed for the European Theater of Operations, arriving in Scotland in March 1944. Here, the 15th was reorganized as the 15th Cavalry Group (Mechanized). The group was composed of the 15th and 17th Reconnaissance Squadrons. The 15th Cavalry Group landed on Utah Beach on 5 July 1944 as part of Patton's Third Army. The 15th served in four major campaigns in Europe: Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, and Central Europe. The 15th Cavalry Group and its two squadrons fought as part of the Third Army, Ninth Army and was later assigned as a security force for several different divisions. The end of the war found the 15th deep inside Germany, covering over 1000 miles of enemy held territory since landing on the Continent in July 1944. When the war ended, the 15th Cavalry Group and its two squadrons had taken nearly 7,000 German prisoners and had destroyed 78 guns and 495 enemy vehicles. =Postwar ‚Äì the Constabulary Era= Following the war, the 15th was redesignated the 15th Constabulary Regiment, charged initially with occupation duty of the defeated Germany. The 17th Reconnaissance Squadron was deactivated in January 1947, but the 15th Squadron, redesignated as the 15th Constabulary Squadron, continued serving. As the cold war began in earnest, the regiment's duty shifted to patrolling the border between West Germany and East Germany, as well as the border with Czechoslovakia. The Constabulary Force guarded the border until 1952. =Cold War= From 1952 to 1987, the regiment went through a series of redesignations, inactivations and reactivations. Elements of the regiment served across various Army units in Korea, Germany, and the United States. Troop G served in the Vietnam War from 1971 to 1972, being equipped at that time with the M551 Sheridan Armored Reconnaissance/Airborne Assault Vehicle (AR/AAV). =Reorganization and current status= In March 1987, the Army overhauled its Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) to restore some order to the history and lineage of its regiments. One goal of this reform was to keep on active duty those regiments which had earned distinguished records over long years of service. The 15th Cavalry Regiment met this criteria and, in March 1987, was reactivated at Fort Knox, Kentucky, by the activation of its 5th Squadron (Sabers).

The trust was used to create a number of schools in Devon including Plympton Grammar School (founded 1658, built 1664)Inscribed bronze plaque near building (alias Hele's School). Origins Hele was born in 1560 at WorstonPrince, p.486 (or WinstonA History of Devonshire By Richard Nicholls Worth, ) in the parish of Brixton near Plympton, Devon. He was the elder of two sons of Walter Hele of Brixton by his wife Jone (or Jane) Maynard, a daughter of Thomas Maynard of Brixton.Vivian, pp.467, 464 His uncle was the very wealthy lawyer John Hele (d.1608), of Wembury, Devon, Recorder of Exeter in 1592, and Member of Parliament for Exeter 1593-1601, who married a daughter of Ellis (alias Elizeus) Warwick of Holbeton. The Hele family originated at the manor of Hele in the parish of Cornwood.Prince, p.484 Marriages and children He married twice: *Firstly to Mary Hender,Ecclesiastical Antiquities in Devon, George Oliver, 1840, p.250 daughter and co-heiress of John Hender of Bottreaux Castle in Cornwall.Vivian, p.467 The arms of Hender (Azure, a lion rampant between an orle of escallops or)Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.3, Cornwall, Extinct Gentry appear on Hele's monument.

He was the 5th son of John Eveleigh of Holcombe in the parish of Ottery St Mary, Devon,Vivian, p.336, pedigree of Eveleigh was Steward of Devon Stannaries, and died when the roof of Chagford Stannary Court collapsed in 1618, killing 9 other people. The arms of Bray (Argent, a chevron between three eagle's legs erased sable) appear on the monuments of both Eveleigh and Hele. Career Hele was a lawyer of the Inner Temple in London. He was called to the bar in 1590 and to the bench in 1603.old totnesians He was the treasurer to James I. He was a major landowner in south and west Devon. After his only child, Walter, died at the age of eleven, Hele decided to bequeath a number of his estates for \\"some godly purposes and charitable uses\\".Kellys Directory of Devonshire 1923 A deed was signed on 9 January 1632 between Elize Hele, John Maynard, later Sir John Maynard, John Hele and Elize Stert in which Elize Hele dedicated his estate to charitable and godly use. Elize Hele included the manors of Fardel, Dinnaton, Brixton Reigny, Cofleet, Halwill, Teignharvey, Clyst St Lawrence and Clyst Gerrard and Woolvington rectory and St Giles in the Heath. Death and burial He died in 1635 and was buried in St. Andrew's Chapel (the \\"Cannons' Vestry\\") in Exeter Cathedral, as was also his wife when she died on 20 June 1636.Some account of the ancient borough town of Plympton St. Maurice by William Cotton, 1859 His elaborate monument with semi-recumbent alabaster effigy survives on the south side of the chancel in Bovey Tracey Church, opposite that of Nicholas Eveleigh, his second wife's first husband. Legacy His will took some time to settle. Twenty years later, his will was challenged in the House of Commons by his great niece Joane Hele (the granddaughter of Elize's brother Nicholas Hele, and the wife of Captain Edmond Lister) who petitioned the court to allow funds from the will to be redirected to her. Hele's executor, Sir John Maynard, was neutral to the outcome and Sir Edward Rhodes ruled that funds should be given to Joane but that the charitable causes should not be abandoned. In 1649 John Maynard and Elize Stert, as surviving trustees, granted the lands and profits of the estate to be enjoyed by the governors, assistants and wardens of the Hospital of the Poors Portion, Plymouth, for the education of poor children. John Maynard and Elize Stert had also purchased in 1656, on behalf of the Hele Charity trust, an estate at Lower Creeson, Mary Tavy. Yearly accounts were compiled each November and money was to be used to build a schoolhouse at Plympton St Maurice and to buy lands at Brixton to support the preaching minister. In 1656 his trustees, Sir John Maynard and Elize Stert apportioned money for the founding of the Blue Maid's Hospital (later renamed \\"The Maynard School\\") and in 1658 for the establishing of Hele's School in Plympton.Exeter charities accessed 22 June 2008 An indenture of 17‚Äì18 December 1658 between the Hele Charity trustees and the City of Exeter and governors of St John's Foundlings Hospital, Exeter, granted the profits of the manors of Clyst St Lawrence, Clyst St Gerrard and Teignharvey, as well as of Torre House, Newton Ferrers, to the Hospital, for the maintenance of the poor children. The heirs of Sir John Maynard were John Kerr, Earl of Ancram (later 7th Marquess of Lothian), Lady Suffield, Ernest Edgcumbe, Viscount Valletort (later 3rd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe) and Viscountess Castlereagh.Hele's charity at the National Archives Sir John Maynard's descendants received the remaining income from the bequest and distributed it to charities as they decided for the next two centuries. Legal proceedings resulted in depriving the descendant of Sir J. Maynard, who was the surviving trustee, of all control over the funds, which were thereupon vested in the Crown.

The game was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is the first game to be released under THQ's 2007 agreement with the UFC, and it is to be the first UFC game released since UFC: Sudden Impact in 2004. A playable demo of UFC 2009 was released onto Xbox Live and PlayStation Network on 23 April 2009, and featured a tutorial and exhibition matchup between Chuck Liddell and Mauricio Rua. A sequel, UFC Undisputed 2010, was released on 25 May 2010. Fighting styles The developers at Yuke's Osaka included 6 major primary fighting styles for the fighters in the game; Striking: Boxing, Kickboxing, and Muay Thai, Grappling: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, and Wrestling. These styles are placed into two categories, allowing a character to have one of the fighting styles from each of these categories. For example: Georges St. Pierre has Kickboxing and Wrestling as his two fighting styles. The \\"standup\\" category allows Boxing, Muay Thai or Kickboxing, while grappling-style can consist of Brazilian jiu- jitsu, Wrestling or Judo. Miscellaneous *In the May 2009 issue of Fight! Magazine, THQ highlighted some of the setbacks they faced during the game's development as a result of various clipping issues within the collision detection. They stated that they removed rising UFC star Clay Guida from the roster due to the clipping issues presented by his lengthy hair on his character model and it was rumored that Dana White even offered him $10,000 to cut it but he refused, this was refuted by Guida in an interview with Pro MMA Radio where he stated that he would have done anything to be in the game including cutting his hair but simply wasn't asked. Southpaw stances were also excluded for clipping issues. As such, southpaw fighters like Rich Franklin fight with the Orthodox stance in the game. *TapouT crew members Charles Lewis Jr. (Mask) and Punkass are unlockable playable characters by progressing through career mode. Skyscrape is unlockable with a code. *The Ultimate Fighter season 8 winners Ryan Bader and Efrain Escudero, formerly available only through an exclusive pre-order code from GameStop, were made available for purchase through XBLA and PSN on 10 September 2009. Reception The game received \\"favourable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine and three eights for a total of 33 out of 40. Some reviews cited the lack of a penalty for users who disconnect from online games as a negative aspect, along with lag in online play. Although recently, there had been a patch that must be downloaded, that is preventing \\"cheating\\" with the CAF program, by stopping a bug that players were able to exploit an error in the CAF system, that allowed artificial \\"pumping up\\" of the CAF's ability meters. This patch is also supposed to be able to track those players that disconnect in an attempt to falsely prevent losses from showing up on the CAF's Win-Loss record. It is also supposed to try to prevent lag issues, by matching up players with similar connection speeds. Hyper's Daniel Wilks commended the game for its \\"very deep, intricate fighting system [and] balanced striking and ground game.\\" However, he criticized it for its \\"very steep learning curve [and] very niche appeal\\".

Founded in 1998 as the University Honors Program, it was expanded and renamed in 2002 in response to a $1.5 million gift by Al and Nancy Burnett. The dean of the college is Sheila Amin Guti√©rrez de Pi√±eres, Ph.D. The college administers UCF's two honors programs, University Honors and Honors in the Major, through programs of advanced study at the university's main campus in Orlando. These programs encompass students who are also in one of UCF's twelve other academic colleges, but have applied to and been accepted to the Burnett Honors College. The college offers an honors dormitory in the Towers at Knights Plaza, and honors students are assisted with applying for prestigious post-graduate honors and fellowships, Other benefits include priority scheduling, specialized academic advisers, smaller classes that benefit from a more hands- on approach, and specialty courses and programs. History In 1998, the UCF Honors Program was granted college status. Al and Nancy Burnett donated $1.5 million towards the completion of a building to house the new honors college, and it was subsequently named in their honor. A state grant matched the donation made by the Burnett's, bringing total funding for the new college to $3 million. Ground was broken on the new facility on April 24, 2001, and the Burnett Honors College building was completed in May 2002, and formally dedicated on October 23, 2002. In 2007 the college partnered with the Department of Housing and Residence Life to create a living-learning community, composed mostly of honors students, in Tower III at Knights Plaza. Admission Admission to the Burnett Honors College is strictly limited to incoming freshmen for the University Honors program, and juniors and seniors for the Honors in the Major program. Requirements for freshman entrance include excellent high school grades, one essay, strong extracurricular activities, and teacher references. The Honors in the Major program requires a minimum of 60 completed credit hours, a 3.2 GPA, and the recommendation of a tenured professor in the student's major. A recent Burnett Honors College incoming class had an average SAT score of 1457, an average ACT score of 32.1 and average high school GPAs of 4.46 (weighted). The class boasted 27 National Merit Scholars, 115 AP Scholars and eight National Hispanic Scholars. Academics The mission of the college is to provide a challenging academic program and a foundation for future achievement to UCF's most academically talented undergraduate students. With only 1,700 students in the college, the Burnett Honors College combines the intimacy of a small liberal arts college with the advantages of a large metropolitan research university. The college does not have any departments or offer any degrees by itself; all of its students are also students of one of the other colleges at the university. Burnett students benefit from being able to take smaller honors-versions of both lower-division and upper-division university courses (most of which are limited to a 20-student capacity), priority multiple-term class registration, usage of a private BHC Computer Lab, Reading Room, extended library privileges, scholarship opportunities, among others. =Programs= The Burnett Honors College offers two distinct Honors programs for students: University Honors, which is a 4-year program in which students must apply as high school seniors, and Honors in the Major, which allows juniors and seniors to conduct original research within their major and write an undergraduate honors thesis. University Honors students must maintain a 3.2 overall GPA, and a 3.0 honors GPA. The two programs are not mutually exclusive, and in fact share many common elements. If a student completes one of these programs, an Honors distinction corresponding to the program that was completed will appear on the student's diploma and official transcript. The college also offers many events and programs, which are open to UCF students regardless of whether or not they are honors students. In addition, the honors college houses the Office of Prestigious Awards, which provides information and preparation services for all UCF students interested in applying for prestigious scholarships and fellowships.

He became Governor of Bangkok and Mergui, but was eventually captured by the Siamese during the 1688 Siamese revolution. The Chevalier de Beauregard was briefly commander of the French fortress of Bangkok, after Claude de Forbin returned to France. De Beauregard went to Siam in 1685, with the embassy of Chevalier de Chaumont. He was transferred to the garrison of Bangkok, under the command of Chevalier Claude de Forbin. In July 1686, when the fort was attacked by a band of pirates from Makassar, de Beauregard's belly was slit open with a dagger, but his commander de Forbin managed to replace the viscera and sew him up, making him the first recorded case of a Western-style surgical intervention in Thailand. > As I drew near the bed and examined the young man more strictly, I saw that > he breathed still, but he could not speak and his mouth as all in a froth.

De Beauregard was named governor by King Narai of Siam in the place of the Englishman, Samuel White. De Beauregard was part of the retreat of the French troops of De Bruant there, following the 1688 Siamese revolution. Large-scale attacks were launched on the two French fortresses in Siam, Bangkok and Mergui, and on 24 June, the French had to abandon their garrison at Mergui. Du Bruant and de Beauregard managed to escape under fire and with many casualties by seizing a Siamese warship, the Mergui. De Beauregard was eventually captured by the Siamese in Tavoy when the French ships from Mergui tried to obtain some victuals there, together with four soldiers and the Jesuit Pierre d'Espagnac. The captives seem to have been enslaved.

It was developed by Bayer HealthCare AG, Animal Health GmbH, and received approval from the European Commission in April 2011 for prescription-only use in veterinary medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections in dogs and cats. History Pradofloxacin was first discovered by chemists at Bayer in 1994 and patented in 1998. The name pradofloxacin was issued in December 2000 by the World Health Organization. Following submission for marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2004, the application was refused in 2006, prompting further studies. Having reviewed the additional studies, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) recommended granting marketing authorisation of pradofloxacin by consensus in February 2011. Marketing authorisation of pradofloxacin was granted by the European Commission in April 2011. Mechanism of action The primary mode of action of fluoroquinolones involves interaction with enzymes essential for major DNA functions such as replication, transcription and recombination. The primary targets for pradofloxacin are the bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Reversible association between pradofloxacin and DNA gyrase or DNA topoisomerase IV in the target bacteria results in inhibition of these enzymes and rapid death of the bacterial cell. The rapidity and extent of bacterial killing are directly proportional to the drug concentration. As a result, pradofloxacin is active against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria including anaerobic bacteria. Indications As with all prescription veterinary medicine, advice on the use of pradofloxacin should always be sought from a suitably qualified veterinarian. =Dogs= In Europe Pradofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of: *wound infections and superficial and deep pyoderma caused by susceptible strains of the Staphylococcus intermedius group (including S. pseudintermedius), *acute urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli and the Staphylococcus intermedius group (including S. pseudintermedius) and *as adjunctive treatment to mechanical or surgical periodontal therapy in the treatment of severe infections of the gingiva and periodontal tissues caused by susceptible strains of anaerobic organisms, for example Porphyromonas spp. and Prevotella spp. =Cats= Pradofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of: *acute infections of the upper respiratory tract caused by susceptible strains of Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli and the Staphylococcus intermedius group (including S. pseudintermedius). *wound infections and abscesses caused by susceptible strains of Pasteurella multocida and the Staphylococcus intermedius group (including S. pseudintermedius) [for oral suspension only].

These names are found throughout continental Europe, Britain, Ireland, Anatolia and, latterly, through various other parts of the globe not originally occupied by Celts. Celtic languages The Proto-Indo-European language developed into various daughter languages, including the Proto-Celtic language. In Proto-Celtic (\\"PC\\"), the Proto-Indo-European (\\"PIE\\") sound *p disappeared, perhaps through an intermediate *'. After that, languages derived from Proto-Celtic changed PC *kw into either *p or *k (see: P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages). In P-Celtic languages, PC *kw changed into *p. In Q-Celtic dialects it developed into /k/. P-Celtic languages include the Continental Gaulish language and the Brittonic branch of Insular Celtic. Common Brittonic is the ancestor of Welsh, Cornish and Breton. Ancient Q-Celtic languages include the Continental Celtiberian and the Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.

For some names, there is uncertainty as to whether they are Gaulish or Latin in origin. In some rare cases, such as Frick, Switzerland, there have even been competing suggestions of Gaulish, Latin and Alemannic etymologies.Frick has been derived from (a) a Celtic word for \\"confluence\\", cognate with fork, (b) an Alemannic personal name Fricco and (c) Latin ferra ricia \\"iron mine, ironworks\\". Examples of toponyms with established Gaulish etymology: *Solothurn, from Salodurum. The -durum element means \\"doors, gates; palisade; town\\".

Insular Celtic =Goidelic= England Place names in England derived from Goidelic languages include: *Dovenby, from personal name Dufan of Irish origin (OIr 'Dubh√°n') *Fixby, from the Gaelic Irish personal name Fiach *Glassonby, from the Irish personal name Glassan *Malmesbury, from the Irish founder of the abbey M√°el Dub *Melmerby, from the Old Irish personal name M√°el Muire Place names that directly reference the Irish include Irby, Irby upon Humber, Ireby and Ireleth. Ireland The vast majority of placenames in Ireland are anglicized Irish language names. Scotland The majority of placenames in the Highlands of Scotland (part of the United Kingdom) are either Scottish Gaelic or anglicized Scottish Gaelic. Gaelic-derived placenames are very common in the rest of mainland Scotland also. Pictish-derived placenames can be found in the northeast, while Brythonic-derived placenames can be found in the south. Isle of Man The majority of placenames on the Isle of Man (a Crown dependency) are Manx or anglicized Manx. =Brythonic= England (excluding Cornwall) Evidence for a Celtic root to place names in England is widely strengthened by early monastic charters, chronicles and returns such as mentioning Leatherhead and Litchfield. To describe a place as of the Celts, the Old English wealh becoming Wal/Wall/Welsh is often used. This was the main Germanic term for Romano-Celtic peoples, such as the Britons. Such names are a minority, but are widespread across England. For example, a smattering of villages around the heart and east of The Fens hint at this: West Walton, Walsoken, and the Walpoles indicate their continued presence. Nearby Wisbech, King's Lynn and Chatteris have Celtic topographical elements. *Arden (forest of), Warwickshire From Celtic *ardu- 'high' (Irish ard) *Avon (river), Gloucestershire/Wiltshire/Somerset *Avon (river), Wiltshire/Hampshire/Dorset *Avon (river), Northamptonshire/Warwickshire/Worcestershire/Gloucestershire *Avon or Aune (river), Devon From Brythonic *abona 'river' (Welsh afon) *Axe (river), Devon/Dorset *Axe (river), Somerset *Axminster, Devon *Axmouth, Devon From Celtic *iska 'water' (Irish uisce) *Brean, Somerset *Bredon, Worcestershire *Breedon on the Hill, Leicestershire *Brewood, Staffordshire *Brill, Buckinghamshire First element from Celtic *briga 'hill' *Brent (river), Greater London *Brentford, Greater London From Celtic *brigant- 'high, lofty, elevated' (or divine name, Brigantia) *Bryn, Greater Manchester Derived from Welsh bryn, 'hill'. *Camulodunum (Latin), now Colchester, Essex From *kamulos 'Camulus' (divine name) + Celtic *d≈´non 'fortress' *Creech St Michael, Somerset *Crewkerne, Somerset *Crich, Derbyshire *Cricket St Thomas, Somerset *Crickheath, Shropshire *Cricklade, Wiltshire First element from Brythonic *cr√ºg 'hill'Mills, AD.

Since 2003, it has been a subsidiary of the Spanish infrastructure services company Ferrovial. Amey was founded by William Charles Amey in 1921. The firm grew rapidly during the Second World War via government infrastructure contracts. In 1959, it was contracted to supply gravel for the construction of the M1 motorway. During 1963, Amey was listed on the first time on the London Stock Exchange. Between 1972 and 1989, the company was owned by Consolidated Gold Fields. In 1995, Amey was refloated on the London Stock Exchange. Around this time, management decided to orientate the company towards support services delivery activities. During April 2003, Amey was acquired by Ferrovial. During the early 21st century, Amey diversified into various market sectors, including criminal justice and railways. Between 2003 and May 2010, the company jointly operated the Tube Lines consortium with partner Bechtel, which was responsible for maintaining, renewing and upgrading the infrastructure of three London Underground lines. As of 2019, the firm operates the Docklands Light Railway and the Manchester Metrolink tram concessions, along with the Transport for Wales Rail franchise via a 30:70 partnership with French public services specialist Keolis. Amey also operates within the civil engineering industry as a consultant, typically performing activities such as structural design, civil infrastructure, transport systems and asset management services. History Amey was founded in 1921 by William Charles Amey; it was initially based in Oxfordshire and acted as quarry operator. During the Second World War, the company experienced significant growth due to its involvement in fulfilling wartime demands, including an arrangement that saw Amey participate in the construction of multiple air bases on behalf of the Royal Air Force. In 1959, the company was responsible for the supply of gravel for the construction of the M1 motorway between London and Birmingham. During that same year, Amey became a public company. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1963. Ronald William Amey took over the business from his father, and agreed the sale of the company in 1972. The family had a close association with Abingdon School, where the Amey Theatre is named after them. For a time, the Amey head office was in Sutton Courtenay, Vale of White Horse, near Abingdon.\\"Amey bids for high-flying firm.\\" Oxford Mail. Story date: Friday 22 January 1999. Internet date: Wednesday 27 January 1999. Retrieved 13 August 2011. \\"Servisair, based in Stockport, Cheshire, has operating licenses in eight countries and provides services at more than 60 airports across Europe,[...]\\" Between 1972 and 1989, the company was owned by Consolidated Gold Fields, and used the names Amey Roadstone and ARC. During this period, Amey Roadstone continued to undertake several major projects on behalf of the British government, included construction work at Mount Pleasant Airfield on the Falkland Islands, which was completed in 1986. In 1974, the company bought Stephen Toulson & Sons. During 1989, Hanson purchased Amey Roadstone from Consolidated Gold Fields, returning the firm back to private ownership. In 1995, Amey was refloated on the London Stock Exchange; around this time, the company's management team made the strategic decision to focus its efforts upon the support services delivery sector. To this end, in 1999, Amey acquired Comax, a secure services specialist. One year later, the company's listing on the stock exchange was changed to 'support services' to reflect the business' new direction. During April 2003, Amey was acquired by the Spanish infrastructure services company Ferrovial with the endorsement of Amey's board; even following this purchase, the firm has continued to trade under the Amey name. A statement issued by Ferrovial noted that the purchase allowed it greater access to the lucrative British market, particularly for public‚Äìprivate partnerships. In February 2006, Amey acquired the highway and railway design consultancy, Owen Williams, allowing it to substantially grow its business and develop its own consultancy division. During the early 21st century, a heavy emphasis was placed upon participating in Britain's railway industry. From 2003 to May 2010, the company jointly owned (with Bechtel) Tube Lines, the consortium responsible for the maintenance, renewal and upgrade of the infrastructure, including track, trains, signals, civil work and stations, on three London Underground lines. In 2010, Tube Lines encountered a funding shortfall for its upgrades and requested that TfL provide an additional ¬£1.75 billion to cover the shortfall; TfL refused and referred the matter to the arbiter, who stated that ¬£400 million should be provided. Shortly following this event, Tube Lines was bought from Amey and Bechtel by Transport for London (TfL). Despite this, Amey continued to provide TfL with management and maintenance services for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines until the end of 2017, at which point London Underground Limited took over from Amey. ballast/track tamper train at Banbury station In 2010, the firm expanded its presence in the waste management sector via the acquisition of waste disposal company Donarbon. That same year, Amey also acquired the rail consultancy arm of WYG Engineering Ltd; these purchase was quickly followed by yet more, such as Transportation Planning (International) Ltd (TPi) in February 2011 and Aquatech Engineering in November 2014. During 2011, Amey began providing criminal justice services following the issuing of three separate contract from the Ministry of Justice. In April 2013, Amey completed the acquisition of utilities, waste and public service providers, Enterprise plc. In January 2016, Amey acquired Travel Point Trading Ltd (TPT), a strategic asset management consultancy with a strong presence in the rail sector in the United Kingdom. In February 2018, Amey purchased Carillion's rail contracts with Network Rail in the East Midlands, London and the North West, following Carillion's liquidation during the previous month; this deal reportedly saved about 700 jobs. In August 2018, Amey completed the acquisition of Ministry of Defence (MoD) housing maintenance contracts previously run in joint venture with Carillion. In December 2018, press reports said that Ferrovial had offered Amey for sale. That year, Ferrovial had posted a net loss of ‚Ç¨72m for the first half of 2018 after allocating ‚Ç¨237m for losses on Amey's highway maintenance contract with Birmingham City Council. In February 2019, Amey was reported close to a deal to exit its Birmingham highway maintenance contract, liabilities from which were preventing the company's sale by Ferrovial, who slashed the value of Amey by ¬£660m, saying the \\"fair value\\" of Amey in the United Kingdom was ¬£88m. In May 2019, Amey was said to be close to agreeing a deal to terminate its Birmingham contract; in July 2019, Ferrovial confirmed the deal terms: the council will receive ¬£160m in 2019 with a further ¬£55m paid over the next six years. Services will continue on an interim basis until 30 September 2019, and may be extended until 31 March 2020. In February 2020, it was announced that Amey would end its Birmingham contract at the end of March 2020, while Kier Group was appointed as interim contractor for 15 months while the council sought a permanent replacement for Amey).

The following day, Amey revealed a pre tax loss of ¬£428m for the year to 31 December 2018. On revenues of ¬£2.32bn, a ¬£208,000 pre tax profit was wiped out by exceptional items, including ¬£123m on the highways contract for Birmingham, and a ¬£314m write down on its waste collection and utilities businesses. In December 2019, Ferrovial started to offload loss making parts of the business in the United Kingdom, appointing PricewaterhouseCoopers to find buyers for Amey's utilities and environmental services divisions.

On 30 September 2020, Amey reported a ¬£217m loss in the year to 31 December 2019, mainly due to its loss- making utilities and waste businesses - booked as discontinued operations - which recorded a loss of ¬£97m, plus ¬£159m of associated impairments. Revenue increased in continuing UK businesses by ¬£325m to ¬£1.9bn, helped by the 2018 acquisition of the other half of the Carillion/Amey Defence joint venture. Operating profit was ¬£73.2m.

The replacement of up to 17,500 of the city's 36,000 highway trees was the subject of a campaign by local residents, who argued that the majority of the trees listed for felling were healthy and could be retained using sensitive engineering solutions. According to the council, the 'Streets Ahead' tree strategy meant only trees which had been assessed as dead, dying, diseased, dangerous, damaging footpaths, private property or roads, or discriminatory by obstructing pavements were replaced. The ultimate decision was taken by the council. Over the course of the contract the overall number of highways trees would increase. On 26 March 2018, the city council announced an immediate pause of the tree felling scheme, following the wave of criticism and protests. =COVID-19 pandemic= In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, an Amey HR executive said company workers would not receive any special sickness benefits as he believed coronavirus was \\"less severe\\" than normal influenza.

Early life He was born on November 11, 1852, in Rochester, Monroe County, New York. He was the son of Wisconsin State Senator Charles S. Kelsey (born 1822) and Lucretia Parson (n√©e Bacon) Kelsey (died 1868). Congressman William H. Kelsey and Wisconsin State Senator Edwin B. Kelsey were his uncles. Career He became a printer, then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1875, and practiced law in Geneseo, Livingston County, New York. =Political career= He was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901 and 1902. In November 1902, he ran for County Judge of Livingston County, but was unexpectedly defeated. Subsequently his party friends forced Theodore P. Gilman to resign the office of First Deputy Comptroller, and had Kelsey appointed to the post. When Comptroller Nathan Lewis Miller was appointed to the New York Supreme Court, Kelsey was appointed New York State Comptroller to fill the vacancy, and was elected at the New York state election, 1904, to succeed himself. On May 2, 1906, Kelsey was appointed by Governor Frank W. Higgins to a three-year term as Superintendent of Insurance, and resigned the comptrollership. Early in 1907, Governor Charles Evans Hughes asked Kelsey to resign, but he refused. The governor then asked the New York State Senate to remove Kelsey on the ground that \\"while honest he utterly lacks in force and initiative\\", but after a lengthy hearing in the Judicial Committee, Kelsey was upheld by a vote of 27 to 24 on May 3, 1907. Then Governor Hughes appointed Matthew C. Fleming a Special Commissioner to examine the Insurance Department, and on February 2, 1908, Fleming declared Kelsey \\"unfit for the office\\" in his report to the State Senate, but Kelsey was maintained in office by an even larger majority. Eventually, Kelsey resigned from the Insurance Department to be re-appointed First Deputy Comptroller by Charles H. Gaus on January 1, 1909, and acted as Comptroller after Gaus's death until the appointment, on November 11, of Clark Williams to fill the vacancy. A week later, Kelsey was forced to resign as First Deputy Comptroller. Personal life He died on August 20, 1934, in Perry, Wyoming County, New York, after complications from a fall, and was buried in Geneseo.

(ISO-NE) is an independent, non-profit Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), headquartered in Holyoke, Massachusetts, serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. ISO-NE oversees the operation of New England's bulk electric power system and transmission lines, generated and transmitted by its member utilities, as well as Hydro-Qu√©bec, NB Power, the New York Power Authority and utilities in New York state, when the need arises. ISO-NE is responsible for reliably operating New England's bulk electric power generation and transmission system. One of its major duties is to provide tariffs for the prices, terms, and conditions of the energy supply in New England. ISO New England's stated mission is to protect the health of New England's economy and the well-being of its people by ensuring the constant availability of electricity, today and for future generations. ISO New England ensures the day-to-day reliable operation of New England's bulk power generation and transmission system, oversees the administration of the region's wholesale electricity markets, and manages comprehensive, regional planning processes. Its board of directors and over 500 employees have no financial interest in any company doing business in the region's wholesale electricity marketplace. ISO-NE was created in 1997 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as a replacement for the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), which was created in 1971. The ISO-NE grid does not extend to remote parts of eastern and northern Maine in Washington and Aroostook Counties. In these areas, residents receive their electricity from Canadian providers such as NB Power and Hydro-Qu√©bec. History New England's electric power industry, like that of the entire nation, changed dramatically during the past few decades. Until the 1970s, the industry consisted of utilities that handled every aspect of providing electricity: generating it, transmitting it and then distributing it to homes and businesses. These utilities were regulated local monopolies that operated independently of each other. The Northeast Blackout of 1965 marked a turning point for the region's electric power industry. It shut down power for 30 million customers. On January 1966, the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) formed to improve system reliability. Concerned about the system's reliability, the Northeast's power companies formed three \\"power pools\\" to ensure a dependable supply of electricity. The New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), formed in 1971 by the region's private and municipal utilities, was intended to foster cooperation and coordination among utilities in the six- state region. During the next three decades, NEPOOL created a regional power grid that now includes more than 300 separate generating plants and more than 8,000 miles of transmission lines‚Äîall interconnected and dedicated to ensuring that New England never again has a region-wide power failure. While the electric power industry's regulated monopolies worked well for generations, by the 1990s the lack of competition provided little reason to improve service, minimize prices or invest in new facilities and technologies. In New England, electricity rates were among the nation's highest, and the region had an antiquated electric power infrastructure. In the early 1990s, Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)‚Äîwhich oversees the electricity industry nationally‚Äîbegan enabling the restructuring of wholesale electric power. They believed competition would provide needed renewal, much as it had in transportation, telecommunications and financial services. The FERC created a level playing field for competitive markets, ensuring equal access to transmission grids and encouraging states to require utilities to sell off power plants and gradually eliminate regulator-set rates in favor of prices determined by the markets. In 1996, FERC Order 888 deregulated portions of the electric power market. In 1997, the ISO created a management system for the regional bulk power system and proposed new wholesale markets and ensure access to transmission systems. In 1999, the ISO began managing restructured regional wholesale power markets. In 2001, the ISO proposed a Standard Market Design, and rules to govern new wholesale markets. In 2003, the ISO New England Board of Directors voted to pursue the creation of an RTO for New England. In 2003, the ISO implemented the Standard Market Design, an improved wholesale market design for the region. In 2004, the FERC conditionally approves ISO New England as an RTO. In 2005, ISO New England begins operation as a Regional Transmission Organization. In 2008, the RTO held the first auction under the new Forward Capacity Market, designed to ensure the region continuously develops the resources needed to meet demand and maintain reliability. In 2010, culminating four years of development and staged implementation, the RTO launched the final phase of the Forward Capacity Market. Creating independent system operators The FERC created independent system operators, or ISOs, to oversee restructuring on a regional basis. These ISOs were given responsibility for ensuring reliability and establishing and overseeing competitive wholesale electricity markets. ISO New England was approved by FERC in 1997. Utilities is the six states have sold off their power plants. = The move to markets = Working closely with the New England Power Pool, now a group of generators, utilities, marketers, public power companies and end users, ISO New England implemented wholesale markets in 1999. About 400 market participants complete $10 billion in wholesale electricity transactions annually. ISO New England has enhanced these markets in 2003, when it adopted a ‚ÄúStandard Market Design (SMD).‚Äù SMD added features such as a Day-Ahead Market to protect against price volatility and locational pricing that improves efficiency by accurately gauging the true cost of producing and supplying power anywhere in the region. = Strengthened oversight and governance through RTOs = In 2005, FERC designated ISO New England as the regional transmission organization for the six-state region. In this role, ISO New England continues to fulfill its responsibilities, but with broader authority over the day-to-day operation of the transmission system and greater independence to manage the power grid and wholesale markets. There are 6.5 million customer households and businesses.

Ryng joined the team during the 1932 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1941 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal, one Munster medal and two National League medals. Ryng was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Ryng was a four-time county club championship runner-up with Carrigtwohill. Playing career =Club= Ryng played his club hurling with Carrigtwohill during a time when the club made great strides but fell short of claiming ultimate championship honours. In 1932 Carrig qualified for the first senior championship decider in eighteen years and Ryng was in the full-forward line. St. Finbarr's led by fourteen points at one stage, however, Carrig fought back in the second half. Ryng still ended up on the losing side by 5-3 to 4-4. Both sides met in the decider again the following year. Carrigtwohill nearly pulled off a coup, however, the game ended in a draw. St. Finbarr's made no mistake in the replay and Ryng ended up on the losing side by 6-6 to 5-0. In 1935 Ryng was moved from the forwards to defence as Carrig qualified for another county final. After picking up a number of injuries in the semi-final as well as having Ryng suspended, Carrigtwohill sought a postponement of the game. Glen Rovers were agreeable to a two-week, however, the county board opposed any such move. As a result of this Carrigtwohill gave the Glen a walkover. Glen Rovers \\"eight in a row\\" includes this 1935 unplayed final which in effect was won in Cook Street, where the Cork County Board meetings were then held. However, six in a row is not bad!!!! Two years later Ryng played in a third championship decider with Glen Rovers providing the opposition. The game was an anti-climax as Carrig were defeated once again by 3-5 to 1-0. =Inter-county= Ryng first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of Cork's first minor hurling team in 1928. Cork claimed both the inaugural Munster Minor Hurling Championship and All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship titles that year. He was only fifteen years of age and he is still the youngest player ever to win an All-Ireland Minor medal. He went on to play for the unsuccessful Cork minors for the following three years. He won Munster College provincial medals in 1929 and 1930. In 1932 Ryng made his senior championship debut in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Waterford. He was promoted from the Cork Junior team of that year and at nineteen years of age was the youngest player on the senior side. He was a regular with Cork for the next nine years. However, Waterford and Limerick ruled the roost for most of that period. By 1939 Ryng was one of the more senior members of the team as Cork made a breakthrough in the provincial championship. A narrow 4-3 to 3-4 defeat of Limerick gave Cork the title and gave Ryng his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny. In one of the most iconic championship deciders of all-time, played on the day that World War II broke out, the climax of which was played in a ferocious thunder storm. Ryng roomed with Jack Lynch, a future Taoiseach, and in the early hours of Sunday they were woken with a terrible racket and they thought Dublin was being bombed. It was thunder and lightning. While a draw looked likely as the hour drew to a close Paddy Phelan sent a seventy-yard free in towards the Cork goalmouth. The sliotar was gobbled up by the defence and cleared, but only as far as Jimmy Kelly who sent it straight over the bar for a one-point lead. Immediately after the puck-out the referee blew the whistle and Cork were defeated on a score line of 2-7 to 3-3. Kilkenny have won seven All-Irelands' by a point, beating Cork in five. Cork only once beat Kilkenny in an All-Ireland Final by a point and that was in 1999. Although defeated in the All-Ireland decider, Cork continued their breakthrough in 1940. An 8-9 to 6-4 defeat of Tipperary in the decider gave Ryng his first National Hurling League medal. He added a second winners' medal to his collection in 1941 following a defeat of Dublin. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease severely hampered the 1941 championship. As a result of this Cork were nominated to represent the province in the All- Ireland series. Ryng was listed as a substitute for the final and came on against Dublin, however, it turned into a one-sided affair thanks to contributing goals from Johnny Quirke and Ted O'Sullivan. At the full-time whistle Cork had won by 5-11 to 0-6. It was one of the most one-sided championship deciders of all-time, however, it did give Ryng an All-Ireland medal. Bobby retired from inter-county hurling after this victory. Even though the 1941 programme shows his club as Carrigtwohill, he had transferred to his native Ballinacurra in 1940. In 1942 he captained Ballinacurra in their victory over Midleton to win the East Cork Junior Championship. Transport was scarce during the war years, scarce anyway, so the Ballinacurra team assembled at Midleton, where the Park Hotel now stands, how provocative!, and walked to the match at Cloyne. There were no hamstrings back then! He also played with Dr. Crokes, Killarney and Laune Rangers, Killorglin as his carpentry work with the railway brought him to these locations. Indeed, the history book, entitled \\"The Trail Blazers\\", which Laune Rangers launched in their 1988 centenary year includes a piece; \\"When Ring hurled with the Rangers\\". This was taken from a Puck Fair supplement of the Kerryman Newspaper but the accompanying photo shoes the \\"REAL RYNG\\" - BOBBY! He was also a noted footballer and played senior with Midleton and also, again because of his work, with Millstreet. In 1938 he was on the Millstreet team that lost to St. Nicks in the Cork County Senior Football Championship semi-final.

During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, one Munster medal and two National League medals. Campbell was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Campbell played with a variety of clubs including Midleton, Sarsfield's and St. Finbarr's. Playing career =Club= Campbell began his club hurling career with Midleton. After progressing from the minor grade he eventually joined the club's senior team, however, he enjoyed little success. In 1941 Campbell joined Sarsfield's, however, his tenure was brief and unsuccessful. Two years later Campbell was a key member of the St. Finbarr's senior hurling team. He lined out in his first senior championship decider that year as the Barr's faced Ballincollig. A 3-3 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, St. Finbarr's made no mistake in the replay and powered to a 7-9 to 1-1 victory.

He eventually left the panel after the 1944 championship. =Inter- provincial= Campbell also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. In 1940 he lined out in his first inter- provincial decider. A 4-9 to 5-4 defeat of fierce rivals Leinster gave Campbell his sole Railway Cup medal. Coaching career In retirement from playing Campbell maintained a keen interest in hurling and became involved in coaching and team selection. He was part of the Cork senior hurling selection committee for the successful 1970 season. Cork began the year by securing the National League title following an aggregate 5-21 to 6-16 defeat of New York. The subsequent championship campaign Campbell's Cork team secure the Munster crown as Tipperary were accounted for by 3-10 to 3-8. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition in the very first eighty-minute championship decider. The game saw a record 64-point score line for both teams as Cork's Eddie O'Brien scored a hat-trick of goals to give Cork a considerable lead.

In addition, land was confiscated from Salfit, Kifl Haris and Iskaka villages for Ariel. Marda Village Profile, ARIJ. p. 18 According to what the head of the village council told HRW: ‚ÄúWe used to have 10,000 animals, now you can barely find 100, because there is nowhere for them to graze. So the economy collapsed and unemployment increased.‚Äù He further noted, that as a result of the Israeli land confiscations, many of the Marda villagers now have little choice but to work in Israeli settlements.Occupation, Inc.

Hoebeke has been active in the Metaphorum community and fora on the viable system model (VSM).  Work  In his book Making Work Systems Better: A Practitioner's Reflections (1994) Luc Hoebeke, Making Work Systems Better: A Practitioner's Reflections, John Wiley & Sons, ,1994 he developed a work system model based on the insights of Peter Checkland and Brian Wilson in soft systems methodology, Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela's development of autopoiesis theory, and Stafford Beer's development of the viable system model. The notion of a work system is defined by Hoebeke as \\"... a purposeful definition of the real world in which people spend effort in more or less coherent activities for mutually influencing each other and their environment.\\" In the work systems model Hoebeke describes the generic transformation processes, control information, audit information and development information for human activities using four overlapping time domains: # Added-value domain: This domain spans periods between 1 day and 2 years in which processes are characterized by throughput time, volume requirements, quality requirements and price requirements. # Innovation domain: This domain spans periods between 1 and 10 years in which processes are characterized by desirability, feasibility, transferability and systemicity. # Value-systems domain: This domain spans periods between 5 and 20 years in which processes are generative, tolerant, dialectical and congruent. # Spiritual domain: This domain spans periods longer than 20 years, up to 50 years. The generic transformation process in this domain is: \\"To materialize through works of art or mere behaviour the universal understanding of one's own mortality\\". The notion of a transformation process is central in Hoebeke's work. Hoebeke defined it as \\"... a basic purpose behind the work system and transforms a specified input into a specified output. The output must contain the input, which has been transformed during the process.\\" The mentioned time domains (added-value, innovation, value-systems and spiritual) are overlapping. To handle this overlap Hoebeke uses the concept of process levels, of which there are seven to span the time between 1 day and 50 years. Process level is defined as: Hoebeke also defined the following concepts in terms not found in contemporary management literature: * Contributions of people * Responsibility and accountability * Clients, actors, owners (as stakeholders of the process) * Environmental constraints and Weltanschauung * The management process To complete the models' dimensions Hoebeke defined three information processes: * Strategic: All information processes that contribute to management, we call strategic information processes. These create, convey and develop meaning to all people involved in a work system. * Control: Control information processes are those which lead to a corrective, regulative action by the people contributing to transformation processes. * Audit: Audit information processes are those that lead actors to a more profound understanding of why the process is carried out, what it does, with what means it is performed and how these means are used.

John Basset (1462‚Äì1528) of Umberleigh (Barry wavy of six or and gules) impaling the arms of his wife, Honor Grenville (Gules, three clarions or). Honor Grenville (c. 1493‚Äì5Byrne, vol.1, p.305, Honor's birthdate estimated at 1493‚Äì5 ‚Äì 1566) was a Cornish lady whose domestic life from 1533 to 1540 during the reign of King Henry VIII is exceptionally well recorded, due to the survival of the Lisle Papers in the National Archives, the state archives of the United Kingdom. Origins Honor was a daughter of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513) of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, and lord of the manor of Bideford in North Devon, by his wife Isabella Gilbert, a daughter of Otes Gilbert (1417‚Äì1492) of ComptonVivian, p.405 in the parish of Marldon, Devon (whose effigy survives in Marldon ChurchPevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.562). Marriages and children She married twice: *Firstly to Sir John Basset (1462‚Äì1528) of Umberleigh in the parish of Atherington in Devon. At her father's death in 1492 Honor was his only daughter by his first wife (the heiress Alicia Mules/Moels) who was still unmarried, and in his will Sir Thomas Grenville requested: \\"I will that my sonne Roger shall mary my doughter Onor and to give her in marriage CCC markes in money to be levied of my lands and goods\\". His son Roger duly followed his father's instructions, and on 15 December 1515 he signed a deed of marriage settlement with his fellow North- Devonian, Sir John Basset of Umberleigh, for the marriage of his sister Honor,Byrne, vol.1, p.308 then aged about 20 or 22. Basset was a widower aged 53, and still lacking a son and heir. By John Basset she had children as follows, depicted as a row of small kneeling figures below her monumental brass in Atherington Church, Devon: **John Basset (1518‚Äì1541), eldest son and heir. **George Basset, born between 1522‚Äì25; **James Basset, born between 1526‚Äì27. **Philippa Basset, born 1516; **Katherine Basset, born 1517; **Anne Bassett, born 1521, reputedly a mistress of King Henry VIII.The Mistresses of Henry VIII by Kelly Hart, p.121‚Äì124 **Mary Basset, born between 1522‚Äì25; *Secondly (as his second wife) she married Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle (died 1542), later Lord deputy of Calais, an illegitimate son of King Edward IV and thus a half-brother of Queen Elizabeth of York and uncle of King Henry VIII. In Calais Honor was one of the ladies who attended Anne Boleyn when she travelled to Calais with Henry VIII in 1532. She moved permanently to Calais with her second husband in 1533 when he was appointed Lord deputy of Calais. They lived together at the Staple Inn in Calais until 1540, during which time she succeeded in forwarding the careers of her children, much assisted by her husband's agent in England John Husee. Her husband was arrested in 1540 whilst on recall to England, for alleged involvement in a plot to betray Calais, Henry VIII's cherished personal possession, to the French, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Although no evidence was ultimately found to implicate him and in 1542 he was due for release and pardon, he died in the Tower \\"at the sudden rapture\\",Granville, Roger, History of the Granville Family, Exeter, 1895, p.66 having heard the good news but before regaining his freedom. During this time Honor had been under house arrest in Calais with her daughters Mary and Philippa.Byrne, vol.6, p.149 The contemporary chronicler Elis Gruffydd described the event of 20 May 1540 thus:Byrne, vol.6, p.139, quoting Mostyn MS 158, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle translated from Welsh by Prys Morgan, folio 552 > That afternoon in the twilight Lord Sussex and the Council went to the > Staple Inn where Lady Lisle kept house. She, after the Council had conversed > a little with her, was put in prison in a room of the palace and the girls > were taken from her and put in prison in various places throughout the town. Lady Lisle was then taken on 1 June 1540 to the house of Francis Hall a Spear of Calais, where she remained under house arrest for two years.Byrne, vol.6, p.139 The Lisle household was broken up on 2 June and the Treasurer of Calais took possession of all the treasure and clothes of Lord and Lady Lisle in the King's name. It was at this time and place that the surviving Lisle Papers (see below) were seized by the state. The contents of the Staple Inn were minutely catalogued on their removal, with headings for gilt plate, plate parcel gilt, white plate, gold, jewels, and with goods (i.e. furnishings) listed for every room in the house.Byrne, vol.6, Appendix E, \\"Inventory of Lisle's Household Goods\\", pp.189‚Äì210 Rumours circulated that Honor herself was the real traitor who brought about her husband's downfall. It was said in the highly insular and Protestant fortress of Calais that she was planning to marry one of her daughters to a Catholic Frenchman, \\"a Picard squire\\",Byrne, vol.6, p.138‚Äì9 thus to an enemy of King Henry VIII, who at that time was convinced that the French were planning an assault on Calais.Byrne, vol.6, p.53 It was due to one of the Lisle's servants having travelled, secretly and without official permission, from Calais to Rome, to see the Pope supposedly in order to betray Calais to the French, that Lord Lisle was suspected of involvement in treason. This servant was a mischievous domestic chaplain named Gregory Botolf,Byrne, vol.6, Part 2, The Botolf Conspiracy, pp.53‚Äì121 like Honor of popish sympathy,Byrne, vol.6, p.54 nicknamed \\"Sir Gregory Sweet- Lips\\", who was said by evil rumour to be Honor's lover. Honor's daughter Mary Basset was in fact in receipt of love-letters from a young French aristocrat, Gabriel de Montmorency, Seigneur de Bours, who had proposed marriage to her,Byrne, vol.6, pp.140‚Äì1 and these she disposed of in the cess-pit. When they were found by Lord Sussex they added further to evidence of suspicious activity. Her husband's arrest was a great shock to her, and John Foxe, the Protestant martyrologist, stated in his Actes and Monuments that immediately on hearing the news she \\"fell distraught of mind and so continued many years after\\".Byrne, vol.6, p.153 Foxe had a dislike for Honor, whom he suspected as being a determined Catholic. Elis Gruffydd however reported that she lost her senses whilst imprisoned in Francis Hall's house at Calais and that he never heard if she ever completely recovered them.Byrne, vol.6, p.153, quoting Mostyn MS 158, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle translated from Welsh by Prys Morgan, folio 571b Return to England On 9 March 1542 the Privy Council ordered her release and this news, together with the news of her husband's release, is said by Elis Gruffydd to have reached her before the news of his death,Byrne, vol.6, p.257 quoting Mostyn MS 158, Elis Gruffydd's Chronicle translated from Welsh by Prys Morgan which \\"was the last ironic twist of the tragic screw\\" (Byrne).Byrne, Vol.6, p.257 She lived out the remaining 24 years of her life in retirement and obscurity, probably latterly at the Basset manor of Tehidy in the parish of Illogan in Cornwall, which in 1558 her grandson Arthur Basset (died 1586) conveyed to her for her life.Byrne, Vol.6, p.258 She died at Tehidy and was buried in Illogan Church on 30 April 1566.Byrne, Vol.6, p.258, quoting Illogan parish register Character Foxe disliked Honor, and stated of her: \\"The Lord Lisly albeit...himselfe of a most gentle nature, beeing fiercelie set on, and incessantlie intised by the wicked Lady Honor his wife, who was an utter enemie to God's honour, and in Idolatrie, hypocrisie and pride incomparably evill, since beeing dailie and hourelie thereunto incited and provoked by Sir Thomas Palmer Knight, and John Rookewood Esquire, too enemies to God's word, beginning nowe to flourish at Calice\\".Fox, Book of Martyrs, quoted by Granville, Roger, (Rector of Bideford), History of the Granville Family Traced Back to Rollo, First Duke of the Normans, With Pedigrees etc., Exeter, 1895, p.66 Lisle Letters Honor is notable for her surviving letters describing sixteenth-century court life, published as the Lisle Letters. These letters show her forceful personality and the influence she had over her husband, which was such that Thomas Cromwell himself felt obliged to write tactfully to Viscount Lisle pointing out that in matters of state a crown official could not simply do what his wife told him to. They also give insights into the administration of the manor of Umberleigh, and the negotiations with the Court of Augmentations, which led to the purchase by the Lisles of the former lands of the dissolved Frithelstock Priory.

The project provides aspiring writers to live in the house that Jack Kerouac lived in while writing his 1958 novel The Dharma Bums, rent free for 3 months. Kerouac lived in this home at the time On the Road (1957) made him a national sensation, and it was in this home that Kerouac wrote his follow-up, The Dharma Bums, over the course of eleven days and nights. The house represents a critical juncture in Kerouac‚Äôs life, when the success of On the Road provided him with nationwide critical acclaim and commercial success, and pushed him and the other members of the Beat Generation into the spotlight. The Kerouac House, as it has come to be known, is now a living, literary tribute to Kerouac. The house in Orlando, Florida where Kerouac lived and wrote The Dharma Bums and aspiring writers stay now. History The Kerouac Project began with a chance discovery by Bob Kealing, a reporter with the Orlando area NBC affiliate and freelance writer. In 1996 he learned that Jack Kerouac had been living in a c. 1920 Orlando cottage when his classic work On the Road was published to worldwide acclaim in 1957 and where he actually typed the original manuscript of his later novel, The Dharma Bums. The Project currently owns an editor's copy of this manuscript with Kerouac's hand written notes and it is retained at the Olin Library at Rollins College.News & Information for the Rollins Community \\"Dharma Bums Typescript Comes to Rollins\\", Rollins News Archives, December 9, 2011 In 2012, the house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.Blakeslee, Vanessa \\"Kerouac in the Sun\\", The Paris Review, July 30, 2013 The Kerouac House is currently a writer's residence, hosting four writers throughout the year. Each writer lives in the house alone for three months, and works on their personal writing projects. They also participate in local literary readings. Over time, the Project has counted on many generous benefactors to keep it going. According to an article in USA TODAY about the project, philanthropist Jeffrey Cole came to the rescue of the project to assist in buying the house. Darden Restaurants have continued to be a friend of the project as well. In 2007, two of the board members were able to form Shady Lane Press. Though this is not formally tied to the Project, it has been successful in printing writings of several of the former writers. In October 2008, several students from Full Sail University produced a video about the house and its history.

It was developed and operated by physicist Guy Savard and a collaboration of other scientists at Argonne, the University of Manitoba, McGill University, Texas A&M; University and the State University of New York. Development The CPT was originally built for the Tandem Accelerator Superconducting Cyclotron (TASCC) facility at Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada. However, it was transferred to Argonne National Laboratory when the TASCC accelerator was decommissioned in 1998 due to funding issues.sciencedirect The CPT spectrometer is designed to provide high- precision mass measurements of short-lived isotopes using radio-frequency (RF) fields. Accurate mass measurements of particular isotopes such as selenium-68 are important in the understanding of the detailed reaction mechanisms involved in the rapid-proton capture process, which occurs in astrophysical events like supernovae explosions and X-ray bursts. An X-ray burst is one possible site for the rp-process mechanism which involves the accretion of hydrogen and helium from one star onto the surface of its neutron star binary companion. Mass measurements are required as key inputs to network calculations used to describe this process in terms of the abundances of the nuclides produced, the light-curve profile of the X-ray bursts, and the energy produced. In the current configuration, more than 100 radioactive isotopes have been measured with half-lives much less than a second and with a precision (Œîm/m) approaching 10‚àí9. Recently, a novel injection system, the RF gas cooler, has been installed on the CPT to allow fast reaction products to be decelerated, thermalized and bunched for rapid and efficient injection. This enhances the investigative capabilities of the CPT on isotopes around the N=Z line with particular emphasis on isotopes of interest to low-energy tests of the electroweak interaction and the rp-process.

It existed from 1887 to 1938.  History  Bond of the Localbahn-AG, issued 12. March 1891 The company was founded on 9 February 1887 by the Lokomotivfabrik Krauss & Co. and the Lechner & Kr√ºzner Branch Line Construction and Operating Company (Lokalbahnbau- und Betriebsunternehmung Lechner & Kr√ºzner). Krauss brought with them the narrow gauge Feldabahn in Saxony-Weimar, which had been built in 1879/80, into the new company. The LAG rapidly grew into an important transportation organisation. From 1889 to 1891 alone their routes grew to a length of 430 kilometres. However this did not constitute a single network. The routes were built where tourism, mineral resources, industry, agriculture or forestry could anticipate a significant volume of traffic. The LAG had no preference for a particular system. There were steam and electrical operations, standard gauge and narrow gauge and both separate routes as well as the co-use of roads. These activities were complemented, at least for a while, with a rack railway, the Schafbergbahn, steamship operations on the Wolfgangsee and horse and motorised transport. The LAG proved to be extremely progressive with its introduction of electrical train operations. The W√ºrttemberg railway line from Meckenbeuren to Tettnang was the first electrically operated standard gauge railway in Germany (the planning of which Oskar von Miller, amongst others, took part). The Ammergaubahn from Murnau to Oberammergau, which was sold to the company, became the first single-phase AC line in Germany. Apart from its own routes in southern Germany the company owned the majority of shares in the Lausitz Railway Company (Lausitzer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and had a share in the Salzkammergut Lokalbahn AG and the Central Bank for Railway Stocks. The latter had, especially over the West Hungarian Lokalbahn-AG, influence on the numerous railway routes in Hungary with a total length of over 700 kilometers, which had been built by the LAG. During the First World War and the years following, the company had to combat major difficulties. The loss of the Hungarian routes hit their accounts especially hard. After overcoming inflation, things improved again, however the worldwide economic crisis as well as the increasing pressure of competition from road transport services brought the company to the brink of ruin at the beginning of the 1930s. With the loans from Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft, reductions in capital and write-offs by the states of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg, restoration to profitability was achieved again in 1934, however it only postponed the end. With effect from 1 August 1938 the entire assets transferred to the Deutsches Reich under a Reich law.

Its mission is to decrease the demand side of the international sex trade through legislation and enforcement while raising awareness utilizing mass media and grassroots outreach.RedLight Children Campaign ‚Äì Child Sexploitation: Expose It. Fight It. End It.  Changemakers Through its partnership with Priority Films, Redlight Children has recently launched the K11 Project‚Äîthree films which attempt to expose real life experiences of the underage sex trade. K11 consists of two documentaries and a feature-length narrative, Holly (film), which were all filmed on locations in Cambodia. Holly is currently being re-released in US cities.Priority Films History The Redlight Children Campaign was inspired by Guy Jacobson's personal experiences backpacking in Cambodia in 2002. While traveling in Phnom Penh, a group of young girls, some only five years old, began to aggressively solicit him for prostitution. Although he refused several times, they revealed to him that they would be beaten by the brothel owners if they returned empty-handed. After Jacobson gave them some money and left, he was motivated to create Redlight Children. Shortly thereafter, Jacobson decided to utilize mass media as a vehicle for social change through his film production company, Priority Films. He teamed up with Israeli actress Adi Ezroni to create the first phase of the Redlight Children Campaign, the K11 Project. They went undercover in Cambodian brothels using espionage equipment and secret cameras to research the plight of child trafficking victims. At one point, the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) contacted Jacobson to warn him to flee the country because the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Cambodian mafia had hits taken out on his life. Jacobson, Ezroni, and their team of filmmakers were also blackmailed and extorted for money, one of the producers was held hostage for two weeks when the rest of the team had left, and they had to hire bodyguards to protect themselves and their research. Jacobson's and Ezroni's work on the ground level provided the education and foundation for them to address the issue on a larger scale. After they established RedLight Children, they created a comprehensive legal manifesto of action items to decrease the demand of child sexual exploitation with the aid of a team of international lawyers. Jacobson and Ezroni have also been honored as Global Heroes by Condoleezza Rice in the Trafficking in Persons Report 2008.Trafficking in Persons Report  U.S. Department of State Video and Audio Manifesto The Redlight Children Campaign ultimately aims to globally decrease demand for child sex trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children by pressuring governments to enact or amend legislation to address the issue more effectively and allocate more resources towards enforcement of laws. The Redlight Children Campaign's main goals are to make it more difficult and costly for perpetrators to sexually abuse children, increase the likelihood of catching perpetrators, and make prosecution faster, easier, and more efficient. The Redlight Children Campaign Manifesto focuses on laws and enforcement efforts relating to Internet chat rooms, child pornography, sex tourism, and extraterritorial enforcement that it believes should be passed in every country in the world.http://www.redlightchildren.org/Redlight%20Manifesto.pdf Currently, Redlight Children is partnering with LexisNexis to create an international case law database for trafficking and a trafficking offenders database to assist lawmakers and prosecutors. Amongst Board members of Redlight Children is Robert Rigby-Hall who was the recipient of the 2010 Business Leaders Award Against Human Trafficking (United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking) The K11 Project The K11 Project consists of three films‚ÄîHolly, The Virgin Harvest, and the K11 Journey‚Äîcreated by Priority Films and Redlight Children to expose the underage sex trade in Cambodia. Holly is a feature-length narrative film written by Guy Jacobson. Filmed in Cambodia, it is based on the true stories of abducted children. It stars Ron Livingston, Virginie Ledoyan, Udo Kier, Chris Penn and Thuy Nguyen. The Virgin Harvest, directed by Charles Kiselyak, is an undercover documentary taking place in Cambodian brothels. It follows three young girls‚ÄîReena, Sokha, and Sereum‚Äîas they are sold into brothels, abused, and finally rescued. The K11 Journey is a documentary that follows the dangerous journey of the filmmakers as they make Holly. It exposes the corruption of the Cambodian government and police. Holly was launched at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, and later shown with the US State Department in Washington, D.C., in order to establish a political presence for the Redlight Children Campaign. With the nationwide release of Holly on November 9, 2007, Jacobson conducted television, radio, magazine, and print coverage, including articles/interviews in Glamour, The New York Times, the LA Times, and CNN.Holly - Movie - Review - The New York Times In addition to creating awareness, the film projects have helped local communities address trafficking. For example, AFISEP is featured as the shelter in Holly, and the Somaly Mam Foundation was featured at the UN. Jacobson organized the UN event/fundraiser for the Somaly Mam Foundation.

Instead, the five-story project was built surrounding her 108-year- old farmhouse, where she died at age 86 in 2008. In the process, she became something of a folk hero. After she died, Macefield willed her house to the new building's construction superintendent, Barry Martin, in gratitude for his friendship and caretaker role.

The dean of the college is Mary Lou Sole, PhD, RN, CCNS, CNL, FAAN, FCCM. According to U.S. News & World Report, UCF is among the most innovative college programs, with one of the best online graduate nursing programs in the state of Florida and among the top 25 programs for Veterans. History The Nursing Program at UCF was established in 1978, with the first class of undergraduate students enrolling in the fall of 1979. The inaugural class graduated in 1981 with their BSN degree. In 1982, the Nursing program received the designation, Department of Nursing. A satellite campus was opened at Cocoa in 1983. In 1986, the Department of Nursing moved to a larger space, including a larger laboratory, in the Health and Physics Building. The program's designation was changed to School of Nursing, within the College of Health and Public Affairs, in 1995. The same year, the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) program began in the fall. In 1998, UCF created the state's fully online RN to BSN program. The year 2003 saw the launch of the nursing PhD program. On July 1, 2007, the School of Nursing became the College of Nursing, UCF's twelfth college, to recognize its growth and stature. The following year, UCF Foundation established the Knightingale Society for alumni and friends of the college who provide annual contributions of $1,000 or more. In 2010, the College of Nursing moved to its current location in the University Tower building within Central Florida Research Park, adjacent to the main campus of UCF. Starting in 2014, the program was recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of the nation's best online graduate programs, being ranked No. 24. In 2015, the College of Nursing launched the state's first online PhD program for nurse scientists. =Future= The college plans to move to a new building on the UCF Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona by the end of the decade, enabling a closer partnership with the College of Medicine. Nursing program According to the UCF College of Nursing website, \\"The mission of the College of Nursing at the University of Central Florida is to prepare nurse leaders and patient advocates through excellence in education, research and service.\\" Its values are listed as: Excellence, Innovation, Integrity, Compassion, Service, and Community. About 3,000 students are enrolled in the UCF College of Nursing. The GPA of admitted students ranges from 3.42 to 4.0. Many students complete their nursing education through a partnership between UCF, Seminole State, and Valencia. Students earn an ASN degree from either Seminole or Valencia after 5 semesters, which also contributes five semesters' worth of coursework to a BSN through UCF. The NCLEX licensing exam is taken upon earning the ASN degree, in order to obtain an RN license. Students then transfer to UCF for two more semesters to complete the BSN degree.

Charlie Bailey (February 11, 1916 in Happy Valley, Tennessee, near Rogersville ‚Äì March 12, 2004 in Bear, Delaware) began his musical career in 1936. His brother, Danny Bailey (December 1, 1919, Happy Valley, Tennessee ‚Äì March 22, 2004, Knoxville, Tennessee), teamed up with him in 1940, and the brothers began making frequent appearances on Tennessee radio stations in the Knoxville area. Danny formed the Happy Valley Boys after Charlie joined the military in 1941. In 1944 the Happy Valley Boys relocated to Nashville, where they became members of the Grand Ole Opry, and also made regular appearances on WSM radio in Nashville. At that time, Danny was the youngest person to ever perform on the Grand Ole Opry.Hillbilly-Music; dawt.com. When Charlie returned from his military service in 1946 the brothers were reunited as a duo but only stayed in Nashville briefly before returning to radio work in Knoxville.title; Oldies.com.The Bailey brothers came from a musical family and began playing music early in their lives. Charlie displayed a desire to pursue music very early in his life buying his first guitar for $1.75. Their parents had hoped that Danny would become a doctor but sensing that the pull toward music was stronger, they encouraged Danny to join his brother who had already begun making a name for himself musically. The Bailey Brothers and the Happy Valley Boys members included from 1949: Charles Bailey on mandolin, guitar, vocals; Daniel Bailey playing guitar, vocals; Carl Bailey on guitar; and E.P. Tullock on bass. Other members had included (from 1946): L.E. White, fiddle; Wiley Birchfield, banjo; Ray Brewster, guitar and mandolin; Willie Brewster, vocals, guitar, and mandolin; Cotton Gaylon, Hawaiian guitar; and Larry Mathis, banjo. George Shuffler also played bass with the group for a time. =Career= A 1946 article gives us a few more tidbits about the Bailey Brothers, then Charlie and Danny and the rest of the Happy Valley Boys. The author of the article Juanita Milligan tells readers that she had seen the band at a packed house in the Maryville Armory. By that time, they had been on WSM for a couple of years. But had moved to WCHS in Charleston, WV where they were doing a daily morning show at 5:30am. Playing with the Bailey Brothers at that performance was Ruhl Kelly, who had worked with Roy Rogers in Hollywood. = Obituary = Charles Bailey and his brother Dan, better known as The Bailey Brothers, performed on WSM's Grand Ole Opry during the early days of bluegrass and attained near legendary status in such locales as WNOX Knoxville, Tennessee, WPTF Raleigh, North Carolina and WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia. They are considered by some to be among the most influential and significant artists in early bluegrass history. It was The Bailey Brothers who brought their tight, close harmony style singing into bluegrass and merged the two forms. With the addition of their Happy Valley Boys, The Bailey Brothers were the first well-known brother duet to introduce the beautiful harmonies characteristic of early brother duets into the full bluegrass group. They also collected, arranged and popularized numerous songs, many of them now bluegrass standards, which were brought to wide public attention later by other groups. Songs made popular by The Bailey Brothers have been recorded by Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Flatt and Scruggs, among others. Many well-known country musicians either got their start with The Bailey Brothers or worked with them early in their career, including Tennessee Ernie Ford, Tater Tate, Buck Graves, Carl Butler, and the Osborne Brothers. Although their contribution to the roots of bluegrass has been recognized by the Smithsonian and music historians, commercial fame eluded the talented, innovative Bailey Brothers. As Rounder Records noted on their \\"Have You Forgotten The Bailey Brothers\\" release, \\"That music and musicians of this calibre could be overlooked for so long is a cultural tragedy which we hope this record will remedy.

The dean of the college is Bahaa E. A. Saleh, Ph.D. In 2004, UCF's Board of Trustees voted to give UCF's School of Optics and Photonics full college status, making it the first college dedicated specifically to optics and photonics at a public university in the United States. Until 2013, it was the only college at UCF that did not offer an undergraduate program, offering only Masters and Doctoral degrees in Optics. In March 2013, the Board of Trustees approved the Bachelor of Science in Photonic Science and Engineering. The college houses the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL), the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE), and the Townes Laser Institute. Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers The Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL) is a research center within the Orlando, Florida- based College of Optics and Photonics (COP), which itself includes undergraduate coursework and is a graduate college for optical science and engineering at the University of Central Florida. =History= The idea for a research center dedicated to optics that would support the growth of Florida's high-tech industry began with the formation of the Florida High Technology and Industry Council (FHTIC) in the mid-1980s. In a FHTIC report, Ron Phillips of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Central Florida (UCF) recommended that the state take action to \\"form the Center for Research in Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL) to provide Florida's high-tech industries with access to research, students, and faculty in advanced areas of optical and laser sciences.\\" Following the recommendation, the Florida legislature approved the use of $1.5M in permanent, recurring funds to UCF for the support of CREOL. In 1987, the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers has been established.https://www.creol.ucf.edu/the-college/ MJ Soileau began work as the center's first director in January, 1987. He was joined by North Texas State University colleagues Eric Van Stryland and David Hagan. Van Stryland and Hagan would later serve as Dean and Associate Dean, respectively. Timeline: *The Center is founded - 1986 *CREOL building construction starts - 1994 *CREOL building ready for move-in - early 1996 *School of Optics is established - 1999 *The Florida Photonics Center of Excellence is created - 2003 *The School of Optics becomes the College of Optics and Photonics - 2004 *Bachelor of Science in Photonic Science and Engineering is approved - 2013 *ABET accredits the Bachelor of Science in Photonic Science and Engineering - 2017 =Academics= Since its founding in 1986, CREOL has conferred a total of over 220 PhD and over 330 MS degree. The faculty have published 27 books and authored over 1900 journal articles which have been cited over 26,800 times. As of 2012, the college has 120 enrolled graduate students, 54 research scientists and postdoctoral fellows, and 51 joint, visiting, and full-time faculty. CREOL research activities cover all aspects of optics, photonics, and lasers. On March 21, 2013, the UCF Board of Trustees voted to approve a Bachelor of Science in Photonic Science and Engineering. Until this time, the college only offered Masters and Doctoral Degrees. This program became possible after a collaborative effort between the College of Optics and Photonics and UCF's College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS). Students who graduate with this degree are awarded a single degree from both COP and CECS and are therefore alumni of both colleges. While other colleges and universities offer tracks or engineering technology degrees, UCF is the only institution in the state of Florida to offer a photonics engineering bachelor's degree and one of only seven in the nation. =Events= The College of Optics and Photonics hosts several events each year some of which are annual events, while others are those of special recognition. Special Events: * March 2012: CREOL marked its 25th anniversary with a celebration and technical symposium with over 330 attendees, including 3 Nobel Laureates: John Hall, Nicolaas Bloembergen, and Charles Townes. * May 2012, 2014: CREOL is involved in the Science Olympiad National Tournament, hosted by the UCF that brings 7500 student participants and parents to the campus for the annual competition. UCF is the only site to host two tournaments in a three-year time span since the formation of Science Olympiad in 1984. Annual Events: * March: Industrial Affiliates Day - In cooperation with the CREOL Industrial Affiliates, partners and students are involved in a technical symposium and lab tours. * April: CAOS, a student group in CREOL, hosts Optics Day which opens research labs and special demonstrations for the public and the campus. Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) The Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) is a research center within the Orlando, Florida-based College of Optics and Photonics, which itself includes undergraduate coursework and is a graduate college for optical science and engineering at the University of Central Florida. The FPCE was established in 2003 with a $10 million grant from the State of Florida to create a new center of excellence within The College of Optics and Photonics. The focus of the FPCE research and education work is on the technologies of nanophotonics, biophotonics, advanced imaging and 3D displays, and ultra-high bandwidth communications, all of which have forecasts of rapid market growth. Work at the center has resulted in the creation of 31 jobs, and in the filing of 40 patents, of which 14 were issued. As well, the financial return on the $10 million state grant totals over $30 million. Townes Laser Institute The Townes Laser Institute was dedicated in 2007 in the presence of, and honoring Charles Townes, 1964 Nobel Laureate in Physics and the inventor of the concept of the laser. Associated with CREOL, the College of Optics and Photonics and the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) it is funded by the State of Florida to develop the next generation of laser light engines for applications in medicine, advanced manufacturing and defense applications. Some $4.5M was allocated in 2006 to the Townes Laser Institute for major facilities, and in addition, the President and Provost of UCF allocated five new faculty positions to support the Institute. This investment complements existing strengths in laser development and laser-based technologies at UCF, in ultra-fast laser technologies, laser materials processing, novel optics for high power lasers, fiber laser development, laser-based sensing, laser-plasma EUV sources, and other related topics.

In May 1989 Wells helped the Boise State University Broncos to their first Track and field Big Sky Conference title in 22 years. He competed at the Olympic Games in 1996 and 2000 and the World Championships in 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001 without reaching the finals. His personal best time was 10.18 seconds, achieved at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. Wells also co-holds the Bahamian national record in the 4 x 100 metres relay, achieved with teammates Dominic Demeritte, Iram Lewis and Andrew Tynes. Wells in 1994 ran one of the fastest times ever recorded under any conditions in the 200 metersCommonwealth All-Time Lists (Men) Wells was coached From 1996 to 2001 by the famed coach Steve Riddick in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  Early life  Renward Ricardo Wells was born in Nassau, Bahamas. His parents William Wells and Leoma Flowers were never married. In 1971 at age one, Wells went to live with his father's parents in Deadman's Cay on Long Island, Bahamas. He left in 1973 and was sent to live with his mother's parents on the Island of South Andros in the settlement of Driggs' Hill. At that time in The Bahamas, neither of those islands possessed electrical installations or modern sewage systems, so Wells grew up in spartan conditions assisting his grandfather, Bertram Flowers, fishing and grandmother, Natalee Flowers with subsistence agriculture farming. In December 1979, he was reunited with his mother and her husband- Yorick Smith in Freeport, Bahamas on the island of Grand Bahama.  Education  Wells attended Driggs Hill All Age School, Bartlette Hill Primary School, Eight Mile Rock High School and RM Bailey Senior High School. He was an active student leader, avid reader and athlete. He graduated at the top of his class in 1987 in the science stream and was elected by students and teachers to be school President. With the aid of an athletic scholarships in 1988, Wells attended Boise State University in Idaho. Wells left Boise State in May 1989 for an athletic scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles, U.C.L.A. However, Boise State refused to sign his release letter required for transfer by the NCAA, so Wells had to sit out an entire year before he was able to attend UCLA. In June 1992, Wells again made another university switch leaving UCLA to attend, on an athletic scholarship, Oral Roberts University. While at Oral Roberts, he began dating Sarah Adermann. Sarah competed in the high jump event for the Oral Roberts University's track team. Renward and Sarah married in June 1993. Wells graduated from Oral Roberts in 1995 with a Bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. While at Oral Roberts, Wells taught himself to play the guitar and has written a number of messianic Christian worship songs. In September 1998, Wells enrolled in Regent University Law School and Divinity School. He left Regent University in December 2000 and moved to his wife's hometown Coon Rapids, Minnesota, to concentrate on his growing family.  Post athletic career  In September 2003, Renward moved back to The Bahamas and began working for The Government of The Bahamas in the Ministry of Works and Transport as a mechanical engineer. Since returning home to The Bahamas, he has become politically active, discussing and debating many social issues and has become a member of the Executive Steering Committee of the National Development Party (NDP), a political party he was instrumental in helping to form in 2008. He became the deputy chairman of the executive steering committee in October 2009 and chairman on 5 April 2010. The NDP was the first party in The Bahamas to allow every member of the party the right to vote for the leadership team and officers of the party. The NDP held a nationally televised debate between the nominees for the leadership on 17 November 2010. On 29 November 2010, Wells was elected the first leader of the National Development Party at the party's first convention. In 2011, however, he was one of several NDP members who defected to the Progressive Liberal Party, following a schism in the party as the new Democratic National Alliance began drawing away some of the NDP's support.\\"The Rise & Fall of The NDP Part 3 ‚Äì The Final Betrayal\\". Straight Talk Bahamas. Wells was elected to the Parliament of The Bahamas as a PLP member in the 2012 election for the Constituency of Bamboo Town. In the Four way election(Renward Wells PLP, Cassius Stuart FNM, Branville Mccartney DNA, Craig Butler IN) Wells won with 39.2% of the overall vote. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Works & Urban Development. Wells broke with PLP in 2015 by crossing the Floor in Parliament to join the then opposition party, The Free National Movement, The FNM. Wells Ran as a candidate for the Free National Movement for the Bamboo Town Constituency in the May 10th 2017 General Elections and won overwhelmingly with 54% of the vote. On May 15, 2017 Well was named the Minister of Agriculture and Marine Resources in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hubert Minnis. Wells was also appointed by the Prime Minister as the Leader of Government Business in The Parliament. On July 4, 2018, Wells was appointed as the Minister Of Transport and Local Government. Wells is married to Sarah Wells and the couple have six children; Sethren, Sasha, Sierra, Soren, Soraya and Sakarren. Sarah is a stay- at-home mom and the Wells' children are all homeschooled.

History The idea for La Recouvrance was originally conceived in 1990. She was modeled on the plans for Iris, which was designed by the French naval engineer Hubert in 1817. Originally, there had been five vessels built from Iris design, and these ships were employed in the early nineteenth century as courier vessels for the Navy. Eventually, their role was expanded to include surveillance and protection of merchant shipping off the African and West Indian coasts. The proposal for a replica vessel was taken up by several public and private interests in Brest, which formed Goelette la Recouvrance organisation to oversee the project. Construction on the ship began in 1991, and employed both volunteer and paid labour. The partially completed La Recouvrance was launched at the Brest '92 maritime festival, and her rig was completed a year later. In 1996, management of the vessel was transferred to SOPAB Brest. Career La Recouvrance sails regularly from Brest, offering day sails for up to 25 passengers and overnight sails for up to 12.

The band currently consists of lead vocalist Matt Shultz, rhythm guitarist Brad Shultz, lead guitarist Nick Bockrath, guitarist and keyboardist Matthan Minster, bassist Daniel Tichenor, and drummer Jared Champion. Lincoln Parish served as the band's lead guitarist from their formation in 2006 until December 2013, when he left on good terms to pursue a career in producing. The band's first album, Cage the Elephant, was released in 2008 to much success, spawning several successful radio singles and gained the band a large following in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It was influenced by classic rock, funk, and blues music. The band's second album, Thank You, Happy Birthday, was heavily influenced by punk rock as well as bands such as Pixies and Nirvana. The band's third album, Melophobia, was the band's concerted effort to find its own distinct musical identity. Cage the Elephant's fourth album, Tell Me I'm Pretty, produced by Dan Auerbach, was released on December 18, 2015. The band released a live album, Unpeeled, on July 28, 2017.

In an interview with the \\"Rock It Out!\\" blog for Consequence of Sound, he said he felt like if he did not quit that job, he would be stuck there for the rest of his life. He left to work at a sandwich bar with Brad Shultz, who had previously worked in telemarketing. Daniel Tichenor held a job at Lowe's and Jared Champion worked in a pet store. Nick Bockrath is part of the band Nicos Gun and previously played bass with Morning Teleportation. Cage got to know him through their friendship with that band. Matthan Minster formed a band called YOURS in 2010. =Formation and name= Members of Cage the Elephant had previously been involved in the band Perfect Confusion when they were in high school and released a self-titled LP in 2005. Matt Shultz was also in an experimental punk band in middle school called Left Nostril. The band's name, according to lead singer Matt Shultz, came from an incident in 2006 when a mentally disturbed man approached the band after a show. He hugged Shultz and kept repeating the sentence \\"You have to cage the elephant\\" over and over again. =Early years and Cage the Elephant (2007‚Äì10)= Matt Shultz performing at the Barfly in London, England in 2008 Brad Shultz at the Barfly in 2008 The band signed with Relentless Records after showcasing at the 2007 South by Southwest music festival. Their first tour was as a support act for Queens of the Stone Age in Canada. They then moved to London, England, to the Leyton area on the outskirts of the city.

Their single \\"Ain't No Rest for the Wicked\\" reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart and was featured in the Gearbox Software video game Borderlands, as well as in the 2010 movie The Bounty Hunter. It was also featured as ITunes' free single of the week for the week of April 12, 2009.

Melophobia was released on October 8, 2013, to largely positive reviews. Shultz mentions in an interview with Billboard that Melophobia is not a fear of music, rather, \\"It's a fear of creating music under false pretenses, catering to cool, or writing to project some sort of image that's based upon social standards...[It's] trying to sound artistic, poetic or intellectual, rather than just trying to communicate an honest thought or feeling or story.\\"\\"Take It or Leave It\\" and \\"Cigarette Daydreams\\" were released on March 24, 2014 and August 26, 2014, respectively. The band toured with Muse as an opening act in the fall of 2013. On August 24, 2013, the band performed Melophobia in its entirety live at Soundcheck Nashville in front of an intimate audience of friends and family. The band also performed the songs \\"Spiderhead\\" and \\"Come A Little Closer\\" live on Los Angeles radio station KROQ. Lincoln Parish left the band early in December 2013 to focus on his production company, TalkBoxRodeo. In an interview, Parrish said that he \\"wanted to be a producer before anything else. And then [Cage the Elephant] obviously took off and did more than what any of us could have expected.\\" Guitarist Nick Bockrath filled in as lead guitarist on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on December 9 and, on subsequent shows. The Melophobia tour continued into 2014, including a stop at the Lollapalooza music festival on August 3.

The band said they \\"just wanted to experiment with sounds. While you start experimenting with sound and you get out there a little bit, away from the norm, I think people will see that as psychedelic.\\" This project reached farther then their usual work. The album's first single, \\"Mess Around\\", was first performed by the band on October 29, 2015. The band posted on Twitter stating that the song was inspired by the band Outkast and The Black Keys. The band then released their second single from the album, \\"Trouble.\\" To promote the album, \\"Too Late To Say Goodbye\\" was put out to the public before the band released the full album. The woman pictured on the cover of the album is model Rachel Sykes. In an interview, lead singer Matt Shultz said \\"When I looked at her, she was immediately beautiful to the eye but also there was some sense that she'd lived some real life in a way that I could relate to...\\" He then continued to say that she looked as if she had been \\"touched\\" and he was delighted to see how she acted in real life, when she was not being photographed or on camera. The album earned the band's first Grammy Award. =Social Cues (2018‚Äìpresent)= On November 26, 2018, the band announced on Twitter that their new album was \\"Done. Mixed.

Lee, starring Francis Lederer and Ida Lupino, and featuring Hugh Herbert, Roland Young and Erik Rhodes. It also marked the last film appearance by actress Florence Lawrence, who died in 1938, who had an uncredited bit role in the film. It was written by Stephen Morehouse Avery, with additional dialogue by Maurice Hanline, from the screenplay for the 1935 French film Monsieur Sans-G√™ne by Emeric Pressburger and Ren√© Pujol, which was based on the story \\"The Satyr\\" by Pressburger.TCM Notes The film was reissued in 1948 as Matinee Scandal. Plot On a rainy afternoon in Paris, debonair actor Philippe Martin (Francis Lederer) goes to a darkened movie theatre for a romantic assignation with his married mistress, Yvonne (Liev De Maigret), but sits in the wrong seat and kisses instead lovely Monique Pelerin (Ida Lupino), the daughter of a powerful publisher (Joseph Cawthorn). Monique, who is engaged to powerful Count Alfredo Donstelli (Erik Rhodes), makes a public accusation against Philippe, and the priggish head of the Purity League (Eily Malyon) exploits the incident until it becomes a national scandal, with Philippe dubbed \\"The Kissing Monster\\". When Philippe is tried, his defense is that he was overcome by Monique's beauty, and that it is a Frenchman's nature to be romantic, even to perfect strangers. His punishment is to spend just three days in jail, but when he is released, he discovers that Monique has paid his fine, supposedly to avoid more publicity, but actually because she is secretly attracted to him. Meanwhile, the tabloids have made Philippe into a national hero, and instead of his producer, Maillot (Roland Young), firing the actor, he gets a raise. His new show will have him re-enact the kissing incident, but on the day of the opening Monique's father has him arrested, only be released when Yvonne, who turns out to be the wife of the Minister of Justice, convinces him to allow Philippe to do his performance, where Philippe learns that Monique has taken the place of the actress with whom he was to re- enact the kiss.TCM Full synopsisErickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)Crawford, Rod. film profile, IMDb.com Cast Songs *\\"One Rainy Afternoon\\" - by Ralph Erwin (music) and Jack Stern (lyrics) *\\"Secret Rendezvous\\" - by Ralph Erwin (music) and Preston Sturges (lyrics)TCM Music Production One Rainy Afternoon was the first of a small number of United Artists sound films which were produced by its vice-president, Mary Pickford, and the first film for Pickford-Lasky Productions.

Criticizing director Rowland Lee as \\"giv[ing] a useful demonstration of how not to direct this kind of story\\", and characterizing Lederer's acting as \\"embarrassing\\", Greene found that at least for Lupino's contribution to the film \\"she is one of the more agreeable screen dummies to whom things are made to happen\\".

The preceptory was founded at Godsfield but was moved soon after the Black Death. Foundation Land in Godsfield, Hampshire was first granted to the Hospitallers by Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester in the time of King John and in 1207 further land there was given by Adam de Port. There were further grants of land in Preston Candover and Child Candover. It is not known when a preceptory was first formed, but it was prior to 1304. 12th to 16th centuries By 1355 the preceptory had moved to Baddesley, although it was still sometimes called Godsfield. The establishment was small with only the Preceptor a chaplain and four servants. They held managed land and buildings in several places in Hampshire, including Godsfield, Baddesley, Rownham and the former Knights Templar possessions at Temple. Dissolution The Valor of 1535 lists the annual value of the preceptory as ¬£131 14s. 1d.. It was suppressed in 1540 and the lands were granted first to Sir Thomas Seymour, and later, in 1551, to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. Present day The 14th century chapel and priest's house at Godsfield survive. Nothing remains of the preceptory at North Baddesley, the site being occupied by the 18th century Baddesley Manor.

Born in Paris in 1949, he attended the 'Beaux-Arts' in Paris and worked, in particular, in the 'Atelier Yankel' from 1968 to 1971. He currently works either in Paris or in the Sarthe region, mostly with acrylic paint (though he has also worked with china ink), his style is abstract. Thibaut de Reimpr√© belongs to the second generation of the French School of abstract painting after the second World War. His work fits, more precisely, in the Lyrical Abstraction school of thought, which is also promoted by painters such as Michelle Destarac and Pierre C√©lice. His work can be seen frequently, both in public events and in art galleries, on the occasion of the three or four personal exhibits each year, within or outside France, as well as in multi-author events or in international shows (no less than 165 since 1970). Didier Decoin, Member of the Acad√©mie Goncourt, describes the work of Thibaut de Reimpr√© as follows (2): > Reimpr√©'s carnal world - that is, his social circle of friends and lovers - > is wrought with such tenderness, consideration, attentiveness, distinction > and enchantment. There is a man, one says to oneself, who must love maples > in autumn, the acidulous mixed borders of springtime, the velvety dance of > the chamois, and Satie's so attractively sarcastic arpeggios. Conversely, > his pictorial world is such a seism, his painting crashing down in such hot > lava, telluric blazes, stellar fusions, Amazonian humus, and Pompeian > concretions that one wonders if Thibaut de Reimpr√© might not be hostage to > uncontrollable forces. Yet he is not. He is the master of these forces - > their shepherd and their diviner.

The manga was serialized in Bunkasha's adult magazine Pent-Japan Special, and released in two bound volumes by Jive. The manga has been licensed for distribution in North America by Media Blasters, in Germany by Panini, and in France by Delcourt.  Character backgrounds  ;Nene: Nene is a cute, well-endowed girl raised from a rich family and was spoiled as a child, but she doesn't let her looks or her affluency affect her personality. The daughter of a successful banker, she has no trouble attracting people due to her good looks and her friendly personality. Although she makes male friends easily and has many of them, she has difficulty trusting men outside of relationships due to an experience when she asked an upperclassman to view her sketches. Instead of viewing the work that she had invested her time into creating, her upperclassman ignored them and came onto her. She explains that although she had planned to have sex with him during their time together, she really wanted her work to be viewed, analyzed and possibly appreciated. :Nene is outwardly needier than Jun and has a great need for human contact. She tends to be laid-back and never really seeks perfection accepting anything that barely meets her line of standards; due to this personality trait, she has difficulty overcoming her problems and often needs the support of someone else (mostly, if not always, Jun) to get through them. She expresses her individuality through designing and making clothes. Nene's initial desire for making clothes came from the fact that she originally had trouble finding clothes that fit her due to her large boobs. She attends university classes regularly, but may fall asleep in them due to her low stamina. Her low stamina may also be the reason why she enjoys eating. Nene seeks solace within Jun due to her strong personality and independence, qualities she feels that she lacks and might not ever have. :Nene's feelings about sex are relatively simple. She enjoys having it since it feels right and it's a way for her to temporarily forget about her troubles and issues. This ties in with the fact that she needs someone else to help her get through whatever is bothering her. ;Jun: Jun is the youngest child of a family with two boys and three girls. Because she was the youngest of a relatively large family, her father was a salaryman and she was often picked on by both her siblings and her peers, she started to gain an independent, cocky and self-assured personality. She often told herself, \\"The idiots are just jealous because I'm a genius.\\" Jun began smoking, attending nightclubs and having sex at a young age since it made her feel more like an artist and gave her a sense of self-worth. Although some of the activities she engaged in would be considered \\"degrading\\" by most, she feels that as long as doing those activities gives her that sense of self- worth she would continue to do them. Like Nene, she has difficulty trusting people, but unlike Nene, this includes both men and women because she never really had anyone to confide in. Jun will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain the image of what she sees an artist should be. :As mentioned above, Jun is very independent and self-assured, meaning that she has much less doubt than Nene. However, due to her fear of ridicule and failure, she's very nitpicky and will agonize over the smallest of details. She has university classes as well, but she doesn't really attend them due to both her lack of interest in attending and the fact that she is a late sleeper. She spends most of her time either hanging out with Nene, other friends or visiting clubs. Jun is relatively thin because she smokes, drinks coffee regularly and doesn't eat properly (she doesn't care what she eats as long as it fills her up and she has a penchant for junk food). She admires Nene due to her passion about making clothes and the fact that she can take her greatest shortcomings, use them as her greatest asset and come off as an optimist at the same time. :Jun's feelings about sex are also relatively straightforward. While she enjoys the pleasure it brings and the mood it sets, she enjoys the fact that she can have the control of making someone else feel more good. Her first sexual encounter also made her feel more like an artist than anything else to that point. Manga Reception A scanlation of the series was reviewed by The Comics Journal in 2006. Eros Comix did not license it because Eros felt that Maka-Maka did not get explicit enough early in the work. Erica Friedman of Yuricon affirms that \\"Love Sex Communication\\" is a \\"major theme\\" throughout the manga, though also criticized the male characters in the manga as all being \\"raging asshole[s]\\". She has praised the English translations and production of the English volumes. Nicholas Demay felt that the inclusion of the sex scenes was organic, arising logically from the experiences of Nene and Jun, but criticised the shiny, latex-like appearance of the girls' skin and the use of screentone as backgrounds. Jason Thompson described it as \\"a rare pleasure\\", contrasting it to other yuri about \\"12-year-old girls holding hands\\" and to other manga depicting \\"adult relationships\\" which portrayed \\"either emotionally heavy angst or extra-drippy porn\\".

Murder, trial and incarceration Bruce Miller was found dead at his junkyard in Flint, Michigan on November 8, 1999, killed by a .20 gauge shotgun. After Sharee was arrested in February 2000, she was held without bail until her trial. On December 12, 2000, the trial began and her case made national headlines. According to the prosecution, Sharee wanted Bruce dead for his money and that a divorce would not have given her enough. After two days of deliberation, on December 22, the jury found Sharee Miller guilty on all charges. On Jan. 29, 2001, Genesee County Circuit Court Judge Judith Fullerton sentenced Miller to life in prison for the conspiracy to commit murder charge, and 54 to 81 years for second-degree murder. She served part of her term at the Robert Scott Correctional Facility in Plymouth, Michigan and as of 2019, was serving a life sentence at the Women's Huron Valley Correctional Facility in Ypsilanti, Michigan.Michigan Department of Corrections Her mother currently has custody of one of her three children.‚ÄúMich. v.

She also claimed that she wanted to give back to the people she had selfishly taken from. In August 2008, a federal court judge overturned her conviction and ordered that she receive a new trial. The judge found that the suicide note from Cassaday (her boyfriend and the one who committed the homicide) should never have been admitted into court and seen by the jurors because Cassaday was dead and could not be cross examined.http://www.crimapp.com/files/miller%20v%20stovall.pdf On July 16, 2009, a federal court judge ordered Sharee Miller's immediate release from prison on bond pending the new trial which was ordered in August 2008.http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/local&id;=6918262 In response, on July 17, 2009, Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton ordered that Miller immediately be re-arrested from prison where she was taken to the Genesee County Jail and held without bond to await new charges.http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/local&id;=6920614 Sharee Miller was arraigned on July 22, 2009 again on charges of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit premeditated first-degree murder.

Miller's lawyer David Nickola said that there was no reason for his client to be barred from using a computer, but Sharee's Facebook page was temporarily deactivated when it attracted publicity. \\"I don't think there's anything inappropriate about it,\\" Nickola said. He states that Sharee used Facebook to keep in touch with her family members and her son who is overseas in the military. \\"She's an innocent person out in society and she's doing positive things,\\" Nickola said. \\"Having a Facebook page to communicate with her son who is serving in the military overseas is nothing inappropriate whatsoever.\\" While having a Facebook page is not a violation of Miller's bond, Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said this is a perfect example of why people need to be careful when they're online. \\"People have to be careful when they're communicating with others who they don't know on the Internet,\\" Leyton said.http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/convicted_killer_sharee_miller_2.html \\"Convicted killer Sharee Miller back on Facebook\\" mlive.com On June 21, 2010, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the August 2008 federal ruling that the Cassaday suicide note was not admissible.

On February 16, 2012, the Sixth Circuit remanded the case to the District Court. On Aug. 2, 2012, the District Court entered its opinion and ordered reinstatement of Miller's convictions and revoked her bond. The court held the suicide note possessed sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to satisfy defendant's constitutional right of confrontation. It also found that the Michigan Court of Appeals' factual determination, that the statements were spontaneous, voluntary, made to Cassaday's parents, and less likely to be fabricated because he was about to kill himself, were reasonable findings.

Starring Nichola Burley, Sian Breckin, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris, it follows a group of English people on holiday in Spain who end up fighting for their lives. Plot While on a holiday in Mallorca, Lisa, Kim, and Tammi meet four young men, Bluey, Josh, Sean, and Marcus. After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht, where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \\"donkey punch\\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man. Marcus, Bluey, Kim, and Lisa go to the master bedrooms, where they begin having drug-fuelled sex. They are watched by Josh who, known to all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then decides to let Josh take a turn. Josh and Lisa then have anal sex. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a knife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender. However, the girls soon realise that the tender's outboard motor is missing (a cut scene shows it still attached to the yacht). In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a flare, attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women. As the men attempt to get the women aboard, threatening them with a shotgun, Kim shoots a second flare directly at Marcus. The flare explodes into Marcus's torso and slowly burns him to death. Josh locks the recaptured women in one of the rooms below. Sean asks Josh to \\"call in\\" and request medical assistance for Bluey. However, knowing that Bluey still has the tape that contains footage of him dealing the earlier fatal blow, Josh instead decides to discover its whereabouts by torturing Bluey. He does this by withholding pain numbing drugs from him. Bluey reveals the location of the tape, beneath the bed in the state room. Tammi escapes the room by smashing through the glass door and cutting herself, and overhears Bluey mention where the tape is. She frantically roams the boat trying to locate it. She does this just moments before Josh attempts to retrieve it. Unable to find the tape, Josh returns to Bluey, stepping up the torture by turning his attention to the knife which still protrudes from the wound. Josh ultimately takes this too far and, following Bluey's pained protestations that he has already revealed the location, he twists the knife further into the wound before pulling it out, causing Bluey to die. Sean tries to bring the situation under control by retrieving a shotgun from Josh. He then tries to calm both Josh and Tammi from a frantic argument about the whereabouts of the tape. Kim notices Sean holding a shotgun with Josh and Tammi visibly upset from an adjacent room. She misinterprets his intentions towards Tammi and Josh, and brutally kills Sean with the propeller of an outboard motor. After realizing her mistake, she manically commits suicide by jumping overboard, leaving Josh and Tammi as the only ones left. A distraught Tammi decides that she cannot remain on the boat any longer. Josh agrees, and readies the tender. His plan is to leave the yacht, get back to shore and claim that there was an accident. As Josh pushes the tender away from the yacht, Tammi quietly takes hold of the end of the mooring rope at the stern. Once the tender has floated some distance from the yacht, Josh pulls his hunting knife from his shorts and points it at Tammi. He demands the incriminating tape from Tammi and, fearing for her life, she obliges, throwing it on the floor of the tender. As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a distress flare in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly stares up at the night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.

He stated he was inspired by Sam Peckinpah, Roman Polanski, Straw Dogs, Rosemary's Baby, George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and John Carpenter. The Philadelphia Inquirer compared Blackburn's work to films including filmmaker Peter Berg‚Äôs Very Bad Things and director Phillip Noyce‚Äôs Dead Calm. The Los Angeles Times additionally compared Blackburn‚Äôs work to Dead Calm as well as director Roman Polanski‚Äôs Knife in the Water. The A.V. Club observed that the movie appeared similar to Knife In The Water and Dead Calm, but with actors similar to those from The Real World. The San Diego Union-Tribune characterized it as a slasher film. Rex Reed of The New York Observer likened the plot of the film to And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. =Development= Filmmaker Olly Blackburn directed Donkey Punch, which he co-wrote with David Bloom. He explained that he was in the offices of production company Warp X discussing television options with company co- founder Robin Gutch when he first thought to make a movie about the topic. He and David Bloom discussed the idea and concept with Warp X management and successfully convinced them to go ahead with the film. His total budget for the film was ¬£1 million. In an interview with Total Film, Blackburn commented, \\"I think Donkey Punch is an extreme thriller or an extreme reality-based thriller. The whole point of the film is it‚Äôs grounded in reality.\\" Blackburn wrote that he made Donkey Punch, \\"to try to push the genre.\\" =Filming= Blackburn's production team went through a casting process which took seven months; the film stars Nichola Burley, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris. Donkey Punch was greenlit by Warp X in February 2007. Blackburn chose to look at filming locations in the Southern Hemisphere owing to greater availability of sunlight that time of year. Film shooting for Donkey Punch began in March 2007. Blackburn shot the film in South Africa, over 24 days. Blackburn decided upon South Africa because of its cost benefit, its support for the movie production, and the availability of skilled film technicians. Cinematography was handled by Nanu Segal. During production Blackburn had to deal with actors afflicted by hypothermia and tidal surges on location. Soundtrack The soundtrack album for Donkey Punch was made available on July 28, 2008, by Warp. The first disc is a compilation of remixes and original tracks performed by various artists, and the second disc is dedicated to composer Fran√ßois-Eudes Chanfrault's score for the film. { width=70%  } Release =Theatrical run= Donkey Punch had its world premiere at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. It was featured among the non-competition titles. The film was Blackburn's first work to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received a positive reception from the audience in attendance. It was subsequently shown at film festivals in Seattle, Washington, and Austin, Texas. The Austin American-Statesman recommended it among the \\"10 Must-See Movies\\" at Fantastic Fest. It was promoted at Fantastic Fest with a \\"'Donkey Punch' Boat Party\\" in honor of the film featuring a screening followed by festivities aboard a ship at Lady Bird Lake. Donkey Punch was featured in 2008 at the 62nd Edinburgh International Film Festival, where it competed for the Michael Powell Award. It was a featured selection at the Sitges Film Festival, and the Melbourne International Film Festival. =Critical reception= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 50% approval rating with an average rating of 5.5/10 based on 51 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Donkey Punch begins as a promising thriller, but loses credibility while adhering too closely to genre conventions.\\" It received a score of 43 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Guardian described it as \\"expertly made and painfully tense; a bracing cold snap blowing in off the ocean.\\" The film failed to stir up much controversy in the British press. Elsewhere in the British press The Times called the film \\"a notable achievement in all departments, handled superbly by its first-time director and largely unknown cast, with a tight, frighteningly plausible script. ... Donkey Punch has a respect for formula but, more importantly, a commitment to doing things differently, and properly. A scary, truly edgy film.\\" Stephen Holden's review in The New York Times said \\"There is no transcendent agent of evil; the enemy is within ... the movie remains above the typical splatter ‚Äôn‚Äô scream fest. These careless hedonists are convincing, and the ensemble acting feels believable.\\" Aintitcool's Harry Knowles said \\"Damn I fucking loved it.\\" Rex Reed wrote a review of Donkey Punch for The New York Observer and called it a \\"slaughterfest\\" and \\"the newest footnote in the history of pretty-girls-in- peril pictures\\". Wesley Morris reviewed the film for The Boston Globe, and commented, \\"The naughtiness turns nasty, the nastiness turns fatal, and the kids gradually turn against each other. ... And the alive-to-dead pecking order is strictly a horror film convention: The soberer and more virginal you are the better your chances.\\" Lou Lumenick gave the film two stars in a review for the New York Post and observed, \\"You could call Donkey Punch, ... a female revenge movie. But you could just as easily characterize it as fairly well- executed exploitation.\\" Writing in the New York Press, Eric Kohn said \\"Such a unique thrill. Director Blackburn develops the scenario with remarkably shrewd finesse and builds to a satisfying spectacle.\\" The Village Voice called it \\"A Knife in the Water for the era of Ugly Briton, package tour imperialism.\\" In a review which graded Donkey Punch a \\"B\\", the Boston Herald called the film \\"dirty, nasty fun\\", while criticising its lack of originality. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \\"Donkey Punch offers a gripping mix of sexual heat and nasty menace.\\" The Los Angeles Times concluded, Donkey Punch isn't without a certain power as it gleefully turns its careless hedonists into caged, paranoid rats.\\" The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of C+ and wrote that the director, \\"sustains a tense mood of mistrust, sexual rivalry, and shifting alliances\\", but lamented that \\"the film goes off the rails in the final third, sacrificing subtle character work at the altar of blood-and-guts survival horror. As mood-killers go, it's like a jab to the back of the neck.\\" The Philadelphia Weekly review called the film \\"an odious little potboiler\\". Long Beach Press-Telegram called the film a predictable thriller. A review in The San Diego Union-Tribune concluded, \\"What began as a fairly interesting girls-gone-wild picture becomes just another gorefest with lingering close-ups of wounds and knives being extracted.\\" Though the San Francisco Chronicle called Donkey Punch an \\"interesting but flawed indie thriller\\", it determined the final act was \\"annoyingly routine\\". Contra Costa Times gave the film a grade of \\"C\\" and described it as unoriginal suspense. The Seattle Times called Donkey Punch a \\"lurid thriller\\", and was critical of its plot progression towards the middle of the film. The Kitsap Sun described the film as \\"a nasty, dirty little movie\\". Though lamenting the predictability of the film's plot, the review offered an instruction for potential viewers, \\"Prediction isn‚Äôt the point, because you know the final score‚Äôs going to be 1. The point is to just sit back, if you‚Äôre so disposed and not easily offended, and gleefully watch all the nasty, dirty little business go down.\\" =Home media= Donkey Punch was released on DVD on 10 November 2008.

The combination is then glued (sometimes with two-sided tape) onto a specially designed rim, referred to as a \\"sprint rim\\" in Britain, and just a \\"tubular rim\\" in the US, of a bicycle wheel. Tubular tyres require more labour to repair a puncture than clincher tyres (wired‚Äìon in Britain). The tyre must be removed from the rim, opened up, patched, sewn back up, then finally glued back to the rim. Clinchers have largely replaced tubulars for amateur racing (although they have seen a revival due to the carbon rim being better suited to tubular design), but tubulars are still commonly used for indoor track racing (where the closed track makes punctures from road debris less commonplace), professional road racing, road time trials, and cyclo-cross racing. The resulting combination was either slightly lighter or stronger than more common clincher tyres until the clincher tyres and rims technology caught up in recent years. Taken as a whole the total weight of a tubular rim and tyre is always lighter than its clincher equivalent. However, for all non-racing purposes the lightness advantage is somewhat offset by the need to carry at least one entire spare tubular tyre (only a patch kit or inner tube are needed if using clincher tyres). Yet the extra weight‚Äîand more importantly, rotational inertia‚Äîis off the wheel, which therefore accelerates more easily. Advances in tire sealant have made carrying an extra tire a bit outdated. Other advantages of this system include a decreased chance of pinch flats, an ability to operate with a wider range of tyre pressures (from 25 to 200 psi), and increased safety in the event of a flat at high speed because a properly glued on tubular tyre is less likely to roll off the rim. A further advantage is that because a tubular tyre is an inner tube within the outer tyre casing, it is a \\"closed system,\\" meaning in the event of a flat the air typically escapes far less quickly than with a clincher. For this reason tubulars are generally regarded as safer to ride than clinchers on fast mountain descents. Conversely, they are also regarded as being less safe on long or fast descents, because the heat generated by braking can cause the glue holding the tire to the rim to fail, or the tire to explode. Tubular tyres are fitted with Presta valves. A tubeless tubular, with an integrated airtight liner instead of a separate inner tube, was introduced in 2009.

Built from 1839 to 1842 by Bishop Leonidas Polk, it was an active church in the Antebellum South. It was ransacked and later used as a hospital for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War of 1861-1865. Services resumed after the war, but they were discontinued due to low attendance in 1915. It is now closed, except for an annual pilgrimage. Location The church is located six miles southwest of Columbia, Tennessee. History The land belonged to Colonel William Polk. One of his sons, Leonidas Polk, served as the rector of St. John's Episcopal Church, which was based in his own house, Ashwood Hall, from January 1, 1834 to August 9, 1838. Due to poor health, he was assisted in his ministry by James Hervey Otey. In 1839, Leonidas Polk decided to erect the church building. It was built where once stood a tall cherry tree, which was felled and used to make wood structures inside the churches such as the balcony or the reredos. The building was designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style. It was modelled after a church in Devon, England, as well as the Chapel of the Cross in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Built by African slaves owned by Polk and his brothers, it was completed in the summer of 1842. It was consecrated on September 4, 1842. The first permanent pastor, Stephen Patterson, was installed in July 1845. The congregation included both whites and blacks. A new rector, E. H. Cressy, was installed in 1848. The church bell was only placed in the tower as late as 1849. By 1858, James Hildebrand became the new rector. Mary Elizabeth Martin, Gideon Johnson Pillow's wife, and their son, attended services. On March 31, 1862, in the midst of the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Union Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell broke into the church building and ransacked it, breaking the window glasses. By 1864, it was converted into a hospital for the Confederate States Army. Days before the Battle of Franklin of November 30, 1864, General Patrick Cleburne (1828‚Äì1864) was passing by St. John's and he remarked to his aides something like, \\"This is such a beautiful church that it would almost be worth dying so one could be buried here.\\" Meanwhile, Leonidas Polk was buried in a crypt inside the church in 1864. In 1872, Richard N. Newell, a former Roman Catholic from England, became the new rector. However, services were discontinued in 1915 due to low attendance. In 1945, upon request from the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana, Leonidas Polk's remains were taken from the church and he was re-buried at the Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana. No longer an operating church, it is only used once annually for services. The attached graveyard is the burial site of four Episcopal Bishops of Tennessee. Heritage significance It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1970.

She married Alfonso P. Romero, a native of Northern New Mexico in 1987. Together they have one son, Zachary Louis William, who was born in 1989 Romero has a daughter named Holly Marie from a previous relationship. After living in Santa Fe for eight years, Virginia and her husband moved to Las Cruces in the early 1990s. Romero is one of only a few non-Hispanic artists to master traditional New Mexican santero techniques. Romero's vocation as a santera was the result of personal crisis. Following her mother's death on 28 December 1998 at age of eighty-two,Social Security Death Index, [Database on-line,] Ancestry.com, (accessed 20 August 2010). the artist began to make devotional retablos, eventually learning how to paint with natural pigments on pine panels with recipes for paints, gesso, and pi√±on varnish that master santero Charlie Carrillo wrote out for her on small pieces of paper, which Romero still has. Romero's studies of the Crucified Christ are examples of contemporary expressions of a traditional genre of New Mexican folk art. She also reproduces her paintings on ceramic tile. Brother Richard Hirbe of the Friars of the Sick Poor of Los Angeles, California, discovered Romero's tiles at a gallery in Santa Fe and purchased several to affix to the front, back, and sides of the altar in the Motherhouse of the Friars of the Sick Poor.Br. Richard Hirbe to Luis E. Cruz, [Long Beach], 31 March 2009, copy of email in author's possession. Cardinal William Joseph Levada, Prefect of the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, was in Long Beach on a pastoral visit to the motherhouse and during Mass commented on the tiles, especially the one of Our Lady of Czestochowa, a piece inspired by Romero's Polish ancestors. The friars gave the tile to Cardinal Levada as a parting gift, and he said that he would give it to Pope Benedict XVI because Our Lady of Czestochowa was the patron saint of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Subsequently Brother Hirbe contacted the artist and related these events to her.\\"A Message from the Vatican,\\" Las Cruces Sun-News, 23 July 2010; and Br.

Reverend Richard Catanach, rector of the Basilica of San Albino, commissioned santera Romero to create a retablo representing the church, to which Pope Benedict XVI, through the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, granted minor basilica status in 2008.Jason Gibbs, \\"Mesilla's historic San Albino elevated to basilica status,\\" Las Cruces Sun-News, 27 June 2008. This retablo is on permanent exhibit at the Basilica. In addition to her retablos, Romero also produces traditional New Mexican bultos. Her bulto of San Isidro is carried in procession each year on 15 May, the D√≠a de San Isidro Labrador (the Day of Saint Isidore the Farmer), when the Bishop of Las Cruces performs the blessing of the fields at the New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum. The natural world also provides inspiration for Romero's work, particularly her newer work. This has also led her to incorporate images of wildlife in her religious painting. In this way she uniquely combines traditional New Mexican techniques and motifs with a very contemporary look. She is drawn to wolves, and there are many examples of her artwork that focus on these and other desert creatures. Romero was asked to create a commemorative tile for the Senator Pete V. Domenici Public Policy Conference, an event begun in 2008 and held annually at New Mexico State University.Gary Carruthers, To all who appreciate excellent art, Las Cruces, 27 October 2009, copy in author's possession. Commenting on the tile entitled \\"Mary Walks in Harmony,\\" Romero stated that this piece of artwork was inspired by respect for the unlimited force and beauty of nature, of which we are all part. The use of symbolic imagery represents diversity, unity, and faith in each other and in our ability to contribute responsibly towards the coexistence of all living things. The hawk represents a messenger, the wolf represents a teacher, the turtle represents the earth and patience, and the woman represents birth and renewal. This piece also represents embracing the mystery of the unknown. Among the collections that include Romero's artwork are those of: Basilica di San Marino al Monte, Florence, Italy; Cardinal William Levada; the Friars of the Sick Poor of Los Angeles, Long Beach, California; Holy Cross Retreat, Las Cruces, New Mexico; Maria Stein Heritage Museum/National Marian Shrine of the Holy Relics, Maria Stein, Ohio; Monte Olivito Maggiore, (outside Siena), Italy; El Museo Cultural de Santa Fe, Santa Fe, New Mexico; New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum, Las Cruces, New Mexico; Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine and Parish, Mesilla Park, New Mexico; Pope Benedict XVI; San Albino Basilica, Mesilla, New Mexico; San Miguel Mission, Santa Fe, New Mexico; Santa Francesca Romana, Rome, Italy.Virginia Maria Romero, Resume, Las Cruces, 2010, copy in author's possession. Romero's art has been featured in dozens of gallery exhibits in Santa Fe and Las Cruces from 1997 to the present. Three major solo exhibitions have featured Romero: Black/White & Beyond at the Branigan Cultural Center in Las Cruces, Retablo, Metamorphosis, Vision: Art of Virginia Maria Romero at the New Mexico Farm & Ranch Heritage Museum from April through August 2009 and Retablos‚ÄîA Cultural Legacy: Original Artwork by Virginia Maria Romero at the Abrazos Gallery at the Chamizal National Memorial in El Paso, Texas, from 14 August through 23 October 2010.Toni S.

Romero is also an award-winning poet, having published two books of poetry, The Turtle Called my Name (Tortuga Press, 2005) and Under the Raven's Wing: Voices from Two Worlds with Hector Telles (Tortuga Press, 2005). She collaborated on Shalanitawu, a book of art and poetry with the late renowned poet, Keith Wilson, which remains in search of a publisher.

Early life and education Pike grew up in Lubec, Maine, a small fishing village in the northeastern portion of the state. He was a Bowdoin College graduate, in the year 1913. Business career Pike entered the sardines industry and became a self-made millionaire. He then went to Wall Street in 1928 where he became an investment banker. He retired from business in 1939. Securities and Exchange Commission After retiring, Pike came to Washington, D.C. and served as an advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. During World War II he was on the Securities and Exchange Commission and also was in the Office of Price Administration. Atomic Energy Commission Pike (far right) with the other original members of the AEC, c. 1947 Pike was chosen as one of the five original members of the Atomic Energy Commission created by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union in August 1949 came earlier than expected by Americans, and over the next several months there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful hydrogen bomb, then known as \\"the Super\\".Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 1‚Äì2. In November 1949, Pike joined a 3‚Äì2 majority of commissioners in recommending against proceeding with the Super.Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 404. However by the time President Harry S. Truman ordered that development of the Super go on, Pike's position had drifted to being in favor of proceeding.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 62. Another issue Pike faced on the AEC was whether to allowed nuclear testing in the United States. In March 1949, he had stated that only a national emergency could justify such testing; but following the onset of the Korean War, it was considered that such an emergency existed and nuclear bomb testing began in Nevada in 1951.Hewlett and Duncan, Atomic Shield, p. 535. In 1950, the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of Congress voted five to four (with one Democrat joining the four Republicans on the panel) not to approve of President Harry S. Truman's nomination of Pike as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, when he was acting as Chairman. Instead, though Pike was renominated and approved as a member, Truman picked Gordon Dean as Chairman. When Pike resigned from the AEC in December 1951, he was the last of the original five members still on it.Hewlett and Duncan, Atomic Shield, p. 588.

Known as Ashot III the Merciful (‘±’∑’∏’ø ‘≥. ’à’≤’∏÷Ä’¥’°’Æ) and acknowledged by foreign rulers as the Shahanshah (king of kings) of Mets Hayk' (Greater Armenia), he moved his royal seat of residence to Ani and oversaw its development and of the kingdom as a whole. Armenia reached the height of its golden era during his reign and that of his sons and successors, Smbat II (977‚Äì89) and Gagik I (990‚Äì1020).Garso√Øan, Nina G.

Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 164ff.  Reign  During the first year of his reign Ashot launched a military assault to free the city of Dvin from Muslim rule, an undertaking that ultimately ended in failure. Despite this setback, he took steps to centralize power in the kingdom, patronizing the Armenian Church in exchange for its support.Aram Ter-Ghevondyan (1976), The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia, trans. Nina G. Garso√Øan. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, pp. 95-96. During his reign Catholicos Anania I Mokats'i moved his patriarchal seat to Argina, near the city of Ani. In 961 Ani was proclaimed the capital of the kingdom, and Ashot set himself to enriching and expanding the city. Ashot constructed a wall enclosing Ani and that would later take its name after him, and sponsored the building of monasteries, hospitals, schools, and almshouses. His consort, Queen Khosrovanuysh, meanwhile sponsored the construction of the churches in Sanahin and Haghpat. Arakelyan, Babken N.

Tsatur Aghayan et al. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 52-57. In the war between the Byzantine emperor John Tzimiskes and the Arabs, Armenia did its best to remain neutral and forced the two battling parties to respect the boundaries of its country. The Byzantine army began to march across the plain of Mush, thinking to strike the decisive blow against the Arabs from Armenia, but when they met with the 30,000-strong army of Ashot III, they altered their plan and left Armenia. Ashot instead provided Tzimiskes with 10,000 soldiers, who accompanied his men in their campaign in Mesopotamia. Scholars have suggested that he was buried either in Ani or at the nearby Horomos monastic complex. =Sub-kingdoms= A new phenomenon that began under Ashot III's reign, and continued under his successors, was the establishment of sub- kingdoms throughout Bagratuni Armenia. Ashot III had sent his brother Mushegh I to rule in Kars (Vanand) and had allowed him to use the title of king. The administrative district of Dzoraget near Lake Sevan was given to Ashot's son Gurgen, the progenitor of the Kyurikid line, in 966, who would later assume the title of king. The proliferation of so many kingdoms worked to the benefit of Armenia so long as the king in Ani remained strong and maintained his hegemony over other kings. Otherwise, the kings, as well their respective bishops who would claim the position of catholicos and formulate their own doctrines, would begin to test the limits of their autonomy.Garso√Øan, \\"The Independent Kingdoms of Medieval Armenia,\\" p. 166.
