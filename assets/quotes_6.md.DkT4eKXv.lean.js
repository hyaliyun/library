It is analogous to conventional fluorescence, which is defined as the emission of a photon (unit of light) by an excited electron in an atom or molecule. In the case of IGE, nuclear isomers can store significant amounts of excitation energy for times long enough for them to serve as nuclear fluorescent materials. There are over 800 known nuclear isomers but almost all are too intrinsically radioactive to be considered for applications. there were two proposed nuclear isomers that appeared to be physically capable of IGE fluorescence in safe arrangements: tantalum-180m and hafnium-178m2. History Energetics of IGE from 115In. Arrows are photons, (up) absorption, (down) emission. Horizontal lines represent excited states of In involved in IGE.Induced gamma emission is an example of interdisciplinary research bordering on both nuclear physics and quantum electronics. Viewed as a nuclear reaction it would belong to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation. It is a class usually overlooked in traditional discussions. In 1939 Pontecorvo and Lazard reported the first example of this type of reaction. Indium was the target and in modern terminology describing nuclear reactions it would be written 115In(Œ≥,Œ≥')115mIn. The product nuclide carries an \\"m\\" to denote that it has a long enough half life (4.5 h in this case) to qualify as being a nuclear isomer. That is what made the experiment possible in 1939 because the researchers had hours to remove the products from the irradiating environment and then to study them in a more appropriate location. With projectile photons, momentum and energy can be conserved only if the incident photon, X-ray or gamma, has precisely the energy corresponding to the difference in energy between the initial state of the target nucleus and some excited state that is not too different in terms of quantum properties such as spin. There is no threshold behavior and the incident projectile disappears and its energy is transferred into internal excitation of the target nucleus. It is a resonant process that is uncommon in nuclear reactions but normal in the excitation of fluorescence at the atomic level. Only as recently as 1988 was the resonant nature of this type of reaction finally proven. Such resonant reactions are more readily described by the formalities of atomic fluorescence and further development was facilitated by an interdisciplinary approach of IGE. There is little conceptual difference in an IGE experiment when the target is a nuclear isomer. Such a reaction as mX(Œ≥,Œ≥')X where mX is one of the five candidates listed above, is only different because there are lower energy states for the product nuclide to enter after the reaction than there were at the start. Practical difficulties arise from the need to ensure safety from the spontaneous radioactive decay of nuclear isomers in quantities sufficient for experimentation. Lifetimes must be long enough that doses from the spontaneous decay from the targets always remain within safe limits. In 1988 Collins and coworkers reported the first excitation of IGE from a nuclear isomer. They excited fluorescence from the nuclear isomer tantalum-180m with x-rays produced by an external beam radiotherapy linac. Results were surprising and considered to be controversial until the resonant states excited in the target were identified. Distinctive features *If an incident photon is absorbed by an initial state of a target nucleus, that nucleus will be raised to a more energetic state of excitation. If that state can radiate its energy only during a transition back to the initial state, the result is a scattering process as seen in the schematic figure. That is not an example of IGE. *If an incident photon is absorbed by an initial state of a target nucleus, that nucleus will be raised to a more energetic state of excitation. If there is a nonzero probability that sometimes that state will start a cascade of transitions as shown in the schematic, that state has been called a \\"gateway state\\" or \\"trigger level\\" or \\"intermediate state\\". One or more fluorescent photons are emitted, often with different delays after the initial absorption and the process is an example of IGE. *If the initial state of the target nucleus is its ground (lowest energy) state, then the fluorescent photons will have less energy than that of the incident photon (as seen in the schematic figure). Since the scattering channel is usually the strongest, it can \\"blind\\" the instruments being used to detect the fluorescence and early experiments preferred to study IGE by pulsing the source of incident photons while detectors were gated off and then concentrating upon any delayed photons of fluorescence when the instruments could be safely turned back on. *If the initial state of the target nucleus is a nuclear isomer (starting with more energy than the ground) it can also support IGE. However, in that case the schematic diagram is not simply the example seen for 115In but read from right to left with the arrows turned the other way. Such a \\"reversal\\" would require simultaneous (to within <0.25 ns) absorption of two incident photons of different energies to get from the 4 h isomer back up to the \\"gateway state\\". Usually the study of IGE from a ground state to an isomer of the same nucleus teaches little about how the same isomer would perform if used as the initial state for IGE. In order to support IGE an energy for an incident photon would have to be found that would \\"match\\" the energy needed to reach some other gateway state not shown in the schematic that could launch its own cascade down to the ground state. *If the target is a nuclear isomer storing a considerable amount of energy then IGE might produce a cascade that contains a transition that emits a photon with more energy than that of the incident photon. This would be the nuclear analog of upconversion in laser physics. *If the target is a nuclear isomer storing a considerable amount of energy then IGE might produce a cascade through a pair of excited states whose lifetimes are \\"inverted\\" so that in a collection of such nuclei, population would build up in the longer lived upper level while emptying rapidly from the shorter lived lower member of the pair. The resulting inversion of population might support some form of coherent emission analogous to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in laser physics. If the physical dimensions of the collection of target isomer nuclei were long and thin, then a form of gamma-ray laser might result. Potential applications =Energy-specific dosimeters= Since the IGE from ground state nuclei requires the absorption of very specific photon energies to produce delayed fluorescent photons that are easily counted, there is the possibility to construct energy-specific dosimeters by combining several different nuclides. This was demonstrated for the calibration of the radiation spectrum from the DNA-PITHON pulsed nuclear simulator. Such a dosimeter could be useful in radiation therapy where X-ray beams may contain many energies. Since photons of different energies deposit their effects at different depths in the tissue being treated, it could help calibrate how much of the total dose would be deposited in the actual target volume. =Aircraft power= hafnium crystalline bar In February 2003, the non-peer reviewed New Scientist wrote about the possibility of an IGE-powered airplane, a variant on nuclear propulsion.Nuclear-powered drone aircraft on drawing board - 19 February 2003 - New Scientist The idea was to utilize 178m2Hf (presumably due to its high energy to weight ratio) which would be triggered to release gamma rays that would heat air in a chamber for jet propulsion. This power source is described as a \\"quantum nucleonic reactor\\", although it is not clear if this name exists only in reference to the New Scientist article. =Nuclear weaponry= It is partly this theoretical density that has made the entire IGE field so controversial. It has been suggested that the materials might be constructed to allow all of the stored energy to be released very quickly in a \\"burst\\". The possible energy release of the gammas alone would make IGE a potential high power \\"explosive\\" on its own, or a potential radiological weapon. Fusion bomb ignition The density of gammas produced in this reaction would be high enough that it might allow them to be used to compress the fusion fuel of a fusion bomb. If this turns out to be the case, it might allow a fusion bomb to be constructed with no fissile material inside (i.e. a pure fusion weapon); it is the control of the fissile material and the means for making it that underlies most attempts to stop nuclear proliferation.

According to another definition, an ethnolect is any speech variety (language, dialect, subdialect) associated with a specific ethnic group. It may be a distinguishing mark of social identity, both within the group and for outsiders. The term combines the concepts of an ethnic group and dialect. The term was first used to describe the monolingual English of descendants of European immigrants in Buffalo, New York. The term ethnolect in North American sociolinguistics has traditionally been used to describe the English of ethnic immigrant groups from non-English speaking locales. Linguistically, the ethnolect is marked by substrate influence from the L1, a result of the transition from bilingualism to English monolingualism. Overview The idea of an ethnolect relates to linguistic variation and to ethnic identity. According to Joshua Fishman, a sociologist of language, the processes of language standardization and nationalism in modern societies make links between language and ethnicity salient to users. Ethnicity can affect linguistic variation in ways that reflect a social dimension of language usage. The way in which ethnic groups interact with one another shapes their usage of language. Ethnolects are characterized by salient features that distinguish them as different from the standard variety of the language spoken by native speakers of the particular language. These features can either be related to the ethnolect‚Äôs lexical, syntactic, phonetic and/or prosodic features. Such linguistic difference may be important as social markers for a particular ethnic group. Types of ethnolects Ethnolect varieties can be further subdivided into two types. One type is characteristic of a specific group, where a majority language currently used by speakers is influenced in terms of lexicon, grammar, phonology and prosody by a minority language associated with their ethnic group but is no longer in active use. Examples include Jewish American English, previous German Australian English and African American Vernacular English. The other type, is called a multiethnolect, because several minority groups use it collectively to express their minority status and/or as a reaction to that status to upgrade it. In some cases, members of the dominant (ethnic) group, especially young people, share it with the ethnic minorities in a 'language crossing' situation to express a new kind of group identity. Examples include , Multicultural London English and Singapore English. Purpose =Establishing identities= Using ethnolects allow speakers to define their social position, and helps them construct their identity. Subscribing to language features commonly associated with a particular ethnic group works to either affiliate or distance themselves from a particular ethnic group. Establishing an ethnic identity through language is not necessarily singular. Studies have found speakers who have melded linguistic features of separate communities together in order to create a mixed ethnic identity. African Americans in rural western North Carolina have been found to adopt both local pronunciation and AAVE vocabulary in their speech. Second-generation Italian Canadians in Toronto have been recorded to participate in a vowel shift that resembles both Italian and Canadian pronunciations. = Facilitating communication = Ethnolects can also serve a communicative purpose in the intergenerational context. Common in new migrant families of non-english language background, ethnolects can be used by the younger generation to communicate with their elders. This usage of ethnolects may be concurrent or in replacement of the community language.Speakers have been found to believe that the use the ethnolect eases communication with the older generations. The use of ethnolect may also address bilingual communication in the home, where there is a discontinuity in the language that parents and their children use. Children whose first language are different may pick up terms from their parents‚Äô ethnolect. The two varieties in this case can symbolize a speaker‚Äôs multiple identity. Examples Listed below are a few examples of ethnolects, with several linguistic features they display highlighted. These distinguished linguistic features are present in areas such as phonetics, grammar, syntax and lexicon. They are usually brought about by influence of another language - the mother tongue of its speakers. =Chicano English (Mexican ethnolect)= Example 1 Chicano English, or Mexican-American English, refers to the ethnolect spoken primarily by Mexican Americans. Chicano English developed as a result of immigration into the United States in the 20th Century. Some features of Chicano English include: ::*Lexical ::**Borrowing - Anglicised Spanish words :::::Your mother is planching. :::::Planching has been anglicised from the Spanish word ‚Äúplanchando‚Äù meaning ‚Äúironing‚Äù. ::*Prosodic ::**Prosody that is similar to the syllable-timed Spanish ::*Phonological ::**Vowel contraction - Chicano English is more monophthongal than American English, especially in monosyllabic words. =African American Vernacular English (African-American ethnolect)= Example 2 African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is one of most researched and salient ethnic varieties of English. It generally refers to the ethnolect primarily spoken by working or middle-class African-Americans in more informal conversations. Some prevalent features of AAVE include: ::*Phonological ::**The de-voicing of word-final consonants /b/, /d/, /g/ ::::: cub may sound similar to \\"cup\\" :::*Metathesis in lexical items ::::: aks for \\"ask\\" :::::graps for \\"grasp\\" ::*Syntactical ::**An optional tense system that differs from the tense-marking system in English ::::: He been done work meaning \\"he finished work a long time ago\\". ::::: He done been work meaning ‚Äúuntil recently, he worked over a long period of time\\". :::*Negative concord, also known as \\"double negation\\" :::::I didn't go nowhere meaning \\"I didn‚Äôt go anywhere\\" ::::: If the sentence is negative, all negatable forms are negated. =Greek Australian English (Greek ethnolect)= Example 3 Greek Australian English refers to the English spoken by Greek immigrants in Australia. It is known and used by the Greek Australians during the last 170 years of settlement. Some salient features of Greek Australian English include: ::*Phonological :::*Vowel changes ::::* /…ô/ advanced to [Œµ] in closed syllables, e.g. houses ::::* The diphthong in ‚Äòface‚Äô has an open starting point, [e:i] e.g. day. ::::* ‚Äònear‚Äô has an open finish [ia] or with glide insertion, [ija], e.g. here. ::::* The final nucleus in ‚Äòcomma‚Äô is consistently open [back a], e.g.soccer, longer. :::*Consonant changes ::::* Heavy aspiration of /k/, e.g. cold, soccer. ::::* Perceptual voicing of voiceless stops and fricatives :::::*/t/ in together, /t/ in Tuesday :::::*intervocalic /p/ in properly :::::*/s/ in baseball ::::* Frequency of /t/ tapping is higher than in comparable speakers from other backgrounds ::*Syntactic :::This is limited to in-group communication, especially with parents. :::*Ellipsis ::::*Auxiliary deletion, for example: ::::::How you know? ::::*Preposition deletion, for example: ::::::We‚Äôll go movies. ::::*Quantifier deletion (some), for example: ::::::Can I have money? Further manifestations Ethnolects are typically employed by speakers to either decrease or increase social distance with others. Listed below are more atypical manifestations of using ethnolects in order to achieve certain social purposes. =Crossing= Crossing refers to the use of a language, or aspects of it, by speakers who are not accepted by members of the group associated with the language. In reference to ethnolects, crossing refers to speakers using ethnolects that do not formally belong to them. Considering the inherent connection between ethnolect and ethnicity, crossing is highly contentious as it involves a movement across ethnic boundaries. Speakers are required to negotiate their identity to perform crossing. Beyond being a linguistic phenomenon, crossing has social implications, and community members are generally aware of the sanctions against crossing. =Hypercorrection= Ethnolects may also be rejected by its speakers. This linguistic choice is apparent in ethnic hypercorrection. Ethnic hypercorrection is a subclass of linguistic hypercorrection, and refers to the over-application of certain linguistic markers common in the variety of another group. Speakers belonging to an ethnicity, often a minority group, hypercorrect to draw distance between themselves and their ethnic groups. Often, speakers hypercorrect due to the social prestige associated with the different language varieties. For example, second and third generation Italian and Jewish immigrants in New York were found to have stronger vowel sounds that are distinctive of the New York accent in their speech. (link 19) The vowels they spoke were opposite of what was expected from their Italian and Yiddish ethnicity.  Criticism of the \\"ethnolect\\" approach  Some twenty-first century linguists object to broader application of the term ethnolect to describe linguistic differences that are believed to reflect ethnic group affiliation. According to these scholars, this may inaccurately posit ethnicity as the central explanation for linguistic difference, when in fact there may be other variables which are more influential to an individual's speech.Becker, Kara. (2014). Linguistic repertoire and ethnic identity in New York City. Language and Communication 35: 43-54. Brubaker, Rogers, Mara Loveman, and Peter Stamatov (2004) Ethnicity as cognition. ÓÅâeory and Society 33(1): 31‚Äì64. Some scholars also point out that the common use of ethnolect is used to compare the \\"ethnolects\\" of ethnic minorities with the \\"standard\\" speech of ethnic majorities, which is designated as the regional dialect instead of as a majority ethnolect. The ethnolinguistic repertoire approach is therefore proposed as a more effective model in linguistic research that could counteract the problems of the ethnolect approach as listed below. =Intra-group variation= The way one speaks can vary widely within any ethnic group on a continuum of styles that could be mixed across variants. Some may employ a few or none of the features in an ethnolect while others may use many. Therefore, it is difficult to draw the line between speakers and non-speakers of an ethnolect. Although qualifications and modifiers are established in definitions to enhance the fluidity of the concept, it is still unable to fully resolve the problem as variation exists in complex and intricate patterns that are unlikely to be fully accounted for in brief definitions. =Intra-speaker variation= Speakers of ethnolects tend to be aware of the differences in their speech compared to others to some extent. They may therefore temper their usage of salient features in their ethnolects when speaking to interlocutors who are not part of their ethnic group and may also be able to code-switch fluently between their ethnolectal variety and Standard English. Speakers who do that are considered to be \\"bidialectal\\". Yet, the selective use of elements from an ethnolect is not predictable, which then confounds the notion of code- switching. =Out-group use= Some speakers who are not part of a particular ethnic group may also make use of elements of the group‚Äôs ethnolect, which can include behaviours like crossing or passing when people imitate an ethnic stereotype or assimilate to an ethnic group‚Äôs behaviour to be included. This can be observed in phenomena such as ‚Äòcrossing‚Äô in multi-ethnic interactions. For example, elements of AAVE are used by people who have little association with African Americans because of the language's influence in hip-hop. Non- group members may also extensively employ features from an ethnic group‚Äôs repertoire in their speech if they spend much of their time with the group members. =Delineating the ethnic group= It is difficult to define the ethnic group a person belongs to, especially in Western societies where ethnic groups are porous and fluid. Individuals often shift from one ethnic identity to another as they transition between life stages. Ethnic group membership is constructed not just on the basis of descent but also on the basis of symbolic practices, including language. Viewing ethnic identity as an inheritance that cannot be changed may pose problems. In addition, an increasing number of individuals consider themselves as part of two or more ethnic groups. It is thus difficult to define one‚Äôs ethnicity by their parentage or physical features. Ethnic identification also generally involves self-identification of a shared understanding and belonging with culture or language, as well as affirmation from existing members of the existing ethnic group. The factors that determine ethnic identity are ambiguous. =Delineating ‚Äòethnolect‚Äô= The final problem lies in the conceptualisation of a given group‚Äôs language as a separate ethnic variety like AAVE and Chicano English, or merely as ethnic variation from an abstract norm such as the phonological variation among people of a shared ethnicity. In the ethnolect approach, distinctions are drawn to categorize certain languages spoken as ethnolects (i.e. ethnic varieties) while others are considered as a repertoire of linguistic features associated with the ethnic group that are employed in ethnic variation.

The acronym NAIDOC stands for National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee. It has its roots in the 1938 Day of Mourning, becoming a week-long event in 1975. NAIDOC Week celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The week is celebrated not just in the Indigenous Australian communities but also in increasing numbers of government agencies, schools, local councils and workplaces. History of the observance  NAIDOC originally was an acronym for the National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee. The organising committee behind the day adopted this name in 1991. However, the idea behind NAIDOC goes back to a letter written by William Cooper that was aimed at Aboriginal communities and at churches. It was written on behalf of the Australian Aborigines Progressive Association, an umbrella group for a number of Aboriginal justice movements. The association gathered together a wide circle of Indigenous leaders including Douglas Nicholls, William Ferguson, Jack Patten and Margaret Tucker. In 1937 they were preparing for what would become the famous Day of Mourning in 1938. It not only sparked a very effective one-off protest. It also stimulated a national observance that was at first championed by churches, and is now a national celebration: ::W. Cooper Hon. Sec., AAL, 43 Mackay Street, Yarraville, 27 December 1937. ::Australia Day 1938 Aborigines' Day of Mourning ::The Australian Aborigines' Progressive Association (AAPA) of New South Wales has called on all aborigines in the advanced stages of civilisation and culture to observe a DAY OF MOURNING concurrently with the white man's DAY OF REJOICING to celebrate the 150th year of the coming of the white man to Australia. The aborigines, by this means, hope to call the attention to the present deplorable condition of all aborigines, of whatever stage of culture, after 150 years of British rule. It is expected that such action will create such sympathy on the part of the whites that full justice and recompense will follow. ::The \\"DAY OF MOURNING\\" has been endorsed by the Australian Aborigines' League, the Victorian body, which also looks after Federal matters, and it is expected that meetings will be held at a number of places and suitable resolutions passed. This League now asks the Christian community to help us in another way. ::We know that sympathy with the aborigines is widespread and growing and, because the aboriginal knows that the goodwill of the whiteman is essential to success they seek to justify the continuance of this sympathy. We now ask all Christian denominations to observe Sunday, 3rd January as ABORIGINES' DAY. We request that sermons be preached on this day dealing with the aboriginal people and their need of the gospel and response to it and we ask that special prayer be invoked for all missionary and other effort for the uplift of the dark people. ::We regret the unavoidable delay in submitting our request, which was not avoidable in all the circumstances, but we feel that a suitable notice from you in your church press will give that wide publicity that is so essential. ::Very sincerely yours, ::W. Cooper.Andrew Markus (ed), Blood From A Stone: William Cooper and the Australian Aborigines League (Monash Publications in History, Department of History, Clayton, 1986). The Day of Mourning before Australia Day 1938 in Sydney by the AAPA and around 100 further Aboriginal people made significant impact on the national conversation and triggered an invitation for Indigenous leaders to meet with Prime Minister Joseph Lyons. The message to the churches got through too. Certainly, some churches were observing the day by January 1940 and it was nationally observed by 1946 at the latest. By 1957, the leaders of the movement decided to change the date from January to July. The National Aborigines Day Observance Committee (NADOC) formed and the first Sunday in July became a day of remembrance and celebration for Aboriginal people and heritage. In 1991 NADOC became NAIDOC (National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee), to recognise Torres Strait Islanders and to describe a whole week of recognition, rather than one day. The committee's acronym has become the name of the week itself.  NAIDOC Week activities  NAIDOC activities are held across Australia, activities include cultural and educational activities in schools and workplaces and public displays. NAIDOC Week activities might include listening to Indigenous Australian music, reading dream time stories, visiting Indigenous Australian websites on the Internet and organising an art competition. Major celebratory events take place in Australia's major cities as well as in larger rural Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, including Alice Springs, Hermannsburg, Shepparton and Mildura. =National NAIDOC Awards= The National NAIDOC Awards Ceremony and Ball, celebrating the end of NAIDOC Week festivities is held in a different host city each year. The Ball features Indigenous food and live bands. For a full list of award winners see: =NAIDOC Poster Competition= The first NAIDOC poster was created in 1972 to promote 'Aborigines Day'.

Retrieved from the 2012-2016 5-year American Census Survey.  Pre-migration  Prior to the rise of the communist Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, Cambodia was a highly agricultural society that endured ninety years of French colonial rule.Ross, R. R. (1998). Cambodia: A country study (Vol. 550, No. 50). United States Govt Printing Office. In 1973, the United States (U.S.) commissioned the Arclight Missions. This operation was a series of bombings targeting the Cambodia-Vietnam border to fight the threat of communism from Vietnam.Chea, J. (2009). Refugee acts: Articulating silences through critical remembering and remembering. Amerasia Journal: 35(1), 20-43. However, the bombings instead instilled chaos and fear in the civilians of Southeast Asia including Cambodia. These bombings convinced many Cambodians that establishing the Khmer Rouge and a new political system would solve all of their problems. Pol Pot led the Khmer Rouge as a communist group who sought to remove all Western influence in Cambodia and create an equal, agricultural society. The Khmer Rouge was able to capture and destroy the old capital city of Odongk on March 1974. This then led to the Khmer Rouge's next action of forcing 20,000 inhabitants into the countryside. The Khmer Rouge formally took control of Cambodia on April 17, 1975 around the time of Cambodian New Year. Cambodia then turned into a classless, institution-less society that forced people to work 12 to 14 hours a day in the labor camps on the countryside. Shortly after taking over the country, the Khmer Rouge clubbed individuals who showed disagreement towards their regime to a painful death. The Khmer Rouge murdered Cambodians for not working hard enough, showing any signs of grief, or being an educated individual. As a result, the Khmer Rouge killed 300,000 to 500,000 Cambodians. When the Vietnamese removed the Khmer Rouge's power in 1979, many Cambodians had already suffered at the hands of the army. During Southeast Asia's political turmoil, the total death toll estimate is 2 million out of 8 million people in Cambodia or a quarter of the total population.  Waves of migration to Cambodia Town  In the 1950s and 1960s, the earliest Cambodians to reside in Long Beach were Cambodian students who attended California State University, Long Beach as part of an exchange program.Adebiyi, A., Cheng, A., Kim, J., Kim, T., Luna, M., Ly, M., & Tse, L. (2013). The state of Cambodia Town. Los Angeles, CA: UCLA Asian American Studies Center.Needham, S., & Quintiliani, K. (2008). Cambodians in Long Beach. Long Beach, CA: Arcadia Publishing. These students were from wealthy and educated families in Cambodia. A few of these students permanently settled in Long Beach after graduating from college and planted the seeds for a Cambodian presence in Long Beach. Consequently, the next wave of migration occurred in the mid-1970s with those who escaped when the Khmer Rouge first took over Cambodia. Many Cambodians took the chance to go to America in various ways even after the fall of the Khmer Rouge. The last wave of Cambodian arrivals to the U.S. occurred under the Refugee Act of the 1980s, which was after the Vietnamese attacked the Khmer Rouge in 1979.Bunte, P. A., Joseph, R., & Wobus, P. (1992). The Cambodian community of Long Beach: An ethnographic analysis of factors leading to Census undercount: Final report for joint statistical agreement 89-31. Long Beach, CA: Center for Survey Methods Research, Bureau of the Census. This was mostly farmers from small villages with limited educational backgrounds. These refugees came to America to avoid fear and violence imposed on them because of war and genocide. The Cambodian students who had settled in Long Beach in the 1950s and 1960s provided services, such as mental health resources, to assist refugees with adjustment to American society. Overall, these Cambodian refugees came to settle in Long Beach to build a new Cambodian community that was destroyed by violence. Long Beach became a destination that allowed many refugees to start their own businesses and establish cultural legacies due to its affordable property.  Demographics  As Cambodian refugees arrived in Long Beach, the Asian population increased between 1980 and 1990. By 1990, the Asian population in Cambodia Town was about 35 percent and has declined since then. According to the 2010 Census, Hispanics composed the majority of all ethnic groups while Asians composed 20 percent, 70 percent of whom identified as Cambodian. Over half of the Asian population of Cambodia Town is foreign born, and 60 percent of these individuals are United States citizens. This process and rate of naturalization indicates the community's efforts of assimilating to American society.Arguelles, D., Castro, S., & Ong, P. (1993). Beyond Asian American poverty: Community economic development policies and strategies. Los Angeles, CA: Leadership for Asian Pacific Americans. 500px Fig. 1. A pictograph showing the racial demographic of Cambodia Town in Long Beach, CA. Retrieved from 2012-2016 5-year American Census Survey.  Resettlement  From April to November 1975, approximately 2,000 Cambodians migrated to Camp Pendleton, a military base in Southern California, for refuge. After their time in this resettlement camp, many Cambodian refugees moved to Cambodia Town, Long Beach in search of support, as well as familiar lifestyle and culture. Through this process of adjusting to American society, many struggled with various challenges including language barriers, trauma, and violence. Trauma is a highly prevalent issue in the community due to the violence inflicted on Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge. Many Cambodians in Cambodia Town struggled emotionally by having more anxiety and fear in their daily activities because of this trauma. These individuals dealt with insomnia, nightmares, panic attacks, and headaches due to painful memories from the political turmoil in Cambodia.Carlson, E. B., & Rosser- Hogan, R. (1994). Cross-cultural response to trauma: A study of traumatic experiences and posttraumatic symptoms in Cambodian refugees. Journal of traumatic stress, 7(1), 43-58.Schlund-Vials, C. J.(2012). War, Genocide, and Justice: Cambodian American Memory Work. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. Intergenerational trauma contributes to behavioral problems during the adolescent years of Cambodian youth.Choi, M. Y. (2014). Putting ethnicity on the map: The making, contesting, and assessing of claims for the formal recognition of ethnic places (Doctoral dissertation, UC Irvine). These problems impact the family dynamic by widening the generation gap between parent and child. As a result, unaddressed past trauma links to various issues, which may intensify the violence within the Cambodian community in Long Beach. Despite these challenges of trauma from migration to America, the Cambodian community in Long Beach displays a great amount of strength and resiliency to overcome any obstacle in order to accomplish their goals. Fig. 9. This building was previously the UCC but was bought out by a different owner. February 25, 2018. (Luu, D.) Cambodians received the opportunity to rebuild their lives and community when they came to Long Beach. At the time, Long Beach had many jobs that did not require English proficiency, which granted Cambodians a higher access to work and income. Additionally, cheap and affordable property allowed a few Cambodian refugees to gather funds within their immediate and extended family to establish small businesses, cultural institutions, and homes.Gorman, A. (2007). Cambodia Town is now on the map. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved February 10, 2018, from http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/local/me-cambodian18. The United Cambodian Community (UCC) formed during this time to assist Cambodian refugees with housing, finance, and food (Fig. 9; Fig. 10). These structures and services helped shape the geographic landscape of the local Cambodian community by creating familiar food, pharmacy, and other stores for Cambodians. For example, pharmacies in Cambodia Town provided traditional herbal medicine from Cambodia.Tran, M. (2009). Trying to get Cambodia Town off the ground. Los Angeles Times. Retrieved February 10, 2018, from http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/01/local/me-cambodia-town1/2. These aspects of recreating Cambodia's lifestyle in Cambodia Town, Long Beach is what helped establish many Cambodians' sense of belonging in Long Beach. Cambodia Town's population grew with services, stores, and migration. This population growth created a local network where Cambodian residents could navigate their daily lives while still using Khmer as their dominant language. East Anaheim Street became the main business corridor for these services, restaurants, and resources for Cambodians in Long Beach. Official designation The initial proposal of designating Cambodia Town in 2000 was rejected because many local residents did not support it. The plan was first brought up by a group of Cambodians who \\"don't live here,\\" leaving the impression that Cambodians who did not live in the area were trying to claim the space as their own.Hou, J. (2013). Transcultural cities: Border-crossing and placemaking. New York and London: Routledge. Thus, some community activists preferred the name Little Phnom Penh because the name does not impose a \\"singular national identity\\" unlike how the name Cambodia Town implies. Some community members continued questioning any official designation for the area because Long Beach is ethnically diverse. Official recognition for a single ethnic group would reinforce racial tensions between Cambodian and Latino youth that stemmed from cultural differences and social isolation.Chan, F. H. (2011).

Press-Telegram. Retrieved from http://ki- media.blogspot.com/2006/10/long-beach-cambodian-community-divided.html. The founders of Cambodia Town, Inc. led a successful attempt to officially designate East Anaheim Street as Cambodia Town. Their attempt included the crucial step of gathering support from community and major stakeholders along East Anaheim Street. The proposal received the unanimous approval by the Housing and Neighborhoods Committee despite dissent and concerns that other minority groups had in regards of being displaced. Community members argued that the designation would not displace other ethnic groups by stating that \\"such designations merely call attention to a neighborhood's unique characteristics\\".Pine, F. (2007). Cambodia Town. Press-Telegram. Retrieved from https://www.presstelegram.com/2007/07/02/cambodia-town/. The advocates for the designation also used other established ethnic enclaves as examples of spaces where Asians, Blacks, Hispanics and Whites were able to live and work together. As a result, the Long Beach City Council unanimously approved the concept of Cambodia Town in 2007 ‚Äì under the condition that it became a Business Improvement District (BID).  Racial tensions  Many Latino community members felt intimidated and threatened by the rapid growth of the Cambodian community.DuBois, T.A. (1993). Constructions construed: The representation of Southeast Asian refugees in academic, popular, and adolescent discourse. Amerasia Journal, 19(3) 1-25. Cambodians became increasingly \\"confronted by the ethnic racial hierarchy\\" that arises in low- income communities due to the lack of resources. Cambodian gangs began forming as a method of resiliency.Woo, M. (2012). \\"The healing fields of Long Beach's Cambodia Town.\\" Orange County Weekly News. Retrieved March 11, 2013, from https://www.ocweekly.com/the-healing-fields-of-long-beachs-cambodia- town-6424795/. Young Cambodians gravitated towards gangs in hopes to reconcile their conflicting American and Cambodian identities.Cheng, J., Nguyen, T., & Vigil, J.D. (2006). Asian Americans on the streets: Strategies for prevention and intervention. AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community, 4(2), 1-14. The lack of educational support within the Long Beach school system for Cambodians also contributed towards high rates of gang participation. In addition, gang participation also correlates to mental health because unaddressed intergenerational trauma among Cambodian youth caused many to search for support from gangs as a coping mechanism; 67 percent of Cambodians suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, while 51 percent suffer from severe depression. Gang activity in Long Beach and Cambodia Town was most active from 1989-1995, through street fights, drive-by shootings and killings. In America by the Numbers Pass or Fail in Cambodia Town, one of the interviewees stated that \\"we had to protect ourselves,\\" when talking about the difficulties of growing up in the United States.Gladsjo, L.A., (Producer & Director). (2014). American by the number pass or fail in Cambodia Town. [Documentary]. United States: Public Broadcasting Services. In a survey conducted in Cambodia Town, more than half of the participants reported public safety as a major concern. Many of these respondents cited gang activity, theft, violence, and substance abuse as issues that their families continually encountered. However, rates of crime and violence have decreased in the community in recent years. Various community-based organizations such as UCC consistently reach out to the younger generations to guide them towards academic attainment (Fig. 9; Fig. 10).  Cambodian culture  Fig. 11. A local performance of Cambodian Classical Dance by Khmer Arts Academy as a way to heal the community and preserve Cambodian culture. November 23, 2017. (Santos, J.) The Cambodian New Year, called Choul Chnam Thmey in Khmer, takes place annually from April 14 to April 16. In Cambodia, Choul Chnam Thmey traditionally signifies the shift from the height of the hot, dry season to the monsoon rains that will wash away the dust and bring nourishment to the fields.Shapiro-Phim, T. (2008). Cambodia's seasons of migration. Dance Research Journal, 40(2), 56-73. This transformation is said to be accompanied by divine beings, known as Tevoda, who migrate in a cycle to watch over the renewal in nature. The Cambodian New Year festival in Cambodia Town is a community gathering in the streets and features a cultural parade. This celebration showcases traditional garments and performances (e.g. classical dancing and drumming), flags and symbols of Cambodian cultural pride, and representatives of local organizations and businesses (Fig. 11).Ablaza, K.

The Cambodia Town business corridor outlines roughly the 1.2 mile stretch of East Anaheim Street just north of Downtown Long Beach and east of the 710 freeway. This location is accessible by the Long Beach Transit bus system and the Los Angeles Metro A Line. The area consists of Cambodian liquor stores, gift shops, jewelry stores, markets, and restaurants (Fig. 6). The area also consists of many Latino-owned businesses and restaurants (Fig. 7; Fig. 8). One of the most well-known Cambodia Town restaurants is Phnom Penh Noodle Shack, established in 1985. Phnom Penh Noodle Shack started as a modest, family-run restaurant, but over the years has garnered mass appeal from food critic reviews and social media.Shyong, F. (2017).

The markets within Cambodia Town reflect the diversity of Asian ethnicities in Long Beach and carry key ingredients for a variety of cuisines including Khmer, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese food.Prajapati, N. (2016). Lost in food translation: Khmer food culture from Cambodia to Long Beach, California. Long Beach, CA: California State University, Long Beach. The stores provide ethnic foods ranging from ready-made meals to cooking ingredients that cater to all Asian ethnic groups of Cambodia Town (Fig. 5). These markets also introduce Cambodian and Asian ethnic foods to the non-Asian ethnic groups of the community.  Education  Cambodia Town's high poverty rate is partially due to low employment rates caused by language barriers and low educational attainment. In the United States, 54 percent of Asians hold a bachelor's degree, while only 10 percent of Asians in Cambodia Town hold a bachelor's degree. About 43 percent of Cambodians reported to having attended college but not earning a degree, thus implying high drop-out rates.Horikoshi, N., & Matasaua Pimentel, L. (2016). Educational opportunity and the missing minority in higher education: changing the national narrative of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by 2040. AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community, 14(1), 66-77. In the United States, less than one-third of Cambodians hold less than a high school degree. Data aggregation consolidates the Cambodian experience with the general Asian population's experiences. Because rates of Asian educational attainment are so high, the low educational attainment of Cambodians is ignored. Cambodian youth are not provided the necessary resources, such as counseling or tutoring, to address specific issues that pertain to the Cambodian community.  Poverty  Fig. 3. A cluster bar chart is used here to compare the percentage of people below the poverty line in Cambodia Town and Los Angeles County. Retrieved from the 2012-2016 5-year American Census Survey. Due to resettlement, the Cambodian community is currently facing many challenges such as trauma and poverty. Poverty imposes stress on individuals, which creates individual trauma such as having financial insecurity. The complexity and interconnections of these issues contributes to the cycle of poverty and violence by hindering economic mobility. Poverty imposes a challenge for social mobility because other challenges build upon poverty such as educational attainment.Yam, K. (2017).

The median household income in Cambodia Town is $34,000, which is lower than the $56,000 median income for Los Angeles County. Moreover, Asians in Cambodia Town on average earn roughly $14,600 less than Asians in Los Angeles County. Additionally, one-third of all residents live below the poverty line ‚Äì about two times higher than that of Los Angeles County (Fig. 3). Income and poverty are both interconnected with employment outcomes such as having labor force participation rate around 34 percent in Cambodia Town. Consequently, Cambodia Town has an unemployment rate of 15 percent. With these financial barriers, residents must dedicate more time into finding and working at lower-paying jobs.  Housing  Fig. 2. A stacked bar graph illustrating the disparity between homeowners and renters in Cambodia Town, Long Beach as it compares to the Los Angeles County as a whole. Retrieved from the 2012-2016 5-year American Census Survey. Few households own a home in Cambodia Town, which highlights the high renter-occupied numbers and the lack of home opportunities (Fig. 2). About 61 percent of Cambodia Town residents are renters. Most resident are low-income, which causes many to devote most of their time and income to rent. Individuals with a high rent burden are described as any renters who dedicate more than 30 percent of their income to paying rent; in Cambodia Town, 62 percent of renters have a high rent burden. This prevalence of poverty and inability to purchase homes within the Cambodia Town community may be due to low levels of educational attainment, which can inhibit the ability to attain high-paying jobs.Houston, D. & Miller, D. (2003). Distressed Asian American neighborhoods. AAPI Nexus: Policy, Practice and Community, 1(1), 67-84. As a result, displacement and gentrification are becoming prevalent issues within the community. Cambodia Town is currently undergoing many beautification projects with public investment in murals, bike lanes, parks, and community gardens, among others. This method of beautification is part of an effort to increase safety within the local community.Niebla, C. (2017). Beauty without the pain: Can Cambodian Americans revitalize their town without displacing their own? KCET. Retrieved February 10, 2018, from https://www.kcet.org/shows/city-rising/beauty-without- the-pain-can-cambodian-americans-revitalize-their-town-without. Although beautification does promote safety, it also increases property values, which imposes a new challenge for locals such as a higher cost of living. Consequently, businesses and residents are at risk of being displaced if rent becomes too high. Taken alongside gentrification, beautification creates dissent from housing community development organizations. These groups petition for policies to protect residents from continually increasing rent.Browne, S., Butler, J., Gresham, J., Humphreys, J., & Hytrek, G. (2013).

Having played and recorded with an array of artists his versatility in original music spans the styles of rock, jazz/punk, industrial, metal, and sonic art including glitch & noise. He has released solo works such as Scaleshack, Digital Jamming and collaborations with Nicholas Littlemore and associates. He has been a member of several bands since 1975 including No (1987‚Äì1989) with Ollie Olsen and Marie Hoy, which were described as \\"One of Australias most compelling stage acts incorporating speed metal, hip hop and electro funk\\". In 1989 he followed Olsen to join Max Q with Michael Hutchence of INXS on vocals. He runs the label Zenith Wa Records https://zenithwarecords.bandcamp.com/ Biography Michael Sheridan was born and raised in Melbourne. In the 1970s, whilst still at secondary school, he became fascinated by the guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix and others. He has been a member of several bands since 1975. Sheridan moved to Sydney to further his interest in improvised music. In 1982 he formed a jazz - punk outfit, Great White Noise, which included Sandy Evans, Diane Spence, Lenny Bastiaans, Tony Buck, John Gillies, soon followed by an improvisation group, Slaughter House 3, with Jon Rose and John Gillies. By the mid-1980s Sheridan had moved back to Melbourne and formed Transwaste with Jamie Fielding and Peter Jones. He also played in Whaddya Want? with David Chesworth. In 1987 Sheridan, on lead guitar, joined an electro-punk band, No, with Marie Hoy on keyboards and samples, Kevin McMahon on bass guitar and Ollie Olsen on vocals, samples and keyboards. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as \\"the ultimate crossover act due to its confrontational fusion of hardcore energy, abrasive heavy metal guitar riffs, electro-funk beats and acid-house grooves.\\" Sheridan and Olsen also work with Michael Hutchence (of INXS) in Max Q (1989‚Äì90). While still a member of No, Sheridan formed Dumb and the Ugly (1987‚Äì93) with John Murphy on drums and noise tapes (ex-the Wreckery) and David Brown on bass guitar. In 1990 Sheridan released a solo CD, Scaleshack, utilising sampling and dub techniques. Soon after he joined Peril, with Tony Buck, Otomo Yoshihide, and Kato Hideki. From 1991 to 1993 he was also a member of RAW with Barry Deenik on bass guitar, Ross Wilson on lead vocals (ex-Mondo Rock) and Craig Waugh on drums (ex-Uncanny X-Men). McFarlane observed that they \\"played an aggressive blend of rock and funk but, aside from building up a strong cult following on the Australian pub circuit, the band did not issue any recordings before breaking up.\\" Sheridan's next solo CD, Digital Jamming, was released in 1996 also features performances by Jon Rose and Jim Denley. Both Scaleshack and Digital Jamming were later re-released by Shame File Music. Sheridan also studied and completed a Bachelor of Music degree at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music 2000, and qualified as a teacher and composer. In March 2012 a quartet with Sheridan on eight-string guitar, Chris Abrahams on piano, John Gillies on percussion and Jon Rose on violin performed and recorded Improvisation at People's Republic in Sydney.

It is a long tube with a wire down the center and a gas which becomes ionized when a particle passes through. A potential difference is maintained between the wire and the walls of the tube, so that once the gas is ionized electrons move in one direction and ions in the other. This produces a current which indicates that a particle has passed through the chamber. Many straws together can be used to track particles in a straw tracker. A straw tracker is a type of particle detector which uses many straw chambers to track the path of a particle. The path of a particle is determined by the best fit to all the straws with hits. Since the time for a particular straw to produce a signal is proportional to the distance of the particle's closest approach to that chamber's wire, if a particle on a predictable path (e.g. a helix in a magnetic field) passes through many straws, the path of the particle can be determined more precisely than the size of any particular straw.

Allume was incorporated in January 1989. In April 2004, the company was acquired by PC software publisher International Microcomputer Software Inc. (IMSI). A few months later in July, the company was forced to change its name from Aladdin Systems as part of a settlement of a trademark lawsuit with Aladdin Knowledge Systems. In 2005, Allume Systems was acquired by Smith Micro Software from IMSI.  Products  As Aladdin Systems, they originally developed exclusively for Macintosh, focusing on data compression and management utilities, such as the StuffIt family of compression utilities and the StuffIt InstallerMaker delivery suite, the ShrinkWrap disk image utility, and its Spring Cleaning system optimization utility. As Aladdin Systems, the company purchased the ShrinkWrap disk image utility from Macintosh shareware developer Chad Magendanz in 1996. As early as 1995, Allume began to release some elements of StuffIt to Windows while not releasing the full StuffIt for Windows until 2000. StuffIt was later ported to both Linux and Solaris in 2001. Under Smith Micro, both Unix products have since been discontinued. By this time, Allume began to publish or distribute a full line of graphics, imaging, internet security, and utility software. In response to the success of the popular marine aquarium fishtank simulator, they have also released their own line of fish sims known as Aquazone, which is not affiliated with the discontinued fish tank computer simulation from 9003.inc by the same name.

It was one of two identical roller coasters built for the Marriott Corporation for each of their ‚ÄúGreat America‚Äù parks at their debut in 1976, with an identical version of the Whizzer at California's Great America. Marriott continued to operate both parks until selling them in 1984. Manufactured by Anton Schwarzkopf of Germany, the two rides were the last ‚ÄúSpeedracer‚Äù models ever built. The California Whizzer was dismantled in 1988 while the Illinois Whizzer remains in operation, as one of only two Speedracers still in existence worldwide (the other operating as Broca (formerly known as Zambezi Zinger) at Parque Nacional Del Caf√© in Montenegro, Colombia).  History  From the start, both Whizzers suffered from problems with the braking system that would sometimes allow the trains to collide in the station. Unfortunately, no immediate solution was put forth to remedy this problem. In one four-year period, from 1976 to 1979, there were at least 11 recorded instances of station collisions on the California's Great America version, resulting in an unknown number of injuries. There were also two station collisions on the Six Flags Great America ride - both of which occurred less than a month apart in 1976. A total of 31 riders were injured in the Gurnee collisions. Then on March 29, 1980, a 13-year-old boy was killed and eight others injured when two trains collided at the station on the Santa Clara Whizzer.Commission Files Complaints Following Fatal Accidents On Amusement Park Rides Following the accident, both rides underwent several changes.

Early life and education An orphan, Wilson's earliest years were spent growing up in a San Francisco, California orphanage, an experience he reminisced upon in his book, These Were the Children. In 1927, Wilson earned his bachelor's degree in botany and, in 1934, his master's in biology, both from Stanford University. Dig It with Albert For many years, Wilson had a regular talk show, Dig It with Albert, broadcast on San Francisco's KGO 810 AM. The original show was called How does your Garden grow and was produced with the help of his manager, George Turkmany. He was on the local PBS TV member station, KQED. He also had a show on KCSM-TV in the late sixties. Wilson was a frequent guest lecturer at local gardening clubs and nurseries throughout the San Francisco Bay area, mentoring and befriending many attendees. He designed and built his home in 1929, on Creek Drive in Menlo Park, California. Wilson was also well known as a landscape architect, having designed Allied Arts and Fremont Park in Menlo Park, and countless backyards and gardens throughout the San Francisco Bay area. How Does Your Garden Grow? How Does Your Garden Grow? is one of the gardening books written by Wilson, who was genuinely interested, not just in gardens, but in the gardeners who tended them. Though at one time he spoke positively upon the seemingly miraculous wonders of pesticides and herbicides, Wilson was an early advocate of wearing protective garments while using the primitive agricultural chemicals of the mid-20th century. Later, Wilson's stance changed, because of the health problems and deaths of many his friends and colleagues, caused by chemicals such as DDT. He was also an early advocate of organic gardening. Wilson's dedication to gardening went beyond landscaping, writing and broadcasting. He spoke at many gardening club meetings and nursery seminars. Among the clubs Wilson was involved with was the Foothill Men's Garden Club, which he co-founded in 1962. The club, which encompasses Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, raises money to preserve the natural environment through the sales of members' homegrown products in an annual garden sale. Death and memorial Wilson died at age 93 after apparently falling down a steep ravine bank into San Francisquito Creek, near his Menlo Park home. In 1996, the 32nd annual Foothill Men's Garden Club show was dedicated to Wilson. Dig it with Albert was remembered with a collection of photos of the beloved gardening expert and writer. The Stanford Club of Palo Alto established a memorial fund for Wilson, with proceeds going toward the reconstruction of the Rodin Sculpture Garden at Stanford University. Wilson planned and landscaped the original flower garden of the Rodin Sculpture Garden in 1986.

The Harbor Subdivision is a historic single-track main line of the BNSF Railway which stretches between rail yards near downtown Los Angeles and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach across southwestern Los Angeles County. It was the primary link between two of the world's busiest harbors and the transcontinental rail network. Mostly displaced with the April 15, 2002 opening of the more direct Alameda Corridor, the Harbor Sub takes a far more circuitous route from origin to destination, owing to its growth in segments over the decades. The subdivision was built in this fashion beginning in the early 1880s to serve the ports and the various businesses that developed along it. History =Construction= First built to serve Port Ballona and Santa Monica, located at what is now Playa del Rey, the construction of a larger, better port at Redondo Beach brought an extension to that city in 1888. The early 1900s would see that project eclipsed with the coming of the San Pedro Outer Breakwater and the Port of Los Angeles. By the early 1920s, owing to the development of the area's oil fields, the Harbor Sub was extended through Torrance, Wilmington and on to Long Beach. Development of Watson Yard in Wilmington completed the line. Other than sidings at \\"Lairport\\" (along the eastern edge of Los Angeles International Airport next to Aviation Boulevard at 120th Street), \\"Ironsides\\" in Torrance and the line's longest siding at the Alcoa, also in Torrance, the Harbor Sub is completely single-track without signals, compensated with track warrant control via a local dispatcher. =Present and potential future uses= The line is currently under control of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and is used by BNSF. A study conducted by the MTA examined the feasibilities of extending the Green Line to Torrance via the Harbor Sub, the creation of a new light rail transit line and even the possibility of a maglev high-speed rail system. Heavy construction began in June 2014 to convert the southern portion of the Harbor Subdivision to light rail use as part of the Crenshaw/LAX Line, part of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. When completed, it will run from Jefferson Park in the north and link with the Metro C Line at the south end with revenue service projected to begin by 2021. The Harbor Subdivision overcrossing on Century Blvd. and Aviation Blvd. was demolished in late-July 2014 as part of the construction of the Crenshaw/LAX Line.

Particle identification reduces backgrounds and improves measurement resolutions, and is essential to many analyses at particle detectors. Charged particles Charged particles have been identified using a variety of techniques. All methods rely on a measurement of the momentum in a tracking chamber combined with a measurement of the velocity to determine the charged particle mass, and therefore its identity. =Specific ionization= A charged particle loses energy in matter by ionization at a rate determined in part by its velocity. The energy loss per unit distance is typically called dE/dx. The energy loss is measured either in dedicated detectors, or in tracking chambers designed to also measure energy loss. The energy lost in a thin layer of material is subject to large fluctuations, and therefore accurate dE/dx determination requires a large number of measurements. Individual measurements in the low and high energy tails are excluded. =Time of flight= Time of flight detectors determine charged particle velocity by measuring the time required to travel from the interaction point to the time of flight detector, or between two detectors. The ability to distinguish particle types diminishes as the particle velocity approaches its maximum allowed value, speed of light, and thus is efficient only for particles with a small Lorentz factor. =Cherenkov detectors= Cherenkov radiation is emitted by a charged particle when it passes through a material with a speed greater than c/n, where n is the index of refraction of the material. The angle of the photons with respect to the charged particle direction depends on velocity. A number of Cherenkov detector geometries have been used. Photons Photons are identified because they leave all their energy in a detector's electromagnetic calorimeter, but do not appear in the tracking chamber (see, for example, ATLAS Inner Detector) because they are neutral. A neutral pion which decays inside the EM calorimeter can replicate this effect. Electrons Electrons appear as a track in the inner detector and deposit all their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The energy deposited in the calorimeter must match the momentum measured in the tracking chamber. Muons Muons penetrate more material than other charged particles, and can therefore be identified by their presence in the outermost detectors. Tau particles Tau identification requires differentiating the narrow \\"jet\\" produced by the hadronic decay of the tau from ordinary quark jets. Neutrinos Neutrinos do not interact in particle detectors, and therefore escape undetected. Their presence can be inferred by the momentum imbalance of the visible particles in an event. In electron-positron colliders, both the neutrino momentum in all three dimensions and the neutrino energy can be reconstructed. Neutrino energy reconstruction requires accurate charged particle identification. In colliders using hadrons, only the momentum transverse to the beam direction can be determined. Neutral hadrons Neutral hadrons can sometimes be identified in calorimeters. In particular, antineutrons and KL0s can be identified. Neutral hadrons can also be identified at electron-positron colliders in the same way as neutrinos. Heavy quarks Quark flavor tagging identifies the flavor of quark a jet comes from. B-tagging, the identification of bottom quarks, is the most important example. B-tagging relies on the b quark being the heaviest quark involved in a hadronic decay (tops are heavier but to have a top in a decay is necessary to produce some heavier particle to have a subsequent decay into a top). This implies that the b quark has a short lifetime and is possible to look for its decay vertex in the inner tracker. Additionally, its decay products are transversal to the beam, resulting in a high jet multiplicity. Charm tagging using similar techniques is also possible, but extremely difficult due to the lower mass. Tagging jets from lighter quarks is simply impossible, due to QCD background there are simply too many indistinguishable jets.

Street Law is an approach to teaching practically relevant law to grassroots populations using interactive teaching methodologies. Elements of practical law taught include awareness of human rights/civil rights, criminal breaches and transgression, democratic principles, conflict resolution, the advocacy process, criminal and civil law, employment and labour law, family law, and consumer rights. History The Street Law approach began in 1972 when Georgetown University Law Center developed a program that sent law students into high schools in Washington, DC to teach practical law lessons to high school students. Street Law, Inc., an outgrowth of the Georgetown program, develops and implements practical law education programs around the world.http://www.georgetown.edu/news/street-law- clinic-celebrates-40-years-in-operation.html Street Law, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its main offices are located in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA. Organizational structure Although Street Law traces its founding to Georgetown Law, it has spread to many law schools globally. Neither Georgetown Law nor Street Law, Inc. exercise vertical or indirect control over local Street Law programs. Within U.S. law schools, Street Law is typically run as a legal clinic or experiential learning module, where law students receive law school academic credit for participation. At other law schools, Street Law is run as a student organization or as an extracurricular activity, typically under direct faculty supervision. In recent years, some law societies have adopted a model which sees Street Law run across their jurisdiction. Examples include Ireland and Scotland. Pedagogical methodology One core Street Law module is a teaching program wherein law students are sent into community schools to teach high school students age appropriate lessons in the law. Within the U.S., this means that second and third year law students are paired with secondary school classes where they regularly teach courses on law and legal subjects. There is significant autonomy and differentiation in the way that Street Law is taught nationally in the U.S. and globally, and Street Law expressly encourages law schools and law students to experiment with different teaching methodologies to account for different learning styles depending on age, culture, regional and state differences, and so on. Other Street Law approaches include: teaching Legal Life Skills to underserved populations; Teacher Professional Development courses; partnerships with the legal community (both law firm and corporate) to teach about the law and legal careers to secondary students; teaching about rule of law, democracy and civil rights to populations in countries outside of the US; and publishing teaching resources. Teaching resources Among other publications, McGraw-Hill has published a high school social studies textbook using this approach. McGraw-Hill has also published a high school government textbook co-authored by Street Law. McGraw-Hill also publishes Street Law: Understanding Law and Legal Issues, an informative law-based, civic learning text for use in the community college program.

Epitope maps provide data for determining mechanism of action (MOA). Epitope mapping is the process of experimentally identifying the binding site, or \\"epitope\\", of an antibody on its target antigen (usually, on a protein). Identification and characterization of antibody binding sites aid in the discovery and development of new therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics. Epitope characterization can also help elucidate the mechanism of binding for an antibody and can strengthen intellectual property (patent) protection. Experimental epitope mapping data can be incorporated into robust algorithms to facilitate in silico prediction of B-cell epitopes based on sequence and/or structural data. Epitopes are generally divided into two classes: linear and conformational. Linear epitopes are formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids in a protein. Conformational epitopes are composed of amino acids that are discontinuous in the protein sequence but brought together upon three- dimensional protein folding. B-cell epitope mapping studies suggest that most interactions between antigens and antibodies, particularly autoantibodies and protective antibodies (e.g., in vaccines), rely on binding to conformational epitopes. Importance for antibody characterization By providing information on mechanism of action, epitope mapping is a critical component in therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) development. Epitope mapping can reveal how a mAb exerts its functional effects - for instance, by blocking the binding of a ligand or by trapping a protein in a non-functional state. Many therapeutic mAbs target conformational epitopes that are only present when the protein is in its native (properly folded) state, which can make epitope mapping challenging. Epitope mapping has been crucial to the development of vaccines against prevalent or deadly viral pathogens, such as chikungunya, dengue, Ebola, and Zika viruses, by determining the antigenic elements (epitopes) that confer long-lasting immunization effects. Complex target antigens, such as membrane proteins (e.g., G protein-coupled receptors [GPCRs]) and multi-subunit proteins (e.g., ion channels) are key targets of drug discovery. Mapping epitopes on these targets can be challenging because of the difficulty in expressing and purifying these complex proteins. Membrane proteins frequently have short antigenic regions (epitopes) that fold correctly only when in the context of a lipid bilayer. As a result, mAb epitopes on these membrane proteins are often conformational and, therefore, are more difficult to map.  Importance for intellectual property (IP) protection  Shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping of antibodies against HER2 revealed a novel epitope (orange spheres). Epitope maps provide supporting data for intellectual property (patent) claims. Epitope mapping has become prevalent in protecting the intellectual property (IP) of therapeutic mAbs. Knowledge of the specific binding sites of antibodies strengthens patents and regulatory submissions by distinguishing between current and prior art (existing) antibodies. The ability to differentiate between antibodies is particularly important when patenting antibodies against well-validated therapeutic targets (e.g., PD1 and CD20) that can be drugged by multiple competing antibodies. In addition to verifying antibody patentability, epitope mapping data have been used to support broad antibody claims submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Epitope data have been central to several high-profile legal cases involving disputes over the specific protein regions targeted by therapeutic antibodies. In this regard, the Amgen v. Sanofi/Regeneron Pharmaceuticals PCSK9 inhibitor case hinged on the ability to show that both the Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron therapeutic antibodies bound to overlapping amino acids on the surface of PCSK9. Methods There are several methods available for mapping antibody epitopes on target antigens: * X-ray co-crystallography' and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)'. X-ray co- crystallography has historically been regarded as the gold-standard approach for epitope mapping because it allows direct visualization of the interaction between the antigen and antibody. Cryo-EM can similarly provide high- resolution maps of antibody-antigen interactions. However, both approaches are technically challenging, time-consuming, and expensive, and not all proteins are amenable to crystallization. Moreover, these techniques are not always feasible due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of correctly folded and processed protein. Finally, neither technique can distinguish key epitope residues (energetic \\"hot spots\\") for mAbs that bind to the same group of amino acids. * Array-based oligo-peptide scanning. Also known as overlapping peptide scan or pepscan analysis, this technique uses a library of oligo-peptide sequences from overlapping and non-overlapping segments of a target protein, and tests for their ability to bind the antibody of interest. This method is fast, relatively inexpensive, and specifically suited to profile epitopes for large numbers of candidate antibodies against a defined target. The epitope mapping resolution depends on the number of overlapping peptides that are used. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot generally be used to obtain conformational epitopes, which are the most relevant epitope type for human therapeutic mAbs. However, one study mapped discontinuous epitopes on CD20 using array-based oligo-peptide scanning, by combining non-adjacent peptide sequences from different parts of the target protein and enforcing conformational rigidity onto this combined peptide (e.g., by using CLIPS scaffolds). * Site-directed mutagenesis mapping. The molecular biological technique of site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) can be used to enable epitope mapping. In SDM, systematic mutations of amino acids are introduced into the sequence of the target protein. Binding of an antibody to each mutated protein is tested to identify the amino acids that comprise the epitope. This technique can be used to map both linear and conformational epitopes but is labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically limiting analysis to a small number of amino-acid residues. * High-throughput shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping. Shotgun mutagenesis is a high-throughput approach for mapping the epitopes of mAbs. The shotgun mutagenesis technique begins with the creation of a mutation library of the entire target antigen, with each clone containing a unique amino acid mutation (typically an alanine substitution). Hundreds of plasmid clones from the library are individually arrayed in 384-well microplates, expressed in human cells, and tested for antibody binding. Amino acids of the target required for antibody binding are identified by a loss of immunoreactivity. These residues are mapped onto structures of the target protein to visualize the epitope. Benefits of high- throughput shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping include: 1) the ability to identify both linear and conformational epitopes, 2) a shorter assay time than other methods, 3) the presentation of properly folded and post-translationally modified proteins, and 4) the ability to identify key amino acids that drive the energetic interactions (energetic \\"hot spots\\" of the epitope). * Hydrogen‚Äìdeuterium exchange (HDX). This method gives information about the solvent accessibility of various parts of the antigen and antibody, demonstrating reduced solvent accessibility in regions of protein-protein interactions. One of its advantages is that it determines the interaction site of the antigen-antibody complex in its native solution, and does not introduce any modifications (e.g. mutation) to either the antigen or the antibody. HDX epitope mapping has also been demonstrated to be the effective method to rapidly supply complete information for epitope structure. It does not usually provide data at the level of amino acid, but this limitation is being improved by new technology advancements. It has recently been recommended as a fast and cost-effective epitope mapping approach, using the complex protein system influenza hemagglutinin as an example. * Cross-linking-coupled mass spectrometry. Antibody and antigen are bound to a labeled cross-linker, and complex formation is confirmed by high-mass MALDI detection. The binding location of the antibody to the antigen can then be identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The cross-linked complex is highly stable and can be exposed to various enzymatic and digestion conditions, allowing many different peptide options for detection. MS or MS/MS techniques are used to detect the amino-acid locations of the labelled cross-linkers and the bound peptides (both epitope and paratope are determined in one experiment). The key advantage of this technique is the high sensitivity of MS detection, which means that very little material (hundreds of micrograms or less) is needed. Other methods, such as yeast display, phage display, and limited proteolysis, provide high-throughput monitoring of antibody binding but lack resolution, especially for conformational epitopes.

The early patterns of Jewish South African history are almost identical to the history of the Jews in the United States but on a much smaller scale, including the period of early discovery and settlement from the late 17th century to the early 19th century. The community grew tenfold between 1880 and 1914, from 4,000 to over 40,000. Jews were instrumental in promoting the extension of diplomatic military ties between Israel and South Africa. South Africa's Jewish community differs from its counterparts in other African countries in that the majority have remained on the continent rather than emigrating to Israel. Among potential Jewish emigrants, many were likelier to select a destination popular among other South Africans, such as Australia. History =Portuguese exploration= The modern Jewish history of South Africa began, indirectly, some time before the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope, by the participation of certain astronomers and cartographers in the Portuguese discovery of the sea-route to India. Jewish cartographers in Portugal, members of the wealthy and influential classes, assisted Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama who first sailed around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 and 1497. Portugal's baptised Jews were still free until the Portuguese Inquisition was promulgated in 1536. =The Dutch Settlement= In 1652, the Dutch East India Company began the first permanent European settlement of South Africa under Jan van Riebeeck. It has been theorised that \\"a number of non-professing Jews\\" were among the first settlers of Cape Town. Non-Christian migration to the Dutch Cape Colony was generally discouraged until 1803.The Virtual Jewish History Tour - South Africa There were Jews among the directors of the Dutch East India Company, which for 150 years administered the colony at the Cape of Good Hope. During the seventeenth and the greater part of the 18th century the state religion alone was allowed to be publicly observed; but on 25 July 1804, the Dutch commissioner-general Jacob Abraham de Mist, by a proclamation whose provisions were annulled at the English occupation of 1806 and were not reestablished till 1820, instituted in the colony religious equality for all persons, irrespective of creed. =The 1820s through 1880s= Jews did not arrive in any significant numbers at Cape Town before the 1820s. The first congregation in South Africa, known as the Gardens Shul, was founded in Cape Town in September 1841, and the initial service was held on the eve of Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) in the house of 1820 Settler and businessman Benjamin Norden, located at the corner of Weltevreden and Hof streets. Benjamin Norden, Simeon Markus, together with a score of others arriving in the early 1820s and '30s, were commercial pioneers, especially the Mosenthal brothers‚ÄîJulius, Adolph (see Aliwal North), and James Mosenthal‚Äîwho started a major wool industry. By their enterprise in going to Asia and returning with thirty Angora goats in 1856 they became the originators of the mohair industry. Aaron and Daniel de Pass were the first to open up Namaqualand, and from 1849 to 1886 they were the largest shipowners in Cape Town, and leaders of the sealing, whaling, and fishing industries. Jews were among the first to take to ostrich-farming and played a role in the early diamond industry. Jews also played some part in early South African politics. Captain Joshua Norden was shot at the head of his Mounted Burghers in the Xhosa War of 1846; Lieutenant Elias de Pass fought in the Xhosa War of 1849. Julius Mosenthal (1818‚Äì1880), brother of the poet S. Mosenthal of Vienna, was a member of the Cape Parliament in the 1850s. Simeon Jacobs, C.M.G. (1832‚Äì1883), who was a judge in the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, as the acting attorney- general of Cape Colony he introduced and carried in 1872 the Cape Colony Responsible Government Bill and the Voluntary Bill (abolishing state aid to the Anglican Church), for both of which bills Saul Solomon, the member for Cape Town, had fought for decades. Saul Solomon (b. St. Helena 25 May 1817; d. 16 October 1892), the leader of the Cape Colony Liberal Party, has been called the \\"Cape Disraeli.\\" He was invited into the first Responsible government, formed by Sir John Molteno, and declined the premiership itself several times. Like Disraeli, too, he early left the ranks of Judaism. At the same time, the Jews faced substantial antisemitism. Though freedom of worship was granted to all residents in 1870, the revised Grondwet of 1894 still debarred Jews and Catholics from military posts, from the positions of president, state secretary, or magistrate, from membership in the First and Second Volksraad (\\"parliament\\"), and from superintendencies of natives and mines. These positions were restricted to persons above 30 years of age with permanent property and a longer history of settlement. As a consequence of the fact that Boer republics were only in existence from 1857 to 1902, unfortunately many residents of the Boer republics had limited access to positions in the upper echelons of government. All instruction was to be given in a Christian and Protestant spirit, and Jewish and Catholic teachers and children were to be excluded from state-subsidized schools. Before the Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), Jews were often considered uitlanders (\\"foreigners\\") and excluded from the mainstream of South African life. However, a small number of Jews also settled among and identified with the rural white Afrikaans-speaking population; these persons became known as Boerejode (Boer Jews). A measure of intermarriage also occurred and was generally accepted. The South African gold rush began after 1886, attracting many Jews. In 1880, the Jewish population of South Africa numbered approximately 4,000; by 1914 it had grown to more than 40,000.Aubrey Newman, Nicholas J. Evans, J. Graham Smith & Saul W. Issroff, Jewish Migration to South Africa: The Records of the Poor Jews‚Äô Temporary Shelter, 1885-1914 (Cape Town: Jewish Publications-South Africa, 2006) . So many of them came from Lithuania that some referred to the population as a colony of Lithuania; Johannesburg was also occasionally called \\"Jewburg\\".Martin Gilbert, The Jews in the Twentieth Century, (New York: Schocken Books, 2001). =Second Anglo- Boer War: 1899‚Äì1902= Jews fought on both sides during the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). Some of the most notable fights during the three years' Boer War ‚Äî such as the Gun Hill incident before the Siege of Ladysmith ‚Äî involved Jewish soldiers like Major Karri Davies. Nearly 2,800 Jews fought on the British side and the London Spectator counted that 125 were killed. (Jewish Encyclopedia) Around 300 Jews served among the Boers during the Second Boer War and were known as Boerjode: those who had citizenship rights were conscripted along with other burghers (\\"citizens\\"), but there were also a number of volunteers. Jews fought under the Boers' Vierkleur (\\"four coloured\\") flag in many of the major battles and engagements and during the guerilla phase of the war, and a dozen are known to have died. Around 80 were captured and held in British concentration camps in South Africa. Some were sent as far afield as St. Helena, Bermuda, and Ceylon to where they had been exiled by the British. Some Jews were among the Bittereinders (\\"Bitter Enders\\") who fought on long after the Boer cause was clearly lost.(Jewish Encyclopedia) & (Saks, 2005) =From Union through World War II= Although the Jews were allowed equal rights after the Boer War, they again became subject to persecution in the days leading up to World War II. In 1930, the Quota Act of 1930 was intended to curtail the entry of Jews into South Africa. The vast majority of Jews immigrating to South Africa came from diaspora communities in Lithuania. The 1937 The Aliens Act, motivated by a sharp increase the previous year in the number of German Jewish refugees coming to South Africa, brought the migration to almost a complete halt. Some Jews were able to enter the country, but many were unable to do so. A total of approximately six-and-a-half thousand Jews came to South Africa from Germany between the years 1933 and 1939.Cape Town Holocaust Centre Many Afrikaners (i.e., Boers) felt sympathy for Nazi Germany, and organizations like Louis Weichardt‚Äôs \\"Grayshirts\\" and the pro-Nazi Ossewabrandwag were openly anti-Semitic. During World War I, many Afrikaners, who had little respect for Britain, objected to the use of \\"Afrikaner women and children from the British concentration camps\\" in fighting the German territory of South West Africa on behalf of Britain. This had the effect of drumming up pro-German sentiment among a population of Afrikaners. The opposition National Party argued that the Aliens Act was too lenient and advocated a complete ban on Jewish immigration, a halt in the naturalization of Jewish permanent residents of South Africa and the banning of Jews from certain professions.The Rise of the South African Reich ‚Äì Chapter 4 After the war, the situation began to improve, and a large number of South African Jews, generally a fairly Zionist community, made aliyah to Israel. During this time, there were also two waves of Jewish immigration to Africa from the island of Rhodes, first in the 1900s and then after 1960.Jews from Rhodes in Central and Southern Africa Ren√©e Hirschon (Encyclopedia of Diasporas, Vol 2) =Post World War II= South African Jews and Israel Abba Eban, born in Cape Town, was Foreign Minister of Israel from 1966 to 1974. When the Afrikaner-dominated National Party came to power in 1948 it did not adopt an anti-Jewish policy despite its earlier position. In 1953 South Africa's Prime Minister, D. F. Malan, became the first foreign head of government to visit Israel though the trip was a \\"private visit\\" rather than an official state visit. This began a long history of cooperation between Israel and South Africa on many levels. The proudly Zionistic South African Jewish community, through such bodies as the South African Zionist Federation and a number of publications, maintained a cordial relationship with the South African government even though it objected to the policies of Apartheid being enacted. South Africa's Jews were permitted to collect huge sums of money to be sent on as official aid to Israel, in spite of strict exchange-control regulations. Per capita, South African Jews were reputedly the most financially supportive Zionists abroad. = Settlement of South African Jews in Israel = Savyon in Israel was built principally by South African Jews A number of South African Jews settled in Israel, forming a South African community in Israel. Perhaps the most famous South African community founded in Israel is Savyon, which remains the wealthiest suburb in Israel. Large houses were built in the style that the community was accustomed to from their life in South Africa, each with a pool, and developed around a country club.The Columbia Gazetteer of the World: P to Z - Page 3471, Saul Bernard Cohen - 2008  South Africa and Israel  Most African states broke ties with Israel after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and Israel began to view the similarly isolated South Africa cordially. Ethan A. Nadelmann claimed that the relationship developed due to the fact that many African countries broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the 1970s following the Six-Day War and Yom Kippur War, causing Israel to deepen relations with other isolated countries.Israel and Black Africa: A Rapprochement? Ethan A. Nadelmann. Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Jun., 1981), pp. 183-219 By the mid-1970s, Israel's relations with South Africa were warm. In 1975, the Israel‚ÄìSouth Africa Agreement was signed, and increasing economic cooperation between Israel and South Africa was reported, including the construction of a major new railway in Israel, and the building of a desalination plant in South Africa. In April 1976 South African Prime Minister John Vorster was invited to make a state visit, meeting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Later in 1976, the 5th Conference of Non-Aligned Nations in Colombo, Sri Lanka, adopted a resolution calling for an oil embargo against France and Israel because of their arms sales to South Africa. In 1977, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha visited Israel to discuss South African issues with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan. Benjamin Beit- Hallahmi, an Israeli professor of psychology, wrote in 1988 that the alliance between South Africa and Israel was one of the most underreported news stories of the past four decades and that Israel played a crucial role in the survival of the South African regime.Beit-Hallahmi, Benjamin (1988). The Israeli Connection: Whom Israel Arms and Why. pp. 108-109. Israel's collaboration with Apartheid South Africa was mentioned and condemned by various international organizations like the UN General Assembly (several times since 1974).Beit- Hallahmi, Benjamin (1988). The Israeli Connection: Whom Israel Arms and Why. p. 114. In 1987 Israel announced that it would be implementing sanctions against South Africa. By the beginning of the 1990s, military and economic ties between the two countries had been lost. Moderation and liberalism South African Jews have a history of political moderation and the majority supported opposition parties such as first the United Party, then the Liberal Party, Progressive Party and its successors during the decades of National Party apartheid rule. (See Liberalism in South Africa). The prime example of the more moderate approach is that of the highly assimilated Harry Oppenheimer (1908‚Äì2000) (born Jewish but converted to Anglicanism upon his marriage), the richest man in South Africa and the chairman of the De Beers and Anglo American corporations. He was a supporter of the liberal Progressive Party and its policies, believing that granting more freedom and economic growth to South Africa's Black African majority was good politics and sound economic policy. The banner for this cause was held high by Helen Suzman, as the lone Progressive Party member in South Africa's parliament, representing the voting district of Houghton, home to many wealthy Jewish families at the time. The Progressive Party (later renamed the Democratic Party and then the Democratic Alliance) was later led by Jewish politician, Tony Leon and his successor, Helen Zille. Zille is of Jewish descent, her parents separately left Germany in the 1930s to avoid Nazi persecution (her maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother were Jewish). In 1980, after 77 years of neutrality, South Africa's National Congress of the Jewish Board of Deputies passed a resolution urging \\"all concerned [people] and, in particular, members of our community to cooperate in securing the immediate amelioration and ultimate removal of all unjust discriminatory laws and practices based on race, creed, or colour\\". This inspired some Jews to intensify their anti-apartheid activism, but the bulk of the community either emigrated or avoided public conflict with the National Party government.The Jews of Africa The Jewish establishment and the majority of South African Jews remained focused on Jewish issues. A few rabbis spoke out against apartheid early, but they failed to gain support and it was not until 1985 that the rabbinate as a whole condemned apartheid (Adler 2000). The South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ) took the strongest stand of any of the Jewish movements in the country against apartheid. It opposed disinvestment while women in the movement engaged in social work as a form of protest. This includes the Moses Weiler School in Alexandra where for generations the school has been funded and led by women from the Progressive movement, even in opposition to the Bantu Education Act, 1953 (Feld 2014). Today De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer (right), the son of Harry Oppenheimer, and the grandson of Ernest Oppenheimer. Although the Jewish community peaked in the 1970s (at around 120,000), about 70,000 mostly nominally Orthodox, remain in South Africa. A proportion are secular, or have converted to Christianity. Despite low intermarriage rates (around 7%), approximately 1,800 Jews emigrate every year, mainly to Israel, Australia, Canada and the United States. The Jewish community in South Africa is currently the largest in Africa, and, although shrinking due to emigration, it remains one of the most nominally Orthodox communities in the world, although there is a significantly growing Progressive community, especially in Cape Town. The nation's Progressive communities are represented by the South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ). The current Orthodox Chief Rabbi, Warren Goldstein (2008), has been widely credited for initiating a \\"Bill of Responsibilities\\" which the government has incorporated in the national school curriculum. The Chief Rabbi has also pushed for community run projects to combat crime in the country. Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Glencore The community has become more observant and in Johannesburg, the largest centre of Jewish life with 66,000 Jews, there is a high number and density of kosher restaurants and religious centres. In politics, the Jewish community continues to have influence, particularly in leadership roles. Currently, the sole national Jewish newspaper, with a readership of about 40,000, is the South African Jewish Report.South African Jewish Report In 2008, a Jewish radio station, ChaiFM, commenced broadcasting in Johannesburg, and also broadcasting on the internet to the large South African \\"diaspora\\".http://chaifm.com Chai FM website Despite a fall in number, since 2003 the number of South African Jews has stabilised. The 2016 Community Survey mini-census conducted by Statistics South Africa found the largest numbers in the following municipalities: Johannesburg 23,420; Cape Town 12,672; Ethekwini (Durban) 3,599; Ekurhuleni (East Rand) 1,846; Tshwane (Pretoria) 1,579; Nelson Mandela Bay (Port Elizabeth) 623; Msunduzi (Pietermaritzburg) 600; Mangaung (Bloemfontein) 343; Stellenbosch 316; Buffalo City (East London) 251; Mbombela (Nelspruit) 242.http://nesstar.statssa.gov.za:8282/webview/ Lemba The Lemba or \\"wa- Remba\\" are a southern African ethnic group whose members are to be found in Zimbabwe and South Africa with some little known branches in Mozambique and Malawi. According to Tudor Parfitt they are thought to number 70,000.Parfitt, Tudor and Trevisan-Semi, E. (2002). Judaising Movements: Studies in the Margins of Judaism. London: Routledge Curzon.Parfitt, Tudor (2000). Journey to the Vanished City: the Search for a Lost Tribe of Israel. New York: Random House. They speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam, which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition. They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population. More recent research argues that DNA studies do not support claims for a specifically Jewish genetic heritage. Jewish education in South Africa Kosher meal approved by the Beth din of Johannesburg Traditionally, Jewish education in South Africa was conducted by the Cheder or Talmud Torah, while children received secular education at government and private schools. There were, initially, no formal structures in place for Rabbinical education. (Note that although the majority of South Africa's Jews are descendants of Lithuanian Jews who venerated Talmudic scholarship, the community did not establish schools or yeshivot for several decades.) An important change took place in 1948, when King David School was established as the first full-time dual-curriculum (secular and Jewish) Jewish day school ‚Äì the high school was established in 1955. Today, the King David schools are amongst the largest Jewish day schools in the world, with thousands of students. King David's equivalent in Cape Town is \\"Herzlia\\" (United Herzlia Schools) with Carmel School in Pretoria and Durban (both subsequently renamed), and the Theodore Herzl School in Port Elizabeth (est. 1959). Umhlanga Jewish Day School(subsequently renamed), was opened in January 2012, to cater for Jewish children in the greater Durban area.Umhlanga Jewish day school opens , myshtetl.co.za In total, nineteen Day Schools, affiliated to the South African Board of Jewish Education, have been established in the main centres. The Jewish day schools regularly place amongst the top in the country in the national Matric examinations The first religious day school, the Yeshiva College of South Africa, was established in the mid-1950s, drawing primarily on the popularity of the Bnei Akiva Religious Zionist youth movement. As an institution with hundreds of pupils, Yeshivah College is today the largest religious school in the country. Other educational institutions within this ideology include Phyllis Jowell Jewish Day School and Cape Town Torah High in Cape Town, the Kollel (Bet Mordechai) and Midrasha (Emunah) of Mizrachi, Johannesburg, and the Yeshiva of Cape Town, a Torah MiTzion Kollel. In parallel to the establishment of Yeshiva College, and drawing on the same momentum, several smaller yeshivot were opened, starting in the 1960s. The Yeshivah Gedolah of Johannesburg,http://www.rabbis.org/forms/Approved_Yeshivot.pdf#search=%22yeshivah%20gedolah%20johannesburg%22 established in 1973, is the best known of these, having trained dozens of South African Rabbis, including Chief Rabbi Dr. Warren Goldstein. The Yeshiva follows the \\"Telshe\\" educational model, although accommodates students from across the spectrum of Hashkafa (Hebrew: worldview, outlook, beliefs within orthodox Judaism). This era also saw the start of a large network of Chabad- Lubavitch activities and institutions. There is today a Lubavitch Yeshiva in Johannesburg (Lubavitch Yeshiva Gedolah of Johannesburg) serving the Chabad community, a Chabad Semicha programme in Pretoria (having ordained 98 Rabbis since its establishment in 2001Pretoria Hebrew Congregation - Machon L'Hora'ah untitled ), and Lubavitch Day schools in Johannesburg (the Torah Academy school) and Cape Town. Johannesburg boasts ten Chabad Houses, Cape Town two and Kwazulu-Natal one, all of which offer a variety of Torah classes and adult education and informal children's education programmes. The 1980s saw the establishment of a Haredi kollel, Yad Shaul, as well as the growth of a large baal teshuva (\\"returnees\\" [to observant Judaism]) movement ‚Äì this was supported by the Israel-based organizations Ohr Somayach and Aish HaTorah which established active branches in South Africa; Arachim also has an active presence. Ohr Somayach, South Africa operates a full-time Yeshiva in Johannesburg (\\"Yeshivas Meshech Chochma\\") ‚Äì with its Bet Midrash established in 1990, and its Kollel (Toras Chaim) in 1996 ‚Äì as well as a Midrasha (Ma'ayan Bina); it also runs a Bet Midrash in Cape Town. There are several Haredi boys' schools in Johannesburg, each associated with one of the yeshivot, as well as a Beis Yaakov girls' school. The Progressive Movement maintains a network of supplementary Hebrew and Religious classes at its temples. These schools are all affiliated to the SA Union for Progressive Judaism.

Today, \\"yakiniku\\" commonly refers to a style of cooking bite-size meat (usually beef and offal) and vegetables on gridirons or griddles over a flame of wood charcoals carbonized by dry distillation (sumibi, ÁÇ≠ÁÅ´) or a gas/electric grill, making it one of the most popular national dishes of Japan. In many parts of the world, yakiniku is also commonly referred to as \\"Japanese barbecue\\". The origin of contemporary yakiniku has become a subject of debate, though it is conventionally considered to have been inspired by similar Korean cuisine. In 2002 the NHK program NHK Ningen K≈çza (NHK‰∫∫ÈñìË¨õÂ∫ß, NHK Humanity Lecture) stated that: \\"While some tend to think that yakiniku came from Korea, it was born in post war Japan.\\"2002Âπ¥6ÊúàÔΩû7ÊúàÊúüÔºàÊúàÊõúÊó•ÔºâÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Å™ÈüìÂõΩ ÂõõÊñπÁî∞Áä¨ÂΩ¶ Á¨¨‰∫îÂõû„ÄåÈ£ü‰∫ã„Å´Ë¶ã„Çã‰∏ñÁïåË¶≥ Nonetheless, it remains categorically associated with similar Korean cuisine, with various dishes, such as bulgogi, being modified to better appeal to Japanese tastes.Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan: Indigenous and colonial others, Michael Weiner (P236) \\"Yakiniku is a Japanese word simply meaning \\"cooked meat\\" and used to denote a grilled meat cuisine found in Korean restaurants in Japan.

The ingredients are cooked by the diners on a grill built into the table, several pieces at a time. The ingredients are then dipped in sauces known as tare before being eaten. The most common sauce is made of soy sauce mixed with sake, mirin, sugar, garlic, fruit juice and sesame. Garlic-and-shallot or miso-based dips are sometimes used.

Ephebos (·ºîœÜŒ∑Œ≤ŒøœÇ) (often in the plural epheboi), also anglicised as ephebe (plural: ephebes) or archaically ephebus (plural: ephebi), is a Greek term for a male adolescent, or for a social status reserved for that age, in Antiquity. History =Greece= Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis museum in Athens. Though the word can simply refer to the adolescent age of young men of training age, its main use is for the members, exclusively from that age group, of an official institution (ephebeia) that saw to building them into citizens, but especially training them as soldiers, sometimes already sent into the field; the Greek city state (polis) mainly depended, as the Roman republic before Gaius Marius' reform, on its militia of citizens for defense. In the time of Aristotle the names of the enrolled ephebi were engraved on a bronze pillar (formerly on wooden tablets) in front of the council-chamber. After admission to the college, the ephebus took the oath of allegiance, recorded in histories by Pollux and Stobaeus (but not in Aristotle), in the temple of Aglaurus, and was sent to Munichia or Acte to form one of the garrison. At the end of the first year of training, the ephebi were reviewed, and, if their performance was satisfactory, were provided by the state with a spear and a shield, which, together with the (cloak) and (broad-brimmed hat), made up their equipment. In their second year they were transferred to other garrisons in Attica, patrolled the frontiers, and on occasion took an active part in war. During these two years they were free from taxation, and were generally not allowed to appear in the law courts as plaintiffs or defendants. The ephebi took part in some of the most important Athenian festivals. Thus during the Eleusinian Mysteries they were sent to fetch the sacred objects from Eleusis and to escort the image of Iacchus on the sacred way. They also performed police duty at the meetings of the ecclesia. After the end of the 4th century BC, the institution underwent a radical change. Enrolment ceased to be obligatory, lasted only for a year, and the limit of age was dispensed with. Inscriptions attest a continually decreasing number of ephebi, and with the admission of foreigners the college lost its representative national character. This was mainly due to the weakening of the military spirit and the progress of intellectual culture. The military element was no longer all-important, and the ephebia became a sort of university for well-to-do young men of good family, whose social position has been compared with that of the Athenian \\"knights\\" of earlier times. The institution lasted till the end of the 3rd century A.D. In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 20, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it. =Rome= In Rome, where the elite (mainly patricians) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the Latinate form ephebus (plural ephebi), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket. Several new officials were introduced, one of special importance being the director of the Diogeneion, where youths under age were trained for the ephebia. At this period the college of ephebi was a miniature city; its members called themselves \\"citizens\\", and it possessed an archon (ruler), strategos, herald and other officials, after the model of ancient Athens. Sculpture In Ancient Greek sculpture, an ephebe is a sculptural type depicting a nude ephebos (Archaic examples of the type are also often known as the kouros type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form \\"the Ephebe\\", where is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the Agrigento Ephebe).

The commission operated under a two- year mandate, from 1997 to 1999, and employed three commissioners: one Guatemalan man, one male non-national, and one Mayan woman. The mandate of the commission was not to judge but to clarify the past with \\"objectivity, equity and impartiality.\\" Among other things, the commission revealed that over 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during the conflict and attributed 93% of the violations to state forces and related paramilitary groups. The commission noted that during the conflict the distinction between combatant and non-combatant was not respected and as a result many children, priests, indigenous leaders, and innocent women and men were killed. The CEH aimed to instill national harmony, promote peace, foster a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights, and preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.  Historical context of the conflict  Guatemala is a multiethnic, pluricultural and multilingual nation and has been plagued by violence and exclusion directed at the poorest and most vulnerable, specifically the indigenous (Mayan) communities. A colonial legacy left power in the hands of an elite minority, much like many other Latin American countries. Repression was omnipresent ‚Äî specifically with regards to insurgent groups. In 1954 Guatemala's democratically elected President Jacobo √Årbenz was overthrown by a U.S.backed right-wing military dictator, Carlos Castillo Armas, in a military coup d'√©tat. The 36 year Guatemalan civil war began in the early 1960s with a military rebellion by left-wing insurgency groups against the new regime. In response, the Guatemalan government employed counter-insurgency tactics, and state-based violence and terror began to escalate. The conflict intensified in the 1970s and saw the height of its destruction and casualties in the 1979 - 1984 period. Guatemala's civil war concluded with the 1996 Oslo Agreement which declared a formal ceasefire between the Guatemalan government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca, URNG) forces. There is a plethora of root causes of Guatemala's 36 year civil war. Guatemala's economy, heavily based on coffee and sugar exports, relied on the exploitation of indigenous labour and land. A democratic regime and Marxist insurgencies posed a direct threat to the political and economic elite as well as their main trading partner ‚Äî the United States. As a result, the state magnified the military threat posed by the insurgency and launched attacks that lead to civilian massacres and violations of human rights of any suspected \\"supporters\\" of the guerrilla. In addition, under a Cold War context, anti-communist sentiment permeated the U.S. - Guatemalan discourse and thus counterinsurgency against the Marxist insurgency groups was more severe.  The CEH  = Creation = In June 1994 the Guatemalan government and the URNG, under advisory by the UN Secretary General and the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), signed the \\"Agreement on the establishment of the Commission to clarify past human rights violations and acts of violence that have caused the Guatemalan population to suffer,\\" which led to the creation of the CEH. Aside from pressure from the UN Secretary General to work towards truth and reconciliation, the road to the CEH was influenced by the Catholic Church ‚Äî specifically when it created the Human Rights Office of the Archdiocese of Guatemala (ODHA) in the mid 1990s. = Mandate = With a belief that uncovering the truth would make national reconciliation a possibility and authentic democracy a reality, the CEH aimed not to judge but to clarify the past with \\"objectivity, equity and impartiality.\\" The commission aimed to ask and answer questions such as: * Why were civilians ‚Äî particularly Mayans ‚Äî targeted? * Why did defenceless children suffer? * Why were basic rules of humanitarian law ignored or not respected? Instillation of national harmony, promotion of peace, the creation of a culture of mutual respect regarding human rights and the preservation of the memory of the victims was of paramount importance to the commission. Guatemalans and external actors in favour of the commission's work wanted to record Guatemala's bloody past. There is awareness with regards to the systematic violation of human rights during the civil war, but the acts committed and their consequences have yet to become entrenched in the national consciousness and historical memory of Guatemalans. = Commission logistics = The commission's duration lasted two years, from February 1997 to February 1999. Its three commissioners were: * German law professor Christian Tomuschat, of Berlin's Humboldt University, named by the UN Secretary-General to chair the CEH * Otilia Lux de Coti, a Mayan scholar nominated by Tomuschat with the agreement of the parties * Edgar Alfredo Balsells Tojo, a lawyer also nominated by Tomuschat with the agreement of the parties The process of the commission was complex and was by no means solely a national effort. Throughout the two year mandate of the commission, multiple countries ‚Äî including Austria, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom ‚Äî provided monetary, political and moral support. The U.S. provided declassified documents crucial to the commission, and the UN Secretary General promoted the project and facilitated the contribution of monetary resources and expert knowledge through various UN bodies. The commission, as outlined in its charter, was to be composed of the current moderator of the peace negotiations (appointed by the UN Secretary General), one Guatemalan citizen (appointed by the aforementioned moderator and agreed upon by both parties), and one academic (selected by the monitor from a list comprised by Guatemalan university presidents and approved by both parties). At the height of the investigations, the commission had a staff of 269 and 14 field offices. The staff consisted of both national, and international commissioners ‚Äî who accounted for just under half of employees. By the end of the CEH's duration, 2000 communities had been visited and testimonies were received from approximately 20,000 people. = Restrictions = The restrictions of the Commission were as follows: responsibility could not be attributed to any individual ‚Äî naming names was not allowed; the findings and conclusions of the CEH could not have judicial repercussions; and the commission would have a six-month mandate ‚Äî extendable to 18 months. The final restriction was not upheld as the commission duration lasted two years. In addition, the CEH had no subpoena powers. = Presentation = The CEH's report, Memory of Silence (Memoria del Silencio) was presented in February 1999 in a 12 volume report to representatives of the URNG and the Guatemalan government as well as Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General. The report is available online for public access in both English and Spanish.  Report findings  For the CEH it was clear that in order to understand the past and move forward on a trajectory for peace, an in-depth analysis of the causes of the civil war was required. They concluded that the four main causes of the conflict were as follows: Structural injustice, closing of free, public spaces, anti-democracy trajectory, Cold War context and international influence. The CEH also investigated Guatemala's systemic problems. They concluded that the structure and nature of economic, cultural and social relations in Guatemala are marked by profound exclusion, antagonism and conflict ‚Äî a reflection of its colonial history. In addition, they found the absence of effective state social policy to have accentuated the historical dynamic of exclusion. In fact, they state, most recent state policy has produced inequality and endemic institutional weakness perpetuates the discrepancies among demographics. Leading up to the conflict, civil and political rights were suppressed and public venues were closed to prevent the spread of anti-government sentiment and other revolutionary thinking. During the armed conflict, the incapacity of the state to deal with political instability led to the creation of an intricate system of repression including an underground, illegal punitive system. Military intelligence was the conflict's driving force. Impunity permeated Guatemala's political system. = Human rights violations: statistics = The principal focus on the CEH was with regards to human rights violations during the civil war. They registered a total of 42,275 casualties by human rights violations and acts of violence, of that 23,671 were victims of arbitrary execution and 6,159 by forced disappearance. Estimates of those killed or disappeared during the conflict reach as high as 200,000. In terms of demographics, the CEH found that 83% of \\"fully identified\\" victims were Mayan and 17% Ladino. 93% of the violations were attributed to state forces and related paramilitary groups and 3% to insurgency groups. Among the victims of arbitrary execution, forced disappearance, torture, rape and other violations of fundamental rights were children, priests, indigenous leaders as well as non-combatant women and men with no ties to insurgency groups.  Recommendations  The CEH highlighted seven main recommendations for Guatemala's government as it embarked upon a path of peace and reconciliation. These recommendations were created in accordance with the UN draft \\"Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparations for Victims of Violation of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law\\" (E/CN.4/Sub2/1996/17). # Take measures to preserve the memory of the victims # Those responsible for the crimes should assume responsibility # Restoration of material possessions and economic compensation # Conduct investigations into all known forced disappearances # Creation of an immediate exhumation policy of all victims' remains # Foster mutual respect and observance of human rights # Strengthen the democratic process (judicial and military reform) Throughout the recommendations the CEH highlights the need for indigenous political participation.  Aftermath  = Implementation of recommendations = The Guatemalan army was opposed to many human rights aspects of the 1996 Peace Accords including the creation and work of the CEH. They argued that these tools were to be used by the insurgency groups to garner political support and military strength. However, support for human rights focused accords and commissions were strongly supported by the URNG, the Catholic Church, and various civil society and human rights based groups. Problems the commission faced were primarily based on political and ideological disagreements. In fact, although the CEH finally came to fruition, its progress was stalled when the army stated its clear opposition to the commission and the URNG affirmed its inclusion as non- negotiable. Since the report was released in 1999, progress has been made with regards to compliance of the aforementioned recommendations. In 2000 Guatemala ratified the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearances, the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights regarding social economic and cultural rights, and the Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In 2002 it ratified the Optional Protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, regarding the participation of children in armed conflicts and the recognition of the competence of the Committee Against Torture to receive individual complaints in 2003. Although these accords have been signed and ratified, their content has yet to be integrated into current and future domestic plans. In addition, in 2003, 20 years after the majority of human rights violations occurred, a National Reparations Program was established. In accordance with the CEH's statement that the state was obligated to investigate crimes committed during the conflict, Jos√© Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt‚Äî former military dictator ‚Äî was tried and convicted for genocide and crimes against humanity. However, for multiple reasons his trial was suspended until January 2015, then further suspended until January 2016. A closed-door trial began in March 2016. Rios Montt died while the trial was still ongoing. = Critiques and controversy = One of the most controversial revelations of the commission was its statement that at no time during the conflict did guerrilla groups have the military potential to pose an immediate threat to the state or its army. The state was well aware that the insurgency did not represent a real threat to Guatemalan political order. It has been argued that they deliberately magnified the military threat of the insurgency to justify the crimes they committed. In the several years following the release of the CEH's report, scholars have analysed its effectiveness in preventing conflict and creating national harmony as highlighted in the commission's mandate. Jeff Corntassel and Cindy Holder argue that state-facilitated truth mechanisms are fundamentally flawed if they do not address historic and ongoing injustices against indigenous groups ‚Äî this is particularly relevant in Guatemala considering 83% of the victims in the conflict were indigenous. In addition, Rachel Sieder has investigated judicial reform and violence in postwar Guatemala and states that homicide rates in fact were higher in 2011 than during the height of the armed conflict. The effectiveness of the CEH is highly contested, however it has seen successes ‚Äî particularly with the opening of spaces like 'La casa de la memoria' which exist to preserve the memory of the conflict's victims.

It is closely related to Schweizer's reagent, which is used for the production of cellulose fibers in the production of rayon. It is used to print fabrics, used as a pesticide and to make other copper compounds like copper nano-powder. Synthesis This compound can be prepared by adding concentrated solution of ammonia to a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulfate pentahydrate followed by precipitation of the product with ethanol.Editor G.Brauer \\"Tetraamminecopper (II) Sulfate\\" Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry, 2nd Ed., Academic Press, 1965, New York.

Often, the dark blue-violet color is used as a positive test to verify the presence of Cu2+ in a solution.  Structure and properties The solid state salt of tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate contains the complex ion [Cu(NH3)4H2O]2+, which has a square pyramidal molecular geometry. The bond length between the atoms in the crystal are measured using X-ray crystallography; the Cu-N and Cu-O distances are about 210 and 233 pm, respectively.Morosin \\"The Crystal Structures of Copper Tetraammine Complexes.

The combination of the correct concentrations will produce the highest absorbance read out on the colorimeter and as a result the formula of the complex can be verified. Corrosion The characteristic deep blue colour of the tetraammine complex is found in brass and copper alloys where attack from ammonia has occurred, leading to cracking. The problem was first found in ammunition cartridge cases when they were stored near animal waste, which produced trace amounts of ammonia. This type of corrosion is known as season cracking. Uses The closely related Schweizer's reagent is used for the production of cuprammonium rayon. Most pesticides contain ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate is used as an agricultural spray adjuvant for water-soluble insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. There, it functions to bind iron and calcium cations that are present in both well water and plant cells. It is particularly effective as an adjuvant for 2, 4-D (amine), glyphosate, and glufosinate herbicides.American Elements ‚Äì The material science company; tetraammine copper(II) sulfate monohydrate; CAS 10380-29-7 The brilliant dark blue-violet color and a good solubility make tetraammine copper (II) sulfate an excellent chemical to dye fabrics. Some of the recent research and development for copper include various studies of tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate. One such research is \\"Chemical reduction method for preparing copper nano-powder with high purity using sodium hypophosphite as reductant\\", which uses tetraaminecopper (II) sulfate. Other property The magnetic and thermal properties of tetraammine copper (II) sulfate monohydrate have been extensively studied and have been interpreted as those of a substance containing a magnetic linear chain structure. In 1967, Saito & Kanda conducted proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies on this material in the paramagnetic and ordered state. Unfortunately, the lack of proton positions prevented a quantitative interpretation of these data. Since the early crystallographic study by Mazzi (1955) reported a structure based on projected data and indicated an unusual coordination about the copper ion, a detail structure determination was considered necessary for any future quantitative interpretation of the observed resonance data.Li, Yudan; Wang, Wenjie; He, Chuan.; Chemical reduction method for preparing copper nanopowder with high purity using sodium hypophosphite as reductant, Faming Zhuanli Shenqing, December 4, 2013, CN 103418801 An ammonia solution of tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate.

Many freeway revolts took place in developed countries during the 1960s and 1970s, in response to plans for the construction of new freeways, as advocated for by the highway lobby. A significant number of these highways were abandoned or significantly scaled back due to widespread public opposition, especially of those whose neighborhoods would be disrupted or displaced by the proposed freeways, and due to various other negative effects that freeways are considered to have. Australia While anti-freeway activism in Australia has not been as vocal as in North America, small-scale revolts against freeway construction have occurred in Sydney and Melbourne, with many protesting toll collection. =Melbourne= Melbourne saw protests against the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, mostly by those in the impacted inner-city areas. In 1974, 150 residents protesting plans for the F-19 freeway through Collingwoodhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat;=19740429&id;=oxAQAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=wpADAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7021,6757387 put themselves in front of construction equipment in an attempt to halt construction. In 1978, protesters rallied to defend Gardiners Creek in Kooyong, which was in the path of the South Eastern Freeway. In 1984, over 100 protesters rallied against the widening of Punt Road to become the Hoddle Highway. Many of the unbuilt freeways were eventually cancelled by change of government, but some projects were later resurrected. An umbrella organisation known as the Coalition Against Freeway Expansion (CAFE) was formed in 1994, and in the following year, 14 of its activists were arrested whilst protesting an Eastern Freeway extension and the partial demolition of Alexandra Parade. The aggressive police response was criticised, and led to the eventual disbandment of the group. One of the largest protests occurred in 2008 in Kensington, one of the areas most impacted by the proposed East-West road connection; it drew wider support due to opposition to the Eddington Transport Report. =Sydney= Sydney freeway protests have included large-scale green bans in the 1970s, which prevented freeway proposals that would have required the demolition of The Rocks historic precinct and The Domain gardens for freeway developments. In 1989, 200 protesters rallied against a proposed north-west tollway. In 1991, 150 anti-freeway protesters rallied outside Parliament House. In 1995, over 400 people protested the M2 Hills Motorway. =Hobart= Tasmanian Aboriginals have conducted protests against the construction of the Brighton Bypass. They have stated that construction of the bypass will suffer the loss of their heritage. Canada =Halifax= In Halifax, Nova Scotia the construction of an elevated waterfront freeway, Harbour Drive, was halted in the 1970s after local opposition to the proposed destruction of many historic buildings. All that remains of the project today is the Cogswell Interchange, a massive concrete structure widely considered a barrier between sections of the city. Its demolition is currently planned. =Montreal= Several areas were destroyed to make room for highways in the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, a historical preservation movement involving figures such as Sandy van Ginkel and Phyllis Lambert prevented a project to run the Ville-Marie Expressway along the waterfront of the Old Port, which would have demolished much of the then-unloved Old Montreal and cut the city off from the river. Many historic homes were demolished to make way for the western section of the autoroute, but the eastern section was reconceived as a tunnel skirting the southern edge of the downtown core and a sunken expressway along the inland edge of the old city. Since then, Old Montreal has undergone significant rehabilitation and is now a desirable residential and commercial district and the city's leading tourist area. Part of the sunken expressway has been covered over (see Quartier international de Montr√©al) and the section immediately north of Montreal City Hall is also slated to be covered. Another cancelled project would have seen Rue Berri converted into a north-south expressway, demolishing much of the Plateau Mont-Royal district. Only the portion south of Rue Cherrier was built. In recent years, protests took place regarding a proposal to extend the Ville-Marie in the axis of Rue Notre-Dame Est, as an 8-lane entrenched highway that would separate the residential neighborhood of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve from the St. Lawrence River. The current plan is to widen the current 4-lane road into a six-lane \\"urban boulevard\\" rather than converting it into a full-scale expressway. Some large road projects from the heyday of the automobile have since been removed at public demand. One of the most prominent was a large interchange at the corner of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins, which had long impeded pedestrian access along a major entryway into Mount Royal Park. The elevated structure was demolished in the early 2000s and replaced with a simpler, at-grade intersection. Another project nearing completion replaces the Bonaventure Expressway with an urban boulevard in the Griffintown neighborhood. =Toronto= During the 1950s, Toronto experienced the same sort of urban sprawl that was sweeping through the United States. Suburbs grew along existing highway corridors, stretching the city east and west, and then northward along the various provincial superhighways. These highways ended at the city limits, however, and there was little route capacity within the city itself. This caused enormous traffic problems within the city,Sewell, pg. 65 and a network of new highways to address the problem became part of the Official Plan in 1959.Sewell, pg. 68 As construction of the network started, the mood of the citizens changed. By the mid-1960s, there was a growing awareness that the growth of the suburbs led to a flight of capital from the city cores, resulting in the urban decay being seen throughout the US. Additionally, several of the chosen routes ran through densely settled neighbourhoods, including some of the more upscale areas of Toronto, like Forest Hill and the University of Toronto. While the opposition was growing, Jane Jacobs moved to Toronto after having successfully rallied groups to cancel the construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway in New York City. Applying the same formula in Toronto, Jacobs rallied local groups to oppose development of the Spadina Expressway project, while twice being arrested in the process.Max Allen (1997), \\"Ideas that Matter: The Worlds of Jane Jacobs\\", pg. 170 On June 3, 1971, Premier Bill Davis rose in the Provincial Legislature and stated, \\"Cities were built for people and not cars. If we are building a transportation system to serve the automobile, the Spadina Expressway would be a good place to start. But if we are building a transportation system to serve people, the Spadina Expressway is a good place to stop.\\" The expressway plan was dead; construction of the Spadina Expressway ended. The successful outcome of inspired protests of varying degrees to other expressway projects in Toronto including the Scarborough, Richview, Crosstown and East Metro Expressway Projects. This led to none of the other planned expressways ever being built. Instead of expressways, Davis and his new Minister of Transport, Charles MacNaughton, outlined the \\"GO-Urban\\" plan, an Intermediate Capacity Transit System that will serve the Greater Toronto Area in place of expressways. This led to the development of Bombardier Innovia Metro. By the time the prototype was ready for service in the early 1980s, changes in the provincial government ended support for the entire GO-Urban project. Only a single short demonstration line was built in Toronto, the Scarborough RT.Mike Filey, \\"Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were\\", Dundurn Press, 1997, , pg. 38-40 =Windsor= Windsor, Ontario is an interesting case of freeway revolt that was later partially reversed. By 1965, the MTO had completed construction of Highway 401 from the south end of Windsor to the Thousand Islands Parkway and onward to the Quebec border. Plans were announced to extend the freeway along Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge, but residents and business owners along the route protested and killed the plan, leaving the freeway's terminus at Highway 3. In recent years, traffic had increased. A new bridge and freeway was needed; expropriation of nearby properties began in the late 2000s for Highway 401's extension to a new proposed border crossing. The Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway's construction, much of it below-grade, began in late 2011 and is expected to be completed by 2015. , the proposed Gordie Howe International Bridge which will continue Ontario 401 through the Delray neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan to I-75 is expected to be completed by 2023. =Edmonton= Original plans called for Alberta Highway 2 to continue into Edmonton, akin to the Deerfoot in Calgary, using 91st Street then descending into the Mill Creek Ravine. However residents along Mill Creek as well as many others who did not wish to have portions of the river valley destroyed at the expense of a freeway opposed the plans and as such they were never completed. The only portions to be completed were 91st Street, Wayne Gretzky Drive and the James MacDonald Bridge.This explains the bizarre look of the James MacDonald Bridge's nearby interchange, which was only meant to be temporary, however serves in its original state today. The plan would have also built a Downtown Freeway Loop encircling the city's downtown core, with freeways reaching out to all corners of Edmonton via present day Fort Road/Manning Drive/Wayne Gretzky Drive as the Northeast Freeway, St Albert/Mark Messier Trail as the Northwest Freeway, 111 St as the South Freeway, 91 St as the Southeast Freeway and would have the designation of Highway 2, and a freeway running along present day River Valley Road/Stony Plain Road and 100 Ave/Baseline Road, which was to be named the Jasper Freeway. While the projects were approved, they were ultimately killed because of cost and the 1978 Commonwealth Games in which Edmonton built an LRT system for instead. =Vancouver= In Vancouver, a freeway project that began with the construction of the Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts in the Strathcona neighborhood was stopped by activists and residents; the plan was intended to link an eight-lane freeway from the Trans- Canada Highway through the East End, destroying much of Chinatown. Before it was stopped, Vancouver's Hogan's Alley neighbourhood was largely demolished. The complete proposal in reports prepared by Swan-Wooster included a six lane tunnel to North Vancouver. An elevated freeway would have run along the Burrard Inlet waterfront, right through property where two Fairmont hotels and many other buildings have since been built. Another elevated freeway would have run through what is now the new portion of Yaletown, where the roundhouse is. It would likely have been adjacent to or above the current Pacific Avenue, between Old and New Yaletown. The Dunsmuir tunnel, a former freight railroad line of the CPR would also have been part of the freeway. This tunnel is now used by the SkyTrain Expo Line, a rapid transit line using the Bombardier Innovia Metro technology developed for Toronto. An attempt was made in 1995 to revive part of the project, adding three lanes of traffic to the north shore; it was also killed by public protest. Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of a long-term plan. This was taken as far as refusing to have a cloverleaf where the provincially authorized and funded Oak Street Bridge entered the city. It was allowed to enter directly onto Oak Street, but no other approaches were allowed for decades. As a result, the only freeway within city limits is the Trans-Canada Highway, which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. Very few major roads have been built in decades although the population would likely have doubled. The conflicting opinions of the City of Vancouver's residents, as represented by their successive councils, and the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation continue in 2013. Many of the suburbs also want more automobile access to Vancouver. The city resists additional cars entering from the suburbs. The province continues to build bridges and freeways throughout the region, but they end at the city's boundaries. Netherlands =Amsterdam= In Amsterdam in the 1970s, plans existed for a highway between the end of the A2 at the President Kennedylaan to the IJtunnel, along with the plans of the Amsterdam Metro around Nieuwmarkt. It would have demolished thousands of houses and monuments on its path, and therefore it led to the Nieuwmarkt riots in 1975. The metro was built, but the highway plans were removed. =Utrecht= In Utrecht, plans to build the A27 led to years of protests and juridical procedures, for example in October 1978, there was a big demonstration. Eventually in 1982, the Dutch Parliament had to decide whether to build or not. A narrow majority of 71 was in favour, 69 opposed. Parts of Amelisweerd were occupied by activists after the decision. The encampment, established by the activists, was evacuated by police and 465 trees were cut down and bulldozed. At the same time a procedure opposing the tree felling was started, however, a municipality lawyer reported that the last tree had already been cut down. Thus the short-term procedure failed to achieve its aim.http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2009/01_januari/26/verrijkingsonderdelen/0126_1630_amelisweerd_geschiedenis.xml After the motorway was completed in 1986, more congestion arose on the motorway. In 2009, new plans were made to extend the road from 2x4 lanes to 2x6 or even 2x7. The start of the construction in 2011 led again to protests, with clearly visible banners along the motorway. United Kingdom  United States  In the United States the \\"revolts\\" occurred mainly in cities and suburbs. Many cities have unused highways, abruptly terminating freeway alignments, and short stretches of freeway in remote areas, all evidence of larger projects which were never completed. In some instances, freeway revolts have led to the eventual removal or relocation of freeways that had been built.

At age 7, the twins took musical lessons from their uncle in which John took an interest in drums and percussion. They attended Catholic school and eventually they were part of a three-piece band in which John played drums and Chuck played guitar. They would play weddings at age 12 and were paid $15 apiece. Then, in 1961, John, Chuck, and their neighbor, Dennis DeYoung, formed a band called The Tradewinds in which John played drums, Chuck played guitar, and Dennis played the accordion and sang. They played local gigs at bars and began gaining popularity as a garage band on the city's South Side.

Cosmic dust, also called extraterrestrial dust or space dust, is dust which exists in outer space, or has fallen on Earth. Most cosmic dust particles measure between a few molecules and 0.1 mm (100 micrometers). Larger particles are called meteoroids. Cosmic dust can be further distinguished by its astronomical location: intergalactic dust, interstellar dust, interplanetary dust (such as in the zodiacal cloud) and circumplanetary dust (such as in a planetary ring). In the Solar System, interplanetary dust causes the zodiacal light. Solar System dust includes comet dust, asteroidal dust, dust from the Kuiper belt, and interstellar dust passing through the Solar System. Thousands of tons of cosmic dust are estimated to reach the Earth's surface every year,Spacecraft Measurements of the Cosmic Dust Flux\\", Herbert A. Zook. with most grains having a mass between 10‚àí16 kg (0.1 pg) and 10‚àí4 kg (100 mg). The density of the dust cloud through which the Earth is traveling is approximately 10‚àí6 dust grains/m3.\\"Applications of the Electrodynamic Tether to Interstellar Travel\\" Gregory L. Matloff, Less Johnson, February, 2005 Cosmic dust contains some complex organic compounds (amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic‚Äìaliphatic structure) that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. A smaller fraction of dust in space is \\"stardust\\" consisting of larger refractory minerals that condensed as matter left by stars. Interstellar dust particles were collected by the Stardust spacecraft and samples were returned to Earth in 2006. Study and importance Artist's impression of dust formation around a supernova explosion. Cosmic dust was once solely an annoyance to astronomers, as it obscures objects they wished to observe. When infrared astronomy began, the dust particles were observed to be significant and vital components of astrophysical processes. Their analysis can reveal information about phenomena like the formation of the Solar System. For example, cosmic dust can drive the mass loss when a star is nearing the end of its life, play a part in the early stages of star formation, and form planets. In the Solar System, dust plays a major role in the zodiacal light, Saturn's B Ring spokes, the outer diffuse planetary rings at Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and comets. Zodiacal light caused by cosmic dust. The interdisciplinary study of dust brings together different scientific fields: physics (solid-state, electromagnetic theory, surface physics, statistical physics, thermal physics), fractal mathematics, surface chemistry on dust grains) meteoritics, as well as every branch of astronomy and astrophysics. These disparate research areas can be linked by the following theme: the cosmic dust particles evolve cyclically; chemically, physically and dynamically. The evolution of dust traces out paths in which the Universe recycles material, in processes analogous to the daily recycling steps with which many people are familiar: production, storage, processing, collection, consumption, and discarding. Observations and measurements of cosmic dust in different regions provide an important insight into the Universe's recycling processes; in the clouds of the diffuse interstellar medium, in molecular clouds, in the circumstellar dust of young stellar objects, and in planetary systems such as the Solar System, where astronomers consider dust as in its most recycled state. The astronomers accumulate observational ‚Äòsnapshots‚Äô of dust at different stages of its life and, over time, form a more complete movie of the Universe's complicated recycling steps. Parameters such as the particle's initial motion, material properties, intervening plasma and magnetic field determined the dust particle's arrival at the dust detector. Slightly changing any of these parameters can give significantly different dust dynamical behavior. Therefore, one can learn about where that object came from, and what is (in) the intervening medium.  Detection methods  Cosmic dust of the Andromeda Galaxy as revealed in infrared light by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Cosmic dust can be detected by indirect methods that utilize the radiative properties of the cosmic dust particles. Cosmic dust can also be detected directly ('in-situ') using a variety of collection methods and from a variety of collection locations. Estimates of the daily influx of extraterrestrial material entering the Earth's atmosphere range between 5 and 300 tonnes. NASA collects samples of star dust particles in the Earth's atmosphere using plate collectors under the wings of stratospheric-flying airplanes. Dust samples are also collected from surface deposits on the large Earth ice-masses (Antarctica and Greenland/the Arctic) and in deep-sea sediments. Don Brownlee at the University of Washington in Seattle first reliably identified the extraterrestrial nature of collected dust particles in the latter 1970s. Another source is the meteorites, which contain stardust extracted from them. Stardust grains are solid refractory pieces of individual presolar stars. They are recognized by their extreme isotopic compositions, which can only be isotopic compositions within evolved stars, prior to any mixing with the interstellar medium. These grains condensed from the stellar matter as it cooled while leaving the star. Cosmic dust of the Horsehead Nebula as revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope. In interplanetary space, dust detectors on planetary spacecraft have been built and flown, some are presently flying, and more are presently being built to fly. The large orbital velocities of dust particles in interplanetary space (typically 10‚Äì40 km/s) make intact particle capture problematic. Instead, in-situ dust detectors are generally devised to measure parameters associated with the high-velocity impact of dust particles on the instrument, and then derive physical properties of the particles (usually mass and velocity) through laboratory calibration (i.e. impacting accelerated particles with known properties onto a laboratory replica of the dust detector). Over the years dust detectors have measured, among others, the impact light flash, acoustic signal and impact ionisation. Recently the dust instrument on Stardust captured particles intact in low-density aerogel. Dust detectors in the past flew on the HEOS-2, Helios, Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Giotto, Galileo and Cassini space missions, on the Earth-orbiting LDEF, EURECA, and Gorid satellites, and some scientists have utilized the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft as giant Langmuir probes to directly sample the cosmic dust. Presently dust detectors are flying on the Ulysses, Proba, Rosetta, Stardust, and the New Horizons spacecraft. The collected dust at Earth or collected further in space and returned by sample-return space missions is then analyzed by dust scientists in their respective laboratories all over the world. One large storage facility for cosmic dust exists at the NASA Houston JSC. Infrared light can penetrate cosmic dust clouds, allowing us to peer into regions of star formation and the centers of galaxies. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope is the largest infrared telescope yet launched into space. It was carried by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its mission, Spitzer obtained images and spectra by detecting the thermal radiation emitted by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 micrometres. Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. Findings from the Spitzer have revitalized the studies of cosmic dust. One report showed some evidence that cosmic dust is formed near a supermassive black hole. Another detection mechanism is polarimetry. Dust grains are not spherical and tend to align to interstellar magnetic fields, preferentially polarizing starlight that passes through dust clouds. In nearby interstellar space, where interstellar reddening is not intense enough to be detected, high precision optical polarimetry has been used to glean the structure of dust within the Local Bubble. arXiv In 2019, researchers found interstellar dust in Antarctica which they relate to the Local Interstellar Cloud. The detection of interstellar dust in Antarctica was done by the measurement of the radionuclides Fe-60 and Mn-53 by highly sensitive Accelerator mass spectrometry. Radiative properties HH 151 is a bright jet of glowing material trailed by an intricate, orange-hued plume of gas and dust. A dust particle interacts with electromagnetic radiation in a way that depends on its cross section, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation, and on the nature of the grain: its refractive index, size, etc. The radiation process for an individual grain is called its emissivity, dependent on the grain's efficiency factor. Furthermore, we have to specify whether the emissivity process is extinction, scattering, absorption, or polarisation. In the radiation emission curves, several important signatures identify the composition of the emitting or absorbing dust particles. Dust particles can scatter light nonuniformly. Forward scattered light is light that is redirected slightly off its path by diffraction, and back-scattered light is reflected light. The scattering and extinction (\\"dimming\\") of the radiation gives useful information about the dust grain sizes. For example, if the in one's data is many times brighter in forward-scattered visible light than in back-scattered visible light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter. The scattering of light from dust grains in long exposure visible photographs is quite noticeable in reflection nebulae, and gives clues about the individual particle's light- scattering properties. In X-ray wavelengths, many scientists are investigating the scattering of X-rays by interstellar dust, and some have suggested that astronomical X-ray sources would possess diffuse haloes, due to the dust. Stardust Stardust grains (also called presolar grains by meteoriticists) are contained within meteorites, from which they are extracted in terrestrial laboratories. Stardust was a component of the dust in the interstellar medium before its incorporation into meteorites. The meteorites have stored those stardust grains ever since the meteorites first assembled within the planetary accretion disk more than four billion years ago. So-called carbonaceous chondrites are especially fertile reservoirs of stardust. Each stardust grain existed before the Earth was formed. Stardust is a scientific term referring to refractory dust grains that condensed from cooling ejected gases from individual presolar stars and incorporated into the cloud from which the Solar System condensed.Donald D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Moon & Planets 19, 109 (1978) Many different types of stardust have been identified by laboratory measurements of the highly unusual isotopic composition of the chemical elements that comprise each stardust grain. These refractory mineral grains may earlier have been coated with volatile compounds, but those are lost in the dissolving of meteorite matter in acids, leaving only insoluble refractory minerals. Finding the grain cores without dissolving most of the meteorite has been possible, but difficult and labor- intensive (see presolar grains). Many new aspects of nucleosynthesis have been discovered from the isotopic ratios within the stardust grains. An important property of stardust is the hard, refractory, high-temperature nature of the grains. Prominent are silicon carbide, graphite, aluminium oxide, aluminium spinel, and other such solids that would condense at high temperature from a cooling gas, such as in stellar winds or in the decompression of the inside of a supernova. They differ greatly from the solids formed at low temperature within the interstellar medium. Also important are their extreme isotopic compositions, which are expected to exist nowhere in the interstellar medium. This also suggests that the stardust condensed from the gases of individual stars before the isotopes could be diluted by mixing with the interstellar medium. These allow the source stars to be identified. For example, the heavy elements within the silicon carbide (SiC) grains are almost pure S-process isotopes, fitting their condensation within AGB star red giant winds inasmuch as the AGB stars are the main source of S-process nucleosynthesis and have atmospheres observed by astronomers to be highly enriched in dredged-up s process elements. Another dramatic example is given by the so-called supernova condensates, usually shortened by acronym to SUNOCON (from SUperNOva CONdensateD. D. Clayton, Moon and Planets 19, 109 (1978)) to distinguish them from other stardust condensed within stellar atmospheres. SUNOCONs contain in their calcium an excessively large abundance of 44Ca, demonstrating that they condensed containing abundant radioactive 44Ti, which has a 65-year half-life. The outflowing 44Ti nuclei were thus still \\"alive\\" (radioactive) when the SUNOCON condensed near one year within the expanding supernova interior, but would have become an extinct radionuclide (specifically 44Ca) after the time required for mixing with the interstellar gas. Its discovery proved the prediction from 1975 that it might be possible to identify SUNOCONs in this way. The SiC SUNOCONs (from supernovae) are only about 1% as numerous as are SiC stardust from AGB stars. Stardust itself (SUNOCONs and AGB grains that come from specific stars) is but a modest fraction of the condensed cosmic dust, forming less than 0.1% of the mass of total interstellar solids. The high interest in stardust derives from new information that it has brought to the sciences of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. Laboratories have studied solids that existed before the Earth was formed. This was once thought impossible, especially in the 1970s when cosmochemists were confident that the Solar System began as a hot gas virtually devoid of any remaining solids, which would have been vaporized by high temperature. The existence of stardust proved this historic picture incorrect. Some bulk properties Smooth chondrite interplanetary dust particle. Cosmic dust is made of dust grains and aggregates into dust particles. These particles are irregularly shaped, with porosity ranging from fluffy to compact. The composition, size, and other properties depend on where the dust is found, and conversely, a compositional analysis of a dust particle can reveal much about the dust particle's origin. General diffuse interstellar medium dust, dust grains in dense clouds, planetary rings dust, and circumstellar dust, are each different in their characteristics. For example, grains in dense clouds have acquired a mantle of ice and on average are larger than dust particles in the diffuse interstellar medium. Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are generally larger still. Major elements of 200 stratospheric interplanetary dust particles. Most of the influx of extraterrestrial matter that falls onto the Earth is dominated by meteoroids with diameters in the range 50 to 500 micrometers, of average density 2.0 g/cm¬≥ (with porosity about 40%). The total influx rate of meteoritic sites of most IDPs captured in the Earth's stratosphere range between 1 and 3 g/cm¬≥, with an average density at about 2.0 g/cm¬≥. Other specific dust properties: in circumstellar dust, astronomers have found molecular signatures of CO, silicon carbide, amorphous silicate, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, water ice, and polyformaldehyde, among others (in the diffuse interstellar medium, there is evidence for silicate and carbon grains). Cometary dust is generally different (with overlap) from asteroidal dust. Asteroidal dust resembles carbonaceous chondritic meteorites. Cometary dust resembles interstellar grains which can include silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and water ice. In September 2020, evidence was presented of solid-state water in the interstellar medium, and particularly, of water ice mixed with silicate grains in cosmic dust grains. Dust grain formation The large grains in interstellar space are probably complex, with refractory cores that condensed within stellar outflows topped by layers acquired during incursions into cold dense interstellar clouds. That cyclic process of growth and destruction outside of the clouds has been modeled to demonstrate that the cores live much longer than the average lifetime of dust mass. Those cores mostly start with silicate particles condensing in the atmospheres of cool, oxygen-rich red-giants and carbon grains condensing in the atmospheres of cool carbon stars. Red giants have evolved or altered off the main sequence and have entered the giant phase of their evolution and are the major source of refractory dust grain cores in galaxies. Those refractory cores are also called stardust (section above), which is a scientific term for the small fraction of cosmic dust that condensed thermally within stellar gases as they were ejected from the stars. Several percent of refractory grain cores have condensed within expanding interiors of supernovae, a type of cosmic decompression chamber. Meteoriticists who study refractory stardust (extracted from meteorites) often call it presolar grains but that within meteorites is only a small fraction of all presolar dust. Stardust condenses within the stars via considerably different condensation chemistry than that of the bulk of cosmic dust, which accretes cold onto preexisting dust in dark molecular clouds of the galaxy. Those molecular clouds are very cold, typically less than 50K, so that ices of many kinds may accrete onto grains, in cases only to be destroyed or split apart by radiation and sublimation into a gas component. Finally, as the Solar System formed many interstellar dust grains were further modified by coalescence and chemical reactions in the planetary accretion disk. The history of the various types of grains in the early Solar System is complicated and only partially understood. Astronomers know that the dust is formed in the envelopes of late-evolved stars from specific observational signatures. In infrared light, emission at 9.7 micrometres is a signature of silicate dust in cool evolved oxygen-rich giant stars. Emission at 11.5 micrometres indicates the presence of silicon carbide dust in cool evolved carbon-rich giant stars. These help provide evidence that the small silicate particles in space came from the ejected outer envelopes of these stars.Evans 1994, pp. 164-167 Conditions in interstellar space are generally not suitable for the formation of silicate cores. This would take excessive time to accomplish, even if it might be possible. The arguments are that: given an observed typical grain diameter a, the time for a grain to attain a, and given the temperature of interstellar gas, it would take considerably longer than the age of the Universe for interstellar grains to form.Evans 1994, pp. 147‚Äì148 On the other hand, grains are seen to have recently formed in the vicinity of nearby stars, in nova and supernova ejecta, and in R Coronae Borealis variable stars which seem to eject discrete clouds containing both gas and dust. So mass loss from stars is unquestionably where the refractory cores of grains formed. Most dust in the Solar System is highly processed dust, recycled from the material out of which the Solar System formed and subsequently collected in the planetesimals, and leftover solid material such as comets and asteroids, and reformed in each of those bodies' collisional lifetimes. During the Solar System's formation history, the most abundant element was (and still is) H2. The metallic elements: magnesium, silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures of the planetary disk. Some molecules such as CO, N2, NH3, and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for example, graphite (C) and SiC would condense into solid grains in the planetary disk; but carbon and SiC grains found in meteorites are presolar based on their isotopic compositions, rather than from the planetary disk formation. Some molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the \\"refractory\\" (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores. Stardust once more provides an exception to the general trend, as it appears to be totally unprocessed since its thermal condensation within stars as refractory crystalline minerals. The condensation of graphite occurs within supernova interiors as they expand and cool, and do so even in gas containing more oxygen than carbon, a surprising carbon chemistry made possible by the intense radioactive environment of supernovae. This special example of dust formation has merited specific review. Planetary disk formation of precursor molecules was determined, in large part, by the temperature of the solar nebula. Since the temperature of the solar nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a dust grain's with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and at different times in the solar nebula. Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space, or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or comets. Due to their highly processed nature, IDPs (interplanetary dust particles) are fine-grained mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and amorphous components. We can picture an IDP as a \\"matrix\\" of material with embedded elements which were formed at different times and places in the solar nebula and before the solar nebula's formation. Examples of embedded elements in cosmic dust are GEMS, chondrules, and CAIs. From the solar nebula to Earth A dusty trail from the early Solar System to carbonaceous dust today. The arrows in the adjacent diagram show one possible path from a collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of the solar nebula. We can follow the trail to the right in the diagram to the IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the carbonaceous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the name implies, the carbonaceous chondrites are rich in carbon, and many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O (Jessberger, 2000). From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely oxidized and contain the lowest condensation temperature elements (\\"volatile\\" elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds. Therefore, dust particles with these elements are thought to have been formed in the early life of the Solar System. The volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K, therefore, the IDP grain \\"matrix\\" consists of some very primitive Solar System material. Such a scenario is true in the case of comet dust. The provenance of the small fraction that is stardust (see above) is quite different; these refractory interstellar minerals thermally condense within stars, become a small component of interstellar matter, and therefore remain in the presolar planetary disk. Nuclear damage tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. Solar wind ions impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40 AU would have many more times the density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt. Based on 2012 computer model studies, the complex organic molecules necessary for life (Extraterrestrial organic molecules) may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of the Earth. According to the computer studies, this same process may also occur around other stars that acquire planets. In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics ‚Äì \\"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively\\". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \\"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\\" In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for detecting and monitoring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to NASA scientists, over 20% of the carbon in the Universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are abundant in the Universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets. In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists. Some \\"dusty\\" clouds in the universe The Solar System has its own interplanetary dust cloud, as do extrasolar systems. There are different types of nebulae with different physical causes and processes: diffuse nebula, infrared (IR) reflection nebula, supernova remnant, molecular cloud, HII regions, photodissociation regions, and dark nebula. Distinctions between those types of nebula are that different radiation processes are at work. For example, H II regions, like the Orion Nebula, where a lot of star- formation is taking place, are characterized as thermal emission nebulae. Supernova remnants, on the other hand, like the Crab Nebula, are characterized as nonthermal emission (synchrotron radiation). Some of the better known dusty regions in the Universe are the diffuse nebulae in the Messier catalog, for example: M1, M8, M16, M17, M20, M42, M43. Some larger dust catalogs are Sharpless (1959) A Catalogue of HII Regions, Lynds (1965) Catalogue of Bright Nebulae, Lynds (1962) Catalogue of Dark Nebulae, van den Bergh (1966) Catalogue of Reflection Nebulae, Green (1988) Rev.

They are inhabited mainly by tribal dwellers, the majority of whom are Garo people. It is one of the wettest places in the world. The range is part of the Meghalaya subtropical forests ecoregion. People who reside in the Garo Hills are known as the Garos. Besides the Garo hills, there are Garo settlements in the plains of Assam and Bangladesh. The Garos call themselves A¬∑chik (locally used). Demographics Garo Hills comprises five districts. Tura is the largest town with a population of about 70,000 located at the foothills of often cloud covered Tura peak. The town is centrally located to other popular game and wildlife sanctuaries in the district such as the national parks of Balphakram and Nokrek, and several natural limestone caves (the Siju Cave is among the longest in Asia). These places are rich reserves of natural flora and fauna and a refuge for endangered animals. Society The traditional Garo female dress is a piece of cloth around the waist and a blouse or vest. The men usually wear, in addition to cloth, a turban. Males and females both wear bangles and earrings. The staple cereal food is rice. They also eat millet, maize, tapioca etc. Garos are very liberal in their food habits. Practically all available types of meat and animals are eaten. The liquor is not distilled, but prepared by brewing food grains. The society is matrilineal like the Khasis and the Jaintias. Till death, the newborn baby belongs to the mother's family, irrespective of sex, even after marriage. Marriage within the clan is completely prohibited and severely punishable for both the Khasis and the Garos. Till now, the institution of Bachelors dormitories which is gradually disappearing amongst the tribes of northeastern region, are found in the Garo villages. In such dormitories young people stay and live together till they are married. They receive various training in the dormitories like making various A'chik music instruments, wrestling or traditional sports, making of traditional bamboo baskets. This institution is similar to ancient agoges of Sparta. The Khasis and Garos are now mostly Christians. Before that they were nature-worshipers. Garo Hills known for its abundance of wildlife attracts naturalists and photographers to capture the multifaceted sights of a unique range of flora and fauna. Two mountain ranges - the Arabella range and the Tura range, pass through the Garo Hills, forming the great Balpakram valley in between. The headquarters town of Tura is 323 km from the state capital Shillong via Guwahati, at an altitude of 657 m. The highest point in the Garo Hills is Nokrek Peak with elevation of 1412 m. Tura has a picturesque landscape of hills against a backdrop of low-lying plains. A sunset view can be best seen from Tura Peak at 1,400 m and its summit can be reached by a 5 km trek, partly by hiking and also by rock-climbing.

The stalls' floor is level Bibiena school, northern Italy A rake or raked stage is a theatre stage that slopes upwards, away from the audience. Such a design was typical of English theatre in the Middle Ages and early Modern era, and improves the view and sound for spectators. It also helps with the illusion of perspective: when features of the scenery are made to align with a notional vanishing point beyond the rear of the stage, the rake supports the illusion. These elements of scenery are termed raking pieces. Raked seating refers to seating which is positioned on an upwards slope away from the stage, in order to give those in the audience at the back a better view than if the seats were all on the same level.Audotoria Services, What is raked seating?, published 19 February 2015, accessed 13 October 2019 Calculating incline The slope of the rake is measured by the number of horizontal units it takes for one vertical unit measured in the direction of the slope, or by the equivalent percentage. A rake of one horizontal unit to one vertical unit (1 in 1) would give an angle of 45¬∞ from the horizontal. Rakes of 1 in 18 (5.56%) to 1 in 48 (2.08%) were more common. Converting the rake ratio to an angle requires the application of some basic trigonometry. The angle in degrees = arctan(vertical/horizontal), where \\"vertical\\" is the vertical rise in distance and \\"horizontal\\" is the horizontal distance over which this rise occurs. For example, for a rake of 1:18, the corresponding angle is arctan(1/18) = 3.18¬∞. History Theatres constructed after the beginning of the 20th century feature a raked audience section. This change back to the method of construction seen in Greek and Roman theaters (flat stage and terraced audience) was effected due to the difficulty encountered when one tries to walk across a sloped surface, which had resulted in unnatural movement patterns to avoid the appearance of limping caused by the non-level surface. Raked stages can still be seen in some opera, Broadway and West End productions, where a temporary raked acting surface is built over a theatre's permanent flat stage. Creating a raked stage can also assist set designs which are designed with forced perspective. Upstaging On a raked stage an actor who is farther from the audience is higher than an actor who is closer to the audience. This led to the theatre positions \\"upstage\\" and \\"downstage\\", meaning, respectively, farther from or closer to the audience. The term \\"upstaging\\" refers to one actor moving to a more elevated position on the rake (stage), causing the upstaged actor (who stays more downstage, closer to the audience) to turn their back to the audience to address the cast member. The term \\"upstaging\\" has since taken on the figurative meaning of an actor unscrupulously drawing the audience's attention away from another actor.

Flora and fauna The hills are for the most part covered with dense bamboo jungle and rank undergrowth; but in the eastern portion, owing probably to a smaller rainfall, open grass-covered slopes are found, with groves of oak and pine interspersed with rhododendrons. The Blue Mountain is the highest peak in Lushai hills. Inhabitants These hills are inhabited by the Lushais and other Mizo tribes, but the population is extremely scanty. From the earliest known times the original inhabitants were Kukis, and the Lushais were not heard of until 1840, when they invaded the district from the north. Their first attack upon British territory took place in November 1849, and after that date they proved one of the most troublesome tribes on the north-east frontier of India; but operations in 1890 resulted in the complete pacification of the northern Lushai villages, and in 1892 the eastern Lushais were reduced to order.

Pantteri (Finnish for \\"panther\\"), sold in Sweden as Katten (Swedish: \\"Cat\\"), is a brand of Finnish salmiakki candy, made by Fazer. History Pantteri candies were first invented in 1965 as small, black salmiakki and liquorice gum drops in a typical cardboard candy box, with a picture of a panther on the box cover. A sugar coating was later added to the drops, slightly altering their taste. The most famous form of Pantteri, however, is the larger, sugar coated disc-shaped candies sold in a plastic bag, also with a picture of a panther on it. At first only salmiakki Pantteri candies were available, but in the 1990s Fazer introduced a fruit-flavoured version of Pantteri, \\"Pantteri Mix\\" (containing red, yellow and green fruit candies and normal salmiakki candies). In the 2000s, the Pantteri drops sold in boxes were reverted to the original 1965 version, without the sugar coating. The text on the box says \\"Original Pantteri drops from 1965\\". Later additions include \\"Lumipantteri Mix\\" (Finnish for \\"snow panther\\") in summer 2006, \\"Pantteri Mix\\" candies with white coating, \\"Musta Pantteri\\" (Finnish for \\"black panther\\"), which has a slightly higher ammonium chloride content than the regular salmiakki Pantteri, and \\"Pantteri Black Shot\\", candies with a salty liquorice filling. Discontinued variations include \\"Y√∂pantteri Mix\\" (\\"night panther\\") featuring fruit and salmiakki candies, shaped like panthers, stars and moons and \\"Rock Pantteri Mix\\", containing many different salty liquorice and fruit candies. Visible advertising campaigns are an important part of Pantteri's publicity image. They were awarded as best advertising campaign in Finland twice, in 1999 and 2000. One advertising campaign featured a fictional latino character called \\"El Pantero\\", sporting advertising slogans in mock Spanish such as \\"El Pantero baila\\" and \\"Baila y come\\".

The motor turned a screw, which in turn lengthened or shortens a cable, changing the compression characteristics of the heel pad. The shoe typically costs $250 in the U.S at launch. The changes were guided by a sensor in the heel, which determined how much the heel was compressed on each stride. The shoe was battery-powered, and lasted for approximately 100 hours of running.

The museum was established in 1867 with Julius von Haast ‚Äì whose collection formed its core ‚Äì as its first director. The building is registered as a \\"Historic Place ‚Äì Category I \\" by Heritage New Zealand. Directors The title curator and director has been used interchangeably during the history of Canterbury Museum. Von Haast was the museum's inaugural director; Haast died in 1887. Following Haast's death, Frederick Hutton was acting director until Henry Ogg Forbes took on a permanent position in December 1888 upon his return from England. In August 1892, Forbes permanently moved to England, and Hutton was appointed full director from May 1892 until October 1905. Hutton applied for leave to travel to England, and Charles Chilton was acting director from March 1905; Hutton died on his return journey from England and Chilton retained his acting role until April 1906, when Edgar Ravenswood Waite received a permanent appointment. Waite was director for eight years until March 1914, when he took the equivalent role at the South Australian Museum. Robert Speight, who had already been acting director in 1911, was appointed as Waite's successor in March 1914. Speight retired from this role in November 1935. Speight was succeeded by two acting directors who worked alongside one another; the geologist Robin Allan, and the zoologist Edgar Percival. They were succeeded by Robert Falla, who commenced his role on 1 March 1937 and who was director until 1947, when he accepted the same position at the Dominion Museum in Wellington. Walter Reginald Brock Oliver was acting director from November 1947 to September 1948. Roger Duff, who had been acting director on several occasions during Falla's tenure prior to Oliver, succeeded Falla as director from September 1948 until his sudden death on 30 October 1978. John Crum Wilson succeeded Duff as acting director from October 1978 to February 1979, and then as full director until February 1983. The archaeologist Michael Malthus Trotter succeeded him as director from March 1983 to December 1995. Stephen Phillips had an interim position from January to March 1996 until the current director, Anthony Wright, was appointed in March 1996. Construction The building, a Gothic Revival constructed on a design by Benjamin Mountfort, opened in 1870. Two years after its opening, the single-storey building was expanded with an additional floor in the Victorian Gothic style. The museum continued to grow over the next decade, with an addition built on in 1876 and an interior courtyard roofed in 1882. In 1958, a new wing was added adjacent to Christ's College, and another was built on in 1977. The building was strengthened in the mid-1990s and a four-storey block was added in 1995. Earthquake impact The museum sustained minor damage to its fa√ßade during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, but remains structurally sound. This can perhaps be attributed to the progressive strengthening and renovating of the buildings to earthquake standards between 1987 and 1995. An estimated 95% of the collections were unharmed. The statue of William Rolleston, located at the front of the museum, toppled off its plinth during the quake. The museum reopened on 2 September 2011.

Argentina Cabrito is also a regional specialty of C√≥rdoba Province in Argentina, especially the town of Quilino, which has a festival in its honour. \\"Chivito\\" differs from \\"cabrito\\" in that chivito is a slightly older animal with less tender meat. The chivito has already begun to eat solid foods, whereas the cabrito is still a suckling. Mexico It is a regional specialty of the city of Monterrey, Mexico, and the surrounding state of Nuevo Leon, based on the Jewish cuisine of the founders of the city. In northern Mexico, cabrito is cooked in a variety of ways: * Cabrito al pastor: The best-known and perhaps most popular form. The whole carcass is opened flat and impaled on a spit. The spit is then placed next to a bed of glowing embers and roasted slowly in the open air without seasonings other than the light scent it will absorb from the slow- burning charcoal. * Cabrito al horno (oven-roasted cabrito): Toasted slowly in an oven at low temperatures. A number of variants of this preparation have emerged, including some very elaborate processes that involve applying seasonings and covering the cooking meat at specific times to produce a tasty and juicy treat. * Cabrito en salsa (cabrito in sauce): The animal is cut into portions, browned in oil and braised in a tomato-based sauce with onions, garlic and green chilies, and other seasonings until tender. * Cabrito en sangre (cabrito in blood), sometimes fritada de cabrito: A less common preparation in which the blood of the animal is collected when it is slaughtered and it becomes the basis for the sauce that the goat is braised in, along with the animal's liver, kidneys, and heart, and other seasonings. The end product is tender cabrito in a rich, very dark sauce. Portugal and Brazil In Portuguese, the name cabrito is used for a goat child (not just roasted) in Northeast Region, Brazil, especially in the Sert√£o Nordestino and in Portugal. The goat being about 3 months old is slow-cooked over a charcoal fire for about eight hours, turning it every 15-20 minutes.

KGF Club Plaque at club entrance Kolar Gold Fields (K.G.F.) is a mining region in K.G.F. taluk (township), Kolar district, Karnataka, India. It is headquartered in Robertsonpet, where employees of Bharat Gold Mines Limited (BGML) and BEML Limited (formerly Bharat Earth Movers Limited) and their families live. K.G.F. is about from Kolar, from Kuppam and from Bangalore. For over a century, the town has been known for gold mining. The mine closed on 28 February 2001 due to a fall in gold prices, despite gold still being present. One of India's first power-generation units was built in 1889 to support mining operations. The mine complex hosted some particle physics experiments between the 1960s and 1992. History The early history of the Kolar Gold Fields was compiled by Fred Goodwill, superintendent of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission, Bangalore and Kolar Gold Fields. Goodwill's studies were published in the Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society and elsewhere. The Western Gangas founded Kolar in the second century CE. For as long as they were in power (nearly 1,000 years) they used the title \\"Kuvalala- Puravareshwara\\" (Lord of Kolar), even after they moved their capital to Talakadu. From Talakadu, the Western Gangas ruled Gangavadi (the southern home of the Kannada people). Kolar came under Chola rule in 1004. Following their usual naming system, the Cholas called the district Nikarilichola-mandala. Around 1117, the Hoysalas (under Vishnuvardhana) captured Talakadu and Kolar and drove the Cholas from the Kingdom of Mysore. Vira Someshwara divided the empire between his two sons in 1254, and Kolar was given to Ramanatha. The Western Gangas made Kolar their capital and ruled Mysore, Coimbatore, Salem and Trave. Around the 13th century, the sage Pavananthi Munivar wrote Nannool about Tamil grammar at the Ulagamadhi cave. Under Chola rule, King Uththama Chola is said to have built the temple to Renuka. The Chola rulers Veera Chola, Vikrama Chola and Raja Nagendra Chola built stone structures with inscriptions at Avani, Mulbagal, and Sitti Bettta. Chola inscriptions indicate the rule of Adithya Chola I (871‚Äì907), Raja Raja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I of Kolar, referring to Kolar as \\"Nikarili Cholamandalam\\" and \\"Jayam Konda Chola Manadalam\\". Inscriptions of Rajendra Chola I appear on the Kolaramma temple. Many Siva temples were built in Kolar under the Cholas, such as the Someshwarar and Sri Uddhandeshwari Temples in the village of Marikuppam, the Eswaran Temple in Oorugaumpet, and the Sivan Temple in the village of Madivala. Chola rule of Kolar lasted until 1116. Chola inscriptions have been neglected and vandalised. According to B. Lewis Rice, names and events have been confused. Vijaynagar rule of Kolar lasted from 1336 to 1664. During the 17th century, Kolar came under Maratha rule as part of the jagir of Shahaji for fifty years before it was ruled by the Muslims for seventy years. In 1720, Kolar became part of the province of Sira; Fath Muhammad, the father of Hyder Ali, was faujdar of the province. Kolar was then ruled by the Marathas, the Nawab of Cuddapah, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and Hyder Ali. Ruled by the British from 1768 to 1770, it passed again to the Marathas and then to Hyder Ali. In 1791, Lord Cornwallis conquered Kolar in 1791, returning it again to Mysore in the Treaty of Seringapatam the following year. Inscriptions in the region indicate the reign of Mahavalis (Baanaas), Kadambas, Chalukyas, Pallava, Vaidumbaas, Rastrakutas, Cholas, Hoysalas and Mysore kings. B. Lewis Rice recorded 1,347 inscriptions in the district in the 10th volume of Epigraphia Carnatica. Of the inscriptions, 714 are in Kannada; 422 are in Tamil, and 211 in Telugu. John Taylor III acquired a number of mines in K.G.F. in 1880, and his firm (John Taylor & Sons) operated them until 1956; the Mysore Gold Mining Company was a subsidiary. In 1902, the mines were electrified with a cable run by General Electric from the hydroelectric power plant at Shivanasamudra Falls. The government of Mysore took over the mines in 1956. Origin of the city With the growth of the gold mines requiring more labour, people from the Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem and North and South Arcot districts of Tamil Nadu and the Chittoor and Ananthapur districts of Andhra Pradesh settled nearby; the settlements began to form the outskirts of K.G.F. The well-to-do families of British and Indian engineers, geologists, and mine supervisors lived in the centre of town. Two townships, Robertsonpet and Andersonpet, are named after two British mine officials. The establishment of BEML Limited expanded the city, providing employment and attracting new residents. The Kannada-language blockbuster film K.G.F: Chapter 1 and its sequel, K.G.F: Chapter 2, are set there. National geological monument The pyroclastic and pillow lava at Kolar Gold Fields have been declared a National Geological Monument by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) for their protection, maintenance, and encouragement of geotourism.national geo-heritage of India, INTACH Demographics The official language is Kannada, but Tamil and Telugu are also spoken widely. Most of the Tamil population trace their ancestry to labourers brought by the British from the North Arcot, Chittoor, Salem and Dharmapuri districts of the Madras Presidency during the late 19th century. Substantial Anglo-Indian and Arcot Mudaliar populations are descendants of mine supervisors. Mine closures The Kolar gold mines were nationalized in 1956, and provided a total of over 900 tonnes of gold. They were closed by the Indian government on 28 February 2001 for environmental and economic reasons; food, water and shelter were scarce, and production did not justify the investment. Climate Education St. Michael's and All Angels' Church In 1901, an English-language primary school was founded by John Taylor and Sons at the Nandydoorg Mine to educate the children of British and European employees. It became known as the Kolar Gold Fields Boys School, and was upgraded to a middle and high school; students took the Senior Cambridge examinations. The school was co-educational at the primary level. On 15 January 1904, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Tarbes founded an English-language school for Europeans and Anglo-Indians for 22 girls. St. Mary's Boys School was also founded. The boys' school later moved to Andersonpet. In 1933, the Order of the St. Joseph of Tarbes founded St. Theresa's School in Robertsonpet; St. Sebastian's School was founded in Coromandel a decade later. Both schools offered English lessons. To educate the growing Marwari population, the Sumathi Jain High School was founded in Robertsonpet. K.G.F. has several colleges, including the KGF College of Dental Science and Hospital, the Dr. T.

Scope, The Times, 1994. The term \\"perpetual traveler\\" (also \\"PT\\", \\"permanent tourist\\", or \\"prior taxpayer\\") refers to the idea that by basing different aspects of one's life in different countries and not spending too long in any one place, a person can reduce taxes, avoid civic duties, and increase personal freedom. Books and services relating to the PT idea have been a staple of companies that specialise in marketing offshore financial services, tax avoidance schemes, and personal privacy services. Principles The perpetual traveler idea proposes that individuals live in such a way that they are not considered a legal resident of any of the countries in which they spend time or operate. By lacking a legal permanent residence status, the theory goes, they may avoid the legal obligations which accompany residency, such as income and asset taxes, social security contributions, jury duty, and military service. The idea has been described as a \\"late capitalist nomadism\\".\\"Cyberspatial Sovereignties: Offshore Finance, Digital Cash, and the Limits of Liberalism\\", Bill Maurer, Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Spring 1998), pp. 493-519.

The Three Flags Theory is credited to investment pundit Harry D. Schultz, who proposed that everyone should have a second passport and an address in a tax haven and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. The idea was later expanded to Five Flags to include a place where money was earned and a place for recreation. Whether to minimize governmental interference (via taxes or otherwise), or to maximize privacy, the theory proposes that each of the following should be in a separate country: # Passport and citizenship ‚Äì in a country that does not tax money earned outside the country or control actions. # Legal residence ‚Äì in a tax haven. # Business base ‚Äì where one earns one's money, ideally somewhere with low corporate tax rates. # Asset haven ‚Äì where one keeps one's money, ideally somewhere with low taxation of passive income and capital gains. # Playgrounds ‚Äì where one spends one's money, ideally somewhere with low consumption taxes. In 1995, financial commentator Bob Beckman commented about his residence in Monaco: \\"A long time ago, I was told that the most efficient way for an individual to handle his affairs was to work one place, keep his money in a second place and live in a third place. I live in Monaco. I don't work here, my money is placed elsewhere, but managed from here.\\"  Scope International and W.G.

This theorem is named after Tjalling Koopmans, who published this result in 1934. Koopmans' theorem is exact in the context of restricted Hartree‚ÄìFock theory if it is assumed that the orbitals of the ion are identical to those of the neutral molecule (the frozen orbital approximation). Ionization energies calculated this way are in qualitative agreement with experiment ‚Äì the first ionization energy of small molecules is often calculated with an error of less than two electron volts.See, for example, Therefore, the validity of Koopmans' theorem is intimately tied to the accuracy of the underlying Hartree‚ÄìFock wavefunction. The two main sources of error are orbital relaxation, which refers to the changes in the Fock operator and Hartree‚ÄìFock orbitals when changing the number of electrons in the system, and electron correlation, referring to the validity of representing the entire many-body wavefunction using the Hartree‚ÄìFock wavefunction, i.e. a single Slater determinant composed of orbitals that are the eigenfunctions of the corresponding self-consistent Fock operator. Empirical comparisons with experimental values and higher- quality ab initio calculations suggest that in many cases, but not all, the energetic corrections due to relaxation effects nearly cancel the corrections due to electron correlation. A similar theorem exists in density functional theory (DFT) for relating the exact first vertical ionization energy and electron affinity to the HOMO and LUMO energies, although both the derivation and the precise statement differ from that of Koopmans' theorem. Ionization energies calculated from DFT orbital energies are usually poorer than those of Koopmans' theorem, with errors much larger than two electron volts possible depending on the exchange-correlation approximation employed. The LUMO energy shows little correlation with the electron affinity with typical approximations. The error in the DFT counterpart of Koopmans' theorem is a result of the approximation employed for the exchange correlation energy functional so that, unlike in HF theory, there is the possibility of improved results with the development of better approximations.  Generalizations  While Koopmans' theorem was originally stated for calculating ionization energies from restricted (closed-shell) Hartree‚ÄìFock wavefunctions, the term has since taken on a more generalized meaning as a way of using orbital energies to calculate energy changes due to changes in the number of electrons in a system. = Ground-state and excited-state ions = Koopmans‚Äô theorem applies to the removal of an electron from any occupied molecular orbital to form a positive ion. Removal of the electron from different occupied molecular orbitals leads to the ion in different electronic states. The lowest of these states is the ground state and this often, but not always, arises from removal of the electron from the HOMO. The other states are excited electronic states. For example, the electronic configuration of the H2O molecule is (1a1)2 (2a1)2 (1b2)2 (3a1)2 (1b1)2, where the symbols a1, b2 and b1 are orbital labels based on molecular symmetry. From Koopmans‚Äô theorem the energy of the 1b1 HOMO corresponds to the ionization energy to form the H2O+ ion in its ground state (1a1)2 (2a1)2 (1b2)2 (3a1)2 (1b1)1. The energy of the second-highest MO 3a1 refers to the ion in the excited state (1a1)2 (2a1)2 (1b2)2 (3a1)1 (1b1)2, and so on. In this case the order of the ion electronic states corresponds to the order of the orbital energies. Excited-state ionization energies can be measured by photoelectron spectroscopy. For H2O, the near-Hartree‚ÄìFock orbital energies (with sign changed) of these orbitals are 1a1 559.5, 2a1 36.7 1b2 19.5, 3a1 15.9 and 1b1 13.8 eV. The corresponding ionization energies are 539.7, 32.2, 18.5, 14.7 and 12.6 eV. As explained above, the deviations are due to the effects of orbital relaxation as well as differences in electron correlation energy between the molecular and the various ionized states. For N2 in contrast, the order of orbital energies is not identical to the order of ionization energies. Near-Hartree‚ÄìFock calculations with a large basis set indicate that the 1œÄu bonding orbital is the HOMO. However the lowest ionization energy corresponds to removal of an electron from the 3œÉg bonding orbital. In this case the deviation is attributed primarily to the difference in correlation energy between the two orbitals. = For electron affinities = It is sometimes claimedSee, for example, that Koopmans' theorem also allows the calculation of electron affinities as the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the respective systems. However, Koopmans' original paper makes no claim with regard to the significance of eigenvalues of the Fock operator other than that corresponding to the HOMO. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to generalize the original statement of Koopmans' to calculate the electron affinity in this sense. Calculations of electron affinities using this statement of Koopmans' theorem have been criticized on the grounds that virtual (unoccupied) orbitals do not have well- founded physical interpretations, and that their orbital energies are very sensitive to the choice of basis set used in the calculation. As the basis set becomes more complete; more and more \\"molecular\\" orbitals that are not really on the molecule of interest will appear, and care must be taken not to use these orbitals for estimating electron affinities. Comparisons with experiment and higher-quality calculations show that electron affinities predicted in this manner are generally quite poor. = For open-shell systems = Koopmans' theorem is also applicable to open-shell systems. It was previously believed that this was only in the case for removing the unpaired electron, but the validity of Koopmans‚Äô theorem for ROHF in general has been proven provided that the correct orbital energies are used. The spin up (alpha) and spin down (beta) orbital energies do not necessarily have to be the same.  Counterpart in density functional theory  Kohn‚ÄìSham (KS) density functional theory (KS- DFT) admits its own version of Koopmans' theorem (sometimes called the DFT- Koopmans' theorem) very similar in spirit to that of Hartree-Fock theory. The theorem equates the first (vertical) ionization energy I of a system of N electrons to the negative of the corresponding KS HOMO energy \\\\epsilon_H . More generally, this relation is true even when the KS systems describes a zero-temperature ensemble with non-integer number of electrons N - \\\\delta N for integer N and \\\\delta N \\\\to 0. When considering N + \\\\delta N electrons the infinitesimal excess charge enters the KS LUMO of the N electron system but then the exact KS potential jumps by a constant known as the \\"derivative discontinuity\\". It can be argued that the vertical electron affinity is equal exactly to the negative of the sum of the LUMO energy and the derivative discontinuity. Unlike the approximate status of Koopmans' theorem in Hartree Fock theory (because of the neglect of orbital relaxation), in the exact KS mapping the theorem is exact, including the effect of orbital relaxation. A sketchy proof of this exact relation goes in three stages. First, for any finite system I determines the \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\to \\\\infty asymptotic form of the density, which decays as n(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\to \\\\exp \\\\left (-2\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 m_{\\\\rm e}}{\\\\hbar} I}\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\right ) . Next, as a corollary (since the physically interacting system has the same density as the KS system), both must have the same ionization energy. Finally, since the KS potential is zero at infinity, the ionization energy of the KS system is, by definition, the negative of its HOMO energy and thus finally: \\\\epsilon_H = -I . While these are exact statements in the formalism of DFT, the use of approximate exchange- correlation potentials makes the calculated energies approximate and often the orbital energies are very different from the corresponding ionization energies (even by several eV!). A tuning procedure is able to \\"impose\\" Koopmans' theorem on DFT approximations thereby improving many of its related predictions in actual applications. In approximate DFTs one can estimate to high degree of accuracy the deviance from Koopmans' theorem using the concept of energy curvature. It provides excitation energies to zeroth-order and \\\\frac{\\\\partial E}{\\\\partial n_i} = \\\\varepsilon_i .

The massive expansion of motorways through the nearby inner city area ‚Äì and subsequent flight of residents and retail into the suburbs from the 1960s onwards ‚Äì turned it from one of Auckland's premier shopping streets into a marginal area with the reputation of a red light district. Now considered to be one of the cultural centres of Auckland, since the 1980s‚Äì1990s it has been undergoing a slow process of gentrification, and is now known for off-beat cafes and boutique shops. It runs west‚Äìeast along a ridge at the southern edge of the Auckland CBD, perpendicular to Queen Street, the city's main street. At its intersection with Ponsonby Road in the west, Karangahape Road becomes Great North Road, at its eastern end it connects to Grafton Bridge.  Etymology  Karangahape is a word from the MƒÅori language. Before Europeans appeared Auckland was occupied by several MƒÅori iwi each of whom apparently used the same name for the Karangahape Ridge but with slightly different meanings. The original meaning and origin of the word is uncertain; there are several interpretations ‚Äì ranging from \\"winding ridge of human activity\\" to \\"calling on Hape\\". Hape was a MƒÅori chief (or mythical personage) of some importance living over on the Manukau Harbour in a place also called Karangahape. As the ridge was a walking route and was known as Te Ara o Karangahape ‚Äì The Path of Karangahape ‚Äì the name possibly indicates the route that was taken to visit him.Auckland City Street Names (from the Auckland City Libraries website) Until the mid 20th century Karangahape Road was the only street in central Auckland with a MƒÅori name, undoubtedly due to its use as a thoroughfare in pre-European times. Its MƒÅori name proved difficult for many European settlers to pronounce and as it was the only major thoroughfare in the central area demarcated as a \\"road\\" (as opposed to a street) during the 19th century it was apparently often referred to as \\"The Road\\". In 1908 there was a movement to replace the long MƒÅori name with something more urbane, European and modern. Although there were several public meetings and much discussion in the newspapers at the time, the city council was unmoved and the name survived. The topic re-emerged in 1913 but was again unsuccessful, probably because of the advent of the First World War. Just before the Royal Tour in 1953 there was another push to rename the road; this time as \\"Elizabeth Street\\" but again the original name survived. From the early 20th century it has become widely known as \\"K Road\\", even outside of Auckland. Demographics The statistical area of Karangahape, which includes the streets between Hopetoun and Beresford Streets to the north and the northwestern motorway to the south, had a population of 2,307 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 504 people (28.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 894 people (63.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,074 households. There were 1,260 males and 1,047 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.2 males per female. The median age was 32.6 years, with 105 people (4.6%) aged under 15 years, 846 (36.7%) aged 15 to 29, 1,179 (51.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 174 (7.5%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 61.9% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 5.5% MƒÅori, 3.3% Pacific peoples, 29.6% Asian, and 7.3% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 56.7%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 57.5% had no religion, 26.5% were Christian, and 12.0% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 987 (44.8%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 69 (3.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $43,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,413 (64.2%) people were employed full-time, 291 (13.2%) were part-time, and 78 (3.5%) were unemployed.  History  Corner Pitt Street and Karangahape Road in 1909, showing the rich architecture typical of many historic retail buildings constructed on the ridge street. K'Road in 1957, a healthy main street with department stores and many other shops ‚Äì before the motorways destroyed or degraded much of the surrounding residential areas, starting several decades of decline. The western portion of the street became run-down and turned into the city's red-light district. The main part of the street remained a shopping hub but in the mind of the general public the reputation of the street as a whole became very disreputable. Now only a small number of obvious remnants of that time, such as the 'Vegas Girl' of the 'Las Vegas' strip club, still exist in the 2000s. As it was a travel route used by the pre-European MƒÅori, Karangahape Road is an older thoroughfare than Queen Street, which was only developed by Europeans in the 1840s. The land was part of the parcel of 3000 acres sold by a local MƒÅori to the government in 1841. The Karangahape ridge was the formal southern edge of Auckland City in the 19th century. In 1882 the ratepayers of Newton (along with Ponsonby and Grafton) voted to become part of Auckland City. From about 1900 to the early 1960s, K' Road was Auckland's busiest shopping street with a large range of clothing and shoe shops and several department stores. Most retail chain stores had branches here, often in preference to Queen Street. During the interwar period most of Auckland's main shops selling furniture, musical instruments, radios and household appliances were located here. In 1908 the gas street lighting was replaced with electric lamps. In 1935 the whole street was lit by electric lights under the shop awnings to create a \\"Community Lighting\\" project referred to as the \\"Great White Way\\". Activated by the Mayor Sir Ernest Davis this created a mile of lit-up shop fronts which added to the glamour of late night shopping. In 1948 the second set of traffic lights in Auckland (and the first lights to have pedestrian phases) were installed at the Pitt Street intersection. In 1949 the street lamps were fitted with the first fluorescent street lights in New Zealand. The Karangahape Road Business Association (KBA) had begun in 1911 as an informal gathering of business people in the area. It officially dates from 1924 when it was registered as the Karangahape Road Businessmen's Association. Its first president was Mathew James Bennett, who ran a paint, wallpaper and interior decorating firm. Bennett was involved in a number of organisations including the Auckland Electric Power Board. During the middle of the 20th century the Karangahape Road Area was a destination shopping centre, especially busy on late nights when family groups would travel in (often on public transport) and clog the pavements. A line was painted down the centre of the footpaths to regulate foot traffic and police were posted at the Pitt Street intersection to stop people being pushed out into the traffic. A typical late-night outing included seeing a movie, shopping, a meal and promenading along the street window shopping and being seen. At this time the street had five cinemas (The Avon, Vogue, Newton Palace, Playhouse and Tivoli) and probably as many dance halls (The Music Academy, Peter Pan Cabaret) including the Druid's Hall in Galatos Street which is still in operation as a music venue. K Road was the location of many shops aimed at the beauty and fashion trade; fabric, clothing, shoes, accessories and many specialist hair and beauty salons (Kay's Beauty Salon, Winter's Hair Dressing, Miss Hubber, The Powder Puff Salon). There were several photographers' studios located along the ridge since the late Victorian period (Ellerbeck, Andrews, Morton's, Partington, Tadema, Sarony, St John Biggs, Peter Pan Studios). In addition to a collection of some fairly upmarket dress emporiums (Flacksons, LaGonda) and furriers, there were a number of establishments which specialised in bridal fashions and accessories (Tadema Studios was just one of the photographers which specialised in Wedding photography). As shops were not open on Saturdays or Sundays before the 1980s, the inner city was rather quiet during the day on the weekends. Karangahape Road was an exception, however. Most weddings take place on a Saturday and groups of women would loiter on K road outside the many photographers' studios to catch a glimpse of wedding parties as they arrived or departed from having their studio portraits taken. Sundays were a social event as well; up until the 1960s people attending church dressed up and there was interest in what people, especially women, were wearing. The Karangahape Road area was the location of several major churches; The Baptist Tabernacle, The Pitt St Methodist Church, St James' Wellington Street, Congregationalist, St Benedicts, The Church of Christ Scientist, The Church of Christ, The Church of the Epiphany, Church of Jesus, Church of the Latter Day Saints, Chinese Presbyterian Church, the Salvation Army, Pacific Island Church, two Brethren Halls and after 1966, the main Synagogue. There was also the Higher Thought Temple, The Theosophical Society, The Foresters Hall, The Druids Hall, The Scots Hall, The Hibernian Society, The Irish Hall, three Freemasons Halls, several Trade Unions, the Maori Hall and the Old Folks Association. Any of these organisations were likely to be the location of a service, lecture or social event on any given day. After 1965, K' Road lost most of its local customer base when construction of the inner-city motorway system resulted in over 50,000 people having to move out of the surrounding areas. The downturn in trade led to many shops closing and the relocating of businesses to other areas of Auckland. This accelerated the decline, and by the early 1970s the low rents in the western portion of the street meant it had acquired a rather seedy reputation as Auckland's red-light district although the adult industry never accounted for more than 4 percent of the businesses in the area at any time. Since the early 1990s there has been a move away from this image largely due to newly constructed apartment blocks attracting residents back to the area, as well as a general gentrification of close by areas such as Ponsonby. Karangahape Road is probably the most notorious street in the country, as most people imagine it is lined with strip clubs, brothels and adult shops. The reality is different; despite the street's earlier reputation very few enterprises are connected with the adult industry; for example there are 150 shops along the main road, K Road, and only 8 of them are connected with the sex industry. This proportion of outre establishments to more ordinary businesses has remained fairly constant for almost 40 years. K Road currently boasts an eclectic collection of shops, caf√©s and a nucleus of dealer art galleries. Since the early 1990s it has developed as a focus for nightlife; its restaurants, bars and nightclubs make it a major part of Auckland's social scene. This is largely due to redevelopment of the Queen Street valley in the 1980s as increased rents made many nightclub venues relocate to the K Road ridge. Since the mid 1990s K Road has become a centre for much of Auckland's bohemian scene, with many venues for alternative music and fringe art as well as the LGBT community. It is also known for its trendy op shops, and craft and art collectives. The street received a major upgrade of its footpaths and street furniture which finished in 2006, at a cost of NZ$3.5 million. As of 2009, approximately 400 businesses were on K Road. In 2011 the Karangahape Road overbridge had a $2.1 million upgrade as part of the Rugby World Cup Celebration. Designed by Opus Architecture and funded by Auckland Transport, it took 6 weeks to complete. Included in the design were three internally lit perspex pylons which act as entry markers for the bridge designed by the renowned Tongan artist Filipe Tohi.

Its molecular formula is ()2¬∑4H2O, a hydrated calcium-aluminium silicate. Potassium or sodium may substitute for the calcium but only in very small amounts. It is monoclinic, space group C2/m. It forms prismatic crystals with a diamond-shaped cross-section and an angled termination. When pure, the color is colorless or white. Impurities may color it orange, brownish, gray, yellowish, pink, or reddish. It has perfect cleavage on [010] and [110] and its fracture is conchoidal. It is very brittle. The Mohs scale hardness is 3.5-4. It has a vitreous luster and a white streak. It is found in hydrothermal deposits left in calcareous rocks, often formed as a result of secondary mineralization. Host rock types include basalt, andesite, metamorphic rocks and granites. The identification of laumontite goes back to the early days of mineralogy. It was first named lomonite by R. Jameson (System of Mineralogy) in 1805, and laumonite by Ren√© Just Ha√ºy in 1809. The current name was given by K.C. von Leonhard (Handbuch der Oryktognosie) in 1821. It is named after Gillet de Laumont who collected samples from lead mines in Huelgoat, Brittany, making them the type locality. Laumontite easily dehydrates when stored in a low humidity environment. When freshly collected, if it has not already been exposed to the environment, it can be translucent or transparent. Over a period of hours to days the loss of water turns it opaque white. In the past, this variety has been called leonhardite, though this is not a valid mineral species. The dehydrated laumontite is very friable, often falling into a powder at the slightest touch. It is a common mineral, found worldwide. It can be locally abundant, forming seams and veins. It is frequently associated with other zeolites, including stilbite and heulandite. Notable occurrences are India; Paterson, New Jersey; Pine Creek, California; Iceland; Scotland; and the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia. Prehnite pseudomorphs after laumontite (epimorphs) have been found in India.

Tau is the biggest island with its , and harbors the highest point of the Manua at . Politically, the islands form the Manua District, one of the three administrative divisions of American Samoa. For centuries, Manu'a was the political centre for the region prior to the rise of the Tu'i Tonga maritime empire and the shift in power from the east to the western islands of Samoa. Geography Map of the Manu'a islands. All three islands are high islands: volcanic remnants rising out of the sea 14¬∞ south of the equator. The islands are elevated and mountainous.Hills, J.W. (2010). O upu muamua i le Tala i le Lalolagi mo e ua faatoa a'oa'oina u lea mataupu: Elementary Geography. Nabu Press. Page 62. . In contrast to most places in the world, the population of these islands has been decreasing steadily for decades. In the 1930s some 20% of the population of American Samoa lived in the Manua Islands. By the 1980s, only 6% were located there. Emigration is the consequence of a lack of economic opportunities and a desire of young people to participate in the more modern lifestyle offered on Tutuila (Office of Tourism, 2005). All the land of Manua is owned communally by Samoan families of Manua. This includes the National Parks lands which are only leased to the US National Parks system for 50 years. History Samoan oral historical traditions state that Manu'a was a ruling center of a large Polynesian empire which included all of the Samoan archipelago, and other nearby islands such as Tonga and Fiji. The traditional capital of Manua is the village of Ta≈´, on the island of Ta≈´. = The Tui Manu'a = The sovereign of Manua was called the Tui Manua, the progenitor of many of Samoa's high titles and the only part of Samoa that was not subjected to Tongan rule, owing to its sacred status to both cultures. The last Tui Manua was Tuimanua Elisara (or Tui Manua Elisala) of the early 20th century. Tuimanua Elisara died on July 2, 1909. The title Tui Manua technically still exists although there is no titleholder; Tuimanua Elisara desired before his death that the title die with him. It was the U.S. government position at the time that his title changed to District Governor upon the hoisting of the U.S. flag at Ta≈´ on June 5, 1900 (Office of the Governor. 2004). However, titles and holdings were not obliterated when the islands became a U.S. territory, and the title and estates of Tuimanua remain under the custody of the Anoalo clan (male side of the Tuimanua line). These are the known Tui Manu'a: 41 successive generations of title holders spanning over 2,000 years.

Cession followed the Tripartite Convention of 1899 that partitioned the eastern islands of Samoa (including Tutuila and the Manua Group) from the western islands of Samoa (including Upolu and Savaii). In 1903, Manu'a had a total population of approximately 2,000 residents.Hills, J.W. (2010). O upu muamua i le Tala i le Lalolagi mo e ua faatoa a'oa'oina u lea mataupu: Elementary Geography. Nabu Press. Page 64. . The Manu'a Hurricane of 1915 is particularly notable of two reasons.

Society and culture Samoan fale in the Manu'a island group, showing thatched roof and woven pola blinds, circa 1890 - 1910.. The history of Manua is said in Samoan oratory to contain the origins of Samoan and Polynesian culture, and the genealogy of Polynesians east of Samoa is said to have originated in Manua. In traditional belief the sun rises over Samoa at Saua on the island of Ta≈´, where the coral reef is supposed to be always yellow from the sun, and it sets at Falealupo the western-most village on the island of Savaii in Samoa. This journey of the sun is strongly related to traditional beliefs and defines the uniformity of cultural identity across both Samoas. The term Fa'asamoa describes \\"The Samoan Way\\", or traditional Samoan way of life  Economy  Today, many families of Manua rely on income from family members working in Tutuila and in the United States. The local diet is generally healthier than in Tutuila, with less reliance on imported American and New Zealand tinned foods, and a greater reliance on local fishing and farming. Language The people of Manua speak the Samoan language and utilize the \\"t\\". Education The high school on Ta≈´, called Manua High School, serves all of Manua. Most students seeking higher education go to American Samoa Community College in Tutuila or National University of Samoa on Upolu, or as far away as the University of Hawaii and elsewhere.

The left subclavian vein plays a key role in the absorption of fats and lipids, by allowing products that have been carried by lymph to enter the bloodstream, where it can enter the hepatic portal vein. The diameter of the subclavian veins is approximately 1‚Äì2 cm, depending on the individual. Structure Each subclavian vein is a continuation of the axillary vein and runs from the outer border of the first rib to the medial border of anterior scalene muscle. From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \\"innominate vein\\"). The angle of union is termed the venous angle. The subclavian vein follows the subclavian artery and is separated from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. Thus, the subclavian vein lies anterior to the anterior scalene while the subclavian artery lies posterior to the anterior scalene (and anterior to the middle scalene). Function The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, near its junction with the left internal jugular vein. It carries lymph (water and solutes) from the lymphatic system, as well as chylomicrons or chyle, formed in the intestines from dietary fat and lipids, allowing these to enter the bloodstream; the products of fats and lipids can then be carried by the bloodstream to the hepatic portal vein, and then finally to the liver, making it so that the left subclavian vein plays a key role in the absorption of these fats and lipids. The right lymphatic duct drains its lymph into the junction of the right internal jugular vein, and the right subclavian vein. Clinical relevance As the subclavian vein is large, central and relatively superficial, it is often used to place central venous lines. History Sub (below), and clavian (pertaining to the clavicle).

It is the principal agency responsible for meteorological observations, weather forecasting and seismology. IMD is headquartered in Delhi and operates hundreds of observation stations across India and Antarctica. Regional offices are at Mumbai, Kolkata, Nagpur and Pune. IMD is also one of the six Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres of the World Meteorological Organisation. It has the responsibility for forecasting, naming and distribution of warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northern Indian Ocean region, including the Malacca Straits, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. History In 1686, Edmond Halley published his treatise on the Indian summer monsoon, which he attributed to a seasonal reversal of winds due to the differential heating of the Asian land mass and the Indian Ocean. The first meteorological observatories were established in India by the British East India Company. These included the Calcutta Observatory in 1785, the Madras Observatory in 1796 and the Colaba Observatory in 1826. Several other observatories were established in India during the first half of the 19th century by various provincial governments. The Asiatic Society, founding in Calcutta in 1784 and in Bombay in 1804, promoted the study of meteorology in India. Henry Piddington published almost 40 papers dealing with tropical storms from Calcutta between 1835 and 1855 in The Journal of the Asiatic Society. He also coined the term cyclone, meaning the coil of a snake. In 1842, he published his landmark thesis, Laws of the Storms. After a tropical cyclone hit Calcutta in 1864, and the subsequent famines in 1866 and 1871 due to the failure of the monsoons, it was decided to organise the collection and analysis of meteorological observations under one roof. As a result, the India Meteorology Department was established in 1875. Henry Francis Blanford was appointed the first Meteorological Reporter of the IMD. In May 1889, Sir John Eliot was appointed the first Director General of Observatories in the erstwhile capital, Calcutta. The IMD headquarters were later shifted to Shimla in 1905, then to Pune in 1928 and finally to New Delhi in 1944. IMD became a member of the World Meteorological Organisation after independence on 27 April 1949. The agency has gained in prominence due to the significance of the monsoon rains on Indian agriculture. It plays a vital role in preparing the annual monsoon forecast, as well as in tracking the progress of the monsoon across India every season. Organisation IMD is headed by the Director General of Meteorology, currently Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra. IMD has six Regional Meteorological Centres, each under a Deputy Director General. These are located in Chennai, Guwahati, Kolkata, Mumbai, Nagpur and New Delhi. There are also Meteorological Centres in every state capital. Other IMD units such as Forecasting Offices, Agrometeorological Advisory Service Centers, Hydro- meteorological Office, Flood Meteorological Offices, Area Cyclone Warning Centers and Cyclone Warning Centers are usually co-located with various observatories or meteorological center. IMD operates a network of hundreds of surface and glacial observatories, Upper Air (high altitude) stations, ozone and radiation observatories and meteorological radar stations. Additional data is received from India's constellation of satellites, such as Kalpana-1, Megha-Tropiques and instruments on board the IRS series and the INSAT series of satellites. Data and observations are also reported into the IMD network from meteorological instruments on board Indian merchant marine and Indian Navy ships. IMD was the first organisation in India to deploy a message switching computer for supporting its global data exchange. IMD collaborates with other agencies such as the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting and the National Institute of Ocean Technology. IMD also operates seismic monitoring centres at key locations for earthquake monitoring and measurements. The new public website of IMD is https://mausam.imd.gov.in/ Tasks IMD undertakes observations, communications, forecasting and weather services. In collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation, the IMD also uses the IRS series and the Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) for weather monitoring of the Indian subcontinent. IMD was first weather bureau of a developing country to develop and maintain its own satellite system. IMD is one of the six worldwide Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres of the Tropical Cyclone Programme of the World Weather Watch of the World Meteorological Organization. It is regional nodal agency for forecasting, naming and disseminating warnings about tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean north of the Equator. New initiatives The IMD launched System of Aerosol Monitoring and Research (SAMAR) in January 2016 to study the concentration of Black carbon, radiative properties of aerosols, environmental visibility and their climatological impacts. It would contain a network of 16 aethalometers, 12 sky radiometers and 12 nephelometers.

Her other previous bands include Asmodina and Mistress. Early life Angela Gossow was born to Orthodox Christian parents in Cologne, Germany, and had three siblings. She was 17 when her parents divorced. Further financial troubles came in when their business went bankrupt. Being anorexic and bulimic further added to her woes. It was at this time that she decided to move out of home and join the metal band Asmodina. After graduation she joined an advertising company as a trainee, specializing in marketing. She simultaneously began studying economics. In 1997, the band Asmodina split and Gossow formed another band: Mistress. Musical career Gossow is one of the first among a small number of women to front as a death metal vocalist. She has a mezzo-soprano vocal range, with a death growl. She uses false cord screams. Her main influences are Jeff Walker of Carcass, David Vincent of Morbid Angel, Chuck Billy of Testament, John Tardy of Obituary, Chuck Schuldiner of Death, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, and Rob Halford of Judas Priest. =Arch Enemy= Gossow joined Arch Enemy in November 2000, after the removal of lead singer Johan Liiva. She had previously interviewed guitarist Michael Amott for a German webzine. While interviewing Amott, Gossow gave him a demo that she described as a \\"poor quality\\" video of a performance at a club. After firing Liiva in 2000, the band called in Gossow for an audition. Amott later said that \\"she wiped the floor with all the other contenders.\\" She then proceeded to record Wages of Sin with Arch Enemy. On the eve of a 2002 tour, Gossow was diagnosed with nodules, which almost stopped her from growling. However, after some vocal therapy, she was able to recover her voice and she proceeded to begin taking piano and screaming lessons from renowned coach Melissa Cross. She continues to work in close conjunction with her. On 17 March 2014, it was announced that Gossow was stepping down as Arch Enemy vocalist to pursue other interests and spend more time with her family. Gossow recommended Alissa White-Gluz from Canadian metal band The Agonist as her replacement, and will remain business manager for the band. =Management career= In addition to managing Arch Enemy, Gossow also manages the bands Spiritual Beggars, Amaranthe and Obscura. She performed guest vocals on Amaranthe's 2020 single, \\"Do or Die\\", and was featured in the song's music video, making it Gossow's first musical performance in 8 years. =Other work= Gossow provides the voice for the recurring character Lavona Succuboso in the animated television show Metalocalypse. According to an interview with Musiikki TV at the Frostbite Festival 2009, Gossow did guest vocals on the Astarte album Demonized, on the song \\"Black at Heart\\". Gossow features on Melissa Cross's 2nd DVD release The Zen of Screaming 2 released by Melissa Cross. Apart from being on the cover pages of many leading magazines, she was also voted the \\"best singer\\" and \\"shining star\\" at the Burrn! magazine awards in 2002. Since 2008 she has been the manager for Spiritual Beggars. Gossow recently expressed interest in starting a new extreme metal project in 2018 after Arch Enemy's touring cycle for Will to Power, stating \\"Yes, I want to make a new extreme metal project, but this will happen after Arch Enemy and work with Alissa [White-Gluz] will be concluded and the whole world will sail in calmer waters.

The ship was completed just before the start of World War I in August 1914. Even though France was not officially completed, she ferried the President of France to Russia during the July Crisis for consultations. She spent the war providing cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea and sometimes served as a flagship. After the war France and her sister ship participated in the occupation of Constantinople and were then sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to support Allied troops in the Southern Russia Intervention. The war-weary crews of both ships briefly mutinied, but it was easily put down and she returned to France mid- year. Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922, she foundered four hours later. Background and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1912 By 1909, the French Navy was finally convinced of the superiority of the all-big-gun battleship like over the mixed-calibre designs like the which had preceded the Courbets. The following year, the new Minister of the Navy, Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, selected a design that was comparable to the foreign dreadnoughts then under construction as part of the 1906 Naval Programme.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139‚Äì140 The ships were long overallGardiner & Gray, p. 197 and had a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 1,115 men as a private ship and increased to 1,187 when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two licence-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 24 Belleville boilers.Jordan & Caresse, p. 143 These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce .Whitley, p. 36 The ships had a designed speed of . The Courbet-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range at a speed of . The main battery of the Courbet class consisted of twelve Canon de Mle 1906‚Äì1910 guns mounted in six twin-gun turrets, with two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure, and a pair of wing turrets amidships. Their secondary armament was twenty-two Canon de Mle 1910 guns, which were mounted in casemates in the hull. Four Canon de Mle 1902 Hotchkiss guns were fitted, two on each broadside in the superstructure. They were also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes and could stow 10 mines below decks. The ships' waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by 250 mm of armour and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The conning tower had a thick face and sides.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 150, 156‚Äì158 Career France, the seventh ship of her name to serve in the French Navy,Roche, Tome 1, pp. 213‚Äì214; Tome 2, p. 215 was ordered on 1 August 1911 from Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire. The ship was laid down on 30 November at its shipyard in Saint-Nazaire and launched on 7 November 1912.Dumas, p. 162 She was formally declared completed on 1 July 1914 to carry President Raymond Poincar√©, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia. He boarded the ship on 16 July. Escorted by Jean Bart, France arrived at Kronstadt on 20 July after encountering the battlecruisers of the German I Scouting Group in the Baltic Sea en route. The French ships made a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden, on 25‚Äì26 July, but a planned visit to Copenhagen, Denmark, was cancelled due to rising tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia; they arrived at Dunkerque on 29 July.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 142, 243‚Äì244 =World War I= When France declared war on Germany on 3 August, the sisters were in Brest and departed for Toulon that night. They were met off Valencia, Spain, on the 6th by their sister and the semi-dreadnoughts and because Jean Bart was having problems with her 305 mm ammunition and France had yet to load any. The ships rendezvoused with a troop convoy the following day and escorted it to Toulon. France entered service on 10 October and was assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron () of the 1st Naval Army () on 21 October at the mouth of the Adriatic SeaJordan & Caresse, pp. 244, 254, 257 to prevent the Austro- Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic.Halpern, p. 19 The torpedoing of Jean Bart on 21 December by the Austro-Hungarian submarine showed that the battleships were vulnerable to this threat and they were withdrawn to spend the rest of the month further south at an anchorage in Navarino Bay.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 257‚Äì258 France anchored in Toulon during World War I On 11 January 1915, the French were alerted that the Austro- Hungarian fleet was going to sortie from its base at Pola, so France and her sisters Courbet and Paris led the 1st Naval Army north to the Albanian coast. It proved to be a false alarm, and they were back at their moorings three days later. In the meantime, the ships patrolled the Ionian Sea as the danger of submarine attacks in the restricted waters of the Strait forced the battleships south. The declaration of war on Austria-Hungary by Italy on 23 May and the Italian decision to assume responsibility for naval operations in the Adriatic, allowed the French Navy to withdraw to either Malta or Bizerte, French Tunisia, to cover the Otranto Barrage. A fire broke out aboard France on 25 July and she was forced to return to Toulon for repairs that lasted until 14 October. Two days later Vice-Admiral () Louis Dartige du Fournet assumed command of the 1st Naval Army and hoisted his flag aboard France, which remained in Malta for the rest of the year. At some point during the year, the ship's 47 mm guns were put on high-angle mountings to allow them to be used as anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They were later supplemented by a pair of Mle 1891 G guns on anti-aircraft mounts.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 258, 260, 280, 283 On 27 April 1916, the French began using the port of Argostoli on the Greek island of Cephalonia as a base. Dartige du Fornet transferred his flag to the battleship on 23 May. Around this time, many men from the battleships' crews were transferred to anti-submarine ships. At the beginning of 1917, the French began to use the Greek island of Corfu as well, but growing shortages of coal severely limited the battleships' ability to go to sea.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 260, 274‚Äì275, 277 The situation was so bad that Vice-Admiral Gabriel Darrieus wrote in 1917: > The military capabilities of the , which has already been badly affected by > the shortages of personnel and constant changes in the general staff, need > to be maintained by frequent exercises, and although from March to June we > were able to follow a normal pattern, the coal crisis is currently > preventing any manoeuvres or gunnery training, even for the ships returning > from repairs. The big ships have lost 50 per cent of the capability they had > several months ago.Jordan & Caresse, p. 277 In 1918, they were almost immobile, leaving Corfu only for maintenance and repairs. On 1 July, the 1st Naval Army was reorganised with France assigned to the 1st Battle Division () of the 1st Battle Squadron (). =Post-war activities= After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the occupation of Constantinople. In early 1919, France, flagship of Vice-Admiral Jean- Fran√ßoise-Charles Amet, and Jean Bart were transferred to the Black Sea to reinforce the French forces opposing the Bolsheviks. A few days after bombarding Bolshevik troops advancing on Sevastopol on 16 April and forcing them to retreat, Frances war-weary crew briefly mutinied on 19 April, inspired by socialist and revolutionary sympathisers. Unlike Jean Barts captain, who had managed to quell the mutiny aboard his ship by the following day, Frances crew was still mutinous and Amet hoped to reduce tensions by meeting the mutineers' demands for leave and letting crewmen with a history of good behaviour ashore. The sailors mingled with a pro-Bolshevik demonstration and the mixed group was challenged by a company of Greek infantry, which opened fire. The demonstrators fled and encountered a landing party from Jean Bart, which also fired upon them. A total of about 15 people were wounded, included six sailors, one of whom later died of his wounds. Delegates from the other mutinous crews were not allowed aboard and the mutiny collapsed when Amet agreed to meet their main demand to take the ships home. France was the first to depart on 23 April, but the ship sailed to Bizerte before continuing onwards to Toulon. Twenty-six crewmen were sentenced to prison terms upon her return, although the sentences were commuted in 1922 as part of a bargain between Poincar√©, now Prime Minister, and the parties of the left.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 285, 288; Masson, pp. 88‚Äì92, 96‚Äì97, 99 On 1 July, all the Courbets were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron. On 10 February 1920, the 1st Naval Army was disbanded and replaced by the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron () and its Western counterpart (); all the sisters were assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the latter unit, with Courbet, Jean Bart and Paris in the 1st Battle Division and France in the 2nd Battle Division, with Rear-Admiral () Louis-Hippolyte Violette commanding the latter from France. The two squadrons were combined into the Mediterranean Squadron () on 20 July 1921.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 288‚Äì290 France and the battleship hosted the British battleship and light cruiser during a port visit to Villefranche from 18 February to 1 March 1922. The two French battleships had a gunnery exercise on 28 June using the former Austro-Hungarian battleship as a target and sank her. On 18 July, France, Paris and Bretagne began a cruise visiting French ports in the Bay of Biscay and English Channel. On the evening of 25/26 August, France struck an uncharted rock while entering Quiberon Bay at 00:57. The after boiler room flooded quickly and the ship lost all power at 01:10. She had a 5¬∞ list by 02:00 and the order was given to abandon ship. The battleship capsized two hours later after Bretagne and Paris were able to rescue all but three of her crew. Her wreck was slowly broken up in place in 1935, 1952 and 1958.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 289‚Äì290 Footnotes Bibliography   * Further reading * Category:Courbet-class battleships Category:World War I battleships of France Category:Shipwrecks of the Biscay coast Category:1912 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1922 ","title":"French battleship France"},{"id":"2178822","text":"Laurite is an opaque black, metallic ruthenium sulfide mineral with formula: RuS2.

During his career Guthrie has performed guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, drums and other musical instruments, in addition to programming, sampling and sound processing. Career Following the break-up of the Cocteau Twins in 1998, Guthrie released his first solo record, Imperial, in 2003 on Bella Union Records. Guthrie's next release, which was co-written with Harold Budd, was the film score for Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. The soundtrack was released in May 2005 by Commotion and consists of 15 complete songs based on the short pieces used in the film. In 2006, Guthrie signed a four-album solo deal with Darla Records, the first product of which was the album Continental. In February 2007, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Continental best album of 2006, on their 2006 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame, and ranked Guthrie Artist of the Year. He subsequently released two four-track EPs, Everlasting and Waiting for Dawn. Two more collaborations with Harold Budd (who had previously announced his musical retirement) were released simultaneously in 2007. After the Night Falls and Before the Day Breaks were both co-composed, co-produced and played with Budd. Like the soundtrack to Mysterious Skin, both albums are slow, drifting pieces primarily utilising treated guitar and piano. Guthrie has also collaborated with singer Siobhan de Mar√© (formerly of Mono) as the band Violet Indiana. Their first full-length album, Roulette, was released in 2001. A second album, Russian Doll, followed in 2004. In March 2006 Guthrie reported on his weblog that the group had started work again on new material. In May 2009, Mirrorball, an album-length collaboration between Guthrie and John Foxx was released on Metamatic Records. A new solo album, Carousel, was released via Rocket Girl in Europe on 1 September 2009 and Darla Records on 15 September 2009. Additionally, Guthrie issued the Angel Falls EP in early 2009, and the Songs to Help My Children Sleep EP in October 2009. A further EP Sunflower Stories was released in March 2010 Guthrie's most recent releases are Emeralds (2011) and two collaboration albums with Harold Budd, Bordeaux and Winter Garden (with Eraldo Bernocchi) (both 2011). He played guitar on the Telefon Tel Aviv track \\"The Sky Is Black\\", from The Birds EP (2012). Guthrie released Fortune, his newest full-length album on 26 November 2012. In 2015, Guthrie and friend Mark Gardener of Ride wrote, performed and recorded an album Universal Road together. Guthrie currently tours live under the name \\"The Robin Guthrie Trio\\" consisting of himself, Steve Wheeler (on bass) & Antti M√§kinen (on drums). He currently works and lives in France with his wife Florence, their daughter Violette, and Lucy Belle, his daughter with Elizabeth Fraser. Recording and production work In 1987 Robin Guthrie produced The Gun Club's 4th studio album Mother Juno in Berlin. In 1990 he produced Lush's second EP Mad Love and a few other songs scattered on various compilation albums. He went on to produce their 1992 debut album Spooky and Black Spring EP (1991). In 2005 Guthrie mixed the Amber Smith's third studio album entitled RePRINT which brought the band an international breakthrough.

Pulp noir is marked by its use of classic noir techniques, but with urban influences. Various media include film, illustrations, photographs and videogames. In film Whereas film noir directly involves characters living bleak existences to accomplish a goal with odds against them, pulp noir often portrays a grittier, one-man army. Typically, the main character has no distinguishing abilities, but can hold ground against seemingly impossible odds. Pulp noir locations are often seedy, run-down and degradated urban landscapes, where the lack of law, morals and even the proliferation of crime and drugs are common themes. Another common trend in pulp noir is the glorification and/or demonization of its urban locations. Examples of films that have been referred to as pulp noir include: * The film adaptation of Frank Miller's Sin City * The Clint Eastwood film Million Dollar Baby * The Paul McGuigan film Lucky Number Slevin * The Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, which itself is an ode to the classic pulp noir/pulp fiction genre. In other media Some illustrations and photographs are described as being pulp noir. Recently, some video games, such as the Max Payne third-person shooter series, have been portrayed in a film noir style, using heavy, gritty, dirty urban themes.

Neues Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie, Monatshefte, 6:255‚Äì268 Mammoth-Saint Anthony Mine, Arizona, USA Pale grey- blue leadhillite from Tsumeb Leadhillite from the Beer Cellar Mine, Missouri, USA  Structure  Leadhillite has a layered structure. The mineral contains both carbonate and sulfate groups, and these are arranged in separate sheets. Pairs of carbonate sheets 8(PbCO3) alternate with pairs of sulfate sheets 8[Pb(SO4)0.5OH]. The carbonate sheets virtually have trigonal symmetry, but the sulfate sheets do not. All the lead (Pb) atoms in the carbonate sheets are surrounded by 9 oxygens from carbonate groups and by one hydroxyl from an adjacent sulfate sheet. The Pb atoms in the sulfate sheets are bonded to 9 or 10 oxygens.  Appearance  Crystals are usually small to microscopic, and nearly always pseudo-hexagonal, being tabular with a hexagonal outline. Prismatic forms also occur. The simplest form with faces parallel to the b axis and cutting the a and c axes (represented as {101}) may develop. When it does it may be striated or curved. The colour is white or pale shades of green, blue or yellow, but the commonest is clear to white. Leadhillite is transparent to translucent, with a white streak and a resinous to adamantine lustre, pearly on faces parallel to the plane containing the a and b axes. Tabular forms of susannite are very similar.  Optical properties  Leadhillite is biaxial (-) with the optical Z axis parallel to the crystallographic b axis, and the optical X axis inclined to the crystallographic c axis at an angle of -5.5¬∞. The refractive indices are large, giving the mineral its high lustre, nŒ± = 1.87, nŒ≤ = 2.00 and nŒ≥ = 2.01. Compare these values with that for ordinary window glass, which is only 1.5. The refractive index depends upon the direction of travel of light through the crystal. The maximum birefringence Œ¥ is the difference between the highest and the lowest values. For leadhillite Œ¥ = 0.140. An important characteristic of a biaxial material is the angle between the two optic axes, called the optic angle and designated 2V. It is possible to calculate this value from the refractive indices, and also to measure it. For leadhillite both the measured and calculated values of 2V are 10¬∞. When the colour of the incident light is changed the refractive indices change, and so does the value of 2V. This effect is known as dispersion of the optic axes. In leadhillite this effect is strong, with 2V smaller for red light than for violet light (r < v). The mineral may fluoresce yellowish longwave or shortwave ultraviolet light.  Physical properties  Leadhillite is a soft mineral, with hardness only to 3, a little less than that of calcite. It breaks with an irregular to conchoidal fracture and it is somewhat sectile. That is, thin shavings can be pared off it. It is heavy, due to the lead content, with specific gravity 6.55, similar to other lead minerals such as cerussite (6.5) and anglesite (6.3). Cleavage is perfect on a plane perpendicular to the c crystal axis. The mineral is usually twinned, according to a variety of twin laws, forming contact, penetration and lamellar twins. The typical habit is platy or tabular pseudohexagonal cyclic twinned crystals.Leadhillite on Mineral Galleries Leadhillite is soluble with effervescence in nitric acid HNO3, leaving lead sulfate.  Occurrence  The type locality is the Susanna Mine at Leadhills, Strathclyde, Scotland, UK. Leadhillite is a secondary mineral found in the oxidised zone of lead deposits associated with cerussite, anglesite, lanarkite, caledonite, linarite and pyromorphite. It may form pseudomorphs after galena or calcite, and conversely calcite and cerussite may form pseudomorphs after leadhillite. Heating leadhillite causes it to reversibly transform into susannite.

This corresponds to a representation of the molecular wave function where the variables corresponding to the molecular geometry and the electronic degrees of freedom are separated. The non separable terms are due to the nuclear kinetic energy terms in the molecular Hamiltonian and are said to couple the potential energy surfaces. In the neighbourhood of an avoided crossing or conical intersection, these terms cannot be neglected. One therefore usually performs one unitary transformation from the adiabatic representation to the so-called diabatic representation in which the nuclear kinetic energy operator is diagonal. In this representation, the coupling is due to the electronic energy and is a scalar quantity which is significantly easier to estimate numerically. In the diabatic representation, the potential energy surfaces are smoother, so that low order Taylor series expansions of the surface capture much of the complexity of the original system. However strictly diabatic states do not exist in the general case. Hence, diabatic potentials generated from transforming multiple electronic energy surfaces together are generally not exact. These can be called pseudo-diabatic potentials, but generally the term is not used unless it is necessary to highlight this subtlety. Hence, pseudo- diabatic potentials are synonymous with diabatic potentials. Applicability The motivation to calculate diabatic potentials often occurs when the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation does not hold, or is not justified for the molecular system under study. For these systems, it is necessary to go beyond the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation. This is often the terminology used to refer to the study of nonadiabatic systems. A well known approach involves recasting the molecular Schr√∂dinger equation into a set of coupled eigenvalue equations. This is achieved by expansion of the exact wave function in terms of products of electronic and nuclear wave functions (adiabatic states) followed by integration over the electronic coordinates. The coupled operator equations thus obtained depend on nuclear coordinates only. Off-diagonal elements in these equations are nuclear kinetic energy terms. A diabatic transformation of the adiabatic states replaces these off-diagonal kinetic energy terms by potential energy terms. Sometimes, this is called the \\"adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation\\", abbreviated ADT. Diabatic transformation of two electronic surfaces In order to introduce the diabatic transformation we assume now, for the sake of argument, that only two Potential Energy Surfaces (PES), 1 and 2, approach each other and that all other surfaces are well separated; the argument can be generalized to more surfaces. Let the collection of electronic coordinates be indicated by \\\\mathbf{r}, while \\\\mathbf{R} indicates dependence on nuclear coordinates. Thus, we assume E_1(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\approx E_2(\\\\mathbf{R}) with corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates \\\\chi_1(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\, and \\\\chi_2(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\,. In the absence of magnetic interactions these electronic states, which depend parametrically on the nuclear coordinates, may be taken to be real-valued functions. The nuclear kinetic energy is a sum over nuclei A with mass MA, : T_\\\\mathrm{n} = \\\\sum_{A} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z} \\\\frac{P_{A\\\\alpha} P_{A\\\\alpha}}{2M_A} \\\\quad\\\\mathrm{with}\\\\quad P_{A\\\\alpha} = -i abla_{A\\\\alpha} \\\\equiv -i \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\quad}{\\\\partial R_{A\\\\alpha}}. (Atomic units are used here). By applying the Leibniz rule for differentiation, the matrix elements of T_{\\\\textrm{n}} are (where we suppress coordinates for clarity reasons): : \\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{k'k} \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\chi_{k'}  T_n  \\\\chi_k\\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} = \\\\delta_{k'k} T_{\\\\textrm{n}} \\\\+ \\\\sum_{A,\\\\alpha}\\\\frac{1}{M_A} \\\\langle\\\\chi_{k'}\\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\chi_k\\\\big)\\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} P_{A\\\\alpha} + \\\\langle\\\\chi_{k'}\\\\big(T_\\\\mathrm{n}\\\\chi_k\\\\big)\\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})}. The subscript {(\\\\mathbf{r})} indicates that the integration inside the bracket is over electronic coordinates only. Let us further assume that all off-diagonal matrix elements \\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{kp} = \\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{pk} may be neglected except for k = 1 and p = 2. Upon making the expansion : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\chi_1(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\Phi_1(\\\\mathbf{R})+ \\\\chi_2(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\Phi_2(\\\\mathbf{R}), the coupled Schr√∂dinger equations for the nuclear part take the form (see the article Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation) \\\\begin{pmatrix} E_1(\\\\mathbf{R})+ \\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{11}&\\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{21}&E;_2(\\\\mathbf{R})+\\\\mathrm{T_n}(\\\\mathbf{R})_{22}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = E \\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{with}\\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}(\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\equiv \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\Phi_1(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Phi_2(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} . In order to remove the problematic off-diagonal kinetic energy terms, we define two new orthonormal states by a diabatic transformation of the adiabatic states \\\\chi_{1}\\\\, and \\\\chi_{2}\\\\, : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\varphi_1(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_2(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) & \\\\sin\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) & \\\\cos\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\chi_1(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\chi_2(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} where \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) is the diabatic angle. Transformation of the matrix of nuclear momentum \\\\langle\\\\chi_{k'}\\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\chi_k\\\\big)\\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} for k', k =1,2 gives for diagonal matrix elements : \\\\langle{\\\\varphi_k} \\\\big( P_{A\\\\alpha} \\\\varphi_k\\\\big) \\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} = 0 \\\\quad\\\\textrm{for}\\\\quad k=1, \\\\, 2. These elements are zero because \\\\varphi_k is real and P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\, is Hermitian and pure-imaginary. The off-diagonal elements of the momentum operator satisfy, : \\\\langle{\\\\varphi_2} \\\\big( P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\varphi_1\\\\big) \\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} = \\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\big) + \\\\langle\\\\chi_2 \\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha} \\\\chi_1\\\\big)\\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})}. Assume that a diabatic angle \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) exists, such that to a good approximation : \\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha}\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\big)+ \\\\langle\\\\chi_2\\\\big(P_{A\\\\alpha} \\\\chi_1\\\\big) \\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} = 0 i.e., \\\\varphi_1 and \\\\varphi_2 diagonalize the 2 x 2 matrix of the nuclear momentum. By the definition of Smith \\\\varphi_1 and \\\\varphi_2 are diabatic states. (Smith was the first to define this concept; earlier the term diabatic was used somewhat loosely by Lichten ). By a small change of notation these differential equations for \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) can be rewritten in the following more familiar form: : F_{A\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = - abla_{A\\\\alpha} V(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\qquad\\\\mathrm{with}\\\\;\\\\; V(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\;\\\\;\\\\mathrm{and}\\\\;\\\\;F_{A\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\equiv \\\\langle\\\\chi_2\\\\big(iP_{A\\\\alpha} \\\\chi_1\\\\big) \\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} . It is well known that the differential equations have a solution (i.e., the \\"potential\\" V exists) if and only if the vector field (\\"force\\") F_{A\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{R}) is irrotational, : abla_{A\\\\alpha} F_{B\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) - abla_{B \\\\beta} F_{A\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = 0. It can be shown that these conditions are rarely ever satisfied, so that a strictly diabatic transformation rarely ever exists. It is common to use approximate functions \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) leading to pseudo diabatic states. Under the assumption that the momentum operators are represented exactly by 2 x 2 matrices, which is consistent with neglect of off-diagonal elements other than the (1,2) element and the assumption of \\"strict\\" diabaticity, it can be shown that : \\\\langle \\\\varphi_{k'}  T_n  \\\\varphi_k \\\\rangle_{(\\\\mathbf{r})} = \\\\delta_{k'k} T_n. On the basis of the diabatic states the nuclear motion problem takes the following generalized Born‚ÄìOppenheimer form \\\\begin{pmatrix} T_\\\\mathrm{n}+ \\\\frac{E_{1}(\\\\mathbf{R})+E_{2}(\\\\mathbf{R})}{2} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & T_\\\\mathrm{n} + \\\\frac{E_{1}(\\\\mathbf{R})+E_{2}(\\\\mathbf{R})}{2} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\+ \\\\tfrac{E_{2}(\\\\mathbf{R})-E_{1}(\\\\mathbf{R})}{2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos2\\\\gamma & \\\\sin2\\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin2\\\\gamma & -\\\\cos2\\\\gamma \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = E \\\\tilde{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi}}(\\\\mathbf{R}). It is important to note that the off- diagonal elements depend on the diabatic angle and electronic energies only. The surfaces E_{1}(\\\\mathbf{R}) and E_{2}(\\\\mathbf{R}) are adiabatic PESs obtained from clamped nuclei electronic structure calculations and T_\\\\mathrm{n}\\\\, is the usual nuclear kinetic energy operator defined above. Finding approximations for \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) is the remaining problem before a solution of the Schr√∂dinger equations can be attempted. Much of the current research in quantum chemistry is devoted to this determination. Once \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{R}) has been found and the coupled equations have been solved, the final vibronic wave function in the diabatic approximation is : \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\varphi_1(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\tilde\\\\Phi_1(\\\\mathbf{R})+ \\\\varphi_2(\\\\mathbf{r};\\\\mathbf{R})\\\\tilde\\\\Phi_2(\\\\mathbf{R}). Adiabatic-to- diabatic transformation Here, in contrast to previous treatments, the non- Abelian case is considered. Felix Smith in his article considers the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation (ADT) for a multi-state system but a single coordinate, \\\\mathrm{R_{A\\\\alpha}}. In Diabatic, the ADT is defined for a system of two coordinates \\\\mathrm{R_{A\\\\alpha}} and \\\\mathrm{R_{B\\\\beta}}, but it is restricted to two states. Such a system is defined as Abelian and the ADT matrix is expressed in terms of an angle, \\\\gamma (see Comment below), known also as the ADT angle. In the present treatment a system is assumed that is made up of M (> 2) states defined for an N-dimensional configuration space, where N = 2 or N > 2\\\\. Such a system is defined as non-Abelian. To discuss the non-Abelian case the equation for the just mentioned ADT angle, \\\\gamma (see Diabatic), is replaced by an equation for the MxM, ADT matrix, \\\\mathbf{A}: : abla \\\\mathbf{ A + FA = 0} where \\\\mathbf{F} is the force-matrix operator, introduced in Diabatic, also known as the Non-Adiabatic Coupling Transformation (NACT) matrix: : \\\\ \\\\mathbf{F}_{jk} = \\\\langle \\\\chi_j\\\\mid abla \\\\chi_k\\\\rangle;\\\\qquad j,k=1,2,\\\\ldots,M Here abla is the N-dimensional (nuclear) grad-operator: : abla = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\quad}{\\\\partial q_{1}},\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\quad}{\\\\partial q_{2}} , \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\quad}{\\\\partial q_N} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} and \\\\chi_k( \\\\mathbf{r\\\\mid q} ) \\\\rangle;\\\\ k= 1,M,are the electronic adiabatic eigenfunctions which depend explicitly on the electronic coordinates \\\\mathbf{r} and parametrically on the nuclear coordinates \\\\mathbf{q} . To derive the matrix \\\\mathbf{A} one has to solve the above given first order differential equation along a specified contour \\\\Gamma . This solution is then applied to form the diabatic potential matrix \\\\mathbf{W} : : \\\\mathbf{W} = \\\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\\\mathbf{uA} where \\\\mathbf{u}_j ; j = 1, M are the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer adiabatic potentials. In order for \\\\mathbf{W} to be single-valued in configuration space, \\\\mathbf{A} has to be analytic and in order for \\\\mathbf{A} to be analytic (excluding the pathological points), the components of the vector matrix, \\\\mathbf{F} , have to satisfy the following equation: : G_{{q_i }{q_j}}= \\\\frac{{\\\\partial}\\\\mathbf{F}_{q_i}}{\\\\partial q_{j}} - \\\\frac{{\\\\partial}\\\\mathbf{F}_{q_j}}{\\\\partial q_i} - \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{F}_{q_i} , \\\\mathbf{F}_{q_j} \\\\right] = 0. where \\\\mathbf{G} is a tensor field. This equation is known as the non-Abelian form of the Curl Equation. A solution of the ADT matrix \\\\mathbf{A} along the contour \\\\Gamma can be shown to be of the form:D.R. Yarkony, in: W. Domcke, D.R. Yarkony and H. K√∂ppel, Eds., Conical Intersections: Electronic Structure, Dynamics and Spectroscopy, (Singapore: World Sci. 2004 : \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\Gamma \\\\right) = \\\\hat{P} \\\\exp : \\\\left( - \\\\int_\\\\mathbf{q_0}^\\\\mathbf{q}\\\\mathbf{F} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q'}\\\\mid \\\\Gamma \\\\right) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q'}\\\\right) (see also Geometric phase). Here \\\\hat{P} is an ordering operator, the dot stands for a scalar product and \\\\mathbf{q} and \\\\mathbf{q_0} are two points on \\\\Gamma. A different type of solutions is based on quasi-Euler angles according to which any \\\\mathbf{A}-matrix can be expressed as a product of Euler matrices. For instance in case of a tri-state system this matrix can be presented as a product of three such matrices, \\\\mathbf{Q}_{j}(\\\\gamma_{ij}) (i < j = 2, 3) where e.g. \\\\mathbf{Q}_{13} (\\\\gamma_{13}) is of the form: : \\\\mathbf{Q}_{13} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\gamma_{13} & 0 & \\\\sin\\\\gamma_{13}\\\\\\\\\\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin\\\\gamma_{13} & 0 & \\\\cos\\\\gamma_{13} \\\\end{pmatrix} The product \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{Q}_{kl} \\\\mathbf{Q}_{mn} \\\\mathbf{Q}_{pq} which can be written in any order, is substituted in Eq. (1) to yield three first order differential equations for the three {\\\\gamma}_{ij}-angles where two of these equations are coupled and the third stands on its own. Thus, assuming: \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\mathbf{Q}_{12} \\\\mathbf{Q}_{23} \\\\mathbf{Q}_{13} the two coupled equations for {\\\\gamma}_{12} and {\\\\gamma}_{23} are: : abla \\\\gamma_{12} = -F_{12} - \\\\tan{\\\\gamma}_{23} (- F_{13} \\\\cos\\\\gamma_{12} + F_{23}\\\\sin \\\\gamma_{12}) : abla \\\\gamma_{23} = - (F_{23} \\\\cos\\\\gamma_{12} + F_{13} \\\\sin\\\\gamma_{12}) whereas the third equation (for \\\\gamma_{13}) becomes an ordinary (line) integral: : abla \\\\gamma_{13} =(\\\\cos\\\\gamma_{23})^{-1}(- F_{13}\\\\cos\\\\gamma_{12} + F_{23}\\\\sin\\\\gamma_{12}) expressed solely in terms of \\\\gamma_{12} and \\\\gamma_{23}. Similarly, in case of a four-state system \\\\mathbf{A} is presented as a product of six 4 x 4 Euler matrices (for the six quasi-Euler angles) and the relevant six differential equations form one set of three coupled equations, whereas the other three become, as before, ordinary line integrals. A comment concerning the two- state (Abelian) case Since the treatment of the two-state case as presented in Diabatic raised numerous doubts we consider it here as a special case of the Non-Abelian case just discussed. For this purpose we assume the 2 √ó 2 ADT matrix \\\\mathrm{A} to be of the form: : \\\\mathrm{A} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\cos\\\\gamma & \\\\- \\\\sin\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sin\\\\gamma & \\\\cos\\\\gamma \\\\end{pmatrix} Substituting this matrix in the above given first order differential equation (for \\\\mathrm{A}) we get, following a few algebraic rearrangements, that the angle \\\\gamma fulfills the corresponding first order differential equation as well as the subsequent line integral: : abla \\\\mathbf{ \\\\gamma + F_{12} = 0 } \\\\cdot \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\cdot\\\\gamma\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q}\\\\mid \\\\Gamma \\\\right) = -\\\\int_\\\\mathbf{q_0}^\\\\mathbf{q}\\\\mathbf{F}_{12} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{q'}\\\\mid \\\\Gamma \\\\right) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{q'} where \\\\mathrm{F}_{12} is the relevant NACT matrix element, the dot stands for a scalar product and \\\\Gamma is a chosen contour in configuration space (usually a planar one) along which the integration is performed. The line integral yields meaningful results if and only if the corresponding (previously derived) Curl-equation is zero for every point in the region of interest (ignoring the pathological points).

It was released simultaneously in single and double CD/cassette formats on October 26, 1993, by Sire Records, then DVD format on January 24, 2006. The single CD is an abridged version of the double CD edition, featuring tracks 2, 13‚Äì16, 5, 6, 9, 18, and 20‚Äì23 in that order. There are no different takes of songs across the multiple editions although the actual track times differ by a few seconds between releases. Background In late 1992, the Velvet Underground 1965‚Äì1968 core line-up of Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker suddenly decided to reform. The decision was entirely unexpected because the relationship between Reed and Cale had been sour ever since the late 60s, and though it had ameliorated after back catalogue royalty renegotiations in the mid-80s, it had hit another low after their 1990 collaboration Songs for Drella. Nevertheless, an impromptu one-song reunion in Jouy-en-Josas, France, later that year for an Andy Warhol exhibition set the scene and by 1993, the band had started to rehearse for European and American tours. Lou Reed's then-current record company, Sire Records, agreed to release a live album from the European tour, and ambitious plans were made for both an MTV Unplugged appearance with accompanying album and a subsequent studio album. Two key people did not participate in the reunion: sometime singer Nico, who had died in 1988; and latter-day vocalist/bassist/keyboard player Doug Yule, who Sterling Morrison would have liked to participate but who was vetoed out by Reed and Cale. Yule later stated that, although he would have liked being considered at least, he would have declined anyway because of family priorities. The album was recorded during a three-night residence in the Paris venue L'Olympia. John Cale later said, \\"During the second night we hit the home run\\", and it is of this night that most of the Live MCMXCIII tracks were taken. The rest were taken from the third night. Live MCMXCIII captures the band playing most of the Velvet classics from the back catalogue, with emphasis on the more structured songs. While they mainly stuck with their classics, there were two major improvisations on the European tour. \\"Some Kinda Love\\" was extended considerably to 9:06, with Cale improvising on piano, and Reed playing lengthy guitar solos throughout. The other improvisation on the tour was on \\"Hey Mr. Rain\\", where Cale and Reed solo \\"against\\" each other on viola and guitar, respectively, for 15:42. The band also performed two new songs: \\"Velvet Nursery Rhyme\\", a short tongue-in-cheek reunion theme song where Reed introduces the members of the band, and \\"Coyote\\", a Reed/Cale collaboration. Emphasis is on the band's first and third records and the \\"lost fourth album\\" (see VU and Another View), with only two songs from Loaded. During the six- week European tour, relationships quickly soured again and by the end of the tour all other plans were off, never to rematerialise. The band's latest breakup proved final when Sterling Morrison died in the summer of 1995. The Velvets' reunion itself met with critical praise from the mainstream rock press, and generated heavy publicity for the band (resulting in the six-week European tour having many sold out venues or near capacity), but the album received mixed reviews. The public and the critics were split into two camps: those who did not want to spoil their vision of the band from the 60s and those who wanted to see the legendary four back together on stage and find out whether they could still be relevant. Reviews reflected the views of the two camps. After its release, Cale expressed disappointment in the album's mix: \\"The trouble is that we had an opportunity here with the live album to really show what the band sounded like and it really doesn't give it to you. Some of the bootlegs that came out of the tour are almost a truer vision of what the band sounded like than the well recorded one, because the well recorded one really didn't take advantage of the ambiance of the room in the mix of the music. And that's what we were always pushing at. We wanted to fill the room up with this noise. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as present in the mix as I would have liked it to be or others would have liked it to be either.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Lou Reed except as noted. =Double-CD edition= Personnel ;The Velvet Underground *John Cale ‚Äì bass guitar, keyboards, viola, backing vocals, lead vocal on \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\", \\"The Gift\\", \\"Femme Fatale\\" and \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\" *Sterling Morrison ‚Äì rhythm and lead guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals *Lou Reed ‚Äì lead and rhythm guitar, lead vocals *Maureen Tucker ‚Äì percussion, keyboards on \\"Black Angel's Death Song\\", lead vocal on \\"After Hours\\" and \\"I'm Sticking with You\\" ;Technical staff *Mike Rathke ‚Äì producer Album Design-Spencer Drate,Judith Salavetz,Sylvia Reed Photography-Ted Chin References External links *The Velvet Underground Web Page Category:1993 live albums Category:The Velvet Underground live albums Category:Sire Records live albums Category:Films directed by Declan Lowney ","title":"Live MCMXCIII"},{"id":"2178919","text":"Tourfilm (1990) is a documentary-style concert film by American rock band R.E.M.

It was a popular strand of the late 1990s and 2000s European dance music scene and a form of Euro disco. The genre has also been referred to as over the years. The defining characteristics of the sound are heavy reliance on filter and phaser effects both on and alongside samples from late 1970s and early 1980s American or European disco tracks (or original hooks strongly inspired by such samples), causing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre's descendants. Most tracks in this vein feature steady beats with a tempo range of 110‚Äì130 beats per minute. French house tends to be confused with a genre known as future funk, although they are not the same genre. Purveyors of French house include Daft Punk,Village Voice: Daft Punk by Scott Woods Cassius, Modjo and √âtienne de Cr√©cy.  History and influences  French house is greatly influenced by the lineage of American dance music from the emergence of disco onwards, maintaining a distinct connection to Euro disco and the short lived space disco music style. Space disco was very popular in France, with artists like Cerrone, Space and Sheila B. Devotion during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Additional influences came from P-Funk, especially the George Clinton and Bootsy Collins hits of that era. Due to originating from the same foreign market, P-Funk was played alongside disco in many French discoth√®ques, especially after the Disco Demolition Night took place in the United States. The Jacking aspect of Chicago house was also picked up on as a theme to incorporate (with \\"jack house\\" becoming a short-lived descriptive term for the sound in the UK). Furthermore, the influence of musical French figures of the seventies as Fran√ßois de Roubaix, Jean-Michel Jarre or Serge Gainsbourg was also critical. An early example of French house could be Dance released in 1990 by New York house producer Earth People (Joseph Longo). Thomas Bangalter's tracks for his Roul√© label may be considered the earliest examples of an attempt to establish a distinctive style of French house. His solo material, along with his work as a member of Daft Punk and Stardust, had a significant impact upon the French house scene during the mid-to-late 1990s.Suzanne Ely, \\"Return of the Cybermen\\" Mixmag, July 2006, pp. 94‚Äì98. The French duo Motorbass (Philippe Zdar, later of Cassius, and √âtienne de Cr√©cy) were also among the first in France to produce house tracks which were largely based around samples and filtered loops ‚Äì in turn inspired by emerging American house producers such as DJ Sneak, Green Velvet and Roger Sanchez and their penchant for producing sample-led house tracks with deep funky grooves ‚Äì and released a sole full-length album, Pansoul. Parisian producer St. Germain produced house tracks with a similar style at the time but these were more directly influenced by jazz as opposed to the brasher vocal disco records appropriated, while other known French DJ-turned-producers at the time such as Fran√ßois Kevorkian and Laurent Garnier remained relatively distant from the emerging French house label. The first French house experiments were warmly received by the UK dance music press and European DJ's in the mid-1990s but major commercial success did not occur until 1997. Daft Punk, Cassius and, later, Stardust were the first internationally successful artists of the genre. Along with Air these acts were signed to Virgin Records and benefited from distinctive music videos directed by the likes of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Alex & Martin. Due to a reasonable amount of buzz generated from the huge clubbing scene and major record company support, Daft Punk's debut album Homework entered the top 10 of the UK album charts on release and they effectively became the biggest-selling French act in the UK since Jean-Michel Jarre. The emergence of the French sound was well-timed as dance music's popularity in the influential UK market was peaking commercially with general electronic music. Further international commercial success continued into 2000 with Bob Sinclar, √âtienne de Cr√©cy, Benjamin Diamond and Modjo achieving hit singles around Europe. In late 2005, pop superstar Madonna released Confessions on a Dance Floor, an album with significant French house influences in several of its songs. As of the mid to late-2010s, there is a resurgence in interest in French house, with material being released from artists such as Folamour and Mirrorball Disco Squad from Paris, as well as Tiger and Woods from Italy. This sound is also being championed on the lo-fi house scene by the likes of Mall Grab and Loods.  Terms, origins and variations  The term \\"French touch\\" was first used in Paris in July 1987. Jean-Claude Lagr√®ze, a photographer of parisians' nights created a couple of \\"French Touch\\" parties at The Palace to make people discover house music. These parties were driven by DJ Laurent Garnier, Guillaume la Tortue and David Guetta. This expression was printed, as part of a motto for French partygoers who liked house music, on a trendy jacket by √âric Morand for Fnac Music Dance Division, in 1991. The motto was: \\"We Give a French Touch to House\\". British music journalists used the expression and contributed to the diffusion of this movement. The first time this term was used widespreadly by MTV UK during the Christmas holiday period of 1999. It was used on an MTV News special, to describe a so-called \\"French house explosion\\" phenomenon. Bob Sinclar was interviewed, as well as Air (a non-house act) and Cassius. This news special later aired on all the MTV local variations worldwide, spreading the term and introducing the \\"French house\\" sound to the mainstream. Prior to that (1996‚Äì2000), \\"French house\\" had been referred to among Europeans as \\"nu disco\\", \\"disco house\\" and \\"new disco\\". However, the term \\"French touch\\" was first used by music journalist Martin James in his 1996 review of the first Super Discount EP in the now defunct weekly music paper Melody Maker. This term became favoured among the French media and was then widely used in the UK press by 1998.'French Connections: From Discotheque to Discovery' by Martin James, 2002, Sanctuary Publishing Martin James was later recognised by French newspaper Liberation and Radio NRJ as the journalist responsible for naming the French house phenomenon \\"French touch\\". One of the biggest markets for nu disco at the time was Greece, especially Athens. A local music shop called Discobole Records imported the records direct from France and middle class clubs like City Groove dedicated totally to the genre between 1998 and 2001. In Greece, this music style was promoted as \\"disco house\\". At the same time, disco house began to gain success in Canada. During 1999 many events also took place on Spain's Ibiza island, and has continued to be a very popular destination for British tourists. French house is essentially a combination of three production styles. One is what the French still refer as \\"the French touch\\" and it is the style that greatly influenced by the space disco sound. The second is a continuation and update of Euro disco and greatly influenced by the productions of Alec R. Costandinos. The third would be the deep American house style as evident in the similar treatment of samples and repetitive 'funky' hooks. Naturally, further variations and mutations followed. French house maintains the established \\"French touch\\" sound, focused more on Euro disco-like vocals and less emphasis on the \\"space disco\\" themes. However, most of the music's most successful acts have altered their sound since. Bob Sinclar's later work, including the hit single \\"World, Hold On (Children of the Sky)\\", which had a video based on a science fiction theme, maintains only a distant connection to the original French house sound. Both Daft Punk and Etienne de Crecy subsequently developed a harder synthetic sound more directly inspired by techno, electro and pop. In Ibiza, disco house took later another direction: it combined vocals and some elements from the UK's speed garage (a mid 1990s music style) with a local Latin flavor. By 2007, many underground disco house productions belonged to the Ibiza school.

In the vicinity of conical intersections, the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation breaks down and the coupling between electronic and nuclear motion becomes important, allowing non-adiabatic processes to take place. The location and characterization of conical intersections are therefore essential to the understanding of a wide range of important phenomena governed by non-adiabatic events, such as photoisomerization, photosynthesis, vision and the photostability of DNA. The conical intersection involving the ground electronic state potential energy surface of the C6H3F3+ molecular ion is discussed in connection with the Jahn- Teller effect in Section 13.4.2 on pages 380-388 of the textbook by Bunker and Jensen.Molecular Symmetry and Spectroscopy, 2nd ed. Philip R. Bunker and Per Jensen, NRC Research Press, Ottawa (1998) Conical intersections are also called molecular funnels or diabolic points as they have become an established paradigm for understanding reaction mechanisms in photochemistry as important as transitions states in thermal chemistry. This comes from the very important role they play in non-radiative de-excitation transitions from excited electronic states to the ground electronic state of molecules. For example, the stability of DNA with respect to the UV irradiation is due to such conical intersection. The molecular wave packet excited to some electronic excited state by the UV photon follows the slope of the potential energy surface and reaches the conical intersection from above. At this point the very large vibronic coupling induces a non-radiative transition (surface-hopping) which leads the molecule back to its electronic ground state. The singularity of vibronic coupling at conical intersections is responsible for the existence of Geometric phase, which was discovered by Longuet-HigginsSee page 12 in this context. Degenerate points between potential energy surfaces lie in what is called the intersection or seam space with a dimensionality of 3N-8 (where N is the number of atoms). Any critical points in this space of degeneracy are characterised as minima, transition states or higher-order saddle points and can be connected to each other through the analogue of an intrinsic reaction coordinate in the seam. In benzene, for example, there is a recurrent connectivity pattern where permutationally isomeric seam segments are connected by intersections of a higher symmetry point group. The remaining two dimensions that lift the energetic degeneracy of the system are known as the branching space. Local characterization Conical intersections are ubiquitous in both trivial and non-trivial chemical systems. In an ideal system of two dimensionalities, this can occur at one molecular geometry. If the potential energy surfaces are plotted as functions of the two coordinates, they form a cone centered at the degeneracy point. This is shown in the adjacent picture, where the upper and lower potential energy surfaces are plotted in different colors. The name conical intersection comes from this observation. In diatomic molecules, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom is 1. Without the necessary two dimensions required to form the cone shape, conical intersections cannot exist in these molecules. Instead, the potential energy curves experience avoided crossings if they have the same point group symmetry, otherwise they can cross.. In molecules with three or more atoms, the number of degrees of freedom for molecular vibrations is at least 3. In these systems, when spin-orbit interaction is ignored, the degeneracy of conical intersection is lifted through first order by displacements in a two dimensional subspace of the nuclear coordinate space. The two-dimensional degeneracy lifting subspace is referred to as the branching space or branching plane. This space is spanned by two vectors, the difference of energy gradient vectors of the two intersecting electronic states (the g vector), and the non-adiabatic coupling vector between these two states (the h vector). Because the electronic states are degenerate, the wave functions of the two electronic states are subject to an arbitrary rotation. Therefore, the g and h vectors are also subject to a related arbitrary rotation, despite the fact that the space spanned by the two vectors is invariant. To enable a consistent representation of the branching space, the set of wave functions that makes the g and h vectors orthogonal is usually chosen. This choice is unique up to the signs and switchings of the two vectors, and allows these two vectors to have proper symmetry when the molecular geometry is symmetric. The degeneracy is preserved through first order by differential displacements that are perpendicular to the branching space. The space of non-degeneracy-lifting displacements, which is the orthogonal complement of the branching space, is termed the seam space. Movement within the seam space will take the molecule from one point of conical intersection to an adjacent point of conical intersection. For an open shell molecule, when spin-orbit interaction is added to the, the dimensionality of seam space is reduced. The presence of conical intersections is difficult to detect experimentally. Only recently it has been proposed that two-dimensional spectroscopy can be used to detect their presence through the modulation of the frequency of the vibrational coupling mode. Categorization by symmetry of intersecting electronic states Conical intersections can occur between electronic states with the same or different point group symmetry, with the same or different spin symmetry. When restricted to a non- relativistic Coulomb Hamiltonian, conical intersections can be classified as symmetry-required, accidental symmetry-allowed, or accidental same-symmetry, according to the symmetry of the intersecting states. A symmetry-required conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states carrying the same multidimensional irreducible representation. For example, intersections between a pair of E states at a geometry that has a non-abelian group symmetry (e.g. C3h, C3v or D3h). It is named symmetry-required because these electronic states will always be degenerate as long as the symmetry is present. Symmetry-required intersections are often associated with Jahn-Teller effect. An accidental symmetry-allowed conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states that carry different point group symmetry. It is called accidental because the states may or may not be degenerate when the symmetry is present. Movement along one of the dimensions along which the degeneracy is lifted, the direction of the difference of the energy gradients of the two electronic states, will preserve the symmetry while displacements along the other degeneracy lifting dimension, the direction of the non- adiabatic couplings, will break the symmetry of the molecule. Thus, by enforcing the symmetry of the molecule, the degeneracy lifting effect caused by inter-state couplings is prevented. Therefore, the search for a symmetry- allowed intersection becomes a one-dimensional problem and does not require knowledge of the non-adiabatic couplings, significantly simplifying the effort. As a result, all the conical intersections found through quantum mechanical calculations during the early years of quantum chemistry were symmetry-allowed intersections. An accidental same-symmetry conical intersection is an intersection between two electronic states that carry the same point group symmetry. While this type of intersection was traditionally more difficult to locate, a number of efficient searching algorithms and methods to compute non-adiabatic couplings have emerged in the past decade. It is now understood that same-symmetry intersections play as important a role in non-adiabatic processes as symmetry-allowed intersections.

They have garnered acclaim for their energetic and intense live shows. They announced on July 14, 2008 that they had left their label Ferret Music and signed with Epitaph Records instead.ETID Searching For New Label: Rock Sound Their eighth and latest studio album Low Teens was released through Epitaph on September 23, 2016.  History  =Early years, The Burial Plot Bidding War and Last Night In Town (1998‚Äì2000)= The band was established by Jordan Buckley, Andy Williams and Michael Novak. They added Keith Buckley on vocals and bassist John McCarthy. They played their first show in Hamilton, Ontario. In their first short tour covering the Buffalo, New York and Toronto, Ontario, Canada vicinity, the band met Goodfellow Records producer Chris Logan, who released the band's debut EP The Burial Plot Bidding War in December 1999. The band also contributed and exclusive song to Redstar Records' Various Artists compilation The Sound and the Fury, released in October 1999. The following year, Aaron Ratajczak replaced McCarthy as bassist and the band entered Zing Studios in Westfield, Massachusetts to begin recording their debut full length for Ferret Records in January 2001. The band released Last Night In Town on August 14, 2001 and embarked on an east coast tour with Killswitch Engage in support. That same year Stephen Micciche, of Kid Gorgeous replaced Ratajczak as bassist. =Hot Damn! and Gutter Phenomenon (2001‚Äì2006)= In mid-December 2002, it was announced that the band had booked time to record their next album in February 2003, with the aim of releasing it in June. Recording took place at Trax East studios in South River, New Jersey with producer Eric Rachel. On February 13, 2003, it was announced that drums had been tracked and that progress on guitars was underway. The following March, the band embarked on tour with Unearth and Evergreen Terrace and shot a music video for the album's lead single, \\"Ebolorama\\" with director Darren Doane. The band released Hot Damn! on July 1, 2003 and embarked on an American tour supporting Jackass star Steve-O. The album was well received and brought about their first mini Warped Tour stint, overseas tours with NORA and Chimaira, numerous U.S tours with bands such as Bleeding Through, Norma Jean, Dillinger Escape Plan and a spot on the 2004 Ozzfest tour. Micciche resigned from his position in 2005 to towards the end of the writing sessions for Gutter Phenomenon with the band announcing they were accepting online submissions to replace Micciche. Kevin Falk of Between The Buried and Me filled the vacant position in April 2005. The band released Gutter Phenomenon on August 23, 2005 on Ferret Records with Falk being let go from the band almost immediately after the album's release for personal reasons. He was replaced by Chris Byrnes of NORA who left the band immediately following their stint on Warped Tour 2006 under amicable circumstances. He was replaced by Keller Harbin of The Chariot and embarked on tour with Atreyu on the World Championship Tour along with From First to Last and Chiodos. On October 30, 2006, the band released their first DVD entitled \\"Shit Happens\\" including various home videos, tour antics and live footage of the band. =The Big Dirty and New Junk Aesthetic (2007‚Äì2011)= In February 2007, Keith Buckley stated that the band had been holed up in a basement in North Tonawanda, New York writing their fourth album. On April 24, 2007 the band announced that The Big Dirty would be released on September 4 of that year. The band embarked on tour with Norma Jean of June 2007. The next month the band released the first single, \\"Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Battery\\" on all streaming services. Upon release of the album, Josh Newton replaced Harbin on bass and the band embarked on tour with Underoath, Poison The Well and Maylene and The Sons Of Disaster. The band performed the song \\"We'rewolf\\" live on the ABC late night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Halloween of 2007. From January‚ÄìFebruary 2008, Every Time I Die went on a tour with Killswitch Engage, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Parkway Drive. They also headlined the Take Action Tour, playing alongside From First to Last, August Burns Red, The Bled, and The Human Abstract. The band played the entire Warped Tour 2008. In July 2008, Keith Buckley announced that the band had fulfilled their contract with Ferret Records and were looking for a new label. In February 2009 the band announced that they have signed with Epitaph Records and would be going into the studio later that year to begin production on their fifth album. During the 2009 UK tour with Gallows, a song titled \\"Buffalo 666\\" was played for the first time. At the end of June it was announced that drummer Mike \\"Ratboy\\" Novak had left the band due to \\"personal conflicts\\". On August 23 of that year, Ryan \\"Legs\\" Leger was added as the new drummer. The band released New Junk Aesthetic on September 15, 2009. The band was part of the European Taste of Chaos tour at the end of 2009, supporting headliners Killswitch Engage and In Flames. Every Time I Die headlined the 2010 Australian Boys of Summer Tour. In support of Every Time I Die were Australian bands 50 Lions, House vs. Hurricane and Mary Jane Kelly. The band toured across Australia playing shows in Sydney, Gold Coast, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Josh Newton announced on October 12, 2011 that he was no longer in the band. For the remainder of the tour, Stephen Micciche filled his role as bassist. On December 12, they released a video on Warped Tour's YouTube channel announcing they were playing all dates on the 2012 Warped Tour. =Ex Lives and From Parts Unknown (2012‚Äì2015)= Ryan Leger (pictured in 2013) was the band's drummer from 2009 to 2015. He was succeeded by Daniel Davison, formerly of Norma Jean, and in 2017, joined Norma Jean, replacing Clayton Holyoak, who is ETID's current drummer. In January 2012, Every Time I Die released their video for \\"Underwater Bimbos from Outer Space\\", from their album Ex Lives, which was released on March 6, 2012. On February 23, the band released the second single and music video off the album for \\"Revival Mode\\". The band embarked on tour with The Devil Wears Prada, Oh, Sleeper and Letlive. in 2012 in support of Ex Lives. On October 15, 2013, the band was announced to be a support act for A Day to Remember on their European Tour 2014. In the spring of 2014, the band announced that they were starting production on their seventh studio album From Parts Unknown with producer Kurt Ballou which was released July 8, 2014 along with their sixth run on the Vans Warped Tour 20th edition. The album peaked at #22 on the Billboard 200, their second top 25 in the band's existence. Following their time on Warped Tour Every Time I Die started a Canadian tour in mid September with Expire and Counterparts. Following their Canadian tour, they co-headlined a winter tour with The Ghost Inside along with support from Architects, Backtrack and Hundredth as their openers. In February 2015, the band announced Ryan Leger's departure, and he was replaced by Daniel Davison, formerly of Norma Jean and Underoath. On March 29, the band revealed that they would be releasing an EP exclusively for Record Store Day titled Salem. =Low Teens and future (2015‚Äìpresent)= In December 2015 while on tour with August Burns Red, vocalist Keith Buckley left due to a life- threatening emergency with his 7-month pregnant wife and unborn daughter. It was during this time and the subsequent hospital stays that Buckley wrote a vast majority of lyrics for a new album while awaiting their clean bill of health and recovery. On September 23, 2016 the band released Low Teens to universal critical acclaim. The band spent the next 2 years touring with the likes of Knocked Loose, Harm's Way, Fall Out Boy, Taking Back Sunday, '68, Motionless In White, Turnstile and Machine Gun Kelly in support of the album. In September 2017, Daniel Davison parted ways with the band citing exhaustion from touring. He was replaced by Clayton \\"Goose\\" Holyoak of Fear Before The March Of Flames and coincidentally from being a replacement for Davison once before in Norma Jean. Holyoak was subsequently replaced in Norma Jean by former ETID drummer Ryan Leger. On June 21, 2018, the band embarked on the final run of the Vans Warped Tour. In October 2018, the band announced that they will embark on one last tour in support of Low Teens with Turnstile, Angel Du$t and Vein before taking time off to begin writing their ninth record. On December 15, 2018, the band was honored by their native Buffalo, for their musical accomplishments and advocacy for the city, with an annual holiday on December 15 named after the band. The band revealed in an interview they all have to share their ETID Day plaque between them On September 9, 2019, the band confirmed that they had started work on their ninth album. They later announced during the January 2020 UK/EU tour supporting While She Sleeps, that the recording process of the album would start once they returned to the US. The album is expected to be released later in 2020. Musical style Every Time I Die's style has been described as metalcore, hardcore punk and post-hardcore. They initially formed as a hardcore band but their music soon manifested strong influences from heavy metal and rock. They have been called \\"metalcore icons\\" and their 2003 album Hot Damn! a \\"total gamechanger\\" for the genre. AllMusic described their metalcore sound as mixing alternative metal, Southern metal and screamo. They have also experimented with mathcore and sludge metal at various points in their discography. They are strongly influenced by Southern rock; frontman Keith Buckley stated that \\"the grit of ... Southern rock bands is the one commonality that the band has. It's something we all appreciate and grew up on, in a sense; mainly because it was the type of music that made a coarse poetry out of nature.\\" Just as the band's sound is chaotic, sharp and manifold, their lyrics are crafted to be strange, sarcastic and sardonic.

Dallas County, Texas, United States) is an American blues rock guitarist and singer based in Austin, Texas. He is the older brother of the late Texas blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan. Several notable blues guitarists have had a significant influence on Vaughan's playing style including the \\"Three Kings\\" (Albert, Freddie, and B.B. King) and Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson. Early career Jimmie Lawrence Vaughan was born on March 20, 1951 in Dallas County, Texas, to parents, Jimmie Lee Vaughan and Martha Jean Cook. Raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan moved to Austin in the late 1960s and began playing with such musicians as Paul Ray and WC Clark. In 1969, Vaughan's group opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fort Worth, Texas. It was at this show that Vaughan lent Jimi Hendrix his Vox Wah-wah pedal which Hendrix ended up breaking. In return, Hendrix gave Vaughan his own touring Wah-wah pedal. Jimmie Vaughan developed his own easily recognized personal style. He formed the band The Fabulous Thunderbirds with the lead singer Lou Ann Barton and harpist Kim Wilson, bassist Keith Ferguson, and drummers Mike Buck and Fran Christina. (The original Fabulous Thunderbirds were all prot√©g√©s of Austin, Texas blues club owner Clifford Antone). The band's first four albums, released between 1979 and 1983, are ranked among the most important 'white blues' recordings. These early albums did not sell well, so the band was left without a recording contract for a couple of years (during the time when Vaughan's younger brother achieved commercial success). During this time, Vaughan played lead guitar on fellow Texas blues musician Bill Carter's 1985 album, Stompin' Grounds, also playing Carter's most well-known song, \\"Willie The Wimp\\", which would be introduced a year later to Stevie Ray Vaughan and played on live albums. The Fabulous Thunderbirds got a new contract in 1986, and made several albums with a more commercially popular sound and production style. Vaughan left the band in 1990, and made his only \\"duo album\\", Family Style, with his younger brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Before the album's release, Stevie Ray died in a helicopter crash along with three members of Eric Clapton's entourage in East Troy, Wisconsin, on August 27, 1990. The album was released a month after the accident. The artist listed on the album was \\"The Vaughan Brothers\\". The album was light, blues-influenced rock, with Jimmie Vaughan singing on several tracks. Personal life Vaughan performing at the 2007 Crossroads Guitar Festival Vaughan released his first solo album Strange Pleasure in 1994. The album contained a song \\"Six Strings Down\\" that was dedicated to the memory of his brother. He has continued his solo career since then. Vaughan's solo albums contain mostly blues-rock material that he writes himself. He made a special guest appearance on Bo Diddley's 1996 album A Man Amongst Men, playing guitar on the tracks \\"He's Got A Key\\" and \\"Coatimundi\\". In 2001, Vaughan paid an installment on his (and the Fabulous Thunderbirds') debt to harmonica swamp blues when he contributed guitar to the Lazy Lester album Blues Stop Knockin.' He has a son, Tyrone Vaughan. Since 1997 Fender has produced a Jimmie Vaughan Tex-Mex Stratocaster. Vaughan appeared in the 1998 released film Blues Brothers 2000 as a member of the fictional \\"Louisiana Gator Boys\\" blues band led by BB King. Vaughan is close friends with Dennis Quaid. They worked together on the film Great Balls of Fire. Vaughan was the third opening act for most of the dates of Bob Dylan's summer 2006 tour, preceded by Elana James and the Continental Two and Junior Brown. Vaughan loves classic and custom cars, and is an avid car collector. Vaughan has had many of his customs and hot rods displayed in museums, as well as featured in rodding and custom magazines.For instance, Street Rodder, 1/85, p.55, and Rod & Custom, 4/00, pp.88‚Äì91. Recent activities Vaughan continues to perform. He has also been politically active to some degree. He endorsed Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul in 2008 and played before one of Paul's speeches at the University of Texas. Vaughan also opened for Ron Paul's keynote address at the Rally for the Republic in St. Paul, Minnesota on September 2, 2008. Vaughan appeared with Boz Scaggs & The Blue Velvet Band at the 2009 Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Vaughan performed at Ron Paul's \\"We are the Future\\" rally in Tampa, Florida on August 26, 2012. Shout! Factory released Jimmie Vaughan's first new album in nine years, Plays Blues, Ballads & Favorites, on July 6, 2010. Vaughan played with Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, BB King, Hubert Sumlin, and others during the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival. Vaughan performed on the episode of the TBS cable television show Conan, that aired December 22, 2010. Jimmie Vaughan and Gary Clark, Jr. join Eric Clapton on stage for the encore during Clapton's show at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 2017. Vaughan performed at the 11th Edition of the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival on Friday, June 29, 2012. In 2014, Vaughan performed at the Mahindra Blues Festival in India alongside the Tedeschi Trucks Band. Vaughan performed guitar as a guest on an episode of the PBS cable television show Austin City Limits, with the Foo Fighters, which aired on February 7, 2015. He and the Foo Fighters were accompanied on stage by another guest guitarist, Gary Clark, Jr., a native of Austin, Texas. His 2019 recording, Baby, Please Come Home, was chosen as a 'Favorite Blues Album' by AllMusic.

It has its origins in a private venture by Dassault to produce an all-French aircraft which would make use of jet propulsion, which subsequently would receive orders from the French Air Force. The Ouragan holds the distinction of being the first jet-powered French- designed combat aircraft to enter production, and thus played a key role in the resurgence of the French aviation industry following the Second World War. The Ouragan was operated by France, India, Israel and El Salvador. While in Israeli service, the type participated in both the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War. Development =Origins= As a consequence of the nation being occupied by Germany during the majority of the Second World War, France had not been able to contribute significantly to the great strides that had been made in aircraft design during the conflict. In March 1945, aviation designer Marcel Bloch returned to France from captivity in the Buchenwald concentration camp and was eager to re-establish the aviation industry through the development and production of an all-French fighter, powered by newly developed jet propulsion technology. In particular, he was keen to develop the aircraft quickly enough to corner the emerging market for such an aircraft. In early 1946, Bloch renamed both himself and his new company Dassault, after his brother's wartime codename in the French Resistance.Munson 1965, p. 3. In 1947, following the bare-bones preparation of a factory and equipment, Dassault formally embarked on the development of this all-French fighter, which was solely at his own initiative at the start. According to aviation historian Kenneth Munson, Dassault's design drew more on American rather than British inspiration, having elected to use features such as a very thin wing akin to the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star and a basic configuration comparable to the North American F-86 Sabre. Due to its interceptor role, an emphasis had been placed on a fast rate of climb. The aircraft was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, which was already being licence-produced in France by Hispano-Suiza for the SNCASE SE-535, which was in turn a licence- built version of the British de Havilland Vampire. In September 1947, a series of talks outlining the project took place between Dassault and the Bureau d'Etudes et Plans d'Etat Major. The French government's response to the proposal was positive;Dassault Aviation however no firm order for the aircraft was placed at this time, necessitating the project to proceed as a private venture. In December 1947, the detailed design work phase of the project, which had been allocated the design number M.D. (Marcel Dassault) 450, commenced. On 7 April 1948, the construction of a prototype began at the company's factory in Saint-Cloud, Paris. On 29 June 1948, Dassault's decision to proceed was met with the issuing of contract No. 2223/48 from the Service Technique de l'A√©ronautique of the Minist√®re des Arm√©es Air, which ordered the construction of three prototypes. =Prototypes= The rate of progress on the project was such that, within 15 months of design work having formally started, the first prototype, designated M.D.450-01, had been fully constructed and had performed its maiden flight. On 28 February 1948, the first prototype of the Ouragan fighter conducted its first flight with Dassault Chief Test Pilot Kostia Rozanoff at the controls.Jackson 1988, p. 16. This prototype lacked pressurization, armament, and the distinctive wingtip fuel tanks of subsequent production aircraft. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce Nene 102 centrifugal-flow engine capable of generating 22.27 kN (2,270 kp/5,000 lbf) of thrust. During service trials in 1949, the first prototype attained a top speed of 980 km/h (529 knots, 609 mph) and achieved an initial climb rate of 43 m/s (8,465 ft/min).Munson 1965, pp. 3-4. In May 1948, the second prototype, M.D.450-02, made its maiden flight. This second prototype featured a pressurized cockpit and more complete internal equipment. In November 1948, the second prototype was dispatched to Centre d'Essais en Vol de Marignane to participate in manoeuvrability trials, during which it was recorded as having climbed to an altitude of 15,000 m (49,213 ft).Munson 1965, p. 4. In December 1948, the 450 liter (118.9 US gal) wingtip tanks that would become an indelible feature of all Ouragans first appeared. Testing of the second prototype was discontinued following the sustaining of damage during one landing due an undercarriage malfunction. The completion of the third prototype was delayed to incorporate lessons learnt from the first two prototypes. On 2 June 1950, the third prototype, M.D.450-03, conducted its first flight. This third prototype was powered by a Hispano-Suiza-licensed Nene 104, as envisaged for use on production aircraft. It was dispatched to Centre d'Essais en Vol de Cazaux to conduct weapons trials while armed with 15 mm and later 20 mm cannons. On 31 August 1949, the French Air Force ordered 15 pre-production aircraft, which were later reduced to 12, in order to support the test program. The contract was signed on 15 December 1949.Jackson 1988, p. 17. These pre-production aircraft saw extensive use in various flying trials and evaluations, including various engines, armament schemes, and equipment payloads, as well as to support other development programs. Amongst these aircraft, which were designated M.D.450-1 through to M.D.450-12, were several notable revisions; M.D.450-6 was the first aircraft of the type to feature electrically operated trim tabs, M.D.450-8 (also known as M.D.450R, was configured as an aerial reconnaissance aircraft, and M.D.450-10, which was used as a flying testbed for the SNECMA Atar engine.Munson 1965, pp. 4-5. =Production= According to Munson, around the time of the pre-production aircraft order, there had been considerations within the French Government for the procurement of up to 850 Ouragans under a five-year plan to recapitalise the French armed forces.Munson 1965, p. 5. On 31 August 1950, Dassault received an initial fixed order contract for 150 production Ouragans to equip the Arm√©e de l'Air. In the following years, a further three orders, each ordering an additional 100 Ouragans, would be placed by the French government; however, the final of these additional orders would be cancelled in January 1952 in favour of an equivalent order for the newer and more advanced Dassault Myst√®re IIC. Dassault's production facilities proved to be unable to attain the rate of production necessary to keep pace with the domestic orders, in part due to a lack of time to refine the Ouragan's design to make it easier to mass-produce; accordingly, portions of the work were subcontracted to other French aircraft manufacturers. A manufacturing arrangement was formed with SNCASE to assemble forward fuselages for the aircraft at their Toulouse factory, while a similar agreement with SNCASO led to the firm manufacturing rear fuselages at Saint-Nazaire and wings in Bouguenais. Dassault's factories continued to produce the center fuselage and tail units, while final assembly was carried out at Dassault's facility in M√©rignac, Gironde. On 5 December 1951, the first production Ouragan conducted its maiden flight. There was little difference between the pre-production and production aircraft, the most significant being alterations to the design of the doors enclosing the retractable nosewheel landing leg in response to accidents that occurred on the first two prototypes. By the end of 1952, a total of 39 production aircraft had been completed; a further 93 were manufactured in 1953, and the final 118 were finished by mid-1954. A handful of production Ouragans were experimentally adapted for intended use of the type from unprepared airstrips. Modifications included the substitution of the single-wheel main gear to a two-wheel configuration fitted with low pressure tires, which retracted into a fairing installed under the wing roots; drogue parachutes were also installed.Munson 1965, pp. 6-7. Aircraft so fitted were nicknamed \\"Barougan\\", derived from combining the Ouragan name with the Arabic word baroud (battle). This configuration was intended for combat operations in Algeria. On 24 February 1954, the first Barougan performed its first flight. A further three aircraft would be used in the test programme, which involved multiple grass landings at varying weights. In 1958, further development of the Barougan variant was abandoned; some of the test aircraft were later re-converted back to the standard Ouragan configuration.Munson 1965, p. 7. Design Forward section of an Ouragan The Dassault Ouragan was an early jet-powered fighter aircraft. It employed a straightforward basic layout, with a single divided air intake in the nose that carried air around either side of the cockpit to the engine, which was located directly behind the pilot. The Ouragan was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, produced under license by Hispano-Suiza. Early aircraft were equipped with Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seats, however the majority of production aircraft were outfitted with SNCASO E.86 ejection seats instead. Some of the more advanced aerodynamic features of the Ouragan included its swept tailplane and its thin wing, which was tapered along the leading edge. Operational history =Armee de l'Air= MD450 Ouragan on display with wingtip fuel tanks. In August 1950, prior to the delivery of any pre-production aircraft, the French government placed an initial order for 150 production Ouragans, with ambitions for as many 850 Ouragans in service with the Armee de l'Air. In 1952, the Ouragan formally entered squadron service with the French Air Force in 1952, where it started to replace aircraft such as the British De Havilland Vampire. Due to the rapid entry to service of the type, the Ouragan's full test programme had not been completed, and this led to multiple instances of pilots inadvertently executing involuntary manoeuvres. In particular, the aircraft had a tendency to sharply snap during a hard turn, leading to unintended spins. Overall, the Ouragan reportedly proved pleasant to fly; according to Mason, French pilots were pleased with the stability of the aircraft, lending itself well to firing both guns and rockets. Its favourable handling qualities led to the Ouragan performing for two years as the display aircraft of the la Patrouille de France aerobatic team.Munson 1965, pp. 5-6. The first 50 Ouragans were built to the M.D.450A standard, equipped with the Nene 102 engine; the majority of aircraft delivered were to the later M.D.450B standard, being fitted with a Hispano-Suiza-built Nene 104B engine, which was lighter than the Nene 102 and with slightly greater thrust. Wingtip fuel tanks were fitted as standard in both variants. In French service, the frontline service of the Ouragan was short-lived; from May 1955 onwards, the type began to be replaced by the more capable Dassault Myst√®re IV.Munson 1965, p. 6. In 1961, the last Ouragans were displaced from operational units; a number of aircraft were retained beyond this date in secondary capacities such as advanced tactical and gunnery trainers throughout the mid-1960s. =India= On 25 June 1953, India placed an order for 71 Ouragans, these being broadly similar to standard production models, except for being powered by the slightly uprated Nene 105 engine. The first four Ouragans were delivered by air in late October 1953, while further deliveries were performed by sea; by mid-1954, all aircraft had been delivered. In March 1957, two additional orders for 20 and 13 second-hand Ouragans were placed, bringing the total procured by India to 104. The selection of the French-built Ouragan at this time is claimed to have reflected a deliberate decision to initiate diversification of supply sources.Jackson 1988, pp. 76‚Äì77. In Indian service, the aircraft was given the name Toofani (), the Hindi equivalent meaning the French name of the type. In 1961, Indian Toofanis were flown on active service, reportedly carrying out airstrikes in support of Indian Army forces engaged with Portuguese forces on the island of Diu, on the western coast of the Indian sub-continent. They were also used in ground-attack missions against anti-government rebels in Assam and Nagaland, and in 1962 to perform reconnaissance missions during the Sino- Indian War. On 24 April 1965, a single Toofani strayed over the border with Pakistan, and was forced to land by a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter of the Pakistan Air Force; while the pilot was returned to India, the aircraft was retained and ended up being displayed at the Pakistan Air Force Museum at Peshawar.Jackson 1988, p. 78. As was the case in France, the Ouragan started to be replaced in frontline service by the Myst√®re IVA in 1957, being withdrawn fully from frontline service in 1965, although it continued in use for some years as an advanced trainer and target tug. =Israel= Ouragan at the Israeli Air Force Museum in Hatzerim. In contrast to France and India, the Israel Air Force (IAF) became an enthusiastic Ouragan user. During the early 1950s, Israel, under pressure from regional hostilities with neighbouring Arab nations, was keen to acquire new military equipment of its own, particularly as Arab air forces were themselves commonly procuring advanced Soviet armaments such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter.Cohen 1993, p. 504. Seeking to augment its jet aircraft fleet of British Gloster Meteors, the IAF initially evaluated both French Dassault Myst√®re IIC and Canadian-built Canadair Sabre Mk.6 fighters. Due to development problems with the Myst√®re and a Canadian embargo on the Sabres, the order was changed to Myst√®re IVAs alongside a batch of Ouragans that were purchased as a stop-gap measure. By 1955, the IAF had received at least 75 aircraft, comprising a mix of newly built and retired French Air Force examples, with deliveries being completed that year.Munson 1965, p. 8. The Israeli Ouragans were assigned to a total of five squadrons for the purpose of performing close air support operations, since they could not match the performance of Egyptian MiG-15s. On 12 April 1956, an Israeli Ouragan shot down an Egyptian de Havilland Vampire flying over Israeli territory, it being the first recorded kill by an Ouragan in Israeli service. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, Ouragans principally flew ground-attack missions, but also flew escort missions. In the early hours of 30 October 1956, a pair of Ouragans shot down four hostile de Havilland Vampires in the Mitla Pass area. The two documented encounters between the Soviet-built MiG-15 fighters and the Ouragan (which were also powered by the Nene engine but furnished with a more modern swept wing) ended with one Ouragan surviving several 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon hits to fly the next day and one MiG-15 being heavily damaged by cannon fire after it entered a turning dogfight with the Ouragans.Munson 1965, p. 9. The poor training of the Egyptian pilots who were consistently unable to realize their advantage in numbers as well as the MiG-15's speed and climb characteristics, helped Ouragans to survive despite their inferior performance. On 31 October 1956, a pair of Ouragans armed with rockets strafed the Egyptian destroyer Ibrahim el Awal (ex-HMS Mendip), contributing to the capture of the ship.Jackson 1988, p. 75.Munson 1965, pp. 9-10. According to Munson, Israeli Ouragans were responsible for the destruction of a major proportion of the hostile tanks and military vehicles that came under aerial attack during the conflict, while only two Ouragans were lost during the five days of fighting, both of which were attributed to small arms fire.Munson 1965, p. 10. The Commander-in-Chief of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is reported to have later stated \\"The Ouragan was a much better aeroplane than had been thought\\". In the aftermath of the Suez Crisis, the Ouragans were soon mostly relegated to secondary roles such as advanced training; by 1967, the type still equipped two close-support units along with an operational training unit. Israeli Ouragans saw more combat in the 1967 Six-Day War. In 1975, the IAF sold 18 Ouragans to El Salvador, where they remained in service until the late 1980s. =El Salvador= Dassault Ouragan of the El Salvador Air Force. In the wake of the Football War of 1969, El Salvador began a concerted push to modernize its air force. Unable to buy combat aircraft from the United States due to a US government arms embargo, the Salvadorans bought 18 surplus Israeli Ouragans on the international arms market. These aircraft were refurbished by the Israelis and were delivered to El Salvador between 1973 and 1978. El Salvador's Ouragans saw extensive combat during the Salvadoran Civil War of 1980-1992. Salvadoran Ouragans flew strike missions against communist FMLN forces, operating from Ilopango Air Base located near the capital city of San Salvador. As El Salvador is not a large country and combat radius was not a pressing concern, Salvadoran Ouragans in combat usually operated with their wingtip fuel tanks removed in order to save weight and allow for greater weapons loads. An FMLN sapper attack against Ilopango Air Base in 1982 destroyed several Ouragans and accelerated the push to supplant, and eventually replace, the Ouragans with American-made Cessna A-37B Dragonfly ground-attack aircraft, which were made available after the Reagan Administration dropped the arms embargo. The remaining Ouragans served on for several more years, but were all retired by the war's end. Salvadoran Ouragans have been pictured in several camouflage schemes, and it is possible that during the war the Ouragan fleet operated in colors that were never completely standardized. At least one survivor of El Salvador's Ouragan fleet is currently on static display at Ilopango.

The use of the West Coast as an outpost to house convicts in isolated penal settlements occurred in the eras 1822‚Äì33, and 1846‚Äì47. The main locations were Sarah Island (known by many in the late twentieth century as Settlement Island) and Grummet Island in Macquarie Harbour. The entrance to Macquarie Harbour was known as Hells Gates and the play on this name has travelled from its naming in the 1830s to Paul Collins's book published in 2002. Convict parties used the land around the harbour as a work area as far as Gordon River. The prison's existence was for only 15 years, but its hold on the imagination has spawned a significant literature. Physical heritage While most physical traces of the convict era were abandoned or lost, many foundations and outlines of the buildings of the settlement can still be seen. Sarah Island was allegedly vandalised for building materials in the 1890s by mining communities. However, enough remains that guided tours of the island can still give a vivid and moving glimpse into the lives of the convicts and their keepers, and the huge amount of building and land reclamation that took place during the relatively short life of the prison. Piners also have periodically discovered convict era items during their work along the rivers and shore of Macquarie Harbour. The Frederick The Frederick was a merchant ship stolen in 1834 by escaping convicts from Sarah Island. It has inspired several books and a play. The Ship that Never Was, by the Round Earth Theatre Company, at the Strahan Visitor Centre, in Strahan, is a long-running play about a successful escape. It was written by Richard Davey, a descendant of Governor Davey who worked on Sarah Island as a guide and researcher. He has also written The Sarah Island Conspiracies ‚Äî an account of twelve voyages to Macquarie Harbour and Sarah Island (Hobart, 2002) and two pamphlets ‚Äî a narrative of the event the play was based on and \\"Sarah Island - The People, Ships and shipwrights ‚Äî a guided tour\\". Collins refers to Davey in his Hell's Gates book. The Ship Thieves by Sian Rees focuses upon James Porter one of the group of convicts on The Frederick, and manuscripts found in the Dixson Library in Sydney.

His achievements rank alongside those of Wernher von Braun and Sergei Korolev. But as most of his work was for the United States Air Force and was therefore classified, his achievements are not widely known.  Biography  Karel Bossart was born on February 9, 1904 in Antwerp, Belgium. He graduated in Mining Engineering at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in 1924. After winning a scholarship to Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the Belgian American Educational Foundation to study aeronautical engineering, he remained in the United States, working for various aircraft companies. In 1945 he was chief of structures at Convair and proposed to the United States Air Force that a missile could be developed with a range of 8000 km. The Air Force was skeptical of Bossart's proposal, partly wishing to preserve the priority of strategic bombers, but granted him a limited contract to develop a prototype. Bossart's major innovation was the use of a monocoque design in which structural support was maintained by pressure within the inelastic fuel tanks. After a series of tests in 1947 the Air Force lost interest and Bossart was instructed to abandon the research, but by 1951 the escalation of the Cold War enabled Bossart to revive the project that became known as 'Atlas'. In 1955 the Central Intelligence Agency reported that Soviet Russia had made swift progress on its own intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) programme and Atlas became a crash project of the highest national importance. Bossart used this opportunity to advance work with high energy cryogenic fuels that resulted in the Centaur upper stage. Atlas was first launched in June, 1957 but was never fully effective as an ICBM. However, use as a launch vehicle, the Atlas design has excelled and has formed the basis of the most successful and reliable expendable rockets in service. As a result, Bossart's achievements include * Launch of first communications satellite; * Launch of first United States orbital manned missions; * Launch of Mariner probes to Mars and Venus; and * Launch of Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to Jupiter and Saturn. In 1955 Bossart became chief engineer of the Atlas project and in 1957 was promoted to Technical Director of Aeronautics at General Dynamics. On December 17, 1957, eleven years of Bossart's work climaxed in the first successful flight of the Atlas. A few days later, on December 22, 1957, he appeared on What's My Line? as a guest credited as \\"Rocket Designer U.S.A.F. Atlas Missile\\". The next year, the Air Force awarded him the Exceptional Civilian Award for his work in developing America's first ICBM. His co-workers called Bossart one of the finest technical men in the country. They credit him with having spearheaded a major phase in the art of rocketry. In 1965, Bossart was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his pioneering contributions to the Atlas rocket system. He is featured in the Hall of Fame's exhibit within the San Diego Air and Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. Bossart was later inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990. Bossart died on August 3, 1975, in San Diego, California.

Development After the success of the Ouragan, Dassault was working on a more advanced machine which would take to the air in early 1951 as the MD.452 Myst√®re I. The first prototype Myst√®re I was essentially an Ouragan with a 30-degree swept wing and modified tail surfaces. Two further prototypes followed, powered by the Rolls-Royce Tay 250 centrifugal-flow turbojet, an improved version of the Rolls-Royce Nene, built under license by Hispano- Suiza, and rated at thrust. These three Myst√®re I prototypes led to two Myst√®re IIA prototypes, powered by the Tay and armed with four Hispano cannon; and then four Myst√®re IIB prototypes, which traded the four cannon for two DEFA revolver-type cannon. A Myst√®re IIA was the first French aircraft to break Mach 1 in controlled flight (in a dive), on 28 October 1951. The eleven preproduction machines that followed were designated Myst√®re IIC, nine of which were fitted with the SNECMA Atar 101C axial-flow turbojet, rated at thrust, while two were experimentally fitted with the afterburning Atar 101F, with an afterburning thrust of . Operational history The French Air Force ordered 150 Myst√®re IICs, with the first production machine flying in June 1954, being delivered in October of that year. The production aircraft featured the twin DEFA cannon, an Atar 101D turbojet with thrust, increased tail sweep, and revised intake trunking and internal fuel tank arrangement. Top speed was at low level. Details of external stores are unclear, but a reasonable assumption would be that they were similar to those of the Ouragan. The last Myst√®re IIC was delivered in 1957, by which time the type was already being relegated to advanced training duties. Aircraft design was moving very quickly in the 1950s and even as the Myst√®re IIC was becoming operational, the better Dassault Myst√®re IVA was flying. The Myst√®re IIC was very much an interim type, though it did persist in the training role until 1963. There were no foreign buyers for the Myst√®re II. As noted, the Israelis wanted to buy 24 but changed their minds and bought Myst√®re IVAs instead. It appears that the Myst√®re II was never used in combat.

She was nicknamed \\"The Pleasure Machine\\" after an airline commercial she appeared in although she has said she does not care for the name. She has risen to fame in particular in Australia. Modeling career Richens captured the eye of the Australian public and rode the wave of popularity generated from her relationship with professional rugby league footballer Solomon Haumono, eventually leading to an appearance in Ralph magazine. Richens then posed nude for Australian Black+White magazine as well as the March 1999 Australian Playboy edition. She returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 2001. Richens placed in the UK edition of FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2002 (41st), 2003 (69th) and 2004 (71st). She was also ranked 14th Sexiest Woman in the World by Maxim. Television career In 2001 Richens co-presented the television game show The Desert Forges (with Richard Fairbrass) for Channel 5, and went on to present 3001: A Sex Oddity; a quirky, sex-orientated 'documentary' series in 2002.

Personal life Richens shot to fame in Australia following her highly publicised relationship with professional rugby league footballer Solomon Haumono. The publicity surrounding their relationship focused on the manner in which the pair met and Haumono's actions subsequent to this. After having met Richens in a Sydney night club, Haumono, then a contracted player to the Canterbury Bulldogs Rugby League Club, left for the United Kingdom to be with Richens. Haumono had not informed his family or his club of his decision and this highly jeopardised his rugby league career. Much debate was generated as to whether his contract with the Bulldogs should have been terminated upon his return to Australia as a result of his actions. Richens and Haumono are no longer together. The trip was a ruse by Solomon Haumono to force the Bulldogs to sack him and enable him to resume his career with the St George Dragons.

Musashino K≈çki () had been making a 6√ó6 SLR called the Rittreck 6√ó6 from 1968;Hagiya, \\"Norita 66\\", p.80. for which Norita had been making the pentaprism finder and the three lenses (wide, standard, and tele). When Musashino decided to terminate production of this camera, Norita decided to expand from being merely an optical designer/manufacturer to manufacturing cameras, and took over machine tools, assembly, and some staff from Musashino. For its new \\"Norita 66\\", Norita expanded the range of lenses: the 55/80/160mm selection for the Rittreck became 40/55/80/160/240/400. Additionally it produced a 75mm f/3.5 lens with built-in shutter (bypassing the focal-plane shutter for high-speed synchronization with electronic flash); the most remarkable lens in the line- up remained the 80mm standard lens with a fast opening of f/2, fast for a medium-format lens. Originally branded Rittron, this lens had been designed and manufactured by Norita from the start. After Norita took over the production of the Rittreck 6x6, it was rebranded as Noritar, but optically remained the same as the original Rittreck 'kit lens'.

She was influenced by the pedagogical ideas of Maria MontessoriNate Lippens, short item on Cornish as part of \\"People Who Shaped Seattle\\", Seattle Metropolitan, May 2006, p. 59. as well as Calvin Brainerd Cady's ideas about teaching broader values through music education. Martha Graham described her as \\"a small, round, plump little lady with the dynamism of a rocket\\".; part of \\"A Tribute from Martha Graham\\" included as an afterword. She founded the Cornish School in 1914 and served as the school's director for the next 25 years. Within three years it had enrolled over 600 students, and was the country's largest music school west of Chicago. Her middle name reflects the year of her birth, the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the United States of America. Life and work Born July 1876 in Nebraska,1900 U.S. census she grew up first in Arlington, Oregon and then in Blaine, Washington, as the daughter of the town's first mayor, lawyer Nathan Armfield Cornish. In her early teens, she lived about half a year in Portland, Oregon, where she studied piano under Ebenezer Cook, a teacher of strong local reputation. Shortly after, her father's fortunes and her mother's health began to fail. Her parents moved to Spokane, Washington, where her mother died two years later; Nellie stayed in Blaine much of that time, teaching fourth grade although still in her teens. Her father remarried to a woman she did not like, leading to a break with him. In her early twenties, she gave music lessons and did other tutoring in northwestern Oregon. The Holyoke Building (photographed 2007) She moved to Seattle in 1900, and took a studio in 1902 in the Holyoke Building (the center of Seattle music instruction at the time), which gave her a chance to meet nearly all of the city's leading music teachers. In 1904, she traveled to Boston for the summer to learn the Evelyn Fletcher-Copp's Montessori-influenced method of teaching piano to young children. From this, she evolved her own technique of teaching. By 1911, when she left for Los Angeles, California to study for six weeks with Calvin Brainerd Cady, she was a very well established Seattle music teacher, with a suite of five studio rooms and two assistants. (She would later hire Cady as a faculty member at the Cornish School.) She returned to Seattle and modified her approach to teaching to incorporate Cady's ideas about using music education to impart a broader spiritual approach to life in general. However, the combination of disappointment in romance and a reconciliation with her father led her to turn over her studio to one of her assistants, Martha Sackett, and join her father in Alturas, California, where he had somewhat recovered his fortune. A plan for father and daughter to travel together to Europe was scotched by the outbreak of World War I; plans to study in New York City also fell through, as did an effort to establish herself in Salt Lake City. She returned to Seattle, where she founded the Cornish School in 1914. Within three years it had enrolled over 600 students, and was the country's largest music school west of Chicago. The curriculum soon expanded to include subjects as diverse as eurhythmics, French language, painting, dance (folk and ballet), and theater. She went on to serve as the school's director for the next 25 years. Although she often moved among the rich and famous, Cornish did not have any particularly large sum of her own money, and was at times totally broke. Neither Cornish not the school itself owned the custom-built 1921 building now known as Kerry Hall: the school was a tenant renting the building, which in turn was rather heavily mortgaged by the group of supporters who owned it. In 1923, the entire financial arrangement nearly came crashing down, and only some last minute donations prevented the school from having to move to Los Angeles. The next year, the realty company that owned the building converted itself into a foundation to support the school, and took on its debts. However, there was no endowment, and finances remained precarious even through what Cornish called the school's \\"golden years\\" in the mid-1920s. This remained the case even after the mortgage was paid off and the building donated to the school in 1929, and financial difficulties inevitably grew during the Great Depression. The Board neither raised an endowment nor otherwise put the school on a financial footing that would allow it to do more than \\"tread water.\\" Ultimately, this led Cornish to resign her position as head of the school in 1939.. The reference to \\"treading water\\" is on p. 255. After leaving her school, Cornish spent three years of \\"rest and gardening\\" in California; spent half a year in an unsuccessful New York-based venture to improve children's radio programming; and then spent four years as head of the Pittsfield Community Music School (Pittsfield, Massachusetts). She spent her last years mainly in California, and sometimes in Seattle. Cornish never married. According to Nancy Wilson Ross, \\"Twice she was deeply in love and lost the men to other women‚Ä¶\\" She adopted the orphaned Elena Miramova as her daughter. Other achievements In 1921, Cornish led a successful fundraising drive to save the Seattle Symphony.

It holds more than six million recordings, including over a million discs and 200,000 tapes. These include commercial record releases (chiefly from the UK), radio broadcasts (many from the BBC Sound Archive), and privately made recordings.  History  Peter Copeland began digitising the collection in the 1990s. The history of the Sound Archive can be traced back to 1905, when it was first suggested that the British Museum should have a collection of audio recordings of poets and statesmen. The Gramophone Company started donating metal masters of audio recordings in 1906 (on the basis that records would wear out), with a number of donations being made up until 1933. These recordings included some by Nellie Melba, Adelina Patti, Caruso and Francesco Tamagno, and others of Lev Tolstoy, Ernest Shackleton, Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Lewis Waller. A number of shellac pressings were also donated in the period 1920‚Äì50. In 1955, Patrick Saul founded the British Institute of Recorded Sound, after realising that material was in danger of being lost as the British Museum did not maintain a comprehensive archive. The Institute was located in a property owned by the British Museum in Russell Square (with rent and rates guaranteed by Robert Mayer), and supported by a donation from the Quaker trust in Birmingham. A public appeal resulted in the donation of thousands of shellac discs, which started off the collection. The British Institute of Recorded Sound became part of the British Library, which had been split off from the British Museum, in April 1983.Day, T. (2001). The National Sound Archive: the first fifty years. pp 41-64 in Aural History: Essays on Recorded Sound (A. Linehan, Ed.). The British Library. It was later renamed the British Library Sound Archive.

The scheme is supported by the Home Office, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) and the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council (NPCC). It acts as an umbrella system: it does not itself issue identification cards, but various proof of age card schemes operate under the PASS umbrella, and issue cards which bear a PASS hologram as proof of authenticity and validity. History Set up in 2001 to develop a recognisable way of endorsing proof of age card schemes, due to the United Kingdom not issuing a government identification card, individuals who didn‚Äòt drive had difficulty providing any proof of age when purchasing age-restricted products such as cigarettes and alcohol. In June 2014, the 18+ card designs were standardised (apart from the Young Scot card in Scotland), with the only real variation in appearance being the logo of the issuing organisation in the corner, citing feedback from police and retailers, in an effort to increase acceptance by venues especially in the night-time economy. In November 2016, PASS reorganised to become a community interest company and ownership by the British Retail Consortium ended. In January 2018, the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council (NPCC) logo replaced the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) logo at the lower left corner of the standardised 18+ card design. Card suppliers there are two types of card suppliers, national and regional. Regional cards often have requirements for residency in the area they are issued, where national cards can be obtained by anyone who can provide required information. There are currently three councils that offer regional cards: Bracknell Forest Council (e+ card), Milton Keynes Council (All in 1 Card) and the London Borough of Southwark (\\"PAL\\"). The national suppliers are CitizenCard, TOTUM, My ID Card, ONEID4U, and ValidateUK. The Young Scot card is available to eligible individuals resident in Scotland. Acceptance Proof of Age Standards Scheme's goal is to become the preferred standard in proving the age of Britons, with 5 million cards issued since 2001 and 200,000 in 2017 to 2018. Several trade bodies currently support PASS: Association of Convenience Stores, British Beer and Pub Association, British Institute of Innkeeping, UK Hospitality and the Wine and Spirits Trade Association. In addition the Home Office, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, National Police Chiefs' Council and Security Industry Authority also support the organisation. It is the responsibility of sellers not to supply alcohol, tobacco, and other age restricted products to people below the legal age. Checking a proof of age card protects them against inadvertently selling to under-age people who look older. Some places requiring proof of age will not accept some cards, despite the PASS hologram. Retailers and licensees have the right to refuse to sell a product or deny entry to an individual even if they possess a PASS endorsed card. In 2011 more than 500,000 holders of a PASS endorsed card were refused entry to pubs and clubs. As a result, in 2014 the police and Security Industry Authority, which licences doorstaff, agreed to permit their logos to be displayed on PASS cards displaying a standardised design. In 2017 the Passport Office urged passport-holders to leave passports at home and use a PASS card on nights out. In 2019 PASS agreed to develop Standards for the Presentation of Digital Proof of Age with the purpose of enabling the Home Office to amend the Mandatory Licensing Conditions so that approved forms of both digital and physical proof of age could be accepted by licensees for the purpose of demonstrating due diligence.

Born in Killeenduff, Easky, County Sligo, where he was schooled, Conlon won a five-year scholarship to the National College of Art and Design in 1960. Domhnail O'Murchadha, assistant professor of sculpture, encouraged him to complete a sculpture diploma. He then spent a year obtaining an Art Teachers Certificate and became a sculpture associate of the college, where he stayed until 1972 apart from eighteen months as art teacher in Navan Vocational School. In 1972 Conlon returned to Sligo to teach at the Sligo Vocational School for a year before becoming a lecturer at the Sligo Regional Technical College (now Sligo Institute of Technology), where he helped to develop a diploma course in art. For the next sixteen years he lectured in sculpture and drawing there until his early retirement 1989. He worked full-time as a professional sculptor until early 2004, when a brain tumour (Glioma) was diagnosed. Although some 80% of the tumour was removed, Conlon was physically incapacitated and required extensive care for the remaining year of his life. During that year he worked on a video installation entitled Become. Conlon's works include Millennium Garden Sculpture at Lucan Community College. He worked in stone, creating large abstract forms. He exhibited with Independent Artists, Oireachtas, the Royal Hibernian Academy and Sculpture in context. Jack Harte has written an account of Conlon's life, Unravelling the Spiral - The Life and Work of Fred Conlon (1943‚Äì2005) (Scotus Press, Dublin, 2010). Harte and Conlon were born within fifty metres of one another, and ten months apart, in the townland of Killeenduff. They were cousins and close friends until Conlon's death. In this book Harte warmly tells the remarkable story of Conlon's life and provides a unique insight into his ideas and inspiration. Pursuing the sculptor's fascination with the spiral motif, Harte unravels the Neolithic symbolism of the Spiral and the Newgrange Monument to illustrate the subliminal pagan inspiration underneath Conlon's overtly Christian spiritual urges. The book is illustrated with photographs of Conlon's work. References *Conlon, Fred. 'Biography', Fred Conlon Sculptor. Retrieved 6 July 2005. *Conway, Frank.

He made his fortune as an automobile dealer and became a prominent thoroughbred racehorse owner. Biography Howard was dubbed one of the most successful Buick salesmen of all time. He bought the soon-to-be- famous horse Seabiscuit. According to Laura Hillenbrand's biography of Seabiscuit, Howard's early car dealership in San Francisco was given a boost by the hand of fate; on the day of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, he was one of the few individuals who had operational vehicles in the city, and was thus able to help the rescue effort significantly. In 1921, long before he bought Seabiscuit, Charles Howard purchased the Ridgewood Ranch at Willits in Mendocino County. His 15-year-old son, Frankie, died there in 1926 after a truck accident on the property (the elder Howard established the Frank R. Howard Memorial Hospital as a memorial to his son). Used as a secondary residence, by the 1930s Howard had converted part of the ranch into a thoroughbred horse breeding and training center. Although Seabiscuit was the most famous resident at Ridgewood Ranch, Charles Howard owned many horses in his secondary career as a Thoroughbred owner including Kayak II (also Kajak) and Hall of Fame colt Noor, the first of only two horses to defeat two U.S. Triple Crown champions. Death Charles Howard died of a heart attack in 1950 and was buried in the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. Ridgewood Ranch was sold by his heirs, with some of the horses sent to his son Lindsay's Binglin Stable in Moorpark, California. See also * Seabiscuit - starring Jeff Bridges as Charles S Howard.

It has about 71,000 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the region. Hav√≠≈ôov lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. Hav√≠≈ôov was founded after World War II (thus being the youngest city in today's Czech Republic) as a coal mining town. Hav√≠≈ôov officially became a town in 1955. It was built on top of several villages with significant Polish populations. The local people were given apartments in the newly built city, and most of their old houses were demolished to make room for new urban buildings. The majority of the population of Hav√≠≈ôov emigrated from other parts of Czechoslovakia, many of them from Slovakia, as migrant workers, thus substantially altering the ethnic structure of the area. Today, the original villages are administratively part of the city and mostly lie on the outskirts of urban Hav√≠≈ôov. Name In a competition to name the city in 1956, various names were suggested, such as Stalin, Gottwald≈Øv Horn√≠kov (after Klement Gottwald), Z√°potock√Ωgrad (after Anton√≠n Z√°potock√Ω) and \\"ƒåestpr√°cov\\" (derived from the Socialist-era greeting ƒçest pr√°ci). Eventually it was decided that the city should be named Hav√≠≈ôov, from hav√≠≈ô, \\"miner\\", and the possessive suffix -ov. History Hav√≠≈ôov railway station Hav√≠≈ôov was founded after the Second World War. Most of the buildings of the new city were built in the style of Socialist Realism.

The term \\"biological records centre\\" is also used in the context of local centres, now frequently referred to as \\"local environmental records centres\\" (LERCs). History The Biological Records Centre (BRC) was set up in 1964 by the Nature Conservancy (UK) at its recently opened Monks Wood Experimental Station near Huntingdon. BRC developed from the Atlas of the British Flora project of the Botanical Society of the British Isles (BSBI) to map the distribution of British (and Irish) flowering plants, which had established basic principles for biological recording in the UK. The former BSBI project leader, Franklyn Perring, established BRC with the project‚Äôs original data and data processing equipment. Function As part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), BRC provides a focus for the collation, management, dissemination and interpretation of species observations (biological records). BRC is now based at CEH Wallingford, near Oxford. Most records are collected by volunteer recording schemes and societies, which are integral to the work of BRC. These activities are supported through a long-term funding partnership between the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Activities Together with more than 80 recording schemes and societies,\\"Biological Records Centre - Recording Schemes\\". Biological Records Centre. Retrieved 2013-09-19. BRC supports biological recording for a wide range of plant and animal groups. BRC helps the recording community to publish atlases, datasets and other online resources, providing information for research, policy and the conservation of wildlife. Through the use of technology BRC helps to harness the enthusiasm and knowledge of naturalists and to enable them to collate and analyse their records. To celebrate the BRC's 50th Anniversary, a special issue of the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society was published with 23 research and review articles covering the Centre's work.Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 115 (3), Pages 469‚Äì784. July 2015. In addition to its work with recording schemes and societies, BRC has played a key role in the greater integration of biological recording activities in the UK, most recently through the National Biodiversity Network (NBN). BRC helped to found the National Federation for Biological Recording (NFBR) in 1986 and carried out much of the survey and analysis for the report of the Coordinating Commission for Biological Recording (CCBR) published in 1995,Burnett, J., Copp, C., Harding, P. (1995) Biological Recording in the United Kingdom Present practice and future development Summary Report, Coordinating Commission for Biological Recording available from download from Natural Environment Research Council both of which helped shape the future of biological recording in the UK. Local biological records centres A network of local biological records centres or local environmental records centres (usually abbreviated to BRC, LRC or LERC,) covers most areas of the UK. All local centres are entirely independent of the Biological Records Centre. The first such local centre was the Natural History Record Bureau at what is now Tullie House Museum in Carlisle which opened in 1902.The Natural History Record Bureau at the Carlisle Museum, The Museums Journal 10 (6). December 1910. As with many LERCs it grew out of the biological recording work of the local natural history society.\\"History  CBDC\\". Cumbria Biodiversity Data Centre, Tullie House Museum. Accessed 2013-09-19. LERCs have a complementary role to BRC and recording schemes as systems \\"for collating biological data from a wide range of sources (including organisations and individuals), for ensuring that data are properly validated and catalogued, and for providing access to them, thereby acting as a focus for biological information.\\"Running a Local Record Centre, The Wildlife Trusts/NBN. 2001. Local Environmental Records Centres are non-profit, partnership-led organisations and typically organised on a county or multi- county basis. Increasingly they are becoming better networked through the activities of the Association of Local Environmental Records Centres, the National Biodiversity Network, Natural England, The Wildlife Trusts partnership and NFBR, which became the National Forum for Biological Recording in 2013. rECOrd is an example of a Local Environmental Records Centre.

It consists of a short length of string, with metal or plastic cross- pieces at each end that are orthogonal to the string. They are threaded through holes in paper or card made with a hole punch or lawyers bodkin or electric drill, and the cross-pieces are sufficiently wide as to not slip back through the holes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1EmZOt8Pno The names Treasury tag and India tag are first found on record in a list of stationery items published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) in 1912, and, both being capitalised, probably refer to HM Treasury and the India Office. While the terms are now equivalent, a Treasury tag was originally a lace with a sharp metal tag at one end, which could be threaded through the holes in a stack of documents or cards and inserted into a corresponding tag at the other end, thus forming a loop and binding the documents. The tags, in that case, were in line with the string, similar to aglets on a shoelace.

The service's enforcement jurisdiction extends across the entire bailiwick and encompasses the Islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm, and Sark. The Guernsey Police falls under the government department of Home Affairs, States of Guernsey. History In common with many communities, a historical development of parish constables formed the system of law enforcement for many centuries. In the 19th century, the people of Guernsey complained that this system was inadequate for a growing population, and a professional police force was demanded. The parish constables retained their historic role, but from 1853 uniformed assistant constables were appointed. Initially, there were four of them, with a uniform hat and belt worn over their civilian clothing. They provided full-time policing, under the authority of the elected parish constables.The full history of this period is available online as a PDF document. The current police force was formed following approval by the States of Deliberation in March 1915, consisting of an inspector, two sergeants, two corporals and eleven constables, with the force being formally founded on 10 April 1920. During the five-year German occupation of the Channel Islands the police had a difficult time whilst working alongside the German military police and the Feldgendarmerie (field police). In 1945 the force resumed its normal role and is now considerably expanded, as of 2018 it had 151 officers. These are supported by 94 civilian staff, who work in roles where warranted officers are not required. From March 2015, emergency calls for all emergency services in Guernsey have been routed through the Joint Emergency Services Control Centre (JESCC), linking police, fire, ambulance and coastguard services. In late January 2019, Guernsey Police led the investigation into the high-profile disappearance of Argentinian footballer Emiliano Sala, whose aircraft had last made radar contact near Alderney.https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1075959/Emiliano-Sala- latest-Guernsey-police-update-Cardiff- Cityhttps://talksport.com/football/479729/emiliano-sala-latest-guernsey- police/ On the 10th April 2020, the Guernsey Police celebrated its 100th Anniversary, with a planned set of events to commemorate this event. These events were postponed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in a lockdown of the island as positive cases were confirmed in the island. Structure and ranks The force is headed by a chief officer (CO), with two deputy chief officer's (DCO) as a joint second in command. The current Chief Officer of the Guernsey Police is Ruari Hardy, After the retirement of the previous Chief Officer, Patrick Rice. As of 2020, the two Deputy Chief Officers are Philip Breban and Ian Scholes. Each of the four branches within the Guernsey Police is headed by a chief inspector; the branches are uniformed operations, crime services, operations and specialist services. Significant units within these four divisions include the commercial fraud department, the explosive ordnance disposal unit and the police dog section. Joint Emergency Services Control Centre (JESCC) In 2015, Guernsey Police's control room for bailiwick and the Islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm, and Sark was combined into one central location. Operators in the room use a bespoke Computer-aided dispatch software to manage, Police, Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, Guernsey Fire and Rescue Service, and Guernsey Coastguard 999 (emergency telephone number) Calls. All four emergency services were merged into one area and all operators are trained to deal with emergency and non-emergency calls, similar to the Police 101 and the NHS 111 services. JESCC does not offer on the phone medical advice like the 111 service but triage's calls through a standardised set of questions as part of their Computer-aided dispatch system. Guernsey Coastguard is also based within the Joint Emergency Services control centre and maintains and 24/7 watch on Channel 16 VHF and its local frequency, VHF channel 20. Guernsey Costguard also broadcasts marine Navigation Warnings for the terrestrial waters within the Bailiwick of Guernsey. JESCC staff are all trained in emergency call handling, dispatch of all services land-based emergency services and Coastguard Search and rescue. Staff in JESCC are civilians and not members of the Guernsey Police. Special Constables Guernsey Police has a system of special constables, with three distinct types of volunteer officer, known as 'A', 'B', or 'C' division of the special constabulary. 'A' division special constables are full-time employees of third party agencies who are granted limited police powers within their workplace, to provide a first response whilst professional police officers are travelling to an incident; for example, a number of hospital porters are sworn as 'A' division special constables to provide an enhanced level of hospital security.Details on the official police website. 'B' division special constables are fully trained to support their full-time colleagues in all aspects of policing. They are commonly deployed in tandem with professional colleagues at large scale public events, and during weekend periods. 'C' division special constables carry out the duties of a traffic warden, but have certain police powers in respect of traffic control, for example around school areas at peak times.

The town was the site of a World War I prisoner of war camp, and Kuhr's rediscovered adolescent diary was published late in her life as Da gibt's ein Wiedersehn (1982). It has been translated into English by Walter Wright, a pacifist and former conscientious objector, under the title There we'll meet again, a young German girl's diary of the first world war. It gives an unusual insight into German experience of the war: 'The fact that the diary is written by a German teenager does make it unusual. The fact that this teenager went on to oppose war, to dance her anti- war message on the Berlin stage, to marry a Jew, and to be forced to flee Germany in 1933, gives an added poignancy to the diary.' Expressionist Dancer Jo Mihaly started as a dancer in 1923. In 1933 she was well known for an anti-war dance she had devised with the World War I military boots, sword and helmet. She belonged to the German expressionist dancers of the 30s, along with Mary Wigman, Rudolf von Laban, Gertrud Bodenwieser and Gret Palucca. She was an opponent of the persecution of Jews, fleeing Germany for Z√ºrich in 1933 to escape being taken to a concentration camp like so many of her activist socialist friends. She continued to dance there from 1934 to 1938. Novelist Mihaly started by contributing articles and poems to the magazine of the Brotherhood of Wayfarers around 1925. She then wrote her first novel, Michael Arpad und sein Kind, a novel about a gypsy family. She wrote another novel in 1938, \\"Gesucht: Stepan Varesku\\". She wrote other books but only her World War I diary has been translated into English. Media portrayal Elfriede Kuhr is one of the 14 main characters of the series 14 - Diaries of the Great War. She is played by actress Elisa Monse.

Owned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts on 97.7 MHz from the Mount Royal candelabra tower, with an effective radiated power of 41,200 watts (class C1) using an omnidirectional antenna, while its studios are located at the Bell Media Building at 1717 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal. The station has a mainstream rock format since the station started using the brand name CHOM, and is sometimes pronounced as if it were a French word, but other Bell Media Radio personalities have also pronounced it as . History =Early years (1963-1974)= CKGM-FM, as the station was originally known, was founded by Geoff Stirling as a sister station to AM station CKGM, and opened on July 16, 1963. After a few weeks as a simulcast of CKGM, CKGM-FM launched a beautiful music format on September 1, 1963. On October 28, 1969 CKGM-FM changed its format to album-oriented rock. On-air advertising was kept at a minimum. The first song played by Doug Pringle after the format switch was Richard Strauss' \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\", followed by The Beatles' \\"Here Comes the Sun\\".http://www.marcdenis.com/ckgm-history.asp The station would change its call sign to CHOM-FM almost two years later, on October 19, 1971. =Going bilingual (1974-1977)= In 1974, CHOM proposed to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission a plan in which the station would become bilingual (English/French). The CRTC accepted this plan but only on an experimental basis that would last three years; it also blocked a plan to implement quadraphonic broadcasting. In 1977, the station was forced by the CRTC to opt between the two languages, and after considering becoming a French-language station, it finally reverted to English full-time. On-air advertising steadily increased during the late 1970s. Furthermore, CHOM's original format of AOR and \\"underground\\" rock tunes (many of which were longer than the average 3 minutes in length) changed to include the playing of more top 40-type hits. Undoubtedly, record companies also began to complain that the playing of entire albums on air cut into their revenue as more and more listeners had access to cassette recorders. =Rise and fall and CHUM takeover (1979-2002)= CHOM-FM became increasingly popular, and in 1979 surpassed sister station CKGM in Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings. Both stations were sold to CHUM Limited on August 20, 1985. Promotional bumper sticker distributed in the 1990s by CHOM with its 1990s logo (an updated version of the 1980s cursive logo). Logo facelifts were made in the 1990s until its retirement in 2002. The station acquired the rights to the syndicated show by Howard Stern which made its debut on CHOM on September 2, 1997 amid much controversy as he launched himself on his very first show heard in Montreal in an anti-Francophone/anti-French tirade. His show was cancelled a year later, on August 27, 1998, after numerous complaints to the CRTC about politically incorrect remarks interpreted by complainants as sexist and homophobic. =Return to their classic rock direction and Standard Radio takeover (2002-2007)= Logo used from 2002-2010 Effective in January 2002, the station was sold to Standard Broadcasting, which already owned CJAD and CJFM-FM in Montreal, in exchange for Standard's CFWM-FM in Winnipeg. =Astral takeover and new direction (2007-2013)= Ownership changed hands again when on October 29, 2007, Astral Media took control of Standard Broadcasting and its assets. On October 19, 2010, CHOM celebrated its 40th anniversary as a radio station. On June 22, 2011, it was announced that Terry DiMonte will be making a return to the station, however it is unlikely that he and Ted Bird will reunite on air.https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Radio+host+Terry+DiMonte+returning+CHOM/4988946/story.html =Bell Media= On July 2013, Astral Media was acquired and dissolved by Bell Media. CHOM-FM has been reunited with its original AM station CKGM which CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) acquired from CHUM in 2007. On September 22, 2017, longtime radio personality Robert \\"TooTall\\" Wagenaar retired from his mid-day show after over 40 years at CHOM.https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/music/choms-tootall-on- retirement-40-years-is-a-nice-thing-to-shoot-for His replacement is Randy Renaud, a 30 year veteran of the radio station.https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/local-arts/chom-vet-randy- renaud-to-succeed-tootall-on-weekday-show Location When first launched in 1963, CHOM (then known as CKGM-FM) was originally based at 1455 Drummond Street in Montreal, along with the CKGM-AM. Like CKGM, it moved to 1310 Greene Avenue in Westmount in the late 1960s. In 1972, CHOM relocated across the street to 1355 Greene Avenue, while CKGM opted to stay at 1310 Greene. CHOM eventually returned to the CKGM building a few years later and remained located there until its acquisition by Standard Broadcasting in 2002. At this point, CHOM was moved to 1411 Fort Street in Montreal (the building that housed Standard's other two existing Montreal radio stations, CJFM-FM and CJAD). In September 2012, Astral Media relocated its local English-language radio stations (including CHOM) to its French-language radio studios at 1717 Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard East in Montreal.

He is registered with the British Psychological Society and also as a Relational Psychoanalyst at the Bowlby Centre. He is also an author, journalist, television producer and broadcaster. Career Following a degree in Social Anthropology at University of Cambridge, he trained as a child clinical psychologist at the University of Nottingham and worked for six years at the NHS Cassel Hospital in Richmond, London, in a clinical psychologist post. He has written columns for The Sun, The Sunday Telegraph, the Sunday Express, The Independent, The Observer magazine and The Guardian Family section. He also contributes regularly to the Comment page of The Guardian, as well as occasional articles for the other broadsheets. He currently writes a column in The Financial Times Wealth magazine. Speaking on Channel 4's 2013 \\"Psychopath Night\\", James described the credit crunch as a \\"mass outbreak of corporate psychopathy which resulted in something that very nearly crashed the whole world economy\\".Psychopath Night, Channel 4 (2013). =Television= In 1982, James made his first television series, for Granada for the ITV network, about childcare (Under Fives). He made two further educational series, one for Channel 4 (Sex With Paula, 1987) and one for ITV (Men On Violence, 1988, for LWT). He originated and was associate producer of the ITV documentary \\"The Man who shot John Lennon\\". He was the interviewer and producer of the 44 interviews in Room 113 for the two series of the BAFTA-award-winning Network 7 youth programme on Channel 4. The interviews in Room 113 were described by Chris Dunckley in the Financial Times as \\"The most frank since John Freeman's Face-to-Face in the Fifties\\". In 1990 he produced a documentary for Channel 4 about the Mail on Sunday and in 1992 he contributed three films, two as Producer and one as Producer-Presenter, to the BBC 2 Crime and Punishment season. Rape, for 40 Minutes, recorded the meeting of a rapist and a rape victim. Prisoner XYY/334422, also for 40 Minutes, was about the psychology of an imprisoned psychopath. Wot U Looking At?, for the science programme Horizon, presented his influential explanation (from his monograph \\"Juvenile Violence in a Winner-Loser Culture\\") for why the poor are more violent than the rich and why, at the time, violence had been rocketing since 1987 in the UK. In 1995 he produced, directed and presented a forty-minute Late Show documentary for BBC2, Prozac Diary, in which artists took the drug to see how it affected their work. In 1997, he produced and presented The Chair, a 7-part interview series for BBC2, including one in which Peter Mandelson MP shed a tear. In 1998 he was the presenter of a 2-part series about his book, New Britain on the Couch, for Channel 4, followed in 2000 by presenting a one-off documentary about infidelity, Affairs of the Heart. In each of 2004, 2005 and 2006 he has presented a series of programmes about childcare for This Morning, titled Through the Eyes of the Child. =Books= His 2002 book, They F*** You Up: How to Survive Family Life, has sold over 150,000 copies, as did his book Affluenza (2007). His 2009 book, Contented Dementia, has sold over 100,000 copies in the UK and is widely used by professionals and relatives in managing people with the illness, despite the extreme hostility displayed to the method by the Alzheimer's Society. In his 2012 book, Love Bombing - Reset your child's emotional thermostat, he describes a technique for parents to help improve relationships between parents and children which is widely used. In his 2013 book, Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks, he identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits (narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy) as being common amongst senior managers. In his 2014 book, How to Develop Emotional Health, he cites five key elements of good emotional health - insightfulness, living in the present, fluid 'two-way' relationships, authenticity and playfulness. He emphasises that although it is rare for a person to develop very high levels of emotional health, his book intends to indicate how it can be incrementally improved over time. His book Not In Your Genes (2016) argued that no genes have been found which significantly explain our individual psychology, such as intelligence or mental health, and claimed that nurture is extremely important, explaining why siblings are different and why traits run in family. Also published in 2016, his book Upping Your Ziggy - How David Bowie Faced His Childhood Demons and How You Can Face Yours analyses how Bowie used his lyrics and stage personas to deal with his fear of madness, resulting from his family background. It explores the environmental causes of schizophrenia. Reception of work During his career in psychology, James has attracted controversy with his views on the nature versus nurture debate. Stuart Ritchie, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh, wrote a strongly critical review of James's book Not In Your Genes. He described the book as a \\"straw man made flesh\\", \\"a compendium of psychological myths and legends\\", and \\"bending over backwards to avoid awkward conclusions\\". Ritchie wrote, \\"Few books risk such damage to the public understanding of science as those by Oliver James\\", and accused James of \\"scientific illiteracy\\". Ritchie described the book's thesis as \\"children are born with brains of soft clay, their mental makeup unaffected by genes and infinitely mouldable by their parents\\", and that \\"DNA has no effect on the mind or mental health, whereas parenting reigns supreme\\". Ritchie described a variety of evidence which contradicts this view. Ritchie also responded to a letter from James in The Psychologist magazine, following which James and Prof Richard Bentall of the University of Liverpool engaged him in argument. James responded to Ritchie's criticisms in an article in The Guardian in March 2016.

Life Hayden Turner is a wildlife television presenter, now a global household name through his work for the National Geographic Channel and TV. He reports from some of the wildest and most scenic places on earth, transmitting passion and expertise with each broadcast. Hayden combines an exceptional commitment to conservation with an understanding of his audiences‚Äô interests. He works alongside experienced television crews, leading producers and directors, and has co- produced several of his programmes. Over the past twelve years, the former zookeeper has travelled extensively throughout the African continent and to more than 35 other countries. He has worked with numerous species but specialises in the husbandry of African mammals. When not adventuring in some remote corner of the Globe, Hayden runs programmes and gives talks for zoos and schools, believing that the most effective approach to conservation is education. Television Few are fortunate enough to turn a lifelong aspiration into a career reality. For Hayden, combining his love of wildlife with a career as a television presenter happened as a result of a chance meeting. Hayden had resigned his ten-year job as senior keeper at Taronga Zoo, Sydney, to visit Africa and work on volunteer conservation projects. Before leaving he took a party of VIPs on a behind-the-scenes tour. One of the group was Bryan Smith, general manager of National Geographic Channel in Australia. Impressed by the passion and depth of knowledge Hayden displayed and struck by his unique presentation skills, Bryan asked him if he‚Äôd be interested in taking a digital video camera to Africa to record his adventures. Hayden made an appearance in a Play School episode in 1993 as a zoo keeper when they visited the Taronga Zoo.

It is populated by Haredi Jews, and was built by members of the Old Yishuv. The oldest Sephardic Haredi dynasty, Levi Kahana of Spain, has a religious cultural center in the neighborhood. Name The name Mea Shearim is derived from a verse from Genesis, which happened to be part of the weekly Torah portion that was read the week the settlement was founded: \\"Isaac sowed in that land, and in that year, he reaped a hundredfold (, mea shearim); God had blessed him\\" (). According to a tradition, the community originally had 100 gates, another meaning of Mea Shearim. History Meir Auerbach, the chief Ashkenazi rabbi of Jerusalem, was one of the founders of the neighborhood.Encyclopedia Judaica, vol. 3, p. 848, Meir Ben Isaac Auerbach Conrad Schick, a German Christian architect, drew up the first blueprint for Mea Shearim in 1846. Mea Shearim, one of the earliest Jewish settlements outside the walls of the Old City, was established in 1874 by a building society of 100 shareholders. Pooling their resources, the society members purchased a tract of land outside the walled city, which was severely over- crowded and plagued by poor sanitation, and built a new neighborhood with the goal of improving their standards of living. Yosef Rivlin, one of the heads of the Jewish community in Jerusalem, and a Christian Arab from Bethlehem were the contractors. The work was carried out by both Jewish and non-Jewish workers. Street plan in 1927 Mea Shearim was structured as a courtyard neighborhood. It was surrounded by a wall, with gates that were locked every evening. By October 1880, 100 apartments were ready for occupancy, and a lottery was held to assign them to families. By the turn of the century, there were 300 houses, a flour mill, and a bakery. Conrad Schick planned for open green space in each courtyard, but cowsheds were built instead. Mea Shearim was the first quarter in Jerusalem to have street lights. Haredi lifestyle Today, Mea Shearim remains an insular neighbourhood in the heart of Jerusalem. With its Haredi and overwhelmingly Hasidic population, the streets retain the characteristics of an Eastern European shtetl, as it appeared in pre-war Europe. Life revolves around strict adherence to Jewish law, prayer, and the study of Jewish religious texts. Traditions in dress include black frock coats and black hats for men (although there are some other clothing styles, depending on the religious sub-group to which they belong), and long-sleeved, modest clothing for women. In some Hasidic groups, the women wear thick black stockings all year long, even in summer. Married women wear a variety of hair coverings, from wigs to scarves and snoods. The men have beards, and many grow long sidecurls, called peyot. Many residents speak Yiddish in their daily lives, and use Hebrew only for prayer and religious study, as they believe Hebrew to be a sacred language only to be used for religious purposes. ?◊ú◊û◊î ◊î◊ó◊®◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊û◊ê◊î ◊©◊¢◊®◊ô◊ù ◊û◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ô◊ì◊ô◊© Hasidic groups with a large number of followers in Mea Shearim include: Breslov, Slonim, Toldos Aharon, Toldos Avraham Yitzhak, Mishkenos HoRoim, and Satmar. The Pinsk-Karlin dynasty also has its center here. The Edah HaChareidis, which supervises kashrut certification and runs a Jewish religious court, has its headquarters at the western end of Mea Shearim. Mea Shearim is the stronghold of both factions of the Neturei Karta movement, as well as the movement whence they sprang ‚Äì the descendants of the original Perushim community, also known as \\"Yerushalmis\\". Some Neturei Karta members have asked to live under Arab rule. The late Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, the leading posek of Litvish / Yeshivish Jewry, made his home here. Neighborhood regulations Modesty sign in Mea Shearim \\"Modesty\\" posters in Hebrew and English are hung at every entrance to Mea Shearim. When visiting the neighborhood, women and girls are urged to wear what is deemed to be modest dress (knee-length skirts or longer, no plunging necklines or midriff tops, no sleeveless blouses or bare shoulders); men and boys are urged to avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts; tourists are requested not to arrive in large, conspicuous groups; and in some of the older signs, even non-Jewish men are requested to wear kippas. During Shabbat (from Friday night at sundown to Saturday night at sundown), visitors are asked to refrain from smoking, photography, driving, or using mobile phones. When entering synagogues, men are asked to cover their heads. =Incidents in the neighborhood= Toldos Aharon children in Mea Shearim, 2007 Some residents have been criticized for attacking police, and other government officials entering the area, with stones, and blocking the streets, or setting fire to rubbish when they try to do so (otherwise known as Hafganahs). A small, violent group called \\"The Sikrikim\\", of less than 100 families, enforce censorship on bookshops, causing over 250,000 NIS damage to a shop that resisted their demands. On 24 June 2010, politicians Uri Maklev and Moshe Gafni of the Haredi party United Torah Judaism were attacked, after they had visited the Slonim rabbi and had entered his synagogue to pray. When they emerged, they were set upon by young extremists affiliated with Neturei Karta who spat at them and physically assaulted them. In April 2015, an IDF officer was attacked by men and women of Mea Shearim who allegedly threatened to kill him, while children blocked his exit. The incident received national attention. The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \\"outrageous\\", and by Shas leader Aryeh Deri as \\"an act of terror\\".

It was begun in 1802 by the British infantry officer William Lambton, under the auspices of the East India Company.Gill, B. (2001); \\"THE BIG MAN. Surveying Sir George Everest\\", in: Professional Surveyor Magazine, Vol. 21 Nr 2. Retrieved online 8 March 2016. Under the leadership of his successor, George Everest, the project was made the responsibility of the Survey of India. Everest was succeeded by Andrew Scott Waugh and after 1861 the project was led by James Walker, who oversaw its completion in 1871. Among the many accomplishments of the Survey were the demarcation of the British territories in India and the measurement of the height of the Himalayan giants: Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga. The Survey had an enormous scientific impact as well, being responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly which led to the development of the theories of isostasy. The native surveyors made use of in the Himalayas, especially in the Tibetan region where Europeans were not allowed, were called pandits, who included the cousins Nain Singh Rawat and Krishna Singh Rawat.Peter Hopkirk, 1982, \\"Trespassers on the Roof of the World: The Race for Lhasa\\", Oxford University Press.Derek J.

Trotter, The Journal of the Royal Geographic Society (1877).  History  The first triangulations across the Peninsula From its inception in 1600 to the beginning of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company gained more territory on the Indian subcontinent. With the acquisition of new territory, it employed several explorers and cartographers to provide maps and other information on its territories, most notably James Rennell, from 1767 in Bengal. As Rennell proceeded to make maps, some serious flaws in them surfaced, based on a lack of precise measurements. In 1800, shortly after the English victory over Tipu Sultan, William Lambton, an infantry soldier with experience in surveying proposed to remedy precisely that, through a series of triangulations initially through the newly acquired territory of Mysore and eventually across the entire subcontinent. Measurement of the Calcutta baseline in 1832 based on a sketch by James Prinsep. This shows surveyors stretching a chain on coffers supported on pickets. The chain is housed under shade to reduce errors due to thermal expansion, and is aligned using a boning telescope. The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started on 10 April 1802 with the measurement of a baseline near Madras. Major Lambton selected the flat plains with St. Thomas Mount at the north end and Perumbauk hill at the southern end. The baseline was long. Lieutenant Kater was despatched to find high vantage points on the hills of the west so that the coastal points of Tellicherry and Cannanore could be connected. The high hills chosen were Mount Delly and Tadiandamol. The distance from coast to coast was and this survey line was completed in 1806. The East India Company thought that this project would take about 5 years but eventually it took nearly 70 years well past the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the end of company rule in India. Because of the extent of the land to be surveyed, the surveyors did not triangulate the whole of India but instead created what they called a \\"gridiron\\" of triangulation chains running from North to South and East to West. At times the survey party numbered 700 people.Bluesci: Cambridge university science magazine, 29 January 2011,\\"History: The Great Trigonometrical Survey\\" , Cambridge. A Zenith sector was an upward facing telescope with accurate angle measurement scales. A star close to the zenith of known declination from the pole star was used to determine latitude as a direct measurement of the pole star could be affected by refraction. The Trigonometrical Survey was conducted independently of other surveys, notably the topographical and revenue surveys. In 1875, the decision was taken that the Survey budget should be reduced from 240,000 to 200,000 pounds. This resulted in a reorganization under Surveyor-General Colonel J.T. Walker to amalgamate the Great Trigonometrical, Topographical and Revenue Surveys into the Survey of India.  Instruments and methods used  Great Trigonometric Survey ridge stone present in Bisle village, Karnataka Triangulation surveys were based on a few carefully measured baselines and a series of angles. The initial baseline was measured with great care since the accuracy of the subsequent survey was critically dependent upon it. Various corrections were applied, principally temperature. An especially accurate folding chain was used, laid on horizontal tables, all shaded from the sun and with constant tension. The early surveys made use of large and bulky theodolites made by William Carey, a Zenith sector made by Jesse Ramsden and chains. Later surveys used more compact theodolites. Survey towers used by George Everest to house the instruments. One of these towers near Kolkata in 2012 Accurate instruments could not always be purchased through the standard system of government contract and Everest personally supervised the construction of instruments. He had a maker, Henry Barrow, set up an instrument company in Calcutta. For a while Barrow was succeeded by Syed Mohsin from Arcot and after his death the instruments were supplied by Cooke from York. = Correcting deviations = To achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry: * Curvature of the earth * The non-spherical nature of the curvature of the earth * Gravitational influence of mountains on pendulums and plumb lines * Refraction * Height above sea level  Superintendents  *1818‚Äì1823 ‚Äì William Lambton *1823‚Äì1843 ‚Äì Sir George Everest *1843‚Äì1861 ‚Äì Andrew Scott Waugh *1861‚Äì1884 ‚Äì James Thomas Walker *1885‚Äì1911 ‚Äì Sidney Gerald Burrard *1912‚Äì1921 ‚Äì Sir Gerald Ponsonby Lenox-Conyngham  See also  * Principal Triangulation of Great Britain  References   Further reading  * Matthew Edney. 1997.

The report, entitled Children and their Primary Schools, reviewed primary education in a wholesale fashion. The collation of the report took around 3 years. The Council was chaired by Bridget, Lady Plowden after whom the report is named. Context The report was commissioned by Education minister, Sir Edward Boyle in 1963. He requested that the council \\"consider primary education in all its aspects and the transition to secondary education.\\" At that time, the last such investigation into the nature of primary education had been undertaken by the Hadow Committee led by Sir William Henry Hadow in the early 1930s. During the time of collating the report, the Labour Government of the day introduced circular 10/65 requesting that local education authorities submit plans to replace the tripartite system and 11-plus with comprehensive schooling. The administration also made clear its intention to raise school-leaving age to 16 (from the then 15). In the years leading up to, and during the collation of the report, prevalent thinking in educational psychology was highly influenced by the work of such people as Jean Piaget who published a seminal work on the matter in 1962. Main findings The report was widely known for its praising of child-centred approaches to education, stressing that \\"at the heart of the educational process lies the child\\". Recommendations in the report included those listed below: * All schools should have a programme for contact with children's homes (Ch. 4) * Primary schools should be used as fully as possible out of ordinary hours (Ch. 5) * A national policy of 'positive discrimination' should favour schools in deprived neighbourhoods (Ch. 5) * Training college should expand opportunities for teachers to train in teaching English to immigrants (Ch. 6) * Surveys of primary education should be undertaken every 10 years (Ch. 8) * Nursery education should be available to children at any time after they reach the age of three (Ch. 9) * A three-tier system of first, middle and Secondary schools, with transfer at ages 8 and 12. (Ch. 10) * Authorities maintaining selection should not rely on intelligence and attainment tests. (Ch. 11) * The infliction of physical pain as a method of punishment in primary schools should be forbidden. (Ch. 19) * The maximum size of primary school classes should be reduced (Ch. 20) * The term 'slow learner' should be substituted for 'educationally sub-normal'. (Ch. 21) * More men teachers are needed in primary schools (Ch. 25) Implementation By the time the report was returned to the Ministry of Education, the change of government had led to the appointment of Anthony Crosland as minister. He received the report in 1967, but implementation of the recommendations was piecemeal. In some areas, local education authorities implemented changes themselves, such as the introduction of three-tier education systems in many places. Similarly, over the 40 years, many of the recommendations which first appeared in the report, have evolved and appeared in legislation under other guises, such as the widespread introduction of state-funded nursery provision, Extended Schools, requirement for a Home School Agreement to be presented (but not signed), the ban on corporal punishment, ESOL programmes, Educational Action Zones and most of all the comprehensive system. However the three-tier system is now uncommon in Britain with a two-tier system of primary school followed by a transition aged 11 to secondary school being normal. The system of children transferring to secondary school at the age of 12 has now been almost completely abandoned. Male teachers remain a small minority in primaries. New Primary Review A new review of primary education in England began on 2 October 2006 under the leadership of Professor Robin Alexander under the title The Primary Review.

It is for girls aged 11 to 18. The campus is situated near the Sussex Downs, on a cliff overlooking Brighton Marina and the English Channel. The school incorporates dance studios, music classrooms, a 320-seat theatre, a heated indoor swimming pool, a golf course, a private tunnel to the beach, a farm and a chapel, as well as a range of workshops, studios, laboratories and sports pitches. Roedean School is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). The Good Schools Guide stated that the \\"School has a healthy spirit and much to offer.\\" The Independent Schools Inspectorate rated Roedean as Excellent in all areas (highest category) in its most recent inspection (March 2016). History The school was founded in 1885 as Wimbledon House by three sisters: Penelope, Millicent, and Dorothy Lawrence. Their brother was the lawyer Sir Paul Lawrence of Wimbledon, who helped them considerably. Their Lawrence great aunts had been noted school teachers earlier in the century, mainly in Liverpool. Roedean was founded to prepare girls for entrance to the newly opened women's colleges at Cambridge University, Girton (now co-ed) and Newnham Colleges.History of Roedean In 1898, the school moved to its present site, occupying new buildings designed by the architect Sir John Simpson. A sister school, also called Roedean School and co-founded by the youngest Lawrence sister, Theresa, in 1903, is located in Johannesburg, South Africa. The school motto, Honneur aulx dignes, is in Norman French, and means \\"Honour the worthy\\". When pronounced, it sounds like \\"Honour Roedean\\". In 1924 the Lawrence sisters were replaced by Emmeline Mary Tanner who became the new head. She had been poached from Bedford High School by Penelope Lawrence as their successor. During the Second World War, the students and staff were temporarily evacuated to Keswick, in the north of England. The school buildings in Brighton, Sussex were used by the Admiralty. They adapted it for use by Navy cadets attending the Mining and Torpedo School (known as HMS Vernon). Roedean is one the few girls' schools in the country to have an Old Boys' Association.Roedean Old Boys' Association The artist Percy Shakespeare was killed by a German bomb while serving at Roedean. =Absorption of St Mary's Hall= Inspired by his friend William Carus-Wilson, who founded Cowan Bridge School, Reverend Henry Venn Elliott proposed to found a similar school for the county. St Mary's Hall was opened in 1836 and was the second-oldest girls' school in the United Kingdom before it was closed in 2009. At that time, its junior section became Roedean's junior school while many senior girls transferred to Roedean. The junior school was closed in 2011 as the school administration decided to focus on secondary and sixth form education.Junior School Location Roedean School is set in of grounds off Roedean Way, at the top of a cliff on the Sussex Downs overlooking the sea, approximately in line with Brighton Marina. Houses The school community is divided into houses. The Lawrence and Tanner House (with Senior and Junior wings) system, introduced in 2005, was reversed starting in 2010. A numbered house system was reintroduced. Roedean school has the longest corridor in England. Year 7 to Year 11 students are spread out amongst House 1, 2, 3, 4. These are named after the house numbers 1‚Äì4 of Lewes Crescent, where the School was located prior to moving in 1898 to this campus built for it. Sixth form (Years 12‚Äì13) are admitted to Keswick House and Lawrence House, which is detached from the main school building.

The ABW is responsible for analyzing, reporting and preventing threats to Poland's internal security, including terrorism, foreign espionage, arms smuggling, drug trafficking, organized crime, corruption and economic coercion. Its powers include arresting individuals, conducting searches and investigations, and combating terrorism with a specialized armed anti-terrorist force. The ABW is headquartered on ul. Rakowiecka in the Mokot√≥w district of Warsaw. As part of its institutional hierarchy, the Head of the ABW reports directly to the Prime Minister of Poland, who in turn provides oversight of the ABW, or can appoint a special minister to coordinate intelligence and security activities for oversight. The ABW is considered by the government of Poland to be one of the nation's special services. History The ABW was created under the premiership of Leszek Miller on 24 May 2002, following the Council of Ministers' submission of its legislation on the Internal Security Agency and Foreign Intelligence Agency bill to the Sejm for approval. The legislation effectively split the previous national intelligence service, the UrzƒÖd Ochrony Pa≈Ñstwa (UOP), into two separate components: the Agencja Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa Wewnƒôtrznego (ABW), responsible for domestic intelligence operations, and the Agencja Wywiadu (AW), dedicated to gathering and analyzing foreign intelligence outside of Poland. Mission and operations In accordance to Article 5 of the 2002 Internal Security Agency and Foreign Intelligence Agency Law, the ABW is tasked to protect Polish citizens, property and the state in a number of fields. These operations include domestic counter-intelligence activities, ensuring economic security, counter- terrorism and weapons proliferation, combating organized crime, securing state classified information, and protecting Polish cyberspace operations. According to law, ABW investigations must be preceded by a warrant issued from a regional court after a submitted request from the ABW's Head. The ABW works closely with other security apparatuses in counter-intelligence and counter- terrorism operations to pool data, including the Agencja Wywiadu, the Policja, the Stra≈º Graniczna and the Biuro Ochrony RzƒÖdu. The ABW also monitors corruption among state agencies and officials. According to its 2009 report, the ABW monitored 82 state enterprises undergoing privatization, as well as monitored the flow of European Union funds to Polish coffers. Ministries of state have been subject to investigations from the ABW for financial irregularities, including the ministries for Finance, National Defence, Environment, Justice, Interior and Administration, and GDDKiA. Among the agency's powers, the ABW reserves the right to arrest individuals, search individuals and premises, inspect cargo from land, water and air transport, and request assistance from other Polish security services and government bodies. The ABW's central operations center is located in the Mokot√≥w borough of Warsaw along ul. Rakowiecka, standing in close proximity to Mokot√≥w Prison and the Ministry of Interior and Administration. The agency's training center is located in the village of Em√≥w, east of Warsaw in Masovian Voivodeship. The ABW maintains offices in nearly all of Poland's major cities, including Bia≈Çystok, Bydgoszcz, Gda≈Ñsk, Katowice, Krak√≥w, Lublin, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Olsztyn, Opole, Pozna≈Ñ, Radom, Rzesz√≥w, Szczecin, Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and Zielona G√≥ra. Additionally, the ABW maintains international liaison offices within Polish diplomatic missions in Berlin, Brussels, Kiev, London, Moscow and Prague. ABW headquarters at 2a Rakowiecka Street in Warsaw. Internationally, the ABW works closely with the intelligence and security agencies of fellow NATO and European Union member states, as well as outside states including Afghanistan, Israel, Kazakhstan and Montenegro. The ABW also worked closely with the Security Service of Ukraine in preparation for the UEFA Euro 2012 over the coordination of security plans. Oversight The activities of the ABW, along with the other special services (including the AW and the CBA) are provided oversight by the Prime Minister of Poland directly, or through a specially appointed minister working within the Chancellery. The Head of the ABW reports to the prime minister regarding security matters of concern. The prime minister also retains the right to propose candidates to lead the ABW; nominated individuals are then subject to the opinion of the President of Poland. The president also reserves the right to receive information from the ABW Head regarding security concerns. A Committee of Special Services under the Council of Ministers within the Chancellery retains responsibility of planning, coordinating and overseeing the activities of the ABW and all other special services. The agency's legal activities are tied to the Public Prosecutor General, who is regularly informed by the ABW's Head of the agency's course of actions. Additionally, the Special Services Committee within the Sejm evaluates the performance of the agency, giving opinion to budgetary concerns, investigations and cooperation among the special services. Controversies In the aftermath of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, killing President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and other senior members of the armed forces and government, members of the Law and Justice party alleged that leaked memos showed the agency had spied on the late president and First Lady Maria Kaczy≈Ñska during a state visit to Georgia in 2008. In May 2011, the ABW conducted a dawn raid on the home of the owner of AntyKomor.pl, a satirical website critical of Polish president Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, citing that the website was in breach of Article 135 of the Polish Penal Code for insulting the president. In response to opposition allegations of stifling free speech, Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated afterwards that the agency was a victim of the penal code's legal vagueness. Later, Prime Minister Tusk criticized the agency for acting \\"overzealous.\\" Marcin Idzik, who served as the CEO in the years 2013-2015 of the state-owned arms firm Bumar (since renamed as Polski Holding Obronny-Polish Defense Holding) has alleged that in 2013 he asked for an investigation by the ABW of a former Bumar sales agent Pierre Dadak on the suspicions of fraud. Dadak has been very closely associated with Krzysztof Wegrzyn, a wealthy businessman and former deputy defense minister, generally regarded as a member of the elite. Idzik claims that the ABW were unwilling to investigate Dadak, leading him to say: \\"I was the chief of the biggest Polish defense company and somebody wheedled money. For me, [is it] strange? Yeah, 400 percent.\\" The ABW has refused to comment on the matter. In June 2014, the ABW conducted a raid on editorial office of \\"Wprost\\" newspaper, after \\"Wprost\\" published stenographic records of private conversations between country officials implicating them in many unconstitutional acts and bribery. The ABW used physical force on newspapers editor-in-chief Sylwester Latkowski in an attempt to illegally seize his laptop computer, after he refused to give it away without court warrant.

One of a pair designed for hauling freight (the other, number 58 was called Tiger), built by Todd, Kitson & Laird (later Kitsons) of Leeds in 1838. It was also used in the 1953 film The Titfield Thunderbolt. History =19th century= \\"Lion\\" was ordered by the Liverpool & Manchester Railway in October 1837; one of an order of six locomotives from Todd, Kitson & Laird of Leeds. They were built according to the patents of Robert Stephenson for a six-wheel locomotive and that of John Melling, the LMR Locomotive Superintendent and included several of his patent ideas, including hollow water filled firebars; a pre-heating tank beneath the firebox into which waste steam from the safety valve could be directed; Melling's patent radial valve gear; and a coupling wheel to aid adhesion. \\"Lion\\" and her sister \\"Tiger\\" were 0-4-2 'luggage' engines for working goods trains. They had cylinders 11 x 20 inches; 5-feet driving wheels; 37 inches diameter carrying wheels; and 50psi boilers 7 feet 4 inches long and slightly oval in cross section.A L Dawson, Early Railways of Leeds, pp. 24-29 \\"Lion\\" was rebuilt at Edge Hill by the LMR in 1841 with a new boiler 8 feet 6 inches long, which necessitated the building of new, longer, frames; new cylinders 12 x 18 inches; new valves and valve chests; and new valve gear as designed by William Barber Buddicom 1840-1841. \\"Lion's\\" present cylinders measure 14 1/8th inches x 18 inches suggesting they have been changed at a later date. In 1845 the LMR was absorbed by the Grand Junction Railway (GJR), which in turn was one of the constituents of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) a year later. Lion was re-numbered 116 on the LNWR Northern Division. It was used in traffic until 1857, what it was transferred to the Stores Department as Ballast Engine No. 14. \\"Lion\\" was sold to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in May 1859 for ¬£400 to work the internal system of the Docks & Harbour Board in Liverpool. A new boiler - and probably the present boiler carried by the engine - was fitted by the Harbour Board in 1865. =Rediscovery and restoration= Around 1874 \\"Lion\\" was retired to work as a pumping engine at the Graving Dock facility at Prince's Dock which came into use in January 1875. It was \\"rediscovered\\" in 1923 and then rescued by members of the Liverpool Engineering Society in 1928 when it was replaced by an electric pump, and then renovated by Crewe works. Lion's tender had long since been scrapped so a new one was built by Crewe Works using parts from a scrapped Furness Railway tender, originally built by Sharp, Stewart of Manchester. Other work included: a new chimney; new smokebox doors; new wheel splashers; new foot plate and cab guard rails; new boiler lagging; new boiler tubes; the fitting of a mechanical lubricator; new boiler fittings. The cylinders were also probably re-bored. A controversial copper cover was fitted over the high-crowned wagon-top firebox to simulate an arc de cloitre firebox of the 1840s period. Lion took part in the LMR centenary celebrations in 1930 and the London and Birmingham Railway centenary in 1938. Before World War II, Lion was displayed at Lime Street station. During the war it was stored at Crewe and afterwards displayed in the Transport Gallery of Liverpool Museum. =Postwar= It starred in the 1953 film The Titfield Thunderbolt, among others. During the filming of Thunderbolt the engine was fitted with a damper and a pressure gauge in order to promote better boiler management to prevent it from blowing off all the time. During filming, the buffer beam on the tender was dented, damage still visible years later. It was the second oldest locomotive to be steamed, the oldest being the British-built American locomotive John Bull. The locomotive had been used in the 1951 film The Lady with a Lamp, depicting the arrival of Florence Nightingale at her home.Internet Movie Database \\"Lion\\" was restored by Rustons Diesels Ltd. in 1979-1980. New boiler tubes were fitted; the original main steam pipe was replaced; because the original plug regulator was cracked a new one was cast and fitted; new boiler fittings including bourdon-type pressure gauge, gauge glass and try-cocks were fitted. New wash out plugs were also provided. The front buffer beam (not original) was reinforced with channel section. Safety chains were fitted and the tender equipped with air brakes taken from a commercial HGV. The boiler certificate issued by BR was for four years. Whilst the new Museum of Liverpool was being built, between 1999 and 2007 Lion was on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester alongside replica Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive Planet. It underwent a cosmetic restoration by Liverpool Museums in 2008 before going on display in the new museum. On 27 February 2007, Lion was moved by road from Manchester to Liverpool for conservation work prior to it becoming an exhibit in the new Museum of Liverpool.  Identity  In March 2019, railway historian Anthony Dawson, who is working on a book on the locomotive, suggested that there was no clear evidence that the locomotive discovered in 1923 and now preserved as Lion is in fact Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive 57 Lion, and raised the possibility that it might be one of a number of other locomotives acquired by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board at around the same time. Other locomotives London, Midland and Scottish Railway Royal Scot Class 4-6-0 locomotive 6142 was originally named Lion. This loco was built by the North British Locomotive Company at Glasgow in November 1927 and withdrawn in January 1964 as 46142 The York and Lancaster Regiment. D0260, a prototype diesel locomotive built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company in 1962 was named Lion. British Rail Class 08 diesel shunter 13030 (later D3030 then 08022) was sold to Guinness at Park Royal in 1985 where it was given the name Lion. It and its sister locomotive Unicorn now reside on the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway.

Brilliant debut season in 1883  Born in Newport, South Wales, Henderson made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1883, and played in all but one of the county's games that season, making over 500 runs. He also took 35 wickets, including 6-17 (which was to remain his career best) against Gloucestershire. However, he then became ill and hardly played for three seasons. He went to India in 1885-86 to coach the Parsi cricketers in Bombay, and when the Parsis toured England in 1886 he again acted as their coach.  Return to the game  On his return to playing in 1887 Henderson bowled far less and played generally as a specialist batsman, but nevertheless again established himself in the Surrey side, being capped the following year. In 1889 he again topped 500 first-class runs, and made several vital half-centuries; he was one of nine Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the Almanack's 1890 edition. 1891 saw him make his only century, scoring 106 against Somerset, and the next year he was selected for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's.  Later career  After the 1893 season Henderson played little for his county and did not bowl at all, but he continued to appear occasionally until 1896. He also stood as an umpire on three occasions, all before the end of his playing career, including the 1895 and 1896 Gentlemen v Players games. He died at the age of 65 in Wallington, Surrey.

Biography  As a student of University of Zagreb's Faculty of Political Sciences Babiƒá began his career in the media in the late 1990s when he launched political news websites Vlast.net and Izbori.net. This caught attention of Globalnet, one of the pioneering Croatian ISPs, who hired him as editor of their web portal Online.hr. Although the portal managed to attract more readership during his tenure, the portal's parent company decided to cease funding the portal in late 2001 and in December 2002 Babiƒá left Online.hr to found Index.hr, one of the first Croatian Internet-only news outlets. Initially designed as a news aggregator, Index.hr provided news content from both Croatia and all around the world. The website quickly gained popularity in the early 2000s and over time more original content produced by the growing staff was being added to the site, until it became a popular media outlet in its own right. Around the same time the website gained a reputation for yellow journalism after exposing a series of scandals, the two most notable being the 2003 controversy stirred by a discovered recording of popular singer Marko Perkoviƒá in which Perkoviƒá publicly performed \\"Jasenovac i Gradi≈°ka Stara\\", a song praising the WWII fascist Usta≈°e regime, and the 2004 celebrity sex tape scandal involving Severina Vuƒçkoviƒá, a pop singer. Babiƒá's website was sued by Vuƒçkoviƒá for copyright infringement and breach of privacy. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a Zagreb district court in July 2004. In April 2015, along with Vana ≈†alov Violiƒá, Babic was accused of damaging Prva stranica d.o.o. company for 2.8 million kunas with fictitious contracts. He pleaded guilty at county court in Zagreb and got sentenced to a year in jail. The sentence was replaced by a year of community service. Additionally, Matija Babiƒá had to pay a fine of 300,000 kunas, while Vana ≈†alov Violiƒá had to pay a fine of 150,000 kunas. They are both obliged to pay up 1,000,000 kunas to state budget, and return 600,000 kunas to Prva stranica d.o.o.. On account of the Index.hr website's success, the South Austrian-based publisher Styria Medien AG (who owned Veƒçernji list, one of the most widely circulated daily newspapers in the country) had hired Babiƒá as editor-in-chief of 24sata, a new tabloid newspaper which was intended to target \\"young, urban and modern\\" readers. Babiƒá left Index.hr and joined 24sata which was launched in March 2005 and soon established itself as Croatia's third daily newspaper in terms of circulation, behind Jutarnji list and Veƒçernji list. However, it was also criticized for sensationalism and poor quality of writing, and Babiƒá was sacked only four months later in July 2005, following an issue which featured a cover page with then Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and the headline \\"Everybody Hates Sanader\\". Babiƒá then returned to Index.hr and continued to run the website, currently holding the title of \\"author and editor of the project\\".

It is recorded that in 2003‚Äì4 Unarius centers existed in Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and in various locations in the United States.Saliba, John A.

Ruth Norman, 92; poet, humanitarian, cosmic visionary. San Diego Union-Tribune From the period of 1954‚Äì1971, when Ernest Norman still controlled the organization, the organization defined \\"the mission\\" as the explanation and promotion of an interdimensional science of life in the books he wrote. He said that he had channeled the material via his psychic connections with extraterrestrial intelligences. Between 1972‚Äì1993, while Ruth Norman guided it, the organization grew and had a raised public profile. \\"The mission\\" became bringing Unarius to the masses. Ruth Norman granted interviews, appeared on Late Night with David Letterman and The David Susskind Show and built a video production studio in the late 1970s. Unarius video productions began appearing on Public-access television cable TV stations all over the United States.Unarius Light Newsletter, 1978‚Äì80 In 2000, Diana Tumminia stated that in several cities in Southern California, the local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films. As it gained notoriety, Unarius has been featured in newspaper and magazine articles as well as radio and television spots.Tumminia (1995) p85 After Ruth Norman's death in 1993, Charles Louis SpiegelTumminia, Diana (2005) p165Tumminia, Diana (2003) p65-67Tumminia, Diana (2005) p193 (also known as Antares) became director, a post he retained until his death on December 22, 1999.Saliba, John A. (2003) p192 Since Ruth Norman's death in 1993, the organization has struggled, particularly since 2001, when a space-fleet landing predicted by Charles Spiegel in 1980 failed to occur. UnariunsAlthough often spelt Unarian other in sources (using the standard English suffix -ian), the word is invariably spelt Unariun on the Academy's website (see the \\"External links\\" section below). believe in immortality of the soul, and that all people have reincarnated many times.Tumminia (2005) p6 They also believe that our solar system was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations. The aliens are said to be \\"human beings\\" who have lived on Earth and on other planets outside our solar system. They are said to be more advanced than humans, spiritually and scientifically.Saliba, John A. (2003) p194 While the group seems to have similarity to the Aetherius Society or to Ra√´lism, as they emphasize \\"space brothers\\" who will come from the stars in 33 spaceships to improve humanity, these beliefs are not held by all Unariuns and in fact, are discounted by many as contradictory to true Unariun principles. In his book, The Truth About Mars, Ernest Norman claimed that the Chinese evolved from ancient interstellar migrants who began colonizing Mars a million years ago. They are reported to have returned to Mars, where they live in underground cities, after being attacked by natives of the Earth. A group which had become separated did not return with them and this group branched off and formed the various Asian racial genotypes.Norman; The Truth About Mars, 1956  Founders  Ernest Norman claimed to have been a child prodigy, having read all his father's (a physician from Scandinavia) books eagerly, self-educating himself alongside his formal schooling. He also claimed that as a child, he performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy rabbit hutch using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age. According to Unarius, Ernest Norman was a scientist, and an aeronautical engineer from whom the idea of the television tube was stolen.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p37 Claiming to possess psychic ability, he began his metaphysical career reading palms and also claimed to have told women of their loved one's whereabouts and often deaths during the World War II years of 1942‚Äì1945. When this practice of describing fatalities allegedly lowered morale at war plants where he worked, he left and started to give lectures of his own philosophy in theosophical churches during the mid to late 1940s.Norman; Biography of Unarius, 1975 Previous to meeting Ruth and the beginning of their mission, Ernest Norman gave psychic readings at spiritualist churches.Tumminia, Diana (1995) p86 Ruth Norman was the oldest of eight children, born in 1900. She took many jobs early on to help support her family, and worked as a fruit packer, and at other various jobs, including as a live-in maid. Her first marriage produced a daughter. After this she worked at many jobs including store clerk, nanny, short-order cook, waitress, ran a real estate office and eventually owned and managed some property.Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp163-4 She had purchased a motel, run a restaurant, worked at a cannery and worked in numerous other professions during her first fifty years. Both Ernest and Ruth had experiences in Spiritualism before the UFO craze in the late 1940s. By the early 1950s, mystics at a psychic convention she attended told her that she was being followed around by long-bearded wise men carrying books and that she would help bring in these books in her future. This same thing had been told to Ernest by other mystics at this same convention and when the two met and later married. Books date their marriage to 1954, and their anniversary is celebrated by Unarius on February 14. Tumminia states that their union brought forth their \\"mission\\". Within weeks, Ernest began to produce, by channeling, the first Unarius book, The Voice of Venus.Norman; Bridge to Heaven, 1969 Ruth was later known within the group as both \\"Ioshanna\\" (1972‚Äì1979) and \\"Uriel\\" (1980‚Äì1993).  Early years  Ernest Norman became a \\"channeler\\", the process by which he \\"wrote\\" his books. Unarian channeling is a process of relaxed contemplation in which the practitioner closes the eyes and enters into a composed state, allowing thoughts and images to flow freely, as he or she voices \\"messages\\" received from a supposedly higher consciousness, or \\"other beings\\" which speak to or through him or her. Coupling \\"channeling\\" with \\"past life\\" readings, the Normans developed a devoted following. Ernest Norman's first books contain themes similar to those of other metaphysical American religions and early 1950s contactees. While the Normans had dealings with other early contactee groups, initially Ernest Norman concerned himself with the \\"spiritual nature\\" of planets and their supposed history. He briefly mentioned flying saucers, saying that residents of more \\"spiritual\\" worlds were concerned about Atomic testing and responded by making their spacecraft visible and increasing contact with Earth people in order to attract attention.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p38Saliba, John A. (2003) p195 Ernest Norman claimed to receive ‚Äòtransmissions‚Äô from Mars and Venus, the homes of ‚Äògreat teachers‚Äô and Ascended Masters who described their cities to him.Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp86,88 Altogether, channeled descriptions of seven spiritual planets including Venus, claimed to be ‚Äòadvanced teaching centers‚Äô, comprise the set of books known as the \\"Pulse of Creation Series\\". The Normans operated out of their home, and in the 60s and early 70s, they moved to different cities in California, eventually settling in Escondido. During that time, Norman and Ruth claimed past lives as Jesus and Mary Magdalene respectively, as well as other famous people.Tumminia, Diana (2000) p300 In 1970, Norman channeled his prime lesson book, \\"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\\".Tumminia, Diana (2005) p. 166. The formation of the mission in February, 1954 by Ernest and Ruth Norman, led to the publication of the \\"Voice Series\\" of books. The first book, ‚ÄòVoice of Venus‚Äô (1956), concerned a psychic trip to Venus and described the advanced wonders of that civilization. Now known as ‚Äòthe Moderator‚Äô, he explained the existence of ‚Äòhealing wards‚Äô on that planet where troubled souls go to recuperate from traumatic experiences. He explained this book was not channeled in the usual type of meditative, trance-like state or in a darkened room, but spoken normally and recorded on tape. Norman generally held modern spiritualist and theosophical movements and practices to be backwards and less enlightened. The work describes communication from Mal-Var of Venus who gives a tour of the Venusian capital. In the work, Venusians are described as having \\"energy bodies\\" and living in a higher vibratory plane that would be invisible to a human were he to stand in the middle of the capital city known as Azure. The planet Venus and its culture are said to be more spiritual than that of the Earth and that more advanced Earth-dwellers visit and study on Venus when they sleep. Healing wards for human suicides, alcoholics, the mentally impaired and similar human wreckage exist in Azure and these souls are treated with positive energy and light to help them reincarnate with greater integration.Norman; Voice of Venus, 1956 The Voice Series consists of seven books: * The Voice of Venus * The Voice of Eros * The Voice of Orion * The Voice of Hermes * The Voice of Muse, Unarius & Elysium The seven books describe the seven planes of Shamballa, which are claimed to exist outside the natural world and are spiritual or non-physical worlds. Each plane has a specialty in the teaching of advanced principles, for the betterment of an individual's progressive evolution from life to life. The planes' specialties are: * Venus ‚Äì Healing * Eros ‚Äì Science * Orion ‚Äì Education * Hermes ‚Äì Philosophy * Muse ‚Äì The Arts * Unarius ‚Äì Leadership * Elysium ‚Äì Devotion These books authored by Ernest Norman, along with The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation, which were a series of 13 lectures given in 1956 and later compiled into book form with seven advanced lesson courses, constitute the early teachings and beliefs of Unarius. The Voice Series books are written with famous past Earth denizens acting as the tour guides for these various planes. Classification as a religion Unarius, as an organization, is strongly opposed to its common classification as a religion.Tumminia, Diana (2007) p85Saliba, John A. (2003) p199 Unarius calls its content and activities teaching \\"interdimensional science\\" and not a religion and assert that they teach the 'spiritual' understanding of \\"high energy-physics\\" and reincarnation.Tumminia, Diana (2003) p62 While Unarius lacks the main elements normally associated with religion, e.g. a hierarchical structure, priests and clergy, initiation rites, weekly services or ceremonies, the beliefs of Unarius do satisfy many religious criteria in that spiritual reality is taught: humans develop their spiritual potential over lifetimes; the concept of the Space Brothers is basically a supernatural assumption as they seem different in kind, and are empirically unprovable; it involves a western concept of good and evil and an eastern concept of karma; higher entities are channeled; the texts read like sacred scriptures; its system of beliefs can explain or dispel all phenomena, and thus satisfy all questions of meaning for adherents..Saliba, John A. (2003) pp200-201, p204Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp186‚Äì7 Unariuns do not offer prayers to God or higher entities, but prefer the word \\"spiritual\\" as opposed to \\"religious\\" to describe the overriding philosophy of the group.Saliba, John A. (2003) pp199-200 Ernest Norman rails against religion in several books, most notably The Infinite Contact, copyrighted in 1960, which describes in detail the origins of Christianity as rooted in Mithraism, Zoroastrianism and assorted ancient belief structures. Norman agreed with Karl Marx that religions were \\"the opium of the people\\", and yet also claimed to realize that many individuals were still at such a point in their evolution where religions still served a positive purpose and kept them from harming their fellowmen.  Principles and beliefs  Unarius was established to teach the 'fourth- dimensional science‚Äô aka \\"the Science of Life\\" which incorporates such New Age themes as \\"harmonic frequencies\\", karma, reincarnation, past-life memories, channeling, and an elaborate cosmology of ‚Äòspiritual planets.‚Äô Central tenets of the belief system include contact with the ‚ÄòSpace Brothers‚Äô and a millenarian prophecy that predicts a mass landing of starships.Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp5‚Äì7 \\"The Science\\" asserts that everything is energy: atoms, higher knowledge, our bodies and our experiences. This energy ‚Äòvibrates in frequencies and wave forms‚Äô. ‚ÄòUnderstanding‚Äô these vibrational energies allows contact with all things: higher intelligence, the ‚Äòadvanced teaching centers‚Äô and our ‚Äòpast lives‚Äô. By being ‚Äòin tune with spiritual frequencies‚Äô we can heal ourselves of mental and physical illness. Unarius belief comes under four basic themes: [1] intelligent life on other planets/galaxies; [2] an infinite creative intelligence (God); [3] that human beings are developing into an advanced state of consciousness; [4] the millennial hope of the advent of a landing. According to Unarius, the purpose of the research institution is \\"to awaken the individual to previous life encounters, the clairvoyant aptitude of the mind, and the reality of one's spiritual connection.\\"Saliba, John A. (2003) p197 Although the group is generally known for its predictions regarding flying saucers landing on Earth, Ernest L. Norman stressed his spiritual teachings as the key to personal development and mastery over material circumstances. In one instance, he derided flying saucer chasers as just another manifestation of people pursuing an \\"escape mechanism\\".Norman; The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation, 1960  The 1970s  With the death of co-founder Ernest in 1971, the mission was continued by his wife and partner Ruth. New Sub-Channels now authored the books with her. The two sub- channels, Thomas Miller (Cosmon) and Louis Spiegel (Antares), are credited on a number of the organization's books starting in 1972. After a channeling revealed a lifetime lived in ancient Atlantis with the name Ioshanna, she adopted the name Ioshanna during this period. Altogether she claimed over 200 previous lives.Tumminia, Diana (2003) p67Tumminia, Diana (2005) Appendix III Much of Unarian cosmology and lore revolves around the past lives of Uriel. From 1954‚Äì1974, meetings were held in Ruth Norman's home or at public meeting facilities.Unarius Light, 1975 In 1972, the channeled messages referred to \\"33 worlds of an interplanetary confederation\\". These worlds all had various problems and by communicating with Ioshanna, many of their hang-ups were solved or on the way to resolution.Norman, Miller, Spiegel; 33 Worlds Speak to Earth, 1972 Ruth became an exuberant visionary, and with help rapidly increased the ‚Äòmessages from space‚Äô. In 1973, she became known as ‚ÄòUriel the Archangel‚Äô said to be her ‚Äòhigher self‚Äô and to stand for Universal, Radiant Infinite Eternal Light.Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp88-89 In November 1973, Uriel purchased 67 acres in Jamul, California, for a proposed landing site for the Space Brothers. In 1974, in the \\"Tesla Speaks\\" volumes, Uriel completely redefined the Unarian mission by introducing the concept of the Interplanetary Confederation and the prophecy of a 33 vehicle spacefleet landing, in which she began to play the role of cosmic emissary uniting the confederation. The media joined in, the landing date was revised, and eventually pushed back to 2001. All unfulfilled prophecies were explained as being a reliving of Unarian past lives in the Isis-Osiris cycle.Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp38-42Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp89-93 In 1975, the organization moved its base from Glendale, California to El Cajon, California where a store front center was opened.Tumminia, Diana (1995) p93 Unarius was also incorporated as a non- profit, tax-exempt, educational foundation.Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp166-7 In El Cajon, Uriel became well known for driving a blue 1969 Cadillac Coupe d‚ÄôVille adorned with airbrushed depictions of spaceships with a large metal flying saucer on the roof; the car remains with Unarius and is driven every year in the annual El Cajon Mother Goose Parade. In 1976, ‚Äòpast life‚Äô therapy (called ‚Äòpsychic group therapy‚Äô) became formalised as part of the curriculum, eventually became the main activity of students, and was regarded as a healing practice.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p167 The content of Unarian belief increased as these revelations evolved into collective biographies of members who are believed to have acted under Uriel on Earth and many other planets throughout millennia. Tumminia comments that this type of collective weaving of past-life narratives as a regular practice of intersubjectivity may be unique to Unarius.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p7Tumminia, Diana (1995) p93-96 Most Unariuns were skeptical about the future predictions of a spacefleet landing, also channeled by Louis Spiegel. Many Unariuns felt that these predictions undermined the original mission of Ernest Norman and a falling out occurred. Circa 1980, Thomas Miller, the primary sub-channel, left the organization, leaving Louis Spiegel as the only sub-channel.Unarius Light, 1980 From this point forward, ever more activities revolved around these predictions. Ruth Norman, now 80, participated less and less in the goings on at the center and so Unariuns turned primarily to Louis Spiegel (aka \\"Antares\\", \\"Vaughn\\" and \\"Charles\\") for guidance and instruction.Unarius Light, 1981‚Äì88 In the early 1970s, a \\"Conclave of Light\\" celebration was staged at the U.S. Grant Hotel in San Diego, California and repeated yearly at different venues, and after 1975, at the Unarius center in El Cajon, California. Every October, they stage their \\"Interplanetary Conclave of Light\\", which will include a visit to the Jamul landing site, the release of white doves, and 90 minutes of \\"mental communication with the Space Brothers.\\" In the late 70s, Unarius started to make films and videos.Tumminia, Diana (1995) p94  Schism  Unarius generally has two types of students: the followers of Ernest Norman's original texts and works and those who believe in every channeling that occurred after his death. The latter group is often blamed by the former for the ridicule and mockery the organization has received by the general public since the early 1980s and more so in the Internet age for the conversion of the group to a \\"flying saucer group.\\"  The 1980s  The Unarius center reached its heyday in the 80s.Tumminia, Diana (1995) p97 The early eighties brought about the development of a video production studio and the marketing of Unarius videos through public-access television cable TV channels all over the nation.Unarius Light, 1983 From a public relations standpoint, Unarius made big inroads during this period, with new centers being opened up in the United States, Canada and Nigeria. During this period, the public identity of the organization changed from one which was teaching a \\"metaphysical science of life\\" to that of a \\"flying saucer group.\\" In 1984, Uriel declared Spiegel to have overcome his past negative karma as the Fallen Angel, Satan, and renamed Him Antares. Subsequently, he channeled elements of the millenarian prophecy, including a new planet Myton which would send a spaceship in the year 2001Tumminia, Diana (2003) p68 In 1984, Unarius also held its first annual Interplanetary Confederation Day (later called the Conclave of Light), which commemorates the ‚Äòunion of the planets under the guidance of Uriel'.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p168Tummnia, Diana (1995) p96Saliba, John A. (2003) p198 Altogether, Uriel directed the organisation for two decades and published over 80 books. Uriel broke her hip in 1988Tumminia, Diana (2003) p69 and the next year her health began to slip.  The 1990s  Ruth Norman, after several falls and surgeries in the late eighties, had more limited physical contact with the students and members but said she was \\"psychically\\" communicating with them on a day-to-day basis. Uriel became bedridden, rarely visiting the center herself, and let members know that her work was over. She died in 1993. Her death disconfirmed a long-held prophecy that the landing would take place in her lifetime. Her will stated that she would return with the Space Brothers in 2001.Tumminia, Diana (2003) p72 Louis Spiegel assumed leadership in the organization. Tumminia, Diana (2003) p77 As director, Spiegel wrote many books on reincarnation and consciousness. Unlike the Normans, he did not claim to have made ‚Äòpsychic/mental voyages‚Äô to other planets. He has been known to claim he's channeling Uriel herself. After Ruth's death and into the 1990s, some long-term students left over disagreements with Antares. These members wished to return focus to the original teachings of Ernest Norman and the more \\"scientific\\" aspects of Unarius. Some students disputed the importance of Uriel and prophecies concerning her.Tumminia, Diana (2005) p170-171 Spiegel died in December 1999, and in 2000, a board of directors formed to guide the center. The board legitimated its cooperative authority through channeled messages, in particular from Uriel and Antares, who are now ‚ÄòSpace Brothers‚Äô. Channeling ‚Äòexplained‚Äô that the Space Brothers are actually guiding the world invisibly and cannot become visible until the world becomes less warlike. Routinisation of charisma in this organisation thus proceeded smoothly, 'channelled advice' and the invocation of 'past-life memories' confirming the need for cooperation.Tumminia, Diana (2003) pp77-80 Students also left or became home-study students because they disagreed with the channelings of Louis Spiegel, particularly one which claimed that it was time for Ruth, then quite ill but still living, to return to the unseen world. This was in complete opposition to previously expounded Unariun principle, wherein members, no matter how far advanced, never engaged in interfering with or predicting future human activities. Many Unariuns perceived this as a power- grab against Ruth Norman. In the belief system of the school, this was related to a \\"negative reliving\\" of a previous existence, creating false, negative messages.Unarius Light, 1991‚Äì1993 Ruth Norman's flamboyance and costumes worn in later years were the subject of some attention. Alex Heard, in Apocalypse Pretty Soon: Travels In End-Time America , quipped of her that she was, \\"a true American original who combined the couture sensibilities of a drag queen with the joie de vivre of a Frisbee-chasing Irish Setter.\\" In and around the year 2000, local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films in several cities in Southern California.  2001  With 2001 having come and gone, and no space fleet landing having occurred, Unarius as an organization doubled down on its roots and the principles, the books and works of Ernest Norman, while simultaneously demonstrating a belief in a future landing by extraterrestrials to assist humankind. With the passing of Louis Spiegel in late 1999, the organization formed a small council which shares leadership and management responsibilities.Unarius Light, Online Edition, 2000 Unarius continues to be active both in the US and in several European countries.

It is part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. Founded in 1790, St Mary's provides a range of inter-related services specifically for women and children. History The hospital was founded in 1790 by Dr Charles White in a house in Old Bridge Street, Salford, as the \\"Lying-in Charity\\". Five years later in 1795 the charity became the Manchester Lying-in Hospital; it was accommodated however in the Bath Inn, Stanley Street, Salford.The Book of Manchester and Salford; for the British Medical Association. Manchester: George Falkner & Sons, 1929; pp. 120 Midwifery training for women was provided from the beginning. The building was felt to be very suitable. The bar was used as the apothecary's shop. Inpatient accommodation was available for widows, deserted wives, and those whose homes were unsuitable. 80 were admitted in 1791/92. In 1799/1800 there were 177 and 800 home patients. The charity maintained a list of midwives, who were paid two shillings and sixpence for each delivery. In 1819 it moved to smaller premises at 18 King Street Manchester, but moved back to Stanley Street in 1822. White's collection of 300 pathological specimens was given to the hospital after his death in 1813. It was available for inspection by the public. In 1840 the charity moved to 2 South Parade, which cost ¬£813. There was a disastrous fire there in 1847 which destroyed most of White's collection. In 1854 it changed its name to St Mary's Hospital and Dispensary for the Diseases peculiar to Women and also for the Diseases of Children under six years of age. From 1855 to 1903 it occupied a new building in Quay Street which was erected at the expense of Dr Thomas Radford. It cost ¬£4300 and had 80‚Äì90 beds, 25 or 30 of which were for children. Home visiting of sick women and children, and clinical teaching of students from Owens College began at this time. Radford had joined the hospital in 1818 as a man-midwife; from 1834 he was house surgeon extraordinary; from 1841 until his death in 1881 he was the consulting physician, and from 1874 also chairman of the board of management.The Book of Manchester and Salford; for the British Medical Association. Manchester: George Falkner & Sons, 1929; pp. 120‚Äì21 In 1904 the hospital was amalgamated with the Manchester Southern Hospital for Women and Children and two new hospitals were built. One was in Whitworth Street West on the corner of Oxford Street, designed by Alfred Waterhouse and built between 1899 and 1901. It had an octagonal tower and a circular ward block on three floors of 43 feet diameter. There were three separate dining rooms ‚Äì for doctors, for nurses, and for ancillary staff. The other hospital on Oxford Road in Chorlton-on- Medlock opened in April 1911. The hospital also had a School of Nursing that certified midwives. In 1910 the first female house surgeon was appointed. In 1915 the city centre hospital provided maternity and outpatient services and had 56 maternity beds and 50 cots, with accommodation for medical students, midwives and pupil nurses. The suburban hospital provided gynaecological and paediatric services and contained 115 beds.Wild, R. B. (1915) \\"The Medical Charities of Manchester and Salford\\", in: McKechnie, H. M., ed. Manchester in Nineteen Hundred and Fifteen. Manchester: University Press; pp. 55‚Äì58 A clinic for venereal disease was opened in 1919 and ante-natal clinics were instituted in 1923. A formal co-operation arrangement was made with the Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1939 which resulted in the gynaecological department was transferred from the Infirmary to St Mary's and a shared nursing staff and training school should be instituted. During the Second World War most patients were moved, first to Blackpool and then to Collar House in Prestbury, Cheshire, well away from the city centre. Prestbury Hall and later Adlington Hall were also used. At the start of the NHS in 1948 it formed part of The United Manchester Hospitals. A new hospital was constructed on Hathersage Road between 1966 and 1970 at a cost of over ¬£3 million. The wards were housed in a tower block with laboratories and the antenatal clinic in a podium. Each ward had 4 four-bedded rooms with nine single rooms, three nurseries, each with six cots, a day room and a utility room. Regional facilities ‚Äì a special care baby unit, the medical genetics centre and In-Vitro Fertilisation services were developed. In 2009 paediatric (excluding neonatal) services from St Mary's Hospital were transferred to the newly re-built Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, which opened on 11 June 2009. Services =Clinical= More than 1,200 staff, including doctors, nurses, midwives, clinical and non-clinical support staff work in St Mary's Hospital. A range of clinical and non-clinical support services are based at the site to support the work undertaken, including well established departments of radiology and physiotherapy. 9,267 babies were delivered in 2015/16. =Library= The Radford Library was transferred from St Mary's Hospital to the Manchester Medical Society's library in 1927. It included early obstetrical and gynaecological literature collected by the surgeon Dr Thomas Radford and donated to the hospital by him together with an endowment. Dr Radford also donated his obstetrical museum.The Book of Manchester and Salford; for the British Medical Association.

Its brands include Roodeberg, KWV Wines & KWV Brandies, and Laborie. The entrance to La Concorde, KWV Head Office in Paarl, South Africa History KWV was founded as a winemaking co-operative on 8 January 1918 by wine makers from the Western Cape in South Africa, with Dr. Charles Kohler as its chairperson. The name ‚ÄúKo√∂peratieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Suid-Afrika‚Äù is Afrikaans for \\"Co-operative Winemakers Union' of South Africa\\", but today KWV represents a well-known global wine and spirits brand producing a large portfolio of products. The purpose of KWV was to create unity amongst the wine farmers of South Africa and to ensure continuous improvement in the quality of South African wines and brandies. From the early 1920s, the co-operative was granted increasing legislative control over the production, sale and export of South Africa's distilling wine and spirits, which allowed the body to experiment with innovations in the industry which aided its development. The organisation also invested a great deal in the promotion of South African wine and brandy both locally and abroad. KWV's legal hand over the industry was lifted with the end of Apartheid in 1990 and subsequent change in government, and in 1997 converted from a co-operative to a company structure. In 2004, KWV negotiated the South African wine industry's largest Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) deal with Phetogo (Pty) Ltd, attaining 25.1% shares. For the first time, KWV products entered the local market with its branded wines and brandies, having previously only been available to international consumers. In 2010, KWV formed a subsidiary of Niveus Investments, part of the HCI black empowerment investment group, and was the only South African producer listed on Drinks International's Most Admired Wine Brands Global register. In October 2016 KWV was acquired by the Vasari group under leadership of Mr Vivian Imerman. Based in London, Vasari is a consumer focussed investment group that acquired the operational assets of KWV for ZAR 1.15 billion. KWV Brandies are regular winners of Best brandy of the world and best brandy and cognac producers of the world accolades. The KWV Headquarters and main production complex are situated in the Cape Winelands in Paarl.

It was derived from the FV430 series of vehicles by converting the FV432 to accommodate a launcher for Swingfire anti-tank guided missiles. It had two firing bins and could carry fourteen missiles, which could be reloaded from inside the vehicle. Instead of using the mounted guidance system a control unit could be deployed and the missiles aimed and fired from up to 100 metres away, allowing the vehicle to remain completely hidden from the enemy; the Swingfire missile was capable of making a ninety-degree turn immediately after firing. When FV438s entered service in the 1970s, they were operated by specialised anti-tank units of the British Infantry and Royal Armoured Corps. In 1977, the anti-tank role was transferred to the Royal Artillery, which formed the FV438s into four independent Royal Horse Artillery batteries, one for each Armoured Division in the British Army of the Rhine. In 1984, the Royal Artillery relinquished the anti-tank role and the FV438s were formed into guided-weapon troops (each of 9 vehicles), one for each Armoured Regiment.

Military service After leaving school, Grylls briefly hiked in the Himalayan mountains of Sikkim and West Bengal. From 1994-1997, he served in the British Army reserves with 21 SAS as a trooper trained in unarmed combat, desert and winter warfare, survival, climbing, parachuting, and explosives. Becoming a survival instructor, he was twice posted to North Africa. His time in the SAS ended as the result of a free fall parachuting accident the year before in Kenya,Bear Grylls at sasspecialairservice.com when his parachute failed to open, breaking three vertebrae. In 2004, Grylls was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Reserve; and in 2013 he was awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Marines Reserve. Expeditions =Everest= On 16 May 1998, Grylls achieved his childhood dream of climbing to the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, 18 months after breaking three vertebrae in a parachuting accident. At 23, he was at the time among the youngest people to have achieved this feat. There is some dispute over whether he was the youngest Briton to have done so, as he was preceded by James Allen, a climber holding dual Australian and British citizenship, who reached the summit in 1995 at age 22.Summit Magazine No. 40, Winter 2005, page 12 The record has since been surpassed by Jake Meyer and then Rob Gauntlett who summitted at age 19. To prepare for climbing at such high altitudes in the Himalayas, in 1997, Grylls became the youngest Briton to climb Ama Dablam, a peak once described by Sir Edmund Hillary as \\"unclimbable\\". =Circumnavigation of the UK= In 2000 Grylls led the team to circumnavigate the British Isles on jet skis, taking about 30 days, to raise money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He also rowed naked in a homemade bathtub along the Thames to raise funds for a friend who lost his legs in a climbing accident. =Crossing the North Atlantic= Three years later, he led a team of five, including his childhood friend, SAS colleague, and Mount Everest climbing partner Mick Crosthwaite, on an unassisted crossing of the north Atlantic Ocean, in an open rigid inflatable boat. Grylls and his team traveled in an eleven-metre-long boat and encountered force 8 gale winds with waves breaking over the boat while passing through icebergs in their journey from Halifax, Nova Scotia to John o' Groats, Scotland. =Dinner party at altitude= In 2005, alongside the balloonist and mountaineer David Hempleman- Adams and Lieutenant Commander Alan Veal, leader of the Royal Navy Freefall Parachute Display Team, Grylls created a world record for the highest open-air formal dinner party, which they did under a hot-air balloon at , dressed in full mess dress and oxygen masks. To train for the event, he made over 200 parachute jumps. This event was in aid of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award and The Prince's Trust. =Paramotoring over the Himalayas= In 2007, Grylls embarked on a record-setting Parajet paramotor in Himalayas near Mount Everest. He took off from , south of the mountain. Grylls reported looking down on the summit during his ascent and coping with temperatures of . He endured dangerously low oxygen levels and eventually reached , almost higher than the previous record of .

During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50 km/h (30 mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.\\"Diary: From Bear\\" , journeyAntarctica2008.com, 6 December 2008. =Longest indoor freefall= Grylls, along with the double amputee Al Hodgson and the Scotsman Freddy MacDonald, set a Guinness world record in 2008 for the longest continuous indoor freefall. The previous record was 1 hour 36 minutes by a US team. Grylls, Hodgson, and MacDonald, using a vertical wind tunnel in Milton Keynes, broke the record by a few seconds. The attempt was in support of the charity Global Angels. =Northwest Passage expedition= In September 2010, Grylls led a team of five to take an ice- breaking rigid-inflatable boat (RIB) through of the ice-strewn Northwest Passage. The expedition intended to raise awareness of the effects of global warming and to raise money for children's charity Global Angels. Career =Books= Grylls' first book, Facing Up (UK)/The Kid Who Climbed Everest (US), described his expedition and achievements climbing to the summit of Mount Everest. His second was Facing the Frozen Ocean. His third book Born Survivor: Bear Grylls was written to accompany the TV series of the same name. He also wrote an extreme guide to outdoor pursuits, titled Bear Grylls Outdoor Adventures.

The name comes from the original rule that a vehicle is purchased for less than NZ$500, and optionally decorated. The event has run since the early 1980s and is organised by the University of Canterbury Engineering Society Inc. (ENSOC). The premise of the event is for student members of ENSOC to purchase and decorate a vehicle before rallying the cars to Dunedin. The vehicles are individually themed and occupants pub crawl over the entire day of driving. This event is characterised by the high level of work performed on the entrants' cars; transforming them from normal motor vehicles into something unique. The event was originally to coincide with the weekend of the annual Canterbury University Engineers v Otago Surveyors rugby match. At this time and well into the 1990s it was known as the \\"Under 500\\". Somewhere along the way it has been transformed into the \\"Undie 500\\", presumably to establish a similar-sounding name to the more famous Indy 500. Since 2003, the number of vehicles was limited to 150. The event used to attract more than 1,000 participants and thousands of spectators. The event was widely reported, attracting national TV news coverage, newspaper, radio and has even featured in Ralph magazine. The New Zealand Police accompany the convoy throughout the trip to ensure both the safety of participants and other road users. Since 2006, when others driving cars not associated with the event began traveling to Dunedin concurrently and rioting, the event has also received much negative publicity due to rioting students and others associated with the event. Some have been charged with offenses including offensive language and breaching the liquor ban the Dunedin City Council had placed. After the 2009 event, the head of the University of Canterbury Students' Association (UCSA) noted that they could not \\"exert authority on those hangers-on or those other students and young people that head to Dunedin to use this as an excuse for violence or anti-social behaviour.\\", and that it was no longer in the interest of students to be associated with those who were causing trouble after the event. Consequently, the 2009 head of the UCSA predicted ENSOC could not run a further event to Dunedin in light of the trouble that would be caused by those non-students who would use it as an excuse for violence and other anti-social behaviour, but appeared not to rule out a similar event heading to a different destination. Many in Dunedin see the event as having been sensationalised by the media, with one local noting the \\"local newspaper will start printing stories a week in advance, and will continue for a week after the event, even if it runs smoothly.\\" Rules Cars were expected to meet the following requirements: * Have a current Warrant of Fitness and Vehicle registration * Be driven by a sober driver In previous years it was also a requirement to have a vehicle under the price of $500, hence the name UNDIE 500. However, due to rising prices and stricter regulations this rule was later overlooked. Prizes Before embarking for Dunedin, cash prizes were awarded for outstanding entries including: * Best Car * Best Dressed Team * Best Mechanical Car * Best Structural Car * Best Engineered Car * Most Politically Incorrect Car * Best Overall Disorder =1994= The winner of best dressed vehicle in 1994 was a 1964 HD Holden Special station wagon cleverly transformed into Thomas The Tank Engine. It featured in an article on the Under 500 in The Timaru Herald newspaper. That year there was a bad snow storm on The Kilmog hill, just north of Dunedin. The local police stopped many of the cars on their way up the hill due to the icy conditions. This vehicle was allowed through as it was explained to the officer, \\"This is a train, not a car\\". =2006= The 2006 event was marred by drunken rioting in the Castle St area of Dunedin; resulting in 30 arrests and a liquor ban subsequently imposed on the main student area over the events weekend. After the incident ENSOC worked with the various local authorities in Ashburton, Timaru, Oamaru and Dunedin to minimise any possible disruption caused to local residents, including paying the Dunedin City Council to tow away any abandoned vehicles.Scoop: ENSOC Undie 500 =2007= Two members of the New Zealand Fire Service dousing an Undie 500 fire on Grange Street in 2007 In 2007 the event saw further drunken rioting in which 69 people were arrested, on a night which one student involved described it as \\"a usual Dunedin Saturday night\\", while Dunedin emergency service workers said it was the city's worst trouble for many years. Crowd estimates were 1,000 ‚Äì 2,000 at the height of the riots. Couches, a mattress and at least two Undie 500 cars were torched on Castle, Dundas, Hyde, Grange, and Leith streets, and police and fire-fighters were pelted with bottles. 9 of the 24 University of Canterbury students arrested were officially registered on the Undie 500, along with 30 Dunedin students and 15 non-students. Subsequently, there have been calls for an end to the event, with the Mayor of Dunedin Peter Chin calling the event 'history'. In response to the rioting, police upgraded charges from disorderly behaviour to the more serious crime of rioting for 21 of the 69 arrested people, which could have resulted in up to 2 years in prison. These charges were later dropped by the police, with ten offenders pleading guilty and six pleading not guilty to lesser offences, resulting in at least one conviction for fifteen people. Furthermore, University of Otago students involved in the rioting also risked being expelled from the university. 31 people were charged at the Dunedin District Court, 22 being convicted (9 on two charges), and 5 receiving diversion. One charge of disorderly likely to cause violence was upheld on appeal to the High Court. The people convicted were forced to pay fines, reparations, donations and court costs exceeding $16,500 (up to $2,000 for some individuals), and received 250 hours community service, in addition to lawyers fees estimated at up to $1,000 to $5,000 each. =2008= Chin later said he expected the event would go ahead for 2008,AUS ‚Äì The Association of University Staff of New Zealand though he soon pulled out of meetings with ENSOC and emergency services. ENSOC had submitted a management plan with bonds and behavioural guarantees for participants, and had planned for a concert for the Saturday night after the official event, which has been the scene of the rioting in recent years. Meetings had been held with concert promoters with the aim of organizing a large event with a budget of over $100,000.Canta, Issue 3, 12 March 2008, pp. 18‚Äì19 Without approval, ENSOC are refusing to condone the 'underground' Undie 500 that they expect to occur. In 2008 the official event was cancelled, but around 100 students from the University of Canterbury travelled to Dunedin in about 40 cars and vans. More than 100 police were rostered on for the event, and had placed checkpoints on the outskirts of Rolleston and the entrance to Dunedin city. The media once again reported the event sparked violence, with police in full riot gear three times charging a group of around 500 students throwing rocks and bottles, before dispersing the crowd in the early hours of 24 August 2008. While police Inspector Dave Campbell noted that the event was not a catalyst for the trouble, with most of those arrested from Otago University or non-students, he also said that to those persons \\"It's quite clear that it [the Undie 500] is seen as a magnet.\\" Around 30 arrests were made, in addition to 3 University of Canterbury and 2 University of Otago students from the previous night. =2009= A man is arrested during riots after the 2009 Undie 500 An official ENSOC charity event ran in 2009, after Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin refused to negotiate with the University of Canterbury Students Association and ENSOC to organise events after the main Undie rally to minimise disorder afterwards. About 600 students from Canterbury participated, bringing more than 1000 cans of food for Dunedin food banks. The \\"Undie Charity Drive\\" has been criticised by Chin as \\"no matter how it is dressed up it is just a pub crawl.\\" While the rally featured decorated cars, costumes and alcohol, new measures such as a good behaviour bond were introduced to address previous concerns. These measures, could, however, only be used to control behaviour by Canterbury University students, not Otago University students or the unemployed. Oamaru, through which the event passes, was \\"proactive\\" (according to their community constable), and organised to deal with any increased littering or other anti- social behaviour as a result of the event. The town experienced no major problems, with only two arrests. The event ran successfully, with partying afterwards becoming chaotic as police in riot gear moved in to be pelted with bottles, bricks and bicycle parts. Over two nights 80 arrests were made ‚Äì around 80% University of Otago students, 10% University of Canterbury students, and 10% not students. In response to the disorder, Chin blamed Christchurch students. Police charged 67 people with a range of offences including breaching the temporary liquor ban, disorderly behaviour, obstruction and burning couches. Prime Minister John Key described the incident as \\"madness\\" and pointed out some students would consequently graduate with criminal convictions. In the aftermath, OUSA president Edwin Darlow pointed out that as there was no way to stop the event, the council should consider alternative events over the weekend to reduce disorder after it finishes, though Chin has consistently refused to consider options ENSOC has proposed. Bystanders complained of being pepper sprayed by police in their own doorways. An 18-year-old Telford Rural Polytechnic student who travelled from Balclutha, specifically to be part of the \\"Undie 500 weekend\\", fell onto a burning couch while trying to jump over it. He was taken to Dunedin Public Hospital suffering burns, and required surgery. In response to the event police minister Judith Collins said on 3 News the rioters were \\"spoilt little rich kids, who think that they are going to be the future leaders of our country, and frankly if they are, God help us\\". Charges against two of those arrested were withdrawn because police lacked valid evidence. On 14 September, the first three of those arrested appeared in court; one a Dunedin student, and two unemployed and employed persons respectively from Dunedin. The day after, a mill-hand and a process worker were convicted of breaching the liquor ban. Of those facing charges, 43 are tertiary students. The largest group was of 27 Otago University students, followed by 18 who are not tertiary students, six of whom were unemployed. On the 18th, one Otago student was convicted of theft for grabbing a police officers hat, valued at $80, for which he would later apologise to the officer. He was fined $500 with court costs of $130. Also convicted were two unemployed men and a shearer. The harshest penalty imposed has been on a 41-year-old unemployed Dunedin man for breaching the City Council liquor ban. Eight people have had charges against them dropped for lack of evidence against them, and two discharged without conviction. One Dunedin student was suspended from the University for swearing at Dunedin University security staff, outside the University property, outside his flat. =2010= In the year 2010 the Undie 500 Charity Drive was denied a liquor licence for an event that included a concert in Seddon. This was a blow to the event as it eventually led to the charity drive being cancelled in 2010.http://www.ensoc.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ENSOC-EMAIL-18.pdf The committee ended up spending funds set asides on helping relief efforts for the Canterbury earthquake. =2011= After several meetings between event organisers ENSOC, the Dunedin police, Christchurch and the Dunedin city council the event was organised as a pub crawl that left from the university and returned to Christchurch. The event was kept off Facebook and the ENSOC website in an effort to keep it out of the media's attention, removing the negative publicity that is normally associated with the event. The event consisted of leaving from the university arts car park, as in previous years, then heading out to the first pub in Yarldhurst. Both the participants and police were well behaved. Following that the event continued further out on to the Canterbury plains, finally ending back at a pub in Templeton, just out of Christchurch. =2017= The name Undie 500 was revitalised in 2017 by former University of Otago student Ryan Hellyer, who created the new annual Undie 500 event as a special event for the Undiecar Championship, a sim racing series run on the iRacing platform. The most recent event in 2018 attracted 33 competitors .

View of the outside, main building on the left, overgrown tower to the right. = Inchiquin Castle = Inchiquin Castle. View from the inside towards the lake. Inchiquin Castle is located on the north side of Lake Inchiquin (in the parish of Kilnaboy). It was possibly begun by Teige-an-Chomhaid O'Brien (d. 1466). In 1542, it belonged to Turlough, son of Murrough, first Baron of Inchiquin. Murrough O'Brien, the fourth Baron, was in possession in 1580. His descendants, the Marquesses of Thomond, derived their title of Earl of Inchiquin from this estate. During the Nine Years' War, Hugh Roe O'Donnell raided Clare and Inchiquin Castle was attacked by one of his lieutenants, Maguire of Fermanagh. During the Confederate Wars Christopher O'Brien, Murrough the Burner's brother, lived here. Murrough's son, Colonel John O'Brien, abandoned Inchiquin towards the end of the 17th century. By then it had deteriorated into a ruin. Today the castle remains a ruin surrounded by pastures. Part of the older castle tower is still extant as is a good portion of the later 17th-century banquet hall. Town twinning Corofin is twinned with Tonqu√©dec in France.

Features include 365 apartments, 121 luxury condominiums, 16 townhomes, a YMCA facility, of retail and restaurant space, of office space, and a 5-level underground parking garage for 829 cars.  History  At that time the Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation, a non-profit coordinator of development in St. Paul's historic warehouse district, had sought to fill Block 40 for some three years. The site on Mears Park just east of the downtown business district represented the keystone in Lowertown's revitalization, and Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation's executive director Weiming Lu had persuaded developers with the concept of a mixed-use development and one tenant, the downtown YMCA. Efforts to put together a project reusing existing properties on the block had fallen through, as had a modest proposal for housing and service retail by the Carley Capital Group of Madison, Wisconsin. The city had already secured an Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) from the federal government for the Carley development, and called for new developers with a three-month deadline looming. Boisclair and Omni Venture, Ltd. the developers of Minneapolis' International Market Square, responded. Robert Boisclair took on the development. Miller, Hanson, Westerbeck & Bell were selected as architects for the project. They had done studies of Block 40 for the Lowertown Corporation and had a history of designing housing for Boisclair which included Lakepoint Tower and the Falls and Pinnacle at Riverplace. Galtier Plaza was named after Father Lucien Galtier, a Roman Catholic priest who has historical involvement with the founding of the city of St. Paul.  Design  Exterior of the Cray Plaza atrium The location and form of the architectural elements was the subject of negotiation between the developer, the city and Lowertown Corporation. In addition, the financial partnerships involved in the project had to be expressed architecturally so that ownership of the complex space could be divided by multiple tenants. The six-story base along the street front was needed to maintain the cornice of the surrounding six-story buildings was dictated by historic and design considerations. The decision to fill out the block to the maximum met economic goals. The housing, proposed as one corner tower cascading to the base, was instead split between two towers. The taller one, the Jackson Tower, falls just under Federal Aviation Administration limits at . The lower one, the Sibley Tower, is located back of the Mears Park facade. The atrium beginning at the building line, became instead a gabled roof extruded beyond the building facade and stepping back to its seven-story peak. The developer wanted it to be wide but it was narrowed to 90 feet. The skyway linking Galtier Plaza and the Farm Credit Bank toward downtown was proposed as a \\"festive\\" design with gabled peaks, lots of glass, and cream and red aluminum trim to match Galtier's. Lowertown's Weiming Lu and the city planning staff stood fast for the standard Vierendeel truss and bronze aluminum. Galtier Plaza opened in 1986.  Project difficulties  The project cost at least $140 million to build, not including the YMCA and other portions. Various parts of the project were funded separately. The rental apartments were funded by bonds sold through the Port Authority to private institutional investors; the YMCA was on a separate parcel; and much of the other private funding came from investors as equity and from Chemical Bank as a loan. There were issues with construction, cost overruns, inadequate financial resources, high interest rates, delays, and strategic errors made in market analysis and design. As the project was delayed, it found difficulty attracting tenants. Eventually, private investors are said to have lost about $42 to $45 million in equity and Chemical Bank is said to have lost about $90 million on their loan. The Port Authority took over the rental apartments after the default on that part of the project‚Äîfor which they had loaned $32 million and which would have cost about $36 million. Excluding the YMCA, rental housing, and the energy plant, the balance of the project (retail, offices, condos, and the parking garage) was sold in 1989 to a Canadian investor in the range of $10 to $12 million. Henry Zaidan's thought to market the condos, and to reposition the retail space from the regional high end target and toward services for the neighborhood and downtown. He relocated the food court to the ground level. After filling the vacant retail and office space during the recession, Zaidan left the Galtier Plaza project in 1992, and in 1996 the holder of the mortgage obtained title through foreclosure, changed the management company and made some nominal improvements before selling Galtier in 1999 to an investor group managed by Wasmer, Schroeder & Company. The Wasmer group invested in an extensive remodeling project, including conversion of much of the vacant retail space into office space. The residential towers at Galtier were sold to Bigos Investments, owned by Ted Bigos, in 2003, and the Wasmer group sold the commercial and parking facilities in 2006 to a group based in California. The commercial portion of Galtier now contains several restaurants, a convenience store, a conference facility, and a credit union, Unity One Credit Union. Retail and office space are about 85% occupied.  Today  Interior of the Cray Plaza building atrium Over the years, the building has seen erratic success, first as a shopping mall, then as an entertainment center, and currently is most notably occupied by a private preparatory academy, various technology companies, an event and presentation facility (carved out of the old movie theaters), a restaurant, and a food court. In the summer of 2009 it was announced that the naming rights to Galtier Plaza had been purchased, and the building would become known as Cray Plaza, as the building's new \\"anchor\\" tenant was Cray Inc. The complex won the award for the first place design award excellence from Development Design Group, First Place from National Mall Monitor Center's of Excellence, and Signs of the Times award for electric sign graphics.

The force's headquarters were in Fettes Avenue, Edinburgh. Lothian and Borders Police was formed on 16 May 1975 by an amalgamation of Berwick, Roxburgh and Selkirk Constabulary, Edinburgh City Police and The Lothians and Peebles Constabulary. The force had 2,905 officers and 1,384 support staff as of March 2008. The force's last Chief Constable was David Strang who replaced Paddy Tomkins on 29 March 2007. An Act of the Scottish Parliament, the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, created a single Police Service of Scotland‚Äîknown as Police Scotland‚Äîwith effect from 1 April 2013.STV News , 30 October 2012 This merged the eight former regional police forces in Scotland (including Lothian & Borders Police), together with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single service covering the whole of Scotland. Police Scotland has its headquarters at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan in Fife. Divisions The Lothian and Borders Police area stretched from Blackridge in the west to Newcastleton in the south. It was split into four territorial divisions, and several other non-territorial divisions for specialist and administrative roles. =Territorial Divisions= A Division covered the City of Edinburgh, and was created in 2002 following the amalgamation of the City of Edinburgh's three previous divisions. It was the largest territorial division in terms of manpower and population. Its headquarters were St Leonards Police Station. E Division covered East Lothian and Midlothian, stretching from the Edinburgh City Bypass to Dunbar in the east. Its headquarters were in Dalkeith. F Division covered West Lothian with its headquarters in Livingston. The division's officers were sometimes referred to as \\"F Troop\\", although this was regarded as offensive as \\"F Troop\\" was originally a comedy set in the old west of America (first shown 14 September 1965) that followed a group of misfit cavalrymen in the U.S. Army. G Division was the largest territorial division in Lothian and Borders Police and covered the Scottish Borders. It was approximately twice the size of all the other divisions combined, bordering England in the south. It covered a predominantly rural area featuring rolling country side and isolated population areas. Its headquarters were in Hawick. =Non-territorial Divisions= C Division (Corporate Services) comprised such departments as Corporate Communications, Safer Communities, Complaints and Conduct and Business Improvement. H Division was concerned with Personnel and Human Resources functions. J Division was concerned with Secondments. N Division was styled the \\"Criminal Justice Administration Department\\". O Division (Operations) provided specialist operations support to the force. It was predominantly made up of the Roads Policing Units (traffic) which were based at the headquarters of each division. They also provided specialist Firearms and Public Order (Riot Police) support to all divisions. Also within O Division were the forces Dog Handlers. O Division also included The Force Communications Centre (FCC). P Division was responsible for training and career development. Training of probationary constables was carried out jointly by the Scottish Police College based at Tulliallan Castle, \\"on the job\\" in the force area. Officers transferring from other Scottish forces were not required to attend the college, unlike those transferring from the rest of the United Kingdom, who were required to attend a conversion course to allow for adjustment to Scots law. S Division was responsible for the financial management of the force. X Division provided investigative support to the entire force. While detectives may have been allocated to assist other divisions as their main role as detectives, they could be pooled to provide assistance whether their specialist skills are required. Also known as the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) they were the detectives of the force and investigated major crimes as well as everyday crimes such as housebreaking. Z Division was styled the \\"Central Services Department\\".

Supersecondary structures can act as nucleations in the process of protein folding.  Examples  = Helix supersecondary structures = Image of a helix hairpin  Helix hairpin  A helix hairpin, also known as an alpha-alpha hairpin, is composed of two antiparallel alpha helices connected by a loop of two or more residues. True to its name, it resembles a hairpin. A longer loop has a greater number of possible conformations. If short strands connect the helices, then the individual helices will pack together through their hydrophobic residues. The function of a helix hairpin is unknown; however, a four helix bundle is composed of two helix hairpins, which have important ligand binding sites.  Helix corner  A helix corner, also called an alpha-alpha corner, has two alpha helices almost at right angles to each other connected by a short 'loop'. This loop is formed from a hydrophobic residue. The function of a helix corner is unknown.  Helix-loop-helix  The helix-loop-helix structure has two helices connected by a 'loop'. These are fairly common and usually bind ligands. For example, calcium binds with the carboxyl groups of the side chains within the loop region between the helices.  Helix-turn-helix  The helix-turn- helix motif is important for DNA binding and is therefore in many DNA binding proteins. = Beta sheet supersecondary structures = Image of a beta hairpin  Beta hairpin  A beta hairpin is a common supersecondary motif composed of two anti-parallel beta strands connected by a loop. The structure resembles a hairpin and is often found in globular proteins. The loop between the beta strands can range anywhere from 2 to 16 residues. However, most loops contain less than seven residues. Residues in beta hairpins with loops of 2, 3, or 4 residues have distinct conformations. However, a wide range of conformations can be seen in longer loops, which are sometimes referred to as 'random coils'. A beta-meander consists of consecutive antiparallel-beta strands linked by hairpins. Two residue loops are called beta turns or reverse turns. Type I' and Type II' reverse turns occur most frequently because they have less steric hindrance than Type I and Type II turns. The function of beta hairpins is unknown.  Beta corner  A beta hairpin has two antiparallel beta strands that are at about a 90 degree angle to each other. It is formed by a beta hairpin changing direction with one strand having a glycine residue and the other strand having a beta bulge. Beta corners have no known function.  Greek key motif  A Greek key motif has four features: # Four sequentially connected beta strands are adjacent to, much not necessarily geometrically aligned with, each other. # The beta sheet is anti-parallel, and alternate strands run in opposite directions. # The first strand and last strand are next to each other and bonded by hydrogen bonds. # Connecting loops can be long and include other secondary structures. The Greek key motif has its name because the structure looks like the pattern seen on Greek urns. This motif has no known function. = Other = Œ≤-sheets (composed of multiple hydrogen-bonded individual Œ≤-strands) are sometimes considered a secondary or supersecondary structure. = Mixed supersecondary structures =  Beta- alpha-beta motifs  A beta-alpha-beta motif is composed of two beta strands joined by an alpha helix through connecting loops. The beta strands are parallel, and the helix is also almost parallel to the strands. This structure can be seen in almost all proteins with parallel strands. The loops connecting the beta strands and alpha helix can vary in length and often binds ligands. Beta-alpha-beta helices can be either left-handed or right-handed. When viewed from the N-terminal side of the beta strandes, so that one strand is on top of the other, a left-handed beta-alpha-beta motif has the alpha helix on the left side of the beta strands. The more common right-handed motif would have an alpha helix on the right side of the plane containing the beta strands. Two Rossmann folds in Cryptosporidium parvum lactate dehydrogenase, with NAD+ bound.  Rossman fold  Rossman folds, named after Michael Rossman, consist of 3 beta strands and 2 helices in an alternating fashion: beta strand, helix, beta strand, helix, beta strand. This motif tends to reverse the direction of the chain within a protein. Rossman folds have an important biological function in binding nucleotides such as NAD within most dehydrogenases.

He is primarily known for his work on Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Thysanoptera, but worked on all insect orders and on many aspects of entomology. Haliday was born in Holywood, County Down, Ireland. A boyhood friend of Robert Templeton, he divided his time between Ireland and Lucca, where he co-founded the Italian Entomological Society with Camillo Rondani and Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Belfast Natural History Society, the Microscopical Society of London, and the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science, as well as a fellow of the (now Royal) Entomological Society of London. Alexander Haliday was among the greatest dipterists of the 19th century and one of the most renowned British entomologists. His achievements were in four main fields: description, higher taxonomy, synonymy, and biology. He erected many major taxa including the order Thysanoptera and the families Mymaridae and Ichneumonidae. Biography =Early life= Alexander Henry Haliday was born in Clifden, Holywood, a small seaside town in County Down, Ireland on 21 November 1806. He was the eldest child of Dr William Haliday (1763-1836) and Marion Webster.Anon., 1837 The Bible Christian designed to advocate the sufficiency of scripture and the right of private judgement, in matters of faith.

The Haliday family was related to the wealthy Luccan Pisani family, whom Haliday visited often throughout his life. =Education= Haliday began his education at the Belfast Academical Institution, a school that had strong leanings towards natural history. Haliday studied Classics when he was twelve, Arithmetic when he was fourteen, and Mathematics when he was sixteen. He learned several other subjects, including natural history from George Crawford Hyndman. Haliday left the Belfast Academical Institution and the family home in nearby Holywood at fifteen, moving to Dublin where he entered Trinity College in 1822. He graduated in 1827, and was awarded a gold medal in classics. Haliday then went to Paris, where he stayed for almost a year. =Career= From 1825 to 1840, Haliday spent most of his time in Dublin. He returned frequently to Clifden however, and spent much of his time in London and sometimes visited Lucca, where he stayed with the Pisani family. Haliday also spent much of his time collecting insects across England, most often with Francis Walker and John CurtisOrdish, G., 1974 John Curtis and the Pioneering of Pest Control. Reading: Osprey at the Darent river and Southgate.Curtis, J., 1824-1840 British Entomology, being illustrations and descriptions of the genera of insects found in Great Britain and Ireland; containing coloured figures from nature of the most rare and beautiful species, and in many instances of the plants upon which they are found London, the Author In 1835, he joined William Thompson on a tour of England and Wales which began in London at the British Museum and the Zoological Gardens and included visits to Matlock, the Lake District (Vale of Newlands), Crummock Water, Llangollen, and Snowdon. From 1841 and 1848, Haliday spent most, if not all, of his time away from Ireland, mainly at the Pisani family home in Lucca. In 1842, he was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim and lived in the townland of Ballyhowne in the parish of Carnmoney. From 1854 to 1860, after having moved back to Dublin, Haliday was employed as an Invertebrate Zoology lecturer at the University of Dublin. During these years, he also edited parts of the Natural History Review, became a founding member of the Dublin University Geological Society, gave lectures at meetings of the Dublin University Zoological Association (Trinity College), and curated the insect collections at the same University. He also made regular visits to London, usually staying with Henry Tibbats Stainton. These visits often coincided with meetings of the Entomological Society of London. =Later life= In February 1862, Haliday moved to Lucca. Following a trip to Sicily, he moved into Villa Pisani with his cousin, Mme. Pisani, and her family. Expeditions and meetings with entomologists became much more frequent. From 1862 until his death, Haliday traveled across Italy collecting insects, mainly in the North (Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta Valley, and Tuscany), although he made two trips to Sicily. Various trips to Switzerland, France, and Bavaria followed, and in 1865, with Edward Perceval Wright, he made an entomological expedition to Portugal. In 1868 and 1870, he toured Sicily with Wright. Haliday died in Bagni di Lucca in 1870 and is buried there in the English Cemetery. =Society memberships= Haliday was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Microscopical Society of London, the Entomological Society of London, the Linnean Society of London, the Dublin University Zoological Association, the Dublin University Geological Society, the Italian Entomological Society, the Entomological Society of Stettin, and the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science. Technique Haliday worked mainly with very small insects. Study of the tiny parts required dissection, glass slide mounting, and a very high quality microscope. He acquired his equipment from the London microscopist Andrew Pritchard. Whole specimens were mounted on card using gum, the card being transfixed by an entomological pin of German manufacture. Since the descriptions were necessarily based on more than one specimen are sometimes ambiguous (based on more than one species). Collecting and general methodology followed the instructions given by George Samouelle in The entomologist's useful compendium; or, An introduction to the knowledge of British insects, comprising the best means of obtaining and preserving them, and a description of the apparatus generally used and Abel Ingpen's manual Instructions for collecting, rearing, and preserving British & foreign insects: also for collecting and preserving crustacea and shells. On collecting trips he used a Coddington lens. Collection Haliday's collection comprising 78 boxes was presented by Trinity of Ireland College to the Museum of Science and Art (now the National Museum of Ireland) in 1882, twelve years after Haliday's death. The dating of the parts of the collection is confusing but the bulk of it was put together before 1860. Although the collection was damaged, and substantial portions of it have been lost, it remains a very large insect collection. The bulk of the material collected by Haliday himself is in the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera. The undamaged Hymenoptera material is laid out in numbered blocks of systematised taxa, usually disparate groups (representing species) disposed below the appropriate generic name. Most of Haliday's specimens are from Ireland, however several of them are from England, Scotland, and Italy. In addition to the specialist collections of Hymenoptera and Diptera, there is Haliday's own general collection (mainly Coleoptera), and a large body of material added to the collection by other entomologists. The largest single source of donations to the collection was Francis Walker, the London entomologist with whom Haliday had a career-long association. The Walker addition was made up mostly of Hymenoptera and Diptera insects, however it contained insects of most other orders, especially Coleoptera and Thysanoptera. Other collectors represented are John Curtis, James Charles Dale, Jean Antoine Dours, Arnold F√∂rster or Foerster, Hermann Loew, Fernandino Maria Piccioli, G.T.Rudd, William Wilson Saunders, JamesFrancis Stephens, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston. The collection also includes a considerable amount of material taken by Charles Darwin on the Beagle Voyage.Nash, R, and O'Connor, J.P, 1982 Notes on the entomological collection of A. H.

Men of a Punjab Regiment march out of the jungle near Pyagle, Burma, 1945. The Punjab Regiment is second oldest regiments still in service in the Indian Army, and is the most senior regional infantry regiment. It was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army in 1947 and has taken part in various battles and wars since, winning numerous honours for the same. Prior to independence and partition there were a number of \\"Punjab Regiments\\" in the British Indian Army. These were amalgamated to form six regiments: the 1st Punjab Regiment, the 2nd Punjab Regiment, the 8th Punjab Regiment, the 14th Punjab Regiment, the 15th Punjab Regiment and the 16th Punjab Regiment. At the onset of independence in 1947, the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments went over to the newly raised Pakistan Army, while the 2nd Punjab Regiment was retained in the Indian Army. Troops were transferred between regiments based on whether the soldiers would be a part of Pakistan or India. History The Punjab Regiment is one of the oldest in the Indian Army. The first battalion which today constitutes this regiment was raised in 1805, by the then Maharaja of Patiala. The first four British-raised battalions of what later became the 2nd Punjab Regiment and finally the Punjab Regiment, were raised during the hostilities in the Carnatic in South India between 1761 and 1776. The first and second battalions have been moved to other regiments and the fourth battalion was disbanded. The third battalion still continues as part of the regiment. The numbers and titles of the battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The names changed from Coast Sepoys to Carnatic Infantry, Madras Native Infantry, Punjabis and finally to the Punjab Regiment. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British applied the martial races theory and north Indian troops replaced the south Indians, the regiment eventually being renamed as the Punjab Regiment. The 1st battalion of the 2nd Punjab Regiment initially formed part of the 44th Airborne Division in an airborne role on the disbandment of the Parachute Regiment in 1946 and was called 1st battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment (Para). The unit retained most of the Punjab Regiment's uniform, but donned the maroon beret, qualification wings and allied insignias of airborne forces. In 1952, when the Parachute Regiment was re-raised and a Regimental Centre formed, the 1st battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment (Para) became the first battalion of the Parachute Regiment and was renamed as the 1st battalion, Parachute Regiment (Punjab). The uniform changed to the Parachute Regiment's, but the battalion retained the Punjab Regiment's hackle on its headgear. In 1951, four experienced battalions of the former princely states of Punjab joined the Regiment. These were a battalion each from the Jind and Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the Punjab Regiment. Additional battalions have been raised since 1963. =15 Punjab= 15 Punjab (formerly First Patiala) completed 300 years of service on 13 April 2005. The battalion was raised on the auspicious Baisakhi day in 1705 by Baba Alla Singh, the founder of Patiala State. It was the first battalion of the state forces of the Maharaja of Patiala. Apart from being the oldest infantry battalion in the Indian Army, 15 Punjab also has the proud distinction of being the second highest decorated battalion of the Army, with 22 Battle Honours, one Theatre Honour (Punjab) and numerous gallantry awards. The battalion took part in numerous campaigns in India and abroad, carving a mark for itself in every operation. In May 1900, the battalion was re-designated as First Patiala Imperial Service Infantry (Rajindra Sikh). During World War I, it took part in operations in the Middle East under the British Expeditionary Force. In 1932, the battalion was re-designated as First Patiala Rajindra Sikh Infantry. During World War II, the battalion participated in the Burma Campaign. It successfully cut off the Japanese lines of communication, thus halting their advance towards India. Thereafter, the battalion sailed to Port Dickson for action in Malaya and Batavia (now Java). =2 Punjab= 2 Punjab (now 1st battalion, Brigade of the Guards) was raised in 1762 as the tenth battalion of the Coastal Sepoys and has been redesignated eighteen times since then. The troop composition of the unit was changed to a North Zone Battalion in 1902 and the unit was redesignated as 69 Punjab. In 1922, the unit was redesignated as 2nd battalion, 2 Punjab Regiment. The battalion, by virtue of its seniority and efficiency, was handpicked by the then Chief of the Army Staff, Gen. (later Field Marshal) K. M. Cariappa to be redesignated as 1st battalion, Brigade of the Guards, in April 1951. Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) Shivinder Singh was the first commanding officer of the battalion. Since then, 22 commanding officers have commanded the battalion. Of them, Lt. Col. M.C.S Menon, Lt. Col. Sehdev Sahgal and Lt. Col. P.P Singh retired as Generals. UN Peacekeeping Operations In recent years, the Punjab Regiment has contributed towards UN peacekeeping missions by sending six of its battalions overseas: 3 Punjab to Gaza, 14 Punjab to Angola, 15 and 26 Punjab to Lebanon and 16 and 24 Punjab to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Regimental Centre The Regimental Centre was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and its present location in Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand, in 1976.

Class Composition The original battalions of the regiment that were transferred to India after 1947 were composed primarily of Jatt Sikh and Dogra soldiers who belonged to the districts of Punjab that were given to Pakistan. However the second and third generations for the regiment were recruited both among this refugee community but recruitment was opened up to all castes and communities of Punjab, Jammu and Himachal Pradesh in the late 1960s. The regiment currently consists of Dogras and Sikhs primarily drawn from north Indian regions of Jammu, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. However, as an exception, two regular battalions (19 and 27 Punjab) have troops from other Indian castes as well. Key Battles =Battle of Longewala= During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, A Company (reinforced) of the 23rd battalion, Punjab Regiment, consisting of about 120 soldiers under the command of Major (later Brigadier) Kuldip Singh Chandpuri, fought off an assault by a brigade of the Pakistan Army. The battle was fought at the desert border post of Longewala, Rajasthan. The unit fought during the last five hours of the night of 5 December 1971 unsupported as the Indian Air Force aircraft at the time did not have night attack capabilities. For his leadership during the battle, Maj. Chandpuri was decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest gallantry award in India. Regimental Insignia The regiment is perhaps the only infantry regiment with naval galley as an insignia, anywhere. It was awarded to 69th Punjabis (later 2nd Punjab) in recognition of the readiness to serve overseas, after the battalion had fought in eight overseas campaigns by 1824.

The castle, which was one of the last fortifications to be built by the native Princes of Wales, was abandoned at the beginning of the invasion of Wales by Edward I in 1277. Its construction, using locally quarried sandstone, appears to have continued piecemeal over many years and may have not been completed. On taking the castle, the English Crown gave it little military value and allowed it to fall into ruin. Ewloe was sited on high ground within Tegeingl, a cantref in the lands of North East Wales (Welsh Perfeddwlad). Standing near the Chester road, it maintained a strategic position near the Wales‚ÄìEngland border. The castle is located on a steeply-sloped promontory within a forested valley. It overlooks the junction of two streams with higher ground to the south. Layout Ewloe Castle combines features from both motte-and-bailey and enclosure castles. An asymmetrical curtain wall ‚Äì with parapets ‚Äì encloses two courtyards. A rock- cut neck ditch defends the southern side of the castle. In the upper triangular inner ward is a D-shaped tower known as the \\"Welsh keep\\". This stands on a stone outcrop that forms the motte; it has a stone revetment around its base (a basic Chemise). The lower outer ward is enclosed by two separate sections of wall that meet at a circular fortified tower, which stands upon a rocky knoll. As the curtain walls are not joined together, ladders would have had to be used to reach their parapets. No gateways connected the inner ward to the outer courtyard. Access into Ewloe Castle was entirely via wooden ramps. The outer ward had several wooden buildings. An external defensive rampart occupies the higher ground to the south of the castle above the neck ditch. Within the inner ward is a D-shaped (or horseshoe-shaped) tower known as the \\"Welsh Keep\\". Although a flight of stairs lead up to a first floor gateway ‚Äì a similarity shared with contemporary military architecture, the shape of the tower does not conform with keeps of the later Plantagenet period. D-shaped towers usually projected out from a wall or gatehouse but at Ewloe the castle builders placed the tower/keep on a motte in the upper ward surrounded by its own curtain wall. This feature has precedence in Welsh military architecture. Llywelyn the Great built a similar D-shaped tower at Castell y Bere at Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd in the 1220s. The tower's outer walls ‚Äì which are at their base ‚Äì rose to about . They were higher than the upper storey to protect its pitched roof from projectiles. A parapet ran around the top of the tower. Spaces in the stonework show where storage slots were placed in the upper roof spaces. The tower had a single first floor hall that stood above a lower ground floor chamber. Defensive arrowslits were placed on the curved sides of the tower. The flat side, which overlooks the outer ward, has a Romanesque window. History =Background= Ewloe Castle, which was built around 1257, is a relic of a brief triumph that the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had over the English Crown and the Anglo-Norman Marcher Lords in the mid 13th century. Until then, this part of north east Wales had been the starting point for repeated Norman invasions of Gwynedd for more than 150 years. But beginning in the early 1230s, the Princes of Gwynedd had started to gain the upper hand against the Anglo-Normans and Plantagenets who had taken territory in North Wales. Eventually by the late 1250s, the Welsh had reached Ewloe retaking lands up to the England‚ÄìWales border. A fortification had existed on or near the site since the Battle of Ewloe () in 1157, when the Welsh successfully ambushed an English force under the command of Henry II (as they marched to Twthill at Rhuddlan). The English king only narrowly avoiding being killed himself having been rescued by Roger, Earl of Hertford. =Construction= In 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had work begin on the castle. The fortification incorporated previous work undertaken by both Owain Gwynedd and Llywelyn the Great. It was built from locally quarried sandstone. There are no records to say when construction ended, however, its design ‚Äì such as the D-shaped Welsh Keep ‚Äì suggest it was conceived and built entirely by a Welsh workforce. Debate varies on whether Ewloe was intended to be an actual defensive fortification or a hunting lodge for Welsh nobility. =Demise= In July 1277, Edward I began the first Welsh War by marching his forces out of the castle at Chester and up the west coast of the Dee Estuary. After an advanced base was established at Flint (a day's travel from Chester), building work immediately began on Flint Castle. Ewloe Castle is not mentioned in chronicles of the 1277 invasion suggesting the Welsh had abandoned the area; retreating to stronger defensive positions along the Clwydian Hills further to the west. As Edward I's castles at Flint and Rhuddlan could be provisioned by sea, Ewloe was never used by the English military. The only contemporary reference to the Ewloe Castle is in the Chester Plea Rolls that mentions a report sent to Edward II in 1311. The Justice of Chester wrote to the King regarding the history of the manor at Ewloe from the middle of the 12th century. The rolls record that by 1257 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had regained Ewloe from the English and built a castle in the wood; noting in 1311 that much of the castle was still standing. By the late medieval period, the site was in ruins. Much of the castle's dressed stone work from its curtain walls and Keep were removed for construction material around Mold and Connah's Quay. Preservation Ewloe Castle, which is a Grade I listed building, is incorporated within Wepre Park; a country park managed by Flintshire County Council. The castle is under the care of Cadw ‚Äì the national heritage agency for Wales. It can be reached by footpaths through Wepre Woods. Public access is free. In November 2009, the castle was among five lots of farmland and woodland put up for sale by Flintshire County Council. The local authority stressed Ewloe and the site it occupies were protected from any development. It was sold at auction to an anonymous farmer along with of surrounding land for ¬£122,000.

Preparation and production Beaufort is produced in the Beaufortain, Tarentaise and Maurienne valleys, as well as parts of the Val d'Arly valley, all located on 450,000 hectares of the Savoie region. The cheese is prepared using of milk for every of cheese desired. The milk used in one variety comes from the Tarine or Abondance cows that graze in the Alps. To make Beaufort, the milk is first heated and then cast into a beechwood hoop or mold which gives the cheese its distinctive concave shape. It is pressed for 24 hours, taken out of the hoops and then cooled for another 24 hours. Once cooled, it is soaked in brine and then stored on spruce shelves for one to two months. During this part of the process, one side of the cheese is hand-salted each morning, then turned over and massaged each afternoon. Once the cheese rind has reached a level of maturity, the cheese is smear-ripened with a mixture called morge which produces its strong flavour and pale yellow rind.Fox, Patrick.

It is named after The Dodo character of Alice in Wonderland. The conjecture was introduced by Saul Rosenzweig in 1936, drawing on imagery from Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but only came into prominence with the emergence of new research evidence in the 1970s.. The importance of the continuing debate surrounding the Dodo bird verdict stems from its implications for professionals involved in the field of psychotherapy and the psychotherapies made available to clients. History . The Dodo bird verdict terminology was coined by Saul Rosenzweig in 1936 to illustrate the notion that all therapies are equally effective... Rosenzweig borrowed the phrase from Lewis Carroll's 1865 book, Alice in Wonderland, wherein a number of characters become wet and, in order to dry themselves, the Dodo Bird decided to issue a competition: everyone was to run around the lake until they were dry. Nobody cared to measure how far each person had run, nor how long. When they asked the Dodo who had won, he thought long and hard and then said, \\"Everybody has won and all must have prizes.\\" In the case of psychotherapies, Rosenzweig argued that common factors were more important than specific technical differences, so that (on the Dodo bird conjecture) all therapies are winners; they all produce equally effective outcomes. The Dodo bird debate only took flight in 1975 when Lester Luborsky, Barton Singer and Lise Luborsky reported the results of one of the first comparative studies demonstrating few significant differences in the outcomes among different psychotherapies. This study spurred a plethora of new studies in both opposition to and support of the Dodo bird verdict.. The Dodo bird debate, in brief, is focused on whether or not the specific components of different treatments lead some treatments to outperform other treatments for specific disorders. Supporters of the Dodo bird verdict contend that all psychotherapies are equivalent because of \\"common factors\\" that are shared in all treatments (i.e., having a relationship with a therapist who is warm, respectful, and has high expectations for client success)... In contrast, critics of the Dodo bird verdict would argue that the specific techniques used in different therapies are important, and all therapies do not produce equivalent outcomes for specific disorders. Support Common factors theory states that if certain therapies in psychology are equally effective, it is because of the common factors they share. The most important causal agents in treatment are the common factors; the specific techniques that are unique to treatment strategies have only minor importance...... There is research to support common factors theory. One common factor is the client‚Äìtherapist interaction, also known as the therapeutic alliance. A 1992 paper by Lambert showed that nearly 40 percent of the improvement in psychotherapy is from these client‚Äìtherapist variables.. Other researchers have further analyzed the importance of client‚Äìtherapist variables in treatment. They found that improvement in the patient was due to extra- therapeutic factors, for example patients' thought processes. Data shows that patients with more positive attitudes will have a better chance of experiencing clinical improvement, regardless of the therapist's actions.. Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of many studies of psychotherapy, Wampold et al. 2002, found that 7% of the variability in treatment outcome was due to the therapeutic alliance whereas 1% of the variability was due to a specific treatment..... The therapist's attitude is also a very important causal agent in positive patient change. Najavits and Strupp (1994) demonstrated that a positive, warm, caring, and genuine therapist generated statistically significant differences in patient outcome.. Wampold et al. 2002, also found that nearly 70% of the variability in treatment outcome was due to the therapist's attitude toward the efficacy of the treatment. Specific components of therapy are concluded to be relatively frivolous when compared with the more profound and directly patient affecting common factors. Researchers have studied common factors in detail. Grencavage and Norcross (1990) identified 35 common factors in published sources. The identified common factors were categorized into five main groups: client characteristics, therapist qualities, change processes, treatment structures and relationship elements. Examples of some of the common factors included within these broad categories are persuasion, a healing setting, engagement, the use of rituals and techniques, suggestion, and emotional learning. Tracey et al. 2003, examined deeper relationships among the categories and common factors. They concluded that there are two dimensions of therapy: feeling and thinking. Within each of the two dimensions are three clusters: bond, information, and role.. Data provide evidence for the Dodo bird verdict. Generally speaking, common factors are responsible for patient improvement instead of any component of a specific treatment. Researchers such as Wampold and Luborsky continue to support this claim in recent articles published in the Behavioral Therapist. Wampold et al. 2010 refutes claims made by Siev et al. 2009 that Wampold 2009 made errors in research. Wampold et al. 2009, suggests that people need to \\"accept the importance of the alliance and therapists and remain committed to developing and improving treatments.\\" Wampold continues by saying that techniques could be beneficial in psychotherapy because they are the easiest variables to manipulate. These variables can act to change alliance and other common factors. Common factors can then be closely monitored and carefully distributed to patients via the therapist. Some researchers have pointed out that there are many reasons to study common factors among different psychotherapies, and some of those reasons may have nothing to do with the Dodo bird verdict. Regardless of whether or not certain psychotherapies are roughly equally effective, studying the commonalities among treatments can lead to a better understanding of why the treatments are effective. Opposition In opposition to the Dodo bird verdict, there are a growing number of studies demonstrating that some treatments produce better outcomes for particular disorders when compared to other treatments.. Here, in contrast to the common factor theory, specific components of the therapy have shown predictive power... The most compelling evidence against the Dodo bird verdict is illustrated by the research done on anxiety disorders. Many studies have found specific treatment modalities to be beneficial when treating anxiety disorders, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Albeit, other studies do not show evidence for cognitive-behavioural and focus on different topics. . CBT uses techniques from both cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy to modify maladaptive thoughts and behaviors. One challenge to the opposition, however, is that some studies were conducted with waiting lists or against medication and criticism can arise as the therapeutic relationship is known to be a factor which influences outcomes. This means the control group may not experience the human condition, whereby the experimental group have an advantage when analysing differences. In addition, comparator trials with other modalities have been known to have unfair training standards between therapies, with some counsellors being given brief workshops over several days to evaluate the efficacy of an approach during trials. Humanistic therapies are also notably difficult to examine due to having less measurable factors that do not fare well under randomised controlled trials. Many of the more extensive studies using different research methodologies with larger sample sizes are overlooked for the perceived gold standard in research. Cognitive- behavioural therapy has indeed been the most examined counselling method; however, to visualise this, you may wish to see them as the big fish in a small pond. Numerous meta-analyses have shown that CBT yields significantly superior results in the treatment of psychological disorders, most notably, anxiety disorders. However, CBT also plays a positive role in treating depression, eating disorders, substance abuse disorders, and obsessive- compulsive disorder. In meta-analytic reviews, there is generally a larger effect size when CBT is used to treat anxiety disorders. Recent studies show that when treating generalized anxiety disorder, CBT generated an effect size of 0.51, which indicates a medium effect. That is a much larger effect compared to supportive therapy and other treatments. Similarly, when treating social anxiety disorder, CBT produced an effect size of 0.62, which again supports the evidence that CBT does in fact yield significantly better results than other therapies. Those supporting the Dodo bird verdict often use meta- analyses to compare multiple treatments in order to illustrate that these treatments have no really significant differences. Some critics claim that if comparisons are made between treatments that already have empirical support (empirically supported treatments, or ESTs) then this will tend to reduce estimates of variability. Nonetheless, Wampold's criteria for including treatments in meta analyses of treatment variability do not require prior empirical support; rather, they must be \\"intended to be therapeutic\\". Research supporting differences among different treatments for specific disorders is now reflected in the latest EST guidelines. ESTs are developed from multiple control trial tests to evaluate which therapies yield the best results for specific disorders. These disorders include, but are not limited to, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD. According to the Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association (APA), psychologists and therapists have an obligation to avoid harming their clients in any way. ESTs are a major component in this movement. By using specific therapies clinically proven to improve certain disorders, therapists are avoiding further damage to their patients. However, supporting the idea of ESTs inevitably implies that some therapies are in fact more efficacious than others for particular disorders. There is also research suggesting that some treatments might be harmful. Indeed, \\"if psychotherapy is powerful enough to do good, it may be powerful enough to do harm\\". Some psychotherapies can be labeled as unhelpful, meaning they give no assistance, while others fall under the category of harmful, meaning they are actually damaging or dangerous to the patient. When identifying a \\"harmful\\" treatment it is important to note the distinction between \\"harm that can be caused by a disorder and harm that can be caused by the application of a treatment\\". The negative outcomes of some psychotherapies are becoming an alarming reality in the field of clinical psychology.Bergin, AE (1971). The evaluation of therapeutic outcomes. Handbook of psychotherapy and behavior change, 217‚Äì70 Studies have shown that individuals exhibited negative responses to treatment in some substance abuse work, some types of grief therapy, and certain therapeutic techniques with trauma and PTSD patients. While those studies that support the Dodo bird verdict focus on the importance of building a client‚Äìtherapist relationship, some studies have \\"identified a number of other relationship factors that may interfere with or negatively impact therapeutic change\\".. The emerging evidence to the effect that there are possibly harmful psychotherapies is not only contradictory to the \\"all therapies are equal\\" stance of the Dodo bird verdict, but may also point out problems implicating the APA's Code of Ethics. Many meta-analyses show that there are treatments that do yield more positive outcomes for specific disorders. However, proof that some treatments actually harm patients instead of helping them further erodes support for the Dodo bird verdict. Issues in testing A considerable amount of the controversy about the Dodo bird verdict relates to the meta-analytic methods used in research.. These generate a lack of clear psychotherapeutic evidence for the support of either side in the debate. Meta-analytic studies have compared the effect sizes of different treatments, but have not been reliable in finding a consistent effect size. This could be because of several confounding variables. For example, many researchers are said to \\"have an agenda\\" when conducting meta-analyses, cherry-picking experiments they want to use in their study in order to produce the results they want. This pre-determined skewing results in unfair representations of the research. \\"Agenda\\"-based meta- analyses are confounded with the researcher's political, social, and economical opinions. Since psychologists are given the power to choose which studies are used in a meta-analysis, personal biases are involved, and the meta-analysis will produce biased results if the researcher is not careful in controlling for his or her own opinions.. Researchers opposing the Dodo bird verdict have found Dodo bird supporters' meta-analyses to be \\"agenda\\"-based and highly subjective.. Arguments have proposed that meta-analyses could possibly produce misleading results because of the type of studies combined in the comparison.... In Paul Crits-Christoph's review of Wampold et al.'s (1997) comparative study, a work that supported the Dodo bird verdict, he concluded that out of the 114 articles used in the study, 79 of them involve similar comparative tests.. Some meta-analyses constructed are not sensitive to the subtle distinctions between treatment effects, especially among comparative studies of highly similar treatments... Dodo bird supporting researchers have found anti-Dodo bird supporters' research to also be \\"agenda\\"-based. For example, Wampold (2009) found Siev et al.'s (2007) study whose research for significance of CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) versus RT (Rational Therapy) was resting on one experiment with an uncharacteristically large effect size (1.02) by Clark et al. (1994).. Wampold found this effect size to be invalid because of the internal biases of the study. When this flawed experiment was removed from the analysis, the effect size was not statistically significant for the use of CBT over RT in panic disorder therapy. Against this research, in support of the anti-Dodo bird verdict, Chambless (2002) stated that \\"errors in data analysis, exclusion of research on many types of clients, faulty generalization to comparisons between therapies that have never been made, and erroneous sorts of treatments for all sorts of problems can be assumed to represent the difference between any two types of treatment for a given problem.\\". Clearly, if meta-analyses are to be taken seriously, they need to be conducted carefully and objectively. In support of the anti-Dodo bird side, Hunsley (2007) says that when \\"measurement quality is controlled for and when treatments are appropriately categorized, there is consistent evidence in both treatment outcome and comparative treatment research that cognitive and behavioral treatments are superior to other treatments for a wide range of conditions, in both adult and child samples.\\" This suggests that if and when variables are controlled, there is appreciable evidence for the superiority of cognitive and behavioral treatments. Importance The outcome of the Dodo bird debate has extremely important implications for the future of clinical psychology. For one, policymakers have to know how effective each existing psychotherapy is in order to be able to decide which therapies should be supported. This controversy may also lead governmental officials to cut funding for psychological treatments and other public health measures.... Perhaps the greatest illustration of the current state of the Dodo bird verdict is seen in the meta-analyses of Wampold and Barlow and the responses to it. In these meta-analyses, researchers on both sides point out the weaknesses and inconsistencies in their opponents' positions. Although both sides are trying to improve psychology in their respective ways, the disagreement about and lack of consistent evidence for the Dodo bird verdict may in fact be the cause of increased public doubt about the field. The conclusion of the debate could nationally dictate which therapists and which procedures will remain financially supported. For example, if the Dodo bird verdict is thought to be true regarding different psychotherapies, then many clinicians would feel free to use any therapy they see fit to employ. However, if the Dodo bird verdict is proven to be false, then clinicians would likely have to use empirically supported therapies when treating their clients. Fuelling the debate have been alternative visions or paradigms of mental illness. Those believing in a medical model of mental illness and cure see the Dodo bird verdict as necessarily untrue ‚Äì even absurd ‚Äì whatever the evidence supporting it. Those who see therapy as context-based ‚Äì as relying on a shared frame of reference or context between client and therapist for optimum results ‚Äì will almost equally automatically welcome the Dodo bird verdict.

Premiani published two more stories in Prize Comics' horror title Black Magic before devoting himself almost exclusively to Tomahawk, drawing the hero's six- to eight-page stories in all but two issues (#27, #30) in a run through issue #36 (Nov. 1955). He also drew Tomahawk stories in World's Finest Comics #73-75 & 79 (Dec. 1954 - April 1955 & Dec. 1955). As well this decade, Premiani was the author of the illustrated book El Caballo, published in 1957, a source of information about the anatomy and history of the horse for artists.Dayton, Robert. \\"Bruno Premiani ‚Äì The Doom Patrol‚Äôs Original, Underrated Artist\\", GuttersnipeNews.com, April 14, 2009. WebCitation archive. With writer France Herron, Premiani co-created Cave Carson, a spelunker/geologist adventurer, in The Brave and the Bold #31 (Sept. 1960). Doom Patrol Premiani most notably drew the original incarnations of the Doom Patrol in 1963 and the Teen Titans in 1964, both series being cult favorites that have survived in one form or another, if sporadically, since their original creation for the DC Comics universe. In the case of the former superhero team, editor Murray Boltinoff had asked writer Arnold Drake to develop a feature to run in the anthology series My Greatest Adventure. Given the assignment on a Friday with a script due that Tuesday, Drake conceived what would become the Doom Patrol, and turned to another DC writer, Bob Haney, to co-plot and co-script the first adventure. Premiani designed the characters. Drake would subsequently script every Doom Patrol story, with Premiani drawing virtually all, from the team's debut in My Greatest Adventure #80 (June 1963) through the series retitling to The Doom Patrol with issue #86 (March 1964), to the final issue of its initial run, #121 (Oct. 1968).\\"The Doom Patrol Index\\", Amazing Heroes #6, November 1981, pp. 50-54 Premiani and Boltinoff appeared as themselves in that final story, discussing the impending demise of the team.Guay, p. 46 In 2001, Drake wrote of the search for a Doom Patrol illustrator, saying that Boltinoff's regular artists Premiani drew proto-teamings of the as-yet-unnamed Teen Titans beginning with the Kid Flash-Aqualad-Robin adventure \\"The Thousand-and-One Dooms of Mr. Twister\\" in The Brave and the Bold #54 (July 1964). Additionally, in the early 1960s, Premiani freelanced for the Gilberton Company's Classics Illustrated, Classics Illustrated Special Issue, and World Around Us series. His major project was the painted cover and complete interior art for Classics Illustrated No. 156, The Conquest of Mexico (May 1960), based on Bernal Diaz del Castillo's eyewitness account of the fall of the Aztec empire. In addition, he contributed sections to two Special Issues, The Atomic Age (June 1960) and The United Nations (1964). Most of Premiani's work for Gilberton was for the educational World Around Us line, for which he provided chapters in The Crusades (December 1959), Festivals (January 1960), Great Scientists (February 1960), Communications (April 1960), Whaling (December 1960), and The Vikings (January 1961).William B. Jones Jr., Classics Illustrated: A Cultural History, with Illustrations (Jefferson, NC, and London: McFarland, 2002), p. 158. =Later career and death= Premiani's last known original comics story was the three-and-a-half-page \\"Please Let Me Die\\", written by Dave Wood, in The Unexpected #126 (Aug. 1971). Premiani died in Argentina, on August 17, 1984.

It is one of the primary biographies detailing the life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. The stories of Chaitanya's life are mixed with philosophical conversations detailing the process of Bhakti yoga, with special attention given to congregational chanting of Krishna's names and the Hare Krishna mantra. Contents The Chaitanya Caritamrta is divided into three sections: Adi-lila, Madhya-lila and Antya-lila. Each section refers to a particular phase in Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's life: =Adi-lila= The Adi-lila explains Chaitanya's unique theological identity (Krishna in the mood of Radharani‚Äîa combined avatar), his lineage, his closest childhood companions and their lineage, and his devotional associates. It ends with a brief summary of his life up to his acceptance of sannyasa. In the conversation with Chand Kazi (the Muslim ruler at the time), the word 'hindu' is used repeatedly for the inhabitants of Nabadwip who were not Muslims.Caitanya Caritamrta 1.17.174-215 =Madhya-lila= The Madhya-lila details Chaitanya's sannyasa; Madhavendra Puri's life; Chaitanya's philosophical conversation with Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya (Advaitin scholar) promoting bhakti as supreme over the impersonal view; Chaitanya's pilgrimage to South India; the daily and annual activities of Chaitanya and his devotees during the Ratha Yatra festival near Jagannath Temple (Puri, Odisha); their observance of other festivities; and Chaitanya's instructions on the process of Bhakti yoga to both Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami. =Antya-lila= The Antya-lila describes the devotional plays composed by Rupa Goswami, Chaitanya's interactions with the occasional critics as well as his devotees such as Raghunatha dasa Goswami and Jagadananda Pandita, and Chaitanya's increasing agony of separation from Krishna (viraha or vipralambha bhava). It concludes with the Chaitanya's Shikshashtakam (eight verses of poetic instruction). Composition of the Chaitanya Charitamrita Although the author, Krishnadasa Kaviraja, never met Chaitanya Mahaprabhu personally, his guru, Raghunatha dasa Goswami, was an associate of Chaitanya and was close to others who were intimates of his. In composing his work, Krishnadasa Kaviraja also referred to the Shri Krishna Chaitanya Charanamrita () of Murari Gupta and also the works of Svarupa Damodara, both of whom knew Chaitanya. Krishna Dasa Kaviraja composed the Chaitanya Charitamrita in his old age after being requested by the Vaishnavas of Vrindavana to write a hagiography about the life of Chaitanya. Although there was already a biography written by Vrindavana Dasa, called the Chaitanya Bhagavata, the later years of Chaitanya‚Äôs life were not detailed in that work. Krishna Dasa‚Äôs Chaitanya Charitamrita covers Chaitanya‚Äôs later years and also explains in detail the rasa philosophy that Chaitanya and his followers expounded. The Chaitanya Charitamrita also serves as a compendium of Gaudiya Vaishnava practices and outlines the Gaudiya theology developed by the Goswamis in metaphysics, ontology and aesthetics. The Chaitanya Charitamrita was frequently copied and widely circulated amongst the Vaishnava communities of Bengal and Odisha during the early 17th Century. Its popularity during this period can be attributed to the propagation of three Vaishnava preachers‚ÄîNarottama Dasa, Shyamananda and Srinivasa‚Äîwho were trained by Jiva Goswami and Krishnadasa Kaviraja himself. Modern publication In 1974, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada published ≈örƒ´ Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta in English as a 17-volume set of books. It contains the original verses, romanized transliterations, word-for-word meanings, translations, and commentaries. His commentaries are based on Bhaktivinoda Thakur's Amrita Pravaha and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's Anubhasya commentaries. His publication popularized the Chaitanya Charitamrita outside of India and has been distributed in mass quantities worldwide.

The film was directed by Nancy Meckler and written by Wendy Kesselman, based on her own play, My Sister in This House. Both the play and the subsequent film deal with societal repression and its victims. The film is based on a true incident in Le Mans, France in 1933 called the Papin murder case, where two sisters brutally murdered their employer and her daughter. The murder shocked the country, and there was much speculation about the sisters, including allegations that they were having an incestous lesbian affair.  Plot  In 1933 France, Christine (Richardson) is the maid of a well-to-do middle-aged widow (Julie Walters) and her teenage daughter (Sophie Thursfield). Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine. The two sisters become increasingly alienated from their employer, separated by barriers between the classes. With only each other to turn to and Christine experiencing much jealousy as to her sister's interest in anyone else, the relationship becomes sexual, adding to the tension between the sisters and their employer. The tension ultimately leads to paranoia, repressed rage and murder.

It starred Glenda Jackson and Susannah York as the maids, and Vivien Merchant as their employer. It is also mentioned in a 1995 French film of Claude Chabrol, La C√©r√©monie, with Isabelle Huppert and Sandrine Bonnaire.

Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any ships of the line compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, board their ships and engage in hand-to-hand combat. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) This decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former Royal Navy personnel that had been discharged and sought service under Pedro I of Brazil. The battle resulted in four Miguelite ships of the line, one frigate and one corvette being captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreating from the engagement. The action took place in context of the Liberal Wars, a Portuguese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a pretender named Don Miguel, whose supporters were called Miguelites. The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St. Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831 against a French fleet led by Albin Roussin.Roche, (2005) The Miguelite-held Lisbon, deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) Background A portrait of Napier in 1834, at the conclusion of the war. Whilst serving in the Royal Navy near the Azores, Napier had become acquainted with some exiled Portuguese liberals, who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some East Indiamen purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain George Rose Sartorius, who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in English, was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the Napoleonic Wars when he captured the French-held island of Ponza in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the Douro River off Oporto.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) Dom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in Oporto by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the Portuguese Navy and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the frigate Rainha de Portugal, commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson Charles Elers Napier as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the Duke of Terceira and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the Algarve so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture Lisbon. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off Cape St. Vincent on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) Battle After two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier‚Äôs force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portuguese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a corvette, a brig and a schooner, mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the Miguelite fleet which consisted four ships of the line, a frigate, a xebec, three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) As the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to board and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his flagship leading the manoeuvre, the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British veterans from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portuguese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to Don Pedro. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or Madeira. Napier‚Äôs losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of Rainha de Portugal and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant√≥nio Marreiros.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) Aftermath Some time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by cholera outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira‚Äôs army advancing from the south at the Battle of Almada, a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the peerage of Portugal. Napier visited Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker who happened to be in the vicinity of the Tagus, and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Royal Navy List at the insistence of the French, he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews, was viewed in the United Kingdom as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the apogee of its success during the preceding Napoleonic Wars.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) Continuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833. For these services he was made Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword, and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite The Lord of the Isles steamer at Sao Martinho and in 1836 defended his prize in the Court of Common Pleas. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the Minho region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the Battle of Asseiceira, fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars. The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at Evoramonte, a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which Dom Miguel formally renounced all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. Dom Pedro restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl√≥ria resumed her interrupted reign as Maria II of Portugal, until she finally passed away in 1853.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) After the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.Napier, (1836)Napier, (1995) References  See also  * Liberal Wars * Charles Napier * Miguelist Bibliography  Cape St. Vincent (1833) Cape St. Vincent Category:1833 in Portugal Category:July 1833 events ","title":"Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)"},{"id":"2179514","text":"Isabel Vericat N√∫√±ez (born c. 1970), is a Spanish-Mexican lawyer, book writer and translator of many languages.

It is the most populous city in Nagaland and also the most densely populated city in the state with an estimated population of about 250,000. The city is the main gateway and commercial centre of Nagaland. Located near the border with Assam along the banks of the Dhansiri River, Dimapur is the only plains tract of hilly Nagaland and also has the only railway station and airport in the state for connectivity and economic activity. Etymology The name Dimapur is derived from the Kachari language; Di means \\"water\\", ma means \\"large\\" and pur (sanskritised word) means \\"city\\", translating to \\"Big-river-city\\", associated with the meaning of \\"Kachari\\" which is \\"people of the river valley\\" and after the river which flows through it (Dhansiri). There are two accounts of the way in which Dimapur got its name : many writers are of the opinion that the name 'Dimapur' was derived from Dimasa Kachari words Di-meaning water, Ma-meaning big and Pur-meaning city or township in the Dimasa dialect; while others contend that Dimapur is a corruption of Hidimbapur, meaning the city of Hidimbi (of Mahabharata fame) - the rakshasi-turned-woman whose marriage to the Pandava prince Bhima led to the birth of Ghatotkacha, believed to be the progenitor of the Kacharis. According to the second theory, the name Hidimbapur is conjectured to have been abbreviated to Dimbapur and subsequently to have lost a consonant to become Dimapur. In the Ahom Chronicles, Dimapur Is referred to sometimes as ‚ÄòChe-din-chi-pen‚Äô (town-earth-burn-make) meaning ‚Äòbrick town‚Äô. History Situated on the banks of the Dhansiri (originally known as Dong- siri meaning a ravine of peaceful habitation), Dimapur, often described as the ‚ÄòBrick City‚Äô by European scholars and also by the Ahoms, was the ancient capital of Dimasa Kachari community and an independent nation of the Dimasa, who were once a powerful and predominant in the now North East India region (Brahmaputra/Dilao Valley). = Medieval period = According to popular belief, the city's formation in Nagaland is separate from that of Assam. In the Middle Ages, it was the capital of the Dimasa Kingdom. In the heart of the town there is an old relic of the Dimasa Kachari Kingdom which speaks about the once prosperous era. = 1900 = During World War II, Dimapur was the centre of action between British India and Imperial Japan. It was the staging post for the Allied offensive. The Japanese could reach Kohima where a siege was laid. Allied reinforcement came through Dimapur by rail and road for the push against the Japanese. An airport at Dimapur was also in use for supplies to the allied forces in Burma. The battle for Kohima about 77 km from Dimapur is considered the turning point for the Japanese retreat from South East Asia. The Jains were amongst the earliest non-Naga settlers of Nagaland. A few Jain families came to Kohima in the 1880s and settled there. They later moved to Dimapur in 1944 due to Japanese invasion during World War II. Prominent among them were Phulchand Sethi, Udayram Chabra, Mangilal Chabra, Phulchand Binaykia, Jethmal Sethi, Ramchandra Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi, Kanhaiyal Sethi, Nathmal Sethi etc. Phulchand Sethi, Bhajanlal Sethi and other Sethi and Chabra brethren set up the SD Jain Temple, SD Jain School, SD Jain Charitable Hospital. Kanhaiyalal Sethi, Phulchand Sethi, and his brothers also built the Durga Mandir in Old Daily Market. = Assam lease Dimapur to Nagaland = In 1918, Dimapur was leased to then Naga Hills district (Now Nagaland) by then erstwhile Assam Province of British of India for 30 years for construction of Railways lines (unclear from which district).https://nagalandpage.com/return- dimapur-to-assam-demand-grows/ In 1963, It was again leased to now state of Nagaland for 99 years.https://easternmirrornagaland.com/assam-politician- wants-dimapur-and-merapani-from-nagaland/ https://nenow.in/north-east- news/assam/assam-mp-demands-return-dimapur.html Though, there is refute of this claim, as both state government has not come forward to comment on the matter.http://www.nagalandpost.com/paying-the-price-of-silence/181641.html =2000= Present-day Dimapur has far outgrown its old town area. It is one contiguous urban sprawl from the Assam border at Dilai gate and newfield checkgate up to the foothills of Ch√ºmoukedima, the designated district headquarters of Dimapur district.  Geography  Dimapur is located in the southwest of Nagaland. The vast majority of this area is flat with the Dhansiri River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra River flowing east of the city. =Climate= Dimapur is hot and humid in summers and moderately cold in winters. Demographics , the census of 2011, the city-population of the old Town Committee area (up to the old dhansiri bridge) at 122,834. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Dimapur has an average literacy rate of 86% male literacy is 88% and, female literacy is 84%. In Dimapur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. Unlike other places in the state, this city has a heterogeneous mix of people from all over India, and for which it is also known as \\"Mini India\\". Besides the dominant Naga tribes, who comprise about 50% of the city's population, other prominent groups include Bengalis, Assamese, Oriyas, Nepalese, Biharis, Meiteis, Kacharis, Kukis, Marwaris, Punjabis and also Tamils and Keralites. In the last two decades Tibetan traders have also settled in the city. =Religion= Christianity is the most popular religion in Dimapur, making up 45% of the city population and Hinduism comprise 41% of the population. Islam at 11%, and Jainism by 1.7%.

It is the first Christie novel to be given a different title for the US market. The US edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6). Mrs Willett and her daughter host an evening of \\"table-turning\\" (a s√©ance) on a snowy winter's evening in Dartmoor. The spirit tells them that Captain Trevelyan is dead. The roads being impassible to vehicles, Major Burnaby announces his intention to go to the village on foot to check on his friend, where he appears to find the prediction has come true. Emily Trefusis, engaged to Trevelyan's nephew, uncovers the mystery along with the police. The novel was well-received, with praise for the character Miss Emily Trefusis. The references to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, no longer alive when the book was published, and the elements of the setting that hearken to The Hound of the Baskervilles (published in 1902) were also noted and appreciated. Plot summary Sittaford is a tiny village on the fringe of Dartmoor. Mrs Willett and her daughter Violet are the newly installed tenants of Sittaford House, a residence owned by Trevelyan, a retired Navy captain. They invite four people to tea on Friday afternoon: Captain Trevelyan's long-standing friend, Major Burnaby, Mr Rycroft, Mr Ronnie Garfield, and Mr Duke. At the suggestion of Mr Garfield, the six of them decide to play a game of table-turning. During this s√©ance, at 5.25 pm, a spirit announces that Captain Trevelyan has just been murdered. Concerned for the Captain's safety in Exhampton, Major Burnaby says that he intends to walk the six miles there. There is a thick layer of snow on the ground and further heavy snowfall is forecast for later that evening. There is no telephone in Sittaford, and cars cannot manoeuvre in these conditions. Two and a half hours later, just before 8 pm, in the middle of a blizzard, Major Burnaby is trudging up the path to the front door of Hazelmoor, the house in Exhampton where Captain Trevelyan now lives. When nobody answers the door, he fetches the local police and a doctor. They enter the house through the open study window at the back, and find Captain Trevelyan's dead body on the floor. Dr Warren estimates the time of death at between 5 and 6 pm. A fracture of the base of the skull is the cause of death. The weapon was a green baize tube full of sand. Captain Trevelyan's will states that, apart from ¬£100 for his servant Evans, his property is to be equally divided among four people: his sister Jennifer Gardner, his nephew James Pearson, his niece Sylvia Dering, and his nephew Brian Pearson (the three children of his other, deceased sister). Each of these four will inherit approximately ¬£20,000. James Pearson is arrested for murder because he was in Exhampton at the time of the murder, trying unsuccessfully to get a loan from Captain Trevelyan. While the official investigation is led by Inspector Narracott, James Pearson's fianc√©e Emily Trefusis starts sleuthing herself. She is assisted by Charles Enderby, a Daily Wire journalist who, after the murder, presented a cheque for ¬£5,000 to Major Burnaby for winning the newspaper's football competition in Exhampton. Emily and Charles stay with Mr and Mrs Curtis in Sittaford, searching for clues. Mr Dacres, James Pearson's solicitor, tells Emily that things look much worse than they already imagined. James has \\"borrowed\\" money from his firm to speculate in stocks without the knowledge of the firm. There are several red herrings. Brian Pearson came under suspicion when Enderby discovered him making a late-night rendezvous with Violet Willett; he is Violet's fianc√©. He was not in Australia but had returned to England on the same boat with the Willetts. The Willetts' motive for moving into the isolated Sittaford house had no connection with Captain Trevelyan. They wanted to live close to Dartmoor Prison, where Violet's father was imprisoned. His escape from the prison three days after the murder was engineered by Brian Pearson. He and Brian would live with the Willetts as their manservants until the danger was past, but the prisoner was recaptured. Martin Dering created a false alibi because his wife Sylvia was watching him for divorce proceedings. Sylvia is Mr Rycroft's niece; Jennifer Gardner is Mr Garfield's godmother; and Mr Duke is an ex-Chief-Inspector of Scotland Yard. Emily solves the mystery in Hazelmoor after finding Captain Trevelyan's ski boots hidden in the chimney, and two pairs of skis in different sizes. Major Burnaby is the killer. He engineered the table movements during the s√©ance to make the spirit convey the message that Captain Trevelyan had been murdered. Instead of walking the six miles in two and a half hours after the s√©ance, he went to his own house to put on skis, and skied the distance in about 10 minutes. He killed Captain Trevelyan at about a quarter to six. Then he cleaned his skis and put them in the cupboard. He hid Trevelyan's ski boots in the chimney to prevent the police seeing them, and thus possibly realising how quickly a person on skis could have travelled between Sittaford and Exhampton. Major Burnaby hoped that the second pair of skis, of a different size, would pass unnoticed. Mr Rycroft, who is a member of the Psychical Research Society, reassembles five of the six original participants for a second s√©ance at Sittaford House, the absent Mr Duke being replaced by Brian Pearson. The s√©ance has scarcely begun, when Inspector Narracott steps in, in the company of Emily and Mr Duke, and charges Major Burnaby with the murder of Captain Trevelyan. Emily explains that Burnaby had lost a lot of money by buying rotten shares; his motive for the murder was to keep the cheque for ¬£5,000. He had received the letter notifying him of the win on the morning of the day of the murder, contrary to what he told Enderby. Captain Trevelyan had won the competition but used Burnaby's name to send in competition solutions. In the final chapter Emily turns down a marriage proposal by Enderby ‚Äì who has fallen in love with her during the investigation ‚Äì because she still loves her fianc√© James.

The New York Times Book Review's issue of 16 August 1931 posited that \\"Mrs. Agatha Christie's latest is up to her usual high standard and compares favourably with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, one of the best she ever did.\\" They went on to comment that, \\"Miss Trefusis is one of the sharpest and most likeable detectives of recent moons.\\" Finally they summarised, \\"An excellent book to take away for week-end reading.\\" In a short review of 23 October 1931, the Daily Mirror said that, \\"A pair of snow shoes and a prize competition offer clues to the villain, who is well concealed.\\" Robert Barnard: \\"Mayhem Parva, sharpened by Dartmoor setting and snow. Many of the usual elements are here, but also escaped convict (out of Baskervilles), s√©ances, newspaper competitions and amateur investigator ‚Äì young woman torn (as in Blue Train) between handsome weakling and hardworking, upright, born-to-success type. Highly entertaining, with adroit clueing.\\" Charles Osborne: \\"... strongly plotted, and the solution to its puzzles are not likely to be arrived at by deduction on the reader's part. It is also one of Mrs. Christie's most entertaining crime novels, and her use of the Dartmoor background is masterly.\\" References to other works The Sittaford Mystery contains several references to The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conan Doyle. *Both stories are set in Devon and have a gothic atmosphere imparted by the suggestion that supernatural phenomena might be involved. *There's an escaped convict from Dartmoor Prison in both stories: \\"Freemantle\\" Freddy in one, Selden in the other. *There's a naturalist in both stories: Mr Rycroft in one, Jack Stapleton in the other. *In chapter eleven, Charles Enderby says: \\"That s√©ance business was queer too. I'm thinking of writing that up for the paper. Get opinions from Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a few actresses and people about it.\\" Conan Doyle was actually an enthusiastic believer in parapsychology, especially in his later years. Geographical locations 'Exhampton' is readily recognisable as Okehampton. There is a Sittaford Tor on Dartmoor, which gave Christie the name. The physical location of her fictional settlement of Sittaford closely matches that of Belstone, but its description also evokes Throwleigh where Christie owned a house.

Smithson Broadhead. =Book dedication= The book's dedication reads: \\"To M.E.M. With whom I discussed the plot of this book to the alarm of those around us.\\" The subject of this dedication is Christie's second husband, Max Mallowan (1904‚Äì1978) and is one of four books dedicated to him, either singly or jointly, the others being Murder on the Orient Express (1934), Come Tell Me How You Live (1946) and Christie's final written work, Postern of Fate (1973). In 1928, Christie had been planning a holiday to the West Indies when a chance conversation at a dinner party with a Commander Howe of the Royal Navy and his wife, who had just returned from his being stationed in the Persian Gulf, awakened an interest in her in visiting Baghdad, especially when the Howes pointed out that a part of the journey could be made by the famed Orient Express. The Howes also mentioned that not far from Baghdad, an archaeological expedition was uncovering the remains of the ancient city of Ur, about which Christie had been reading with avid interest in The Illustrated London News. Entranced by the thought of such a journey, she changed her tickets at Thomas Cook's and set off for the orient. On the journey, she found herself in the company of a tedious Englishwoman who was determined to take Christie \\"under her wing\\", although that was the last thing she wanted. Desperate to escape she travelled to Ur and made the acquaintance of the archaeological expedition's leader, Leonard Woolley (1880‚Äì1960) and his wife, Katharine (1888‚Äì1945). Visitors to the dig were usually discouraged but Katharine Woolley was a great admirer of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and, being an imperious and difficult woman who always got her way in things large and small (Gertrude Bell described Katherine as \\"dangerous\\"), Christie was treated as an honoured guest. In 1929, Christie gave the Woolleys the temporary use of her then residence in Cresswell Place in London and they, in turn, invited her back to the dig at the end of the season. Arriving back there in February 1930, she met Max Mallowan, who had been away ill with appendicitis. Katharine 'ordered' him to take Christie on a tour of the local sights. They visited Nippur, Diwaniyah, Nejeif, Ukhaidir, and Kerbela and on a journey back to Baghdad, their car got stuck in the sand. Mallowan was impressed by the way in which Christie, rather than succumbing to panic in the heat and dust, just lay down in the car's shadow to sleep while a Bedouin went off for help. After being reunited with the Woolleys, most of the party made its way by stages to Greece where Christie received telegrams informing her that her daughter Rosalind (who was in the care of her sister at Abney Hall), was seriously ill with pneumonia. Christie set off for home by a four-day train journey with Max accompanying her. Getting to know her on the journey, he made up his mind to propose marriage and, after a few more meetings, that is what he did to Christie's great shock. Christie accepted and in doing so was warned to be cautious by her brother-in-law James Watts (1878?‚Äì1957) and vehemently opposed in her plans by his wife (Christie's sister) Madge (1879‚Äì1950). Their son, Jack Watts (1903‚Äì1961) who had been at New College, Oxford with Max was also opposed, supposedly due to mistrust of his new 'uncle'. As The Sittaford Mystery was written during this period, it is probable that this opposition is what the dedication refers to. =Dustjacket blurb= The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads: It was a typical Dickens Christmas; deep snow everywhere, and down in the little village of Sittaford on the fringe of Dartmoor, probably deeper than anywhere. Mrs Willett, the winter tenant in Captain Trevelyan's country house, was, with her daughter Violet, giving a party. Finally they decided to do a little table rapping and after the usual number of inconsequential messages from the 'other side', suddenly the table announced that Captain Trevelyan was dead. His oldest friend, Captain Burnaby, was disturbed. He quickly left the house and tramped six miles of snowy roads to Exhampton. There was no sign of life in Trevelyan's house. A back window was broken in and the light was burning ‚Äì and there, on the floor, was the body of Trevelyan. Inspector Narracott took the case in hand, and after wandering through a maze of false clues and suspects, he ultimately discovered the murderer of Captain Trevelyan. Mrs. Christie has never formulated a more ingenious or enthralling plot and her characterisation is of the vivid type which marked The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and The Murder at the Vicarage. Adaptations =Television= The novel was adapted by Granada Television as a Miss Marple mystery as part of the Agatha Christie's Marple series (set in 1952). It featured Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple and guest-starred Timothy Dalton as Trevelyan, Patricia Hodge as Mrs Evadne Willett, Carey Mulligan as Violet Willett, Laurence Fox as Jim Pearson, Zoe Telford as Emily Trefusis, James Murray as Charles Burnaby, Mel Smith as John Enderby and Rita Tushingham as Elizabeth Percehouse. It aired in the UK on 30 April 2006. However, apart from the names of some of the characters and locations, the plot bears little resemblance to the original story. Also, Miss Marple is added in the story though the book is not about her. =Radio= A five-part radio adaptation was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1990 featuring Melinda Walker as Emily Trefusis, Stephen Tompkinson as Charles Enderby, John Moffatt as Mr Rycroft and Geoffrey Whitehead as Inspector Narracott.

C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. History The comic book magazine was launched in response to the popularity of science fiction in the 1970s at the cinema and on television. A science fiction comic had first been considered by Ian Chisholm and Jack Smith, editors at DC Thomson, in 1976. A decision was made to launch the comic in September 1978. Smith was the first editor. His successors in the role were Bill Graham and Bill McLoughlin.http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/exhibitions/comics/starblazer/ Starblazer reached 281 issues, running from April 1979,https://downthetubes.net/?page_id=18895 to 1 January 1991. The front cover was printed in colour while the back page featured an ongoing subject that was relevant to space. This included pictures of astronauts, brief details of the missions they were on, artificial satellites and the planets and planetoids of the solar system. The first three issues were published monthly, changing to two issues a month from issue four until the last issue in 1991. Partway through its run, from issue 168 onwards, the anthology changed format. Instead of a single front cover and a black and white subject on the back, a new all-colour 'wrap around' cover was instituted, most of the time showing a collage of subjects from that issue's storyline. The subject matters also appeared to have a more adult emphasis and there was a heavier focus on fantasy storylines. The cover title also changed format slightly to Starblazer - Fantasy Fiction in Pictures; despite the title change, there were still a considerable number of science fiction storylines up till the final issue. The later style of Starblazer cover from Issue 200, which had a wrap around effect. Also showing an emphasis on Fantasy storylines, this was the first appearance of the Kingdom of Anglerre. Prior to the new format, there had been several issues that had been classed as interactive fiction, with the title Starblazer - Space (or Fantasy) roleplaying game in pictureshttp://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=3864 similar in idea to the then popular Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf gamebooks, but this idea was quietly dropped after a few issueshttps://downthetubes.net/?page_id=18889 when it proved unpopular. The Starblazer issues suffered from poor distribution, being rare in parts of Scotland and almost unknown in the rest of the United Kingdom. Due to a downturn in the general comic market, many newsagents never stocked them, or later would only take subscriptions. This contrasts sharply with the Commando comics from the same publisher that have enjoyed countrywide widespread distribution since their origin in the 1960s. Also, a slump in the science fiction genre affected the sales. In May 2007 Cubicle 7 Entertainment announced that they were producing a licensed Starblazer role-playing game using the FATE 3.0 system. The game was released by Cubicle 7 in August 2008, at Gen Con Indianapolis, followed by a hard-cover edition in June 2009. In July 2009 it was nominated for three Ennies. An exhibition was held in Dundee in 2009 to mark the 30th anniversary of the title and attracted comics creators like Alan Grant and Warren Ellis.Exhibition to mark comic‚Äôs anniversary, The Press and Journal, 1 July 2009 Featured artists and writers British comics creators to have worked on Starblazer include Grant Morrison, Walter Cyril Henry Reed, John Smith, Mike Chinn,https://downthetubes.net/?page_id=18897 Mike McMahon, Colin MacNeil, Cam Kennedy, John Radford and John Ridgway. There were also a number of European and South American artists who did other work in British comics, such as Enrique Alcatena. Also Mike Knowles. Before the comic was launched he was one of a group of writers selected by D. C. Thomson to come up with stories for the comic. Recurring characters Although each issue was intended to be a 'one-off' storyline, a number of characters made reappearances in subsequent issues. The first of these was Matt Crane, who appeared in issue number 5, title \\"The Shipeater\\". He subsequently reappeared in issue 26, \\"Alien Contact\\". Other recurring characters include: Herne the Cosmic Outlaw. A mysterious warrior who is said to appear seemingly from nowhere to settle disputes in the 28th century. Herne was created by Grant Morrison. * 15 - \\"Algol the Terrible\\" * 86 - \\"The Cosmic Outlaw\\" The Suicide Squad. Not to be confused with the DC Comics group of the same name, this series of stories, by W. C. H. Reed, follows the team of Lieutenant Steve Martin and his squad of misfits. Martin himself apparently was disgraced and his active military career was finished. The remainder of his crew, Gunner Gee, Vidop (Computer operator) Bello, and Navigator Henry also had issues. The first appearance was in issue 49, titled \\"Rigel Express\\". Steve Martin was called Steven Terry in that issue. The Terry surname was also used in a couple of early pages in issue 75 (\\"Doomrock\\") but it changed by the end of that issue. Later issues used the Martin surname and no explanation was ever given for the change. As the issues went on, Martin became increasingly sickened by war, especially the human cost. Issue number 31, \\"Starstrike\\", featured a character called Steve Martin, though he is not the same character. * 49 - \\"Rigel Express\\" * 75 - \\"Doomrock\\" * 122 - \\"Alien Invasion\\" * 154 - \\"The Suicide Squad\\" * 162 - \\"The D Team\\" The Planet Tamer. Formerly known as Jubal McKay, a member of the United Planets Security Service who was rebuilt by cyberneticist Dr. Hans Verringer. The whole side of his body was practically destroyed by a bomb that had been planted by a criminal by the name of Trent. The resulting damage left him effectively unable to live a normal life. Verringer rebuilt his body, integrating weapons and computer systems into his suit. Completely self- sufficient in space, he had a sled built at a ship engineers that he can control remotely. Armed with a wide variety of weapons the Planet Tamer operates outside the normal jurisdiction of the law. * 40 - \\"Planet Tamer\\" * 57 - \\"Galactic Lawman\\" * 90 - \\"Return of the Planet Tamer\\" Matt Tallis. One of the more irregular and short lived of the reused characters, Matt Tallis is an investigator/agent for the Galactic Security Service. He is stronger than the Earth normal, because his home world is a heavier gravity world. Tallis has his own ship, the Taurus, complete with a robot named Isak which can remotely control ship functions. Due to an implant that Tallis has, he can establish a telepathic style link with Isak. * 42 - \\"The Immortals\\" * 52 - \\"The Mask of Fear\\" * 94 - \\"The Megaloi Menace\\" Hadron Halley. A member of the Fi-Sci (Fighting Scientists), a part of Earths Galac Squad. The Fighting Scientists are a small group of scientists who are extremely intelligent, but also enter combat areas, having been fully trained in combat and survival techniques. Hadron Halley first appeared in issue number 50, \\"Moonsplitter\\", which also saw the first appearance of General Larz Pluto who would later become Halley's commanding officer and friend. Issue appearances are as follows. * 50 - \\"Moonsplitter\\" * 54 - \\"The Torturer of Triton II\\" * 62 - \\"Terror Tomb\\" * 77 - \\"Fortress of Fear\\" * 81 - \\"The Serpents of Sirius\\" * 109 - \\"The Sword of Solek\\" * 121 - \\"Nightmare Ship\\" * 146 - \\"Knight of Darkness\\" * 185 - \\"The Warlord of Laama\\" Mikal R Kayn. A former police officer who was invalided out of the force after an explosion burned out his eyes. Without the aid of special glasses he can only see in the infrared spectrum. He eventually meets Cinnibar, a female warrior from the planet of Babalon, who helps him in a case to the abandoned research city of Valhalla Nova on the ice planet of Thrymheim. Kayns first appearance in issue 45 (\\"Operation Overkill\\") makes no mention of his accident, or his disability, only that he is a former law enforcement officer. However, it is the same character. Kayn was created by Grant Morrison. * 45 - \\"Operation Overkill\\" * 127 - \\"The Death Reaper\\" * 167 - \\"Mind Bender\\" * 173 - \\"The Vegas Murders\\" * 177 - \\"The Midas Mystery\\" * 199 - \\"Nether World\\" * 203 - \\"Wipe Out\\" * 207 - \\"Citizen Kayn\\" * 211 - \\"The Dream Machine\\" * 219 - \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" * 225 - \\"Supercop\\" * 247 - \\"Kayn's Quest\\" * 252 - \\"Head Case\\" * 256 - \\"Convict Kayn\\" * 258 - \\"Computer Killer\\" * 266 - \\"Badlands\\" Cinnibar. A fierce female warrior from the frontier planet of Babalon. Her character started in the Kayn stories, and she was also created by Morrison. She had three spin off stories involving herself and her brother Rulf who also had made his first appearance in a Kayn story. Cinnibar is a tall, statuesque, but slender woman who looks human. Her most distinctive features are the extremely long hair, and three striped marks on her face which could be tribal style tattoos. She favours combat with traditional style weapons like swords, although she is not averse to using ranged weapons like laser blasters. As Kayn once remarked, he remembered that \\"Babalonians had found methods to kill practically anything that moves\\". She has a cousin, Vivanna, who also became a semi-recurring character in two of the Cinnibar issues. * 216 - \\"Trouble in Babalon\\" * 253 - \\"Revolt on Babalon\\" * 264 - \\"Banished From Babalon\\" Grok and Zero. One of the earlier series with a lighter tone to it. While some of the stories themselves are serious in nature, they do have a touch of humour to them. Grok is a humanoid alien, an experienced Space Policeman. His partner is injured in the first appearance and he gets assigned a new partner by the name of Smith, who he dubs 'Zero' which is derived from his service number. In this universe, Earth is not the origin of the human race, it is in fact a planet called Cappella VI, Earth having been the location of a crash of a colony ship some centuries before, from which the present population has descended, although it has regressed somewhat. * 176 - \\"Grok and Zero\\" * 184 - \\"The Return of Grok and Zero\\" * 217 - \\"The Pirates of Penz-Anz\\" * 221 - \\"Beastworld\\" * 244 - \\"Double Trouble\\" * 278 - \\"Zero's Hour\\" Frank Carter. More commonly referred to as just 'Carter', he is a mandroid: part robotic, but not quite enough to be called a cyborg. His background is revealed in a later issue. Frank Carter was a perfectly normal police officer until he received a gun blast to the head. The severe head wound meant that pioneering cybernetic surgery was tried. He was given enhanced strength and reactions, but the part of his brain that contained emotions had been destroyed. His basic no-nonsense attitude to lawbreakers, and some would say overly brutal methods are constantly bringing him into conflict with his superiors.

An intergalactic freelance troubleshooter, his real name is Sol Rynn. He answers distress calls from those in need who use a special card which slots into a computer interface. Starhawk was one of the flagship stories in the short-lived DC Thomson comic The Crunch. Starhawk also made a number of brief appearances in DC Thomsons Hotspur annual. His companion is a robot simply named Droid. He has a starship that he can remotely summon. The setting is the crumbling Earth Empire which has been ravaged by years of raiding from the alien Krell. Strangely enough, little background is given to the Krell themselves and the backstory of conflict between the Krell and that of Earth is never elaborated on. The result is that much of the galaxy is in a state of lawlessness. * 186 - \\"Starhawk\\" * 201 - \\"Return of Starhawk\\" * 222 - \\"Target...Starhawk\\" Skald. The Skald series of stories initially is set in the region of a castle where the population are enslaved by powerful 'warlocks'. The warlocks use energy weapons to dispense their own brand of justice and keep the population enslaved by fear. When Skald, a young herder, finds out that he is to receive the 'collar of manhood', basically a life sentence in the mines performing hard labour, he rebels. Lashing out in anger, he kills one of the warlocks and flees the area. Later he meets with Linx, an Amazonian warrioress member of the matriarchal Yaba-Kel tribe. Many elements of the Skald stories centre around the fact that an Earth colony ship crash landed on the planet and advanced technology found its way into the hands of a select few people, and the constant struggle for this technology. * 190 - \\"The Power of the Warlocks\\" * 241 - \\"Revenge of the Warlocks\\" * 267 - \\"Skald-The Saga Continues\\" * 274 - \\"Skald-The Ultimate Conflict\\" The Anglerre Series. This series of issues, set in the fantasy kingdom of Anglerre, follows the royal family and their conflict against various aggressors. The first appearance of Prince Veyne, in issue 200, was followed by a later issue which was a prequel showing Veyne's father, King Iagon. King Iagon had been vaguely referred to in #200, both by saying that Veyne had just ascended to the throne on the death of his father, and a ship named the 'Royal Iagon'. Much of the storyline of the Royal House of Anglerre is entwined with the god Vishena and the Demon Sword, Cerastes, who will make its user invincible, but will also kill its wielder after an unspecified period of time. The nature of Anglerre's opponents seems to make heavy use of Demons. A recurring character within this series is that of Myrdan, a seemingly immortal figure of unspecified power. In the issue Demon Sword, Myrdan at one point seems to merge with Vishena, which hints that he could be an avatar of the god. * 200 - \\"Demon Sword\\" * 224 - \\"Rune\\" * 231 - \\"Godstone\\" * 250 - \\"Sun Prince\\" * 271 - \\"The Triune Warrior\\" Solo. This series charts the adventures of Solo, the sole human survivor of a cryogenic sleeper ship. The charter of his vessel, the Telurian Quest, grants him ownership of a planet. However, he finds that his planet is already inhabited as faster than light capable ships were launched some years after the Telurian ships. Solo was reared by an onboard android who educated him with tales of chivalry. Therefore, Solo has a rather archaic way of looking at things and is also naive. * 202 - \\"Lord of the Far Planet\\" * 229 - \\"Solo's Quest\\" The Robot Kid. One of the more humorous series of stories appeared in Starblazer. The initial Robot Kid story was set on a frontier planet under attack from bandits. The whole story had a quasi-western feel to it. The initial story had the townsfolk try to buy a Kelso Deathmek, a war robot, to protect them. What they got was a reprogrammed cinema usher. It is computerised mind had been loaded with all sorts of clich√©s and popular saying from Western films. Indeed, there were homages throughout the issue with a character by the name of Angel Eyes, and another character who bore a resemblance to Lee Van Cleef in the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. With its body destroyed at the end of the story, the replacement body was manufactured by the Japanese arm of the company and was a parody of the many martial arts movies. The third and final appearance was a parody of the Rambo-style movies. * 204 - \\"The Robot Kid\\" * 232 - \\"The Return of the Robot Kid\\" * 273 - \\"The Robot Kid Strikes Back\\"  Roleplaying game  Cubicle 7 released a licensed tabletop role-playing game called Starblazer Adventures using the Fate system in 2008, with multiple supplements coming out through to 2013.

He was crowned king of Italy in 889 and emperor in 891. He died in 894 while fighting for control of the Italian Peninsula. Guy was married to Ageltrude, daughter of Adelchis of Benevento, who bore him a son named Lambert. Early life Guy was the second son of Guy I of SpoletoMann III, pg. 303 and Itta, daughter of Sico of Benevento. Guy I was the son of Lambert I of Nantes and his second wife, Adelaide of Lombardy, who was a daughter of Charlemagne's second eldest son, Pepin of Italy. In 842, the former Duchy of Spoleto, which had been donated to the Papacy by Charlemagne, was resurrected by the Franks to be held against Byzantine catapans to the south, as a Frankish border territory by a dependent margrave. Consequently, Guy‚Äôs family had been important players in Italian politics since the early ninth century.Mann III, pg. 303 Although in 876 Guy and his elder brother, Lambert, Duke of Spoleto, had been commissioned by Charles the Bald to accompany Pope John VIII to Naples to break up the alliances that many of the southern Lombard states had made with the Saracens,Mann III, pg. 281 the family‚Äôs interests were generally hostile to the papacy, a policy that Guy initially followed.Mann III, pg. 318 With Lambert‚Äôs death in 880, he bequeathed to Guy the march of Camerino, and in 882 Guy supported his nephew‚Äôs (Guy II of Spoleto) invasion of the Papal States.Mann III, pg. 318 This brought him into conflict with the Emperor Charles the Fat, and in 882, at an assembly at Verona, the emperor dispossessed him of his fiefs, together with a significant number of other important, but minor, Italian nobles.Mann III, pg. 355 Rising up in rebellion, Guy allied himself with the neighbouring Saracens and began acquiring further territory. At this point, at a diet at Ravenna, the emperor declared him guilty of high treason, and Berengar of Friuli was commanded to strip him of his fief by force.Mann III, pg. 356 In 883, Guy inherited his nephew's title of Spoleto and reunited the dukedom, henceforth as the \\"Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino\\" bearing the title of dux et marchio, and by the end of 884, Emperor Charles III was forced to make peace with Guy, where he formally recovered his titles.Mann III, pg. 356 Then in 885, he fought his occasional allies, the Saracens of the Garigliano. Rule as Emperor A Spoletan denarius from the reign of Guy III After the deposition of Charles the Fat in 887, by virtue of being a relative of Archbishop Fulk of Rheims,Mann III, pg. 377 he had hopes of being crowned king of West Francia, and in fact travelled as far as Langres, where the bishop crowned him as such. But because of Odo's coronation that year (888), he turned and went back with designs on the crown of Italy and the emperorship. Guy of Spoleto was opposed by Berengar of Friuli for the Iron Crown of Lombardy.Comyn, pg. 82 Although Berengar had the advantage of being allied with the Carolingian family,Mann III, pg. 377 and of having been crowned as king of Italy in 887, from 888 Guy was closer to Rome, and had already allied himself with Pope Stephen V, who had described Guy ‚Äúas his only son‚Äù. Fighting between the rival contenders began, and it was Guy who had himself proclaimed king of Italy in a diet held at Pavia at the end of the year 888.Mann III, pg. 377 He was formally crowned King of Italy by Pope Stephen V in 889, and this was followed by his coronation as Roman Emperor on 21 February 891,Mann III, pg. 378 together with the crowning of his son Lambert II as King of Italy. The situation in Italy began to deteriorate with the election of a new pope, Formosus, in 891. Distrustful of Guy, he began to look elsewhere for support against the emperor, as Guy found it increasingly difficult to end the threat of Berengar who still held out in his Duchy of Friuli.Mann IV, pg. 50 To bolster his overall position, at Ravenna on 30 April 892, Guy forced Pope Formosus to crown Lambert as co-emperor.Comyn, pg. 82 The pope therefore took the next opportunity to oppose Guy by supporting Arnulf of Carinthia for the Italian and imperial titles. In 893, Formosus invited Arnulf to come to Trento to overthrow Guy and be crowned himself. Arnulf instead sent his son Zwentibold with an army to join Berengar, the deposed king, and march on Trento. Their joint army surrounded Trento, but Guy probably bribed them to leave him unmolested. The following year, they defeated Guy at Bergamo and took Trento and Milan. Berengar was recognised as king and a vassal of Arnulf. Zwentibold returned to Germany, as fever had wreaked havoc on the German armies.Mann IV, pg. 51 Guy retreated in order to regroup at a fortified place on the Taro and died there suddenly in late autumn, leaving his son under the tutelage of his wife. Both would contest the throne with Berengar and Arnulf. Legacy Guy's power never extended over much beyond his hereditary lands, which offered stark illustration of the fact that the imperial title, with its pretensions of universal rule, had by the end of the ninth century become merely a token of the pope's favour, to be fought over by various Italian nobles. He did not even firmly control the north of Italy, battling other claimants over the throne for much of his reign. He did try to maintain the Carolingian tradition and issue capitularies as former emperors had. In 891, he demanded the traditional service in the army of all arimanni, whether they owned land or not.

To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia. The Yellow Sea is to the west, the East China Sea and Korea Strait is to the south, and the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is to the east.Korean Map , The People's Korea, 1998. Notable islands include Jeju Island (Jejudo), Ulleung Island (Ulleungdo), and Liancourt Rocks. The southern and western parts of the peninsula have well-developed plains, while the eastern and northern parts are mountainous. The highest mountain in Korea is Mount Paektu or Paektusan (), through which runs the border with China. The southern extension of Mount Paektu is a highland called Gaema Heights. This highland was mainly raised during the Cenozoic orogeny and partly covered by volcanic matter. To the south of Gaema Gowon, successive high mountains are located along the eastern coast of the peninsula. This mountain range is named Baekdudaegan. Some significant mountains include Mount Sobaek or Sobaeksan (), Mount Kumgang or Kumgangsan (), Mount Seorak or Seoraksan (), Mount Taebaek or Taebaeksan (), and Mount Jiri or Jirisan (). There are several lower, secondary mountain ranges whose direction is almost perpendicular to that of Baekdudaegan. They are developed along the tectonic line of Mesozoic orogeny and their directions are basically northwest. Unlike most ancient mountains on the mainland, many important islands in Korea were formed by volcanic activity in the Cenozoic orogeny. Jeju Island, situated off the southern coast, is a large volcanic island whose main mountain Mount Halla or Hallasan () is the highest in South Korea. Ulleung Island is a volcanic island in the Sea of Japan, whose composition is more felsic than Jeju-do. The volcanic islands tend to be younger, the more westward. Because the mountainous region is mostly on the eastern part of the peninsula, the main rivers tend to flow westwards. Two exceptions are the southward-flowing Nakdong River (Nakdonggang) and Seomjin River (Seomjingang). Important rivers running westward include the Amnok River, the Chongchon River (Chongchongang), the Taedong River (Taedonggang), the Han River (Hangang), the Geum River (Geumgang), and the Yeongsan River (Yeongsangang). These rivers have vast flood plains and provide an ideal environment for wet-rice cultivation. The southern and southwestern coastlines of Korea form a well-developed ria coastline, known as Dadohae-jin in Korean. Its convoluted coastline provides mild seas, and the resulting calm environment allows for safe navigation, fishing, and seaweed farming. In addition to the complex coastline, the western coast of the Korean Peninsula has an extremely high tidal amplitude (at Incheon, around the middle of the western coast. It can get as high as ). Vast tidal flats have been developing on the south and west coastlines. Physical geography A view of Mount Seorak Mountains cover 70 percent of Korea and arable plains are generally small and fall between the successive mountain ranges. The peninsula becomes more mountainous towards the north and the east, with the highest mountains (including Baekdu Mountain which stands at ) found in the north. The peninsula has of coastline, and the south and west coasts are particularly irregular. Most of the 3,579 islands off the peninsula are found along the south and the west coasts. Climate Heavy snow fell on eastern Korea in February 2011. The climate of Korea differs dramatically from north to south. The southern regions experience a relatively warm and wet climate similar to that of Japan, affected by warm ocean waters including the East Korea Warm Current. The northern regions experience a colder and to some extent more inland climate, in common with Manchuria. For example, the annual precipitation of the Yalu River valley () is less than half of that on the south coast ().KOIS 2003, p. 17. Likewise, there is a difference in January temperature between the peninsula's southern and northern tips. The entire peninsula, however, is affected by similar climactic patterns, including the East Asian monsoon in midsummer and frequent typhoons in autumn. The majority of rainfall takes place during the summer months, with nearly half during the monsoon alone. Winters are cold, with January temperatures typically below freezing outside of Jeju Island. Winter precipitation is minimal, with little snow accumulation outside of mountainous areas. Biology Surveys of Korean flora have identified more than 3,000 species on the peninsula, of which more than 500 are endemic. The peninsula's floristic provinces are commonly divided between warm-temperate, temperate, and cold-temperate zones. The warm-temperate zone prevails over the southern coast and islands, including Jeju-do. It is largely typified by broad-leaved evergreens. The temperate zone covers the great majority of the peninsula, away from the southern coast and high mountains. It is dominated by the Korean pine and various broad-leaved deciduous trees. Cold-temperate vegetation is found along the peninsula's northern fringe and in the high mountains, including the upper reaches of Hallasan on Jeju. Evergreens in this area include larch and juniper. Much of this vegetation is shared with Manchuria. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, Korea consists of several ecoregions. The Southern Korea evergreen forests occupy the southernmost portion of the peninsula, as well as the island of Jeju. The Central Korea deciduous forests occupy the more temperate central portion of the peninsula. Manchurian mixed forests occupy the northern lowlands and low hills of the peninsula, and extend north into Manchuria as far as the Amur River on the Russia-China border. The Changbai Mountains mixed forests include the higher elevation mountain region along the North Korea-China border, where forests are dominated by conifers, with alpine meadows and rock slopes on the highest peaks. Geology Jeju Island seashore The terrain of Korea is rumpled, covered with low mountains. Most rocks are of Precambrian origin, although isolated pockets of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic rock can also be found. There are no active volcanoes on the peninsula. However, Baekdu Mountain in the north and Hallasan in the south have crater lakes, indicating that they were active not long ago. Furthermore, hot springs indicative of low-level volcanic activity are widespread throughout the peninsula. Roughly two earthquakes are recorded per year, but few have any major impact.

The OpenEmbedded framework is developed by the OpenEmbedded community, which was formally established in 2003. OpenEmbedded is the recommended build system of the Yocto Project, which is a Linux Foundation workgroup that assists commercial companies in the development of Linux-based systems for embedded products. The build system is based on BitBake \\"recipes\\", which specify how a particular package is built, but also includes lists of dependencies and source code locations, as well as instructions on how to install and remove a compiled package. OpenEmbedded tools use these recipes to fetch and patch source code, compile and link binaries, produce binary packages (ipk, deb, rpm), and create bootable images. Historically, OpenEmbedded's collection of recipes were stored in a single repository, and the metadata was structured in a form now called \\"OpenEmbedded-Classic\\". By 2010, it had become increasingly difficult to manage the ever-growing number of recipes. To resolve this, recipe metadata was split into multiple layers. The lowest layer, which includes platform- independent and distribution-independent metadata is called \\"OpenEmbedded- Core\\". Architecture-specific, application-specific and distribution-dependent instructions are applied in appropriate target support layers that can override or complement the instructions from lower layers. Additionally, changes to the recipes at the core layer are now managed with a pull model: instead of committing their changes directly to the repository (as was previously the case), developers now send their patches to the mailing list. The patches, if approved, are then merged (pulled) by a maintainer.. The OpenEmbedded framework can be installed and automatically updated via Git..  History  The OpenEmbedded Project (OE for short) was created by Chris Larson, Michael Lauer, and Holger Schurig, merging the achievements of OpenZaurus with contributions from projects like Familiar Linux and OpenSIMpad into a common codebase. OpenEmbedded superseded these projects and was used to build any of them from the same code base. Stable maintenance builds exist for the old OpenEmbedded-Classic, although most development is, or will be, based on the new OpenEmbedded-Core in the future. The OpenEmbedded-Core Project (OE- Core for short) resulted from the merge of the Yocto Project with OpenEmbedded. This is the most recent version of OpenEmbedded and many of the OE-dev recipes are available in OE-Core. Newer versions of package recipes may only get ported for OpenEmbedded-Core.  Layer organisation  OpenEmbedded- Core has adapted this layered structure in the merge with Yocto and new layer entries were added over time.Yocto & OpenEmbedded Core Layers The Layers represent a structure which is only of declarative nature.

The Engine division and Sukhoi division of the aircraft manufacturing company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), a public sector undertaking (PSU) of Ministry of Defence is in Sunabeda. Other major establishments of this town are Naval Armament Depot (NAD), State government offices, Sports Authority of India hostel, Central University of Orissa (CUO) and Battalion headquarter of Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA). History Created around 1965, mainly to accommodate HAL employees, Sunabeda is a planned and organized township. It is situated around 1,000 meters above sea level. Prior to its creation, this place was known as Old Sunabeda which was occupied by native tribal community. About a thousand tribals in and around Chikapar village were displaced and rendered homeless to give way for the HAL factory.Everybody Loves a Good Drought by Palagummi Sainath. Even though the factory was made with Russian collaboration, the township and factory buildings were executed by state engineers of Odisha. The project was named Aero Engine Factory (AEF) Project. The residential colony is called AEF Colony with a Chief Engineer responsible towards it. After the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War a shelter camp for the Bangladeshi refugees was constructed which became Sunabeda‚Äì3, which today predominantly comprises Bengali Hindu people. The Odisha Small Industries Corporation established the Odisha Timber and Engineering Works adjacent to NH-43. Most Bengali people joined here as carpenters. When the Kolab dam was constructed a catchment formed around Sunabeda in the form of a big lake. Some of the Bengali people took to fishing and today Sunabeda is a centre for making fishing boats and nets for which fishermen from as far as Malkangiri come to buy their provisions. There was little growth in Sunabeda and on the other hand the hustle and bustle gradually started dwindling as the AEF project closed after commencement of production in HAL. Similarly fresh recruitment in HAL stopped after a while and people started retiring and the post remained vacant as the Mikoyan (MIG) series of aircraft was losing out to new series of aircraft. In the late 1980s the setting up of the NAD and the National Aluminium Company (NALCO) in Damanjodi kept the overall situation alive in Sunabeda and Semiliguda. Things started looking brighter after the Sukhoi Su-30 production meant a new division in HAL. The arrival of the Battalion Headquarters of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA), as well as the Central University and the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) are hoped to provide some growth to the area. Geography =Location= Sunabeda is located 20 km east of Koraput. There are frequent buses and taxis from Koraput. Though the closest railway station is at Dumuriput, Damanjodi and Koraput, a majority of the people prefer alighting at Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh. The National Highway 26 (previously NH-43) running over the mountains and forest make the journey to Sunabeda an unforgettable experience. There are basically three areas in Sunabeda defined as Sunabeda - I, II, III, these being AEF Colony, the H A L township and the N A C (notified area council) respectively. They are so called because of the last digit in the PINCODE. With lush green flora all around the hills and hillocks it is a place worth seeing. The HAL Nursery while open to the public is worth a visit. There is also a deer park adjoining the nursery. A museum on the outskirts of the township is to house the developmental history of the place as well as the factory. =HAL Township= Sunabeda is a well planned and beautiful township with adjoining areas like PHED Colony, AEF Colony, Shantinagar, NAC, Semliguda, D.P. Camp, Jadaguda, Malliguda, Jersey Farm, Timber, and Damanjodi. Moreover, many of hill stations and water falls surrounded near by. The HAL factory is located in the center of the town, employees around six thousand people, and provides residential quarters for the employees and staff of the company. The entire township is divided into sectors which are further divided into zones starting from A to Y, the 'R' zone being the largest. There are other zones listed as RA, QA, LA, NG, UA, JA, IB, KG,GG etc. Demographics India census, Sunabeda had a population of 58,647. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Sunabeda has an average literacy rate of 62%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 69%, and female literacy is 54%. In Sunabeda, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. Education The oldest school but relatively less known is the Government High School at Sunabeda-1 which has one alumni Sri Jayaram Pangi as a Member of Parliament. Most educated people in the old parts of the town are likely to be products of this elite school belonging to the T&R; Department. In order to provide continual and quality education to transferable central government employees comprising serving Officers and sailors of Indian Navy, Navy civilians and counterparts from Army and Airforce of Sunabeda along with retired authorised personnel and few local populace, NAD KV Sunabeda has been established in the year 1989 (from class -1 to class-V) and to presently class-12 has been functioning satisfactorily under the aegis of KV Sangathan with students hailing from far off places like Koraput, Damanjodi etc. For employees of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) factory, Aeronautics Education Society (AES) established a co-educational English medium School in year 1968, Vyomayana Samstha Vidyalaya(VSV) formerly called the DAV English Medium School with classes from LKG - Std XII. It's located at the edge of township near the Utkal Cinema hall. It has 3 buildings - Primary which has LKG to Std 5 students, Secondary for class 6 to 8 students and the main building for 9th to class 12th. All board exams 10th and 12th are held on premises and is affiliated to board of Secondary education with CBSE course studies. Alumnus of VSV work in top positions at global companies both in India and abroad. Bibhuti Acharya, the Vice President of Apollo Medvarsity is an alumnus of V.S.Vidyalaya. http://vsvidyalaya.in/index.php?file=c-menu&iMenuId;=129 The only missionary school, Jeevan Jyothi convent school is situated at Semiliguda 5 km from Sunabeda. There is also the Sunabeda Public School (ICSE)in the A.E.F. Colony. The Sunabeda Public School founded in 1965 is the oldest English-medium school in the erstwhile undivided Koraput district . It is a co-educational residential school having classes from LKG to Class XII. The other schools are A.G.H. School, and A.D.A.V. School. The primary schools are: A Zone School, D Zone School, R Zone School, U Zone School and I Zone School. For the development of women's education in Sunabeda there is women's college named as Sunabeda Women's College. Aurobindo Integral School, and Saraswati Vidya Mandir (founded in 1985) were also established for the development of education in the NAC area. Saaraswati Vidya Mandir is an Oriya medium school, affiliated to board of secondary education, Bhubaneswar. Transport Sunabeda is situated on NH 26 which connects Raipur and Bargarh. The nearest railway stations are: * Dumuriput, 6 km * Koraput, 19 km * Damanjodi, 12 km The nearest airport is in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh (188 km). Sunabeda is well connected with rest of Odisha as well as nearby districts of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with huge number of buses. Recently Jeypore - Koraput - Sunabeda City Bus Service has been started and it caters well to the transportation needs of Sunabedians. Distance from major cities and surrounding towns *Jeypore 43 km * Koraput 19 km * Semiliguda 3 km * Sunki 48 km * Saluru 71 km * Visakhapatnam 196 km * Vizianagaram 127 km * Bhubaneswar 484 km * Brahmapur 313 km * Asika 316 km * Bhanjanagar 367 km * Cuttack 510 km * Phulbani 332 km * Rourkela 607 km * Rayagada 109 km Sports There is big stadium in middle of the Township. Many Divisional events are observed in this stadium. Independence Day and Republic Days are celebrated in a grand way. Hockey, Football, Cricket and other athletic meets are held in this stadium. National level football tournament are organised in this ground in every two years. Teams from different parts of our Country are participating in this tournament. There is also Sports club at HAL Township. Apart from it, Sunabeda has a Sports training center which is run by HAL in collaboration with Sports Authority of India. The training center primarily trains students of age group 13‚Äì15 years old, in archery and football for three years and is managed by a sports officer Mr. Ramesh Thakur, who happens to be a HAL employee. Candidates are selected from adjourning districts of Koraput. Trainees of this centre have participated at National level championship in Archery and brought laurels for the State. Culture Sunabeda has a very old Jagannath Temple, older than Koraput Jagannath temple which holds Annual Rath Yatra that ends at HAL Open Air Pandal. This event is an important annual event in Sunabeda. Maa Banadurga temple at Shantinagar is the oldest temple of the Region, where the tribals celebrate their annual Chaita Parba, the oldest annual event of the entire Sunabeda region. The major cultural events in Sunabeda are the Rath Yatra, the Viswakarma Puja, Dussehra and other festivals. There is a Jagannath temple in AEF Colony and L zone in HAL Township. Maha Sivaratri which is celebrated at the temple of Shiva atop a hillock just close to the AEF Colony bus stop, There is a Hanuman Temple in IB zone. There is also a Jagannath Temple at L-Zone named as Swarnakhetra, Tarini Temple at B-Zone, Mangala Temple at R-Zone and K-Zone, Gayatri Temple at G-zone, Santosimaa Temple at E-Zone, Satyasai Temple at F-zone and many more temple at HAL Township for the spiritual development of the people of the township. In the boundary of Jagannath Temple there is a Siva Temple where Baba Biswanath worshiped. Besides Siva and Jagannath there is also Ganesh Mandir and Laxmi Mandir. Arnapurna Mandap and Laxmi Mandap also constructed in the boundary of Jagannath Temple for social functions of the Township. At an extreme of the township, there exists a hill called Chikkappara. On the hill top is the oldest temple - \\" Lord Siva Temple\\" and Parvathi Temple at the bottom of the hill. By the side of the temple Lord Ayyaappa Temple is there, which was consecrated on 15 February 1989. There are a lot of stories related to this temple. On the time of consecration, an Eagle, which is rare in Sunabeda, revolved around the temple, like the eagle coming to Sabarimala temple. Every year on \\"Mandala Puja\\" day, water flows from the hill just behind the temple. This was predicted before the construction of the temple and it is happening every year since 1998. Only on that day the water flows and that also for about an hour during the Abhishekam time.  Literature  Every Year on the occasion of Ratha Yatra a colourful magazine is published called Swarnakhetra. Utkal Sanskrutika Parishad of Sunabeda is one of the oldest cultural Organization of Odisha in the township which is continuously playing a vital Role for the Development of the Odia Culture, Literature and Customs since 1966. The organization observes the Jayanti of Kabisamrat Upendrabhanja, Fakirmohan, Gangadhar, Madhusudan, Bijupatnaik, Nanda Kishore Bal. The organization also publishes an annual magazine called Smaranika. The Banaphula Sahitya Parishad and The Banaprabha Sahitya Sansad are two other organizations that are continuously working for the development of Odia literature.

Arcus is common and benign when it is in elderly patients. However, if arcus appears in patients less than 50 years old, it is termed \\"arcus juvenilis\\" and is associated with abnormally high cholesterol in the body with increased risks for cardiovascular disease. Arcus may also present as a white ring, which is visible in front of the periphery of the iris. Causes Arcus results from cholesterol deposits in or hyalinosis of the corneal stroma, and may be associated with ocular defects or with familial hyperlipidemia. It is common in the apparently healthy middle aged and elderly; a prospective cohort study of 12,745 Danes followed up for a mean of 22 years found that it had no clinical value as a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Arcus can be a sign of disturbance in lipid metabolism, an indicator of conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia or hyperlipidemia. Unilateral arcus is a sign of decreased blood flow to the unaffected eye, due to carotid artery disease or ocular hypotony. Diagnosis Arcus is usually diagnosed through visual inspection by an ophthalmologist or optometrist using a biomicroscope. Arcus senilis can be confused with the limbus sign, which reflects calcium rather than lipid deposits. Anterior embryotoxon is a benign, congenital, elongation of the sclera-cornea transition zone which is present at birth and has a similar appearance to arcus juvenilis.

In the original work of Stiefel and Whitney, characteristic classes were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent vectors. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a cross-section of a bundle. In homotopy theory The older meaning for obstruction theory in homotopy theory relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a continuous mapping defined on a simplicial complex, or CW complex. It is traditionally called Eilenberg obstruction theory, after Samuel Eilenberg. It involves cohomology groups with coefficients in homotopy groups to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex X to another, Y, defined initially on the 0-skeleton of X (the vertices of X), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same path-connected component of Y. Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from X, given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of X, given the mapping already defined on its boundary. At some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of X to the n-skeleton of X, this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an n-cochain with coefficients in . Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a cocycle and so defines a cohomology class in the nth cohomology group of X with coefficients in . When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of X so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of X. If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton. =Obstruction to extending a section of a principal bundle= Construction Suppose that is a simply connected simplicial complex and that is a fibration with fiber . Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined section on the -skeleton of . For every -simplex in , can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological -sphere). Because send each of these back to each , we have a map from an -sphere to . Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and is contractible; is homotopy equivalent to . So this partially defined section assigns an element of to every -simplex. This is precisely the data of a -valued simplicial cochain of degree on , i.e. an element of . This cochain is called the obstruction cochain because it being the zero means that all of these elements of are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the -skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each ) and the constant map. The fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from all the boundaries of all the -simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle. If one started with a different partially defined section that agreed with the original on the -skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary. Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group such that if a partially defined section on the -skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the -skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial. The converse is also true if one allows such things as homotopy sections, i.e. a map such that is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on . Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the -skeleton. Applications * By inducting over , one can construct a first obstruction to a section as the first of the above cohomology classes that is non-zero. * This can be used to find obstructions to trivializations of principal bundles. * Because any map can be turned into a fibration, this construction can be used to see if there are obstructions to the existence of a lift (up to homotopy) of a map into to a map into even if is not a fibration. * It is crucial to the construction of Postnikov systems. In geometric topology In geometric topology, obstruction theory is concerned with when a topological manifold has a piecewise linear structure, and when a piecewise linear manifold has a differential structure. In dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Morse), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same. In dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide. In surgery theory The two basic questions of surgery theory are whether a topological space with n-dimensional Poincar√© duality is homotopy equivalent to an n-dimensional manifold, and also whether a homotopy equivalence of n-dimensional manifolds is homotopic to a diffeomorphism. In both cases there are two obstructions for n>9, a primary topological K-theory obstruction to the existence of a vector bundle: if this vanishes there exists a normal map, allowing the definition of the secondary surgery obstruction in algebraic L-theory to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a homotopy equivalence.

Kustodiev's biography at Olga's gallery Kustodiev's biography at ArtRoots.com Early life Boris Kustodiev was born in Astrakhan into the family of a professor of philosophy, history of literature, and logic at the local theological seminary. His father died young, and all financial and material burdens fell on his mother's shoulders. The Kustodiev family rented a small wing in a rich merchant's house. It was there that the boy's first impressions were formed of the way of life of the provincial merchant class. The artist later wrote, \\"The whole tenor of the rich and plentiful merchant way of life was there right under my nose... It was like something out of an Ostrovsky play.\\" The artist retained these childhood observations for years, recreating them later in oils and water-colours. Art studies Winter- festivities 1919 Between 1893 and 1896, Kustodiev studied in theological seminary and took private art lessons in Astrakhan from Pavel Vlasov, a pupil of Vasily Perov. Kustodiev and Petrov-Vodkin as members of Mir Iskusstva Subsequently, from 1896 to 1903, he attended Ilya Repin‚Äôs studio at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. Concurrently, he took classes in sculpture under Dmitry Stelletsky and in etching under Vasiliy Mate. He first exhibited in 1896. \\"I have great hopes for Kustodiev,\\" wrote Repin. \\"He is a talented artist and a thoughtful and serious man with a deep love of art; he is making a careful study of nature...\\" Kustodiev's biography at Hrono.ru When Repin was commissioned to paint a large-scale canvas to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State Council, he invited Kustodiev to be his assistant. The painting was extremely complex and involved a great deal of hard work. Together with his teacher, the young artist made portrait studies for the painting, and then executed the right-hand side of the final work. History of creating of the painting to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State Council Also at this time, Kustodiev made a series of portraits of contemporaries whom he felt to be his spiritual comrades. These included the artist Ivan Bilibin (1901, Russian Museum), Moldovtsev (1901, Krasnodar Regional Art Museum), and the engraver Mate (1902, Russian Museum). Working on these portraits considerably helped the artist, forcing him to make a close study of his model and to penetrate the complex world of the human soul. In 1903, he married Julia Proshinskaya (1880‚Äì1942). Another Kustodiev's biography Catalog of Proshina's works He visited France and Spain on a grant from the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1904. Also in 1904, he attended the private studio of Ren√© M√©nard in Paris. After that he traveled to Spain, then, in 1907, to Italy, and in 1909 he visited Austria and Germany, and again France and Italy. During these years he painted many portraits and genre pieces. However, no matter where Kustodiev happened to be ‚Äì in sunny Seville or in the park at Versailles ‚Äì he felt the irresistible pull of his motherland. After five months in France he returned to Russia, writing with evident joy to his friend Mate that he was back once more \\"in our blessed Russian land\\". Career Pancake Tuesday; Butter Week or Crepe week, (1916) The Russian Revolution of 1905, which shook the foundations of society, evoked a vivid response in the artist's soul. He contributed to the satirical journals Zhupel (Bugbear) and Adskaya Pochta (Hell‚Äôs Mail). At that time, he first met the artists of Mir Iskusstva (World of Art), the group of innovative Russian artists. He joined their association in 1910 and subsequently took part in all their exhibitions. In 1905, Kustodiev first turned to book illustrating, a genre in which he worked throughout his entire life. He illustrated many works of classical Russian literature, including Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls, The Carriage, and The Overcoat; Mikhail Lermontov's The Lay of Tsar Ivan Vasilyevich, His Young Oprichnik and the Stouthearted Merchant Kalashnikov; and Leo Tolstoy's How the Devil Stole the Peasants Hunk of Bread and The Candle. Blue House (1920). In 1909, he was elected into Imperial Academy of Arts. He continued to work intensively, but a grave illness--tuberculosis of the spine--required urgent attention. On the advice of his doctors he went to Switzerland, where he spent a year undergoing treatment in a private clinic. He pined for his distant homeland, and Russian themes continued to provide the basic material for the works he painted during that year. In 1918, he painted The Merchant's Wife, which became the most famous of his paintings. In 1916, he became paraplegic. \\"Now my whole world is my room\\", he wrote. His ability to remain joyful and lively despite his paralysis amazed others. His colourful paintings and joyful genre pieces do not reveal his physical suffering, and on the contrary give the impression of a carefree and cheerful life. His Pancake Tuesday/Maslenitsa (1916) and Fontanka (1916) are all painted from his memories. He meticulously restores his own childhood in the busy city on the Volga banks. Boris Kustodiyev 125th Anniversary exhibition at the Russian Museum. In the first years after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the artist worked with great inspiration in various fields. Contemporary themes became the basis for his work, being embodied in drawings for calendars and book covers, and in illustrations and sketches of street decorations, as well as some portraits (Portrait of Countess Grabowska). Kustodiev Trinity day, 1920 His covers for the journals The Red Cornfield and Red Panorama attracted attention because of their vividness and the sharpness of their subject matter. Kustodiev also worked in lithography, illustrating works by Nekrasov. His illustrations for Leskov's stories The Darner and Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District were landmarks in the history of Russian book designing, so well did they correspond to the literary images. =Stage design= The artist was also interested in designing stage scenery. He first started work in the theatre in 1911, when he designed the sets for Alexander Ostrovsky's An Ardent Heart. Such was his success that further orders came pouring in. In 1913, he designed the sets and costumes for The Death of Pazukhin at the Moscow Art Theatre. His talent in this sphere was especially apparent in his work for Ostrovsky's plays; It's a Family Affair, A Stroke of Luck, Wolves and Sheep, and The Storm. The milieu of Ostrovsky's plays--provincial life and the world of the merchant class--was close to Kustodiev's own genre paintings, and he worked easily and quickly on the stage sets. In 1923, Kustodiev joined the Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia. He continued to paint, make engravings, illustrate books, and design for the theater up until his death of tuberculosis on 28 May 1927, in Leningrad.

Intrigued by recent reports of cold fusion, they attempted to study potential causes for the effect by accelerating tiny droplets of heavy water, about 25 to 1300 D2O molecules each, into a target at about 220 eV. To their surprise they immediately saw fusion effects, at a rate that was many times what any of them could explain via conventional theory. The experiment was fairly simple in concept but required an appropriate accelerator, so it was some time before other labs were able to repeat the experiments. One of the first was the University of Washington, who reported a null result in 1991. Further experiments and a review from MIT in 1992 solved the mystery: the fusion products were the results of contamination, which could be eliminated by filtering with a magnet. The Brookhaven experimenters tried this and the effect disappeared. Cluster fusion references end abruptly at that point.

Caplin Cove was probably named for the large body of capelin in its waters. History Lower end of Caplin Cove Caplin Cove used to be a small fishing community, which had its own integrated elementary school, accommodating the community's Anglican, United, and Salvation Army students. The growth of service centres combined with the harsh environment of Conception Bay contributed to the decline in population of Caplin Cove. The growth of the fresh frozen fish industry, nearby seafood processing plants, improved roads, and new educational facilities contributed to Caplin Cove's survival. Timeline *1700s - Caplin Cove is first of the last settled by English fishermen. *1836 - Census reports a population of 44, most of whom are fishing servants. *Mid-19th century - Several families from Freshwater and Carbonear are settled in Caplin Cove. *1871 - Lovell's Newfoundland Dictionary reports 2 planters, George Cull And Michael Power, and fishermen Bussey, Stephen Compton, George Garland, Robert Keats, Charles, Job, John and Urias Reynolds, and Jacob, James and Peter Snelgrove *1935 - The population is 202. *1950s - Decline in cod fishery and the depression causes some families to leave the community *1951 - Population is reduced to 188, 28 of which are fishermen and 20 are labourers. *1973 - To improve shore facilities, a haul-up and landing block are built. *1980 - The small boat inshore cod fishery remained the main employment in this community, which in 1980 reported 22 full-time fisherman in 6 crews who drew each season for the traditional berths. During the fishing season, approximately 11,000 pounds of cod per week are hauled and trucked to the plants in Conception Bay. Squid is caught and shipped to Dildo. *1961 - High school students attend school in nearby Western Bay. *1972 - Elementary school students attend school in Western Bay. *1992 - High School and Elementary students attended school in Bay de Verde and Western Bay. *1997 - High school students attend school in nearby Northern Bay and elementary students attend school in Western Bay. *2005‚ÄìPresent Day - Elementary students attend school in Western Bay And Bay De Verde, While High School students attend school in Old Perlican. Geography The community of Caplin Cove for the most part is on gently sloping area much higher than the coast where the majority of the buildings have been built. A road which follows a brook runs from east to west and slopes to sea level to a beach below. The Brook which stretches from the far reaches of the boundaries which runs from west to east, fed by many deep and shallow watered ponds, spotted around the region, drains into the ocean slightly dividing the community in two. Caplin Cove also consists of many natural underground fresh water springs. It is a moderately wooded area consisting of primarily balsam fir trees.

It was built in 1975 to a height of , making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. The 55-story building is cylindrical, with an open centre allowing additional light into the apartments. The centre space is known as \\"the core\\" and rises above an uneven rock floor. When built, Ponte City was seen as an extremely desirable address due to its views over all of Johannesburg and its surroundings. The neon sign on top of the building is the largest sign in the southern hemisphere and advertised for the Coca-Cola Company prior to 2000. It currently advertises the South African mobile phone company Vodacom. History The principal designer of Ponte was Mannie Feldman, working in a team together with Manfred Hermer and Rodney Grosskopff.Chipkin, Clive, Johannesburg in Transition, STE Publishers, 2008Editors note in Housing in Southern Africa, 2006, Grosskopff recalled the decision to make the building circular, the first cylindrical skyscraper in Africa. At the time, Johannesburg bylaws required kitchens and bathrooms to have a window, so Grosskopff designed the building with a hollow interior, allowing light to enter the apartments from both sides. At the bottom of the immense building were retail stores and initial plans were to include an indoor ski slope on the inner core floor. The building was so tall because developers wanted a large number of units but had a limited land to build on. The building is located 35 minutes from the OR Tambo International Airport and almost within walking distance of the inner city with theatres like the Market and the Civic within . =Decay= During the late 1980s, gang activity had caused the crime rate to soar at the tower and the surrounding neighbourhood. By the 1990s, many gangs moved into the building and it became extremely unsafe. Ponte City became symbolic of the crime and urban decay gripping the once cosmopolitan Berea neighbourhood. The core filled with debris five stories high as the owners left the building to decay. There were even proposals in the mid-1990s to turn the building into a highrise prison. In 2001 Trafalgar Properties took over management of the building and began making numerous improvements. = New Ponte = Ponte City (left) with Hillbrow Tower In May 2007 Ponte changed ownership and a re-development project \\"New Ponte\\" was put in motion. David Selvan and Nour Addine Ayyoub under Ayyoub's company, Investagain, planned to revitalise the building completely. The planned development would have contained 467 residential units, retail and leisure-time areas. Over the next few years, the Johannesburg Development Agency planned to invest about R900 million in the areas around Ponte City such as the Ellis Park Precinct project as well as an upgrade of Hillbrow and Berea partly in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The subprime mortgage crisis caused the banks not to provide the funding required to finish the revitalisation and so the project was cancelled and ownership was given back to the Kempston Group.

Following the 1893 death of his brother Tieba Traor√©, Babemba assumed the K√©n√©dougou throne. The capital, Sikasso, was beset at this time by both the Mandinka forces of Samory Tour√© and by the rapidly advancing French colonial army. The neighboring Toucouleur Empire's capital at S√©gou had fallen to the French the previous year, leaving the French free to focus on subduing the K√©n√©dougou. In April 1898, the French began a major artillery barrage against Sikasso's walls; the city itself fell on May 1, 1898. Rather than surrender to the French, Babemba ordered his guards to kill him, an action still celebrated in Mali today. Samory Tour√© was captured in September of the same year, marking the effective end of West African resistance to French rule. History Mansa Douala, Traor√© was the father of Tieba Traore, Babemba (Bangaly Traore), and Sillatequi Traore and others. Tieba Traore was the youngest brother of Babemba Traore and Sillatequi(spelling) Traore, and after the war, and calm returned to Kenedougou the two elder brothers set out on a new journey in two different directions, for farming, the now Guinea direction and the now Burkina Faso direction, leaving Tieba Traore the youngest home with his mother, the youngest of the wives. Tieba Traore was left in charge of the family home with his mother, but realizing that his mother was not happy in Duru (spelling), he took off to his mother's home, Sikasso, Mali where he was warmly welcomed by his uncles and maternal family. Because of the status of the family, he was received as the head of the Traore, and the town Sikasso became the new headquarter of the Traore. He became a fearless warrior defending his people. He built a strong force in Sikasso and later the Tata (the wall) when it was heard that Samori Toure and his men were passing through Sikasso. Samori and his men arrived in Sikasso en route for an all out assault, he requested that the people of Sikasso give him 43 men and 43 women to take his war material and food to the battle ground, which Tieba Traore and his men refused, because they were ready to fight Samori Toure. Samori Toure and men could not enter the Tata (the wall) because it was fortified and any attempt by Toure and men could have resulted in a blood bath. Toure decided to take a chance by waiting at the Mamelon with his men where they survived on fruit's seeds. The seeds became trees and are a part of Sikasso's history. Samori Toure could not penetrate the town of Sikasso because of the wall. The people had already made sacrifice, making sure that they maintained control of the city of Sikasso. In the end, no war took place between Samouri Toure and Tieba Traore. When the French were about to extend their rule onto Sikasso, they called a meeting with Tieba Traore in Segou. After the meeting, the commander of the French forces decided to escort Tieba Traore back to Sikasso. Tieba Traore decided that leaving the commander to return was not in his best interest at that time. The force in Sikasso killed the French commander which led to the first all out confrontation between Tieba Traore and the French. The French forces were defeated during the first attack, and some were killed; their graves can be found in Sikasso. The French decided to regroup to attack Sikasso for the second time, and it was during the second attack that Tieba Traore didn't survive, but there are no details on his death. His brother Babemba was on the side now called Guinea when he learned about the war and his brother's death. He secretly left his family without any detail as to where he was going. During Babemba's stay in Sikasso, the French decided to make the final push to take complete control over the town of Sikasso, and it was during this time that Bambemba and the force of Tieba had to defend the town. But with heavy cannons, the French were able to blast the Tata (the wall) to enter the town of Sikasso and it became a blood bath. Babemba(Bangaly Traore) told his men that he would not going to be captured and treated the way Samori Toure was. He told one of his men to shoot him when he realized that there was no way out. Even though he was there to sympathize with his brother's family, he was also dissatisfied with the manner in which his sister was used as the sacrifice of the town of Sikasso. He could not hold his brother responsible for the fact that she was sacrificed in his absence, and that she volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb for the town to keep the town safe from Samori Toure and any attack. After Samori's departure from Sikasso, it was not too long that the French captured Samori Toure and he was sent to Gabon to serve time, and died there.

The 2012 Summer Olympics made London the first city to have hosted the modern Games of three Olympiads. London is the only city in the United Kingdom to have ever hosted the Olympics; the United States is the only country to have hosted Summer Olympics on more occasions than the UK. Also, London is the only city to have bid more than once and still hold a 100% record. British participation in Olympic events, both as a competitor and as a host, is the responsibility of the British Olympic Association.  1908 Summer Olympics  London 1908 Olympics The 1908 Summer Olympics (the Games of the IV Olympiad) were the fifth modern Olympic Games and the third to be hosted outside of Athens, Greece. The International Olympic Committee considers them the fourth Olympic Games, discounting the intercalated 1906 Summer Olympics. The 1908 Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Rome, but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 7 April 1906 required the Italian government to redirect funds away from the Olympics. The events took place between 27 April 1908 and 31 October 1908, with 22 nations participating in 110 events. The British team easily topped the unofficial medal count, finishing with three times as many medals as the second-place United States.  1944 Summer Olympics  The 1944 Summer Olympics (the Games of the XIII Olympiad) were scheduled to be held in London. Awarded in 1939, they were, however, cancelled due to World War II. These Games would have celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Modern Olympiad.  1948 Summer Olympics  The 1948 Summer Olympics (the Games of the XIV Olympiad) were the first to be held after World War II, with the 1944 Summer Olympics having been cancelled due to the war. Showing a collective unity after the war, 59 nations competed in 136 different events between 29 July 1948 and 14 August 1948. Germany and Japan were not invited to the games due to security reasons. Unlike the previous time the UK hosted the Olympics, the British athletes did not have a high medal count, finishing 12th in the unofficial medal count with only 21 medals.  2012 Summer Olympics  The 2012 Summer Olympics (the Games of the XXX Olympiad) took place between 27 July 2012 and 12 August 2012. The London 2012 Olympic bid was announced as the winner of the bidding process on 6 July 2005, following unsuccessful bid attempts for previous Olympics by Manchester and Birmingham. Team GB finished 3rd with 29 Gold medals, and 65 total medals, representing their best medal haul since London first hosted the Olympics in 1908.  2012 Summer Paralympics  The 2012 Summer Paralympics were the fourteenth Paralympics and took place between 29 August 2012 and 9 September 2012 at the Summer Olympics venues in London.

World War II defenses D-day assault map of Normandy and northwest coastal France In British phraseology, Fortress Europe meant the battle honour accorded to Royal Air Force and Allied squadrons during the war, but to qualify, operations had to be made by aircraft based in Britain against targets in Germany, Italy and other parts of German-occupied Europe, in the period from the fall of France to the Normandy invasion. Simultaneously, the term Festung Europa was being used by Nazi propaganda, namely to refer to Hitler's and the Wehrmacht's plans to fortify the whole of occupied Europe, in order to prevent invasion from the British Isle's troops. These measures included the construction of the Atlantic wall, along with reorganization of the Luftwaffe for air defense. This use of the term Fortress Europe was subsequently adopted by correspondents and historians in the English language to describe the military efforts of the Axis powers at defending the continent from the Allies. Postwar usage Identitarian Movement of Austria rally in Vienna on November 10, 2013.

For conservative parties such as the Freedom Party of Austria, 'Fortress Europe' is a positive term. They mostly claim that such a fortress does not really exist yet, and that illegal immigrants can enter Europe far too easily. They often charge the southern states with insufficient border control, claiming that the latter are acting on the knowledge that immigrants tend to be more attracted to western/northern states with more generous welfare systems (Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Sweden etc.). Conservatives all over Europe want to end the Schengen Agreement and to re-install border controls because they say it leads to mass migration of illegals and also free traffic of criminals.

History The smaller 22-story rear tower was built in 1970 as The Tollman Towers hotel, owned by the prominent hotelier Stanley Tollman. The property was purchased by Sol Kerzner's Southern Sun Hotels in the early 1980s and totally rebuilt at a cost of R100 million, with the addition of the 40-story main tower, linked to the older building by a four-story podium with a pool deck and a running track.

Together with Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin, he directed the release of the capital from the Poles, and for the time after the expulsion of the Poles and before the election of Mikhail Romanov, he was elected ruler of the Russian state. For his activities, he received the title of \\"Savior of the Fatherland\\" and was one of the contenders for the royal throne at the Zemsky Sobor of 1613.  Biography  Trubetskoy was first mentioned on April 11, 1607. He was in Kozelsk (probably as governor). He was dissatisfied with the policy of Vasily Shuisky and in December 1608 he joined the army of False Dmitry II. After the death of False Dmitry II, Trubetskoy enters into negotiations with Prokopy Lyapunov on the organization of the first rebellion to liberate Moscow from the Polish-Lithuanian occupiers and the ¬´Seven Boyars¬ª. The first militia in April‚ÄìMay 1611 stormed the walls of the \\"Zemlyanoy gorod\\" and the walls of the \\"Belyy gorod\\", freeing up most of Moscow (more than 95%), and locked up the Poles in the Kremlin and \\"Kitay gorod\\". After the split of the militia, Dmitry remained at the head of a few noble detachments and Cossack ‚Äúcamps‚Äù near Moscow (together with Ivan Zarutsky). In the fall of 1612, with an agreement on ‚Äúunity‚Äù, he headed (together with Prince Pozharsky and Minin) the combined military force and the Zemsky government. October 22, Cossacks of Dmitry Trubetskoy stormed Kitay Gorod. This day (November 4, according to the new style) in the 21st century became a national holiday of national unity. Two days later, the Poles began negotiations on surrender, and the Time of Troubles came to an end. Dmitry Trubetskoy, as the head of the Zemsky government, headed Russia before the election of Mikhail Romanov as tsar (March 3, 1613). Later, Mikhail Romanov appointed Trubetskoy governor to Siberia, where he died in Tobolsk on June 24, 1625. From Tobolsk, his body was transported for burial in the Trinity-Sergius Lavra. The grave of Trubetskoy is located in the underlining of the Trinity Cathedral next to the graves of his brother, father and first wife.

It was first described by Oldfield Thomas in 1888, after he identified that a museum specimen labelled as an eastern pygmy possum in fact represented a species then unknown to science. The holotype resides in the British Museum of Natural History. Description Although it is a marsupial, the Tasmanian pygmy possum superficially resembles a dormouse, and it is the smallest of all the known species of possum. Adults range from in head-body length, with a tail, and weigh just . Their fur is soft and thick, and is fawn in colour over most of the body, fading to a pale grey on the underparts. The snout is short with long whiskers, and the eyes are directed forwards and surrounded by slightly darker fur, although without the conspicuous black rings seen on other pygmy possums. The ears are mobile and largely hairless. The tail is prehensile, and thickly furred at the base, which may be widened by fat stores beneath the skin. The remainder of the tail is relatively narrow and cylindrical, with only sparse hair between numerous tiny scales. Distribution and habitat The Tasmanian pygmy possum is found throughout Tasmania, but was at one time thought to be extinct elsewhere. In 1964, a living animal was discovered on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and further populations have since been discovered in the Murray-Darling basin in South Australia and Victoria. There are no formally recognised subspecies, although it has been proposed, based on genetic information, that the mainland and Tasmanian populations may be subspecies, or even entirely separate species. They inhabit sclerophyll forest, mallee, and open heathland vegetation. The oldest fossils for this species date from the late Pleistocene, and were found on the mainland, with the oldest known Tasmanian fossils being much younger. Fossils have been found as far afield as eastern Victoria and New South Wales, suggesting that the species was once much more widespread than it is today. Behaviour The Tasmanian pygmy possum is nocturnal and arboreal. It lives primarily in shrubland or forest undergrowth, and, although a good climber, rarely ventures into the higher branches of trees, presumably because this would make it more vulnerable to avian predators. Pygmy possums use strips of bark to construct dome-like nests in tree cavities or rotten wood, but are solitary animals that do not share their nests with other individuals except for their own young. Biology Tasmanian pygmy possums are omnivorous, feeding on insects, spiders, small lizards, nectar, and pollen, the latter two primarily coming from Banksia and eucalypts. Their preference for eating pollen without destroying the host flower may mean that they help to pollinate some species of plant. Known predators include Tasmanian devils, quolls, kookaburra, masked owls, and tiger snakes. During cold weather, especially below about 6 ¬∞C (43 ¬∞F), Tasmanian pygmy possums have the ability to enter torpor. While in this state, body temperature drops, and oxygen consumption falls to just 1% of normal. Breeding occurs throughout the year, although it may be more common in spring and summer. The female has a well-developed pouch containing four teats, which therefore limits the maximum size of a litter to this number. The young leave the pouch at around 42 days, although they may cling to the mother's fur and be carried about after this age. They leave the nest to fend for themselves at around 90 days of age.

From 1600 until the second half of the 20th century, the north and west had embraced the Protestant Reformation and were Calvinist. The southeast was predominately Catholic.see map Associated with immigration from North Africa and the Mideast of the 20th century, Muslims and other minority religions were concentrated in ethnic neighborhoods in the cities. Since the 1960s the Netherlands has become one of the most secular countries in the western world. In a December 2014 survey by VU Amsterdam, for the first time more atheists (25%) were reported than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the remainder of the population identified as agnostic (31%) or ietsist (27%). Altar for Nehalennia AD 150-250 Prehistory and Early Middle Ages Before the advent of Christianity, the Netherlands were populated by Celtic tribes in the South, which adhered to Celtic polytheism, and Germanic tribes in the North, which adhered to Germanic paganism. After the Roman Empire occupied the later southern Netherlands, Roman mythology became important there, as well as religions from the Middle East, including relics from Egyptian mythology, Judaism, Mithraism and later Christianity. The oldest data on the profession of religion by the inhabitants of the regions that are now the \\"Netherlands\\" were passed down by the Romans. Contrary to what ancient sources seem to suggest, the Rhine, which clearly formed the boundary of the Roman Empire, did not form the boundary between residential areas of Celts and Germans. Germans settled south of it (Germani Cisrhenani), and many place names and archaeological finds indicate the presence of Celts north of the Rhine. Between these \\"Celtic - Germanic peoples\\" and later the Roman conquerors (romanization) a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and other myths occurred among the various tribes, absorbing influences from Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. Gods such as Nehalennia, Hludana and Sandraudiga are of indigenous (Celtic) origin; the Germanic people had such gods as Wodan, Donar and Frigg/Freya from Scandinavia. Jupiter, Minerva and Venus were introduced by the Romans. Tacitus described the creation myth of Mannus, a primitive man from which all Germanic tribes were said to have emerged. The Celts and Germans in the Low Countries were also most likely to have had tree shrines, following the example of the Old Norse Yggdrasil and the Saxon Irminsul and Donar's oak. Temples were probably built only during and after the romanization. Examples have been preserved in Empel and Elst. From the 4th to the 6th century AD, the Great Migration took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the Franks, the Frisians and Saxons. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the Somme, adopted Christianity, forced by their king Chlodovech. A large part of the area south of the Meuse River was controlled from the early Middle Ages to 1559 by Archdeacon of Kempenland, which was part of the Diocese of Tongeren-Maastricht-Li√®ge. The see of this diocese, successively the cities of Tongeren, Maastricht and Li√®ge, made up the base by which this part of the Netherlands was probably Christianized. According to tradition, the first Bishop of Maastricht, Servatius, was buried in this city in 384 CE. Only Bishop Domitianus (c. 535) is documented as having resided in Maastricht. At the start of the 6th century, the first (Hiberno-Scottish) missionaries arrived. They were later replaced by Anglo-Saxon missionaries, who eventually succeeded in converting most of the inhabitants of the southern Netherlands to Christianity by the 8th century. From the late 7th century, missionaries coming from England and Ireland, such as Boniface, Lebuinus, Ludger, Plechelm, Willehad and especially Willibrord, sought to convert the inhabitants of the areas north of the Meuse and Rhine rivers to Christianity. They had varying degrees of success, as attested by the (not always reliable) descriptions of their lives that have been written about them. While some sermons yielded success, Frisian king Radboud refused to be baptized by Wulfram. Because he was assured of getting to heaven if he repented and converted, Radboud instead chose an afterlife with his ancestors who, according to Wulfram, were in hell. After the Frisian‚ÄìFrankish wars (c. 600-793) and the Saxon Wars (772-804), the Low Countries all fell under the rule of the Christian Frankish kings. They wanted their people to be both religious and political subjects, as the kings claimed divine right of leadership. The Old Saxon Baptismal Vow describes how one must renounce his old gods (described as \\"devils\\") and submit to the Christian Trinity. In the 8th century, Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as Boniface continued efforts to Christianize the land inhabited by the Frisians. But Boniface was killed in 754 near Dokkum by the Frisians, because they thought he carried gold. The missionaries gradually succeeded in the conversion of the North in the 8th century. By the beginning of the 9th century, the Saxon-controlled northeastern regions were also subjugated and Christianized by Lebuinus, Plechelmus and Ludgerus. It took until 1000 CE before all pagan people were Christianized, and the Frisian and Saxon religions had died out. Elements of these religions were absorbed into the Christian religion, which is syncretic. During the following centuries, Catholic Christianity was the main religion in the Netherlands, but other practices likely survived in the conservative societies of the villages. The Old Saxon Baptismal Vow: \\"Forsachistu diobolae..\\" (Forsake devils) and \\"gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer\\" (believe in god almighty father). Left caption in a later writing: \\"Abrinuciatio diaboli lingua Teotisca veter.\\" = (abjuration of the devil in Old German). Under the Baptismal Vow in Latin is an enumeration of the first 20 practices in the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum. High and Late Middle Ages Thomas √† Kempis, the author of The Imitation of Christ (c. 1418‚Äì1427) Religious life was ubiquitous in medieval society. Important abbeys such Rolduc, Susteren, Sint Odili√´nberg and Egmond were highly influential in the countryside. They were centers of learning and literacy. In the Christian centers of Utrecht and Maastricht, powerful chapters were established. From the 13th century, monastic and knightly orders settled in many cities, such as the Franciscans, Dominicans and knights of the Teutonic Order. They also took part in many of the 12th- and 13th-century crusades to the Holy Land (see Frisian participation in the Crusades). Where justice until the 12th century existed largely in actions by kangaroo courts, which often administered trial by ordeal to establish a person's guilt or innocence, in the course of the 12th century, the ecclesiastical and secular powers took over more control of the justice system. The church rules (in particular by the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215) and the monarchs maintained the order. At the end of the Middle Ages, the Devotio Moderna (among others Geert Groote and Thomas √† Kempis) created a spiritual innovation. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the first calls were heard for religious reform from within the Catholic Church. Geert Groote established the Brethren of the Common Life, an influential mystical order. The influence of humanism (particularly through the teachings of Erasmus and Dirck Coornhert) changed the Dutch world. It began to shift from a theocentric to an anthropocentric worldview. Reformation in the Early Modern Period Erasmus in 1523 as depicted by Hans Holbein the Younger Hugo Grotius Portrait of Benedictus de Spinoza (painting by an unknown artist, ca. 1665), the author of Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670) Catholicism dominated Dutch religion until the early 16th century, when the Protestant Reformation began to develop. Lutheranism did not gain much support among the Dutch, but Calvinism, introduced two decades later, did. It began its spread in the Westhoek and the County of Flanders, where secret sermons in Dutch, called hagenpreken (\\"hedgerow orations\\"), were held outdoors. Gradually discontent among the Dutch grew, and erupted in 1566 with the so-called Beeldenstorm, a surge of iconoclasm. This quickly spread among all Dutch regions and finally resulted in what would become the Dutch revolt from Catholicism and Spanish control. During the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, an independent Dutch religious tradition began to take shape in the northern parts of the independent Netherlands. The most prominent Dutch theologian was the humanist Desiderius Erasmus. He was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, but he kept his distance from Martin Luther and Philip Melancthon. He continued to recognise the authority of the Pope. Erasmus emphasized a middle way, with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, and rejected Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus therefore remained a Catholic all his life. In relation to clerical abuses in the Church, Erasmus remained committed to reforming the Church from within. He also held to Catholic doctrines such as that of free will, which some Calvinist Reformers rejected in favour of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road approach disappointed and even angered scholars in both camps.Manfred Hoffmann, \\"Faith and Piety in Erasmus's Thought,\\" Sixteenth Century Journal (1989) 20#2 pp 241-258 Menno Simons. The Mennonites are named after him. Jacobus Arminius, the Reformed theologian and the father of Arminianism. Cornelius Otto Jansen, the father of the Roman Catholic reform movement known as Jansenism in the Southern Netherlands. The 16th and 17th century were characterized by the Protestant Reformation, which greatly influenced the history of the Netherlands, especially in western and northern areas of the country. They also had influence with the eastern English shires, with which they were in contact through trading across the North Sea. The first wave of Reformation, initiated by Luther, did not come to the Netherlands. The second wave of the Protestant Reformation, Anabaptism, became very popular in the counties of Holland and Friesland. Anabaptists were very radical and believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was Menno Simons, who initiated the Mennonite church. Another Anabaptist, Jantje van Leyden became the ruler of a newly founded city, New Jerusalem. Anabaptists survived throughout the centuries and they were recognized by the States-General of the Netherlands in 1578. Institutionalized Dutch baptism was a model for both English and American Baptists. The third wave of the Reformation, Calvinism, arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s. Part of both the elite and commoners, mostly in Flanders, adopted this influence. Then in control of the Low Countries, the Spanish government, under Philip II started harsh persecution campaigns, supported by the Inquisition of the Catholic Church, as Protestantism was seen as threatening the royal government. In reaction to this persecution, the Calvinists rebelled. In the Beeldenstorm in 1566, they conducted iconoclasm, destroying statues, paintings, and other religious depictions and artifacts in churches. Also in 1566 William the Silent, Prince of Orange, a convert to Calvinism, started the Eighty Years' War to liberate the Calvinist Dutch from the Catholic Spaniards. The counties of Holland and Zeeland were conquered by Calvinists in 1572. Numerous residents were already Calvinist in Holland and Zeeland at that time, but the other states were still almost entirely Catholic. The estates of Holland, led by Paulus Buys, decided to support William the Silent. All churches in the Calvinist territories became Calvinist and most of the population in these territories converted to or were forced to convert to Calvinism. Because the Netherlands had gained independence from Spain over both political and religious issues, it chose to practice certain forms of tolerance toward people of certain other religions. It opened its borders for religious dissenters (Protestants and Jews) from elsewhere. For instance, Ren√© Descartes, a French Protestant, lived in the Netherlands for most of his adult life. As the Reformation reached England, some Puritans fled from persecution to Amsterdam and other Dutch cities. (Jews had been expelled from Spain and Portugal in the late 15th and 16th centuries if they refused to convert to Catholicism, and were prohibited from England.) But the Calvinist- dominated areas maintained persecution and later discrimination against native Dutch Catholics. Philip II of Spain was the hereditary ruler of the Netherlands. As a devout Catholic, Philip believed he was obligated to fight Protestantism, which also threatened his rule. After the Beeldenstorm, he sent troops to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands. The Spanish conquered the southern Netherlands (Flanders and Brabant). Protestants in this area, many of them prosperous merchants, fled en masse to Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland. An extreme example was the city of Hondschoote, where the population dropped from 18,000 to 385 inhabitants. Antwerp, formerly the most powerful city in the Low Countries, lost more than half its residents to this exodus.Israel, Jonathan Irvine (1995) The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806. In the Calvinist-controlled northern counties, many of the remaining Catholics were tending toward converting to Protestantism for temporal gain, to survive in the changed society. In the early 17th century, the Roman Catholic Jesuits launched a Counter Reformation in order to rekindle faith among Catholics. In those areas where the Jesuits could operate, the Dutch Catholics were supported in their faith and some Calvinists reverted to Catholicism. However, the number of Catholics dwindled due to the lack of priests, especially in rural areas of Gelre, Overijssel, Groningen, and Friesland. At the same time, the larger western cities received an influx of Protestant immigrants from Germany, Flanders, and France and developed a Protestant character. Strict Calvinists converted a belt of land from the southwest (the province of Zeeland), via the Veluwe, to the north of the Netherlands (to the city of Staphorst) during the 17th and even as late as the 18th centuries. This remains strictly Calvinist until this day. During the Twelve Years' Truce (between 1609 and 1621) in the Eighty Years' War, a civil war along religious lines developed in the Netherlands. The Synod of Dort tried to bring an end to an internal theological conflict within the Calvinist church between two tendencies of Calvinism: the liberal Arminians or Remonstrants and the strict Gomarists or Contra-Remonstrants. Civil war broke out in the 1610s between strict and liberal Calvinists. The liberal States of Holland left the Republic. The strict Calvinist side won (Prince Maurice of Orange and the other provinces) and Johan van Oldebarnevelt, the official head of state of the County of Holland, was executed. Calvinism became the de facto state religion. Only Calvinists (and, in some cases, Jews) were allowed to hold political office. Other Christian denominations were mostly tolerated, although discriminated against, and believers were not allowed to practice their religion in public. Judaism was allowed in public, and Lutheranism only in larger cities. It was permitted only on the condition of the congregations maintaining Calvinist church interior styles, without having crucifixes, as were still displayed in Scandinavian Lutheran cathedrals. In 1648, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire recognized the independence of the Netherlands in the Treaty of Westphalia. The Netherlands included the \\"Seven Provinces\\" of the Dutch Republic, which were Protestant, but also a Roman Catholic area. This Generaliteitsland was governed by the States-General; it roughly included the current provinces of North Brabant and Limburg. The Netherlands became known among dissenting Anglicans (such as Puritans), many Protestants, and Jews for its relative religious tolerance; it became a refuge for the persecuted and a home for many of these immigrants. English Puritans in Amsterdam formed what was known as the \\"Ancient Church of Amsterdam\\", whose leaders included wealthy merchants such as Edward Bennett (1577-bef. 1651), a member of the Virginia Company and later developer of a large plantation in the colony of Virginia beginning in the mid-1620s. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the proportion of first-generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands among the population of Amsterdam was nearly 50%. Many Jews, especially from Antwerp, migrated to Amsterdam. Jews governed their communities under their own laws and formed a separate society. The Netherlands hosted religious refugees, including Puritans from England (the most famous of the latter were the Pilgrims, who in the early 17th century emigrated to what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony in North America). Protestant Huguenots from France fled to Amsterdam after repeal in 1689 of the Edict of Nantes and renewed persecution and attacks from Catholics. 19th century Abraham Kuyper Religious division in the Netherlands in 1849. Catholicism holds a majority in green areas. Protestantism holds a majority in red areas. During the 19th century, there was a rising conflict among Catholics, liberal Calvinists, and orthodox Calvinists. The Dutch solution, known as pillarization, lasted until the 1960s. Following the invasion of forces of Revolutionary France in 1795, the Batavian Republic was established for a time, creating equal rights for all religions in the Netherlands. In 1813, the Calvinist Republic united with the Catholic Southern Netherlands to form the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union split in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, which was partially motivated by religious differences between Protestants and Catholics, as well as by the political split between Orangists (royalists) and Liberals (mainly from Brussels and Ghent). The position of Catholics in the Kingdom of the Netherlands worsened. The Catholic episcopal hierarchy was forbidden and Catholics were forbidden to hold religious processions in all provinces except for Noord Brabant and Limburg. A liberal Calvinist elite dominated the Netherlands for a period, including the national bureaucracy and the Dutch Reformed Church. An opposition movement developed. In 1834, led by Rev. Hendrik de Cock, a group seceded from the Dutch Reformed Church in what was known as the Afscheiding. Roughly fifty years later, in 1886, another group of orthodox Calvinists, led by Abraham Kuyper, split from the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1892, they founded the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, one of the major neo-Calvinist denominations. Kuyper also organized a range of religiously inspired organizations. He was inspired by his conception of sphere sovereignty, the separation of Church and State. He founded an orthodox Calvinist newspaper, labour union, schools, a university and a political party.James D. Bratt, Abraham Kuyper: Modern Calvinist, Christian Democrat (2012) During this period Catholics began to develop their own non- governmental institutions. The Netherlands became dominated among three religious pillars, an orthodox Calvinist, a Catholic, and a neutral one. These subcultures generally did not interfere with each other. During the 20th century, a separate socialist pillar would also develop. This phenomenon is called pillarization. There was considerable religious tolerance among these subcultures, and they cooperated with each other at the level of government. The social distance grew. People read different newspapers; by the 1930s they listened to different radio programs. Catholic and Protestant children generally lived in different neighborhoods and provinces, and did not play together. Adults did not socialize across religious lines. Marriage across religious lines grew rare.On the decline of intermarriage see Erik Beekink, et al. \\"Changes in Choice of Spouse as an Indicator of a Society in a State of Transition: Woerden, 1830‚Äì1930,\\" Historical Social Research (1998) 23#1 pp 231-253. Jews had become fully integrated into Dutch society after 1795. Most Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries became later become aligned within the socialist pillar, Many became highly secularized and adopted mainstream dress rather than that associated with Orthodox Judaism. They formed a considerable minority, especially in certain cities: one-eighth of the population of Amsterdam was Jewish.Yosef Kaplan, The Dutch Intersection: The Jews and the Netherlands in Modern History (2008) The Second World War In 1940, the Netherlands was occupied by Nazi Germany. Their forces rounded up and deported most of the Dutch Jewish community to concentration camps in eastern Europe, exterminating them. by the Nazis during this occupation. In February 1941 after Nazi occupation, a general strike took place in Amsterdam and the surrounding areas against the first razzia, a raid to collect Jews. This was the largest act of resistance in the Netherlands against the persecution of Jews during the Second World War. The main resistance groups were composed of conservative Calvinists, Communists and Catholics, while liberals and others were underrepresented. An important action of the resistance movement was hiding Jews from Nazis. There were 140,000 Jews recorded in 1940 in the Netherlands. 20,000 of them were free from persecution, because they were married to Aryans, or because some of their parents and grandparents were non- Jews. Another 20,000 Jews hid from the Germans. Of the 101,000 Jews that the Nazis deported, only 1,000 returned after the war. The percentage of Dutch Jews who were exterminated was much higher than in other countries, including Germany. Secularization Until late into the 20th century, the predominant religion in the Netherlands was Christianity. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline of religious adherence and practice in the 21st century. In 2006, 34 percent of the Dutch population identified as Christian church members. In 2015, that had declined to about 25 percent (11.7% Roman Catholic, 8.6% PKN, 4.2% other small Protestant denominations). Another 5 percent is Muslim (primarily immigrants or descendants of majority- Islam states), and 2 percent adheres to Hinduism or Buddhism. These percentages are based on independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.http://nos.nl/artikel/2092498-hoe- god-bijna-verdween-uit-nederland.html In 2015 approximately 67.8% of the population claimed no no religious affiliation, up from 61% in 2006, 53% in 1996, 43% 1979, and 33% in 1966.God in Nederland 1966-2015, dr. Ton Bernts, dr. ir. Joantine Berghuijs, Publisher: Uitgeverij Ten Have, In 2007, the Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (Social and Cultural Planning Agency, SCP) expected the number of non-affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020.Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, God in Nederland (2006/2007) Secularization, or the decline in religious adherence and practice, first became noticeable after 1960 in the Protestant rural towns of Friesland and Groningen. It became more obvious in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other large cities in the west. Finally the Catholic south also showed declines in religious practice and belief. By contrast, there has been a religious revival in the Protestant Bible Belt of the Netherlands. In addition, there has been growth of Hindu and Muslim communities as a result of immigration and higher birth rates.Hans Knippenberg, \\"Secularization in the Netherlands in its historical and geographical dimensions,\\" GeoJournal (1998) 45#3 pp 209-220. onlineTom√°≈° Sobotka and Feray Adig√ºzel, \\"Religiosity and spatial demographic differences in the Netherlands\\" (2002) online After the Second World War the major religions began to decline. With higher immigration of workers from North Africa and the Mideast, the number of people practicing Islam increased. During the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional pillarization began to weaken and the population became less religious. In 1971, 39% of the Dutch population were members of the Roman Catholic Church; by 2014, their share of the population had dropped to 23.3% (church-provided KASKI data). The proportion of adherents of mainline Protestantism declined in the same period from 31% to 10% (church-provided KASKI data). Godsdienstige veranderingen in Nederland, Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau, September 2006 KASKI (Katholiek Sociaal- Kerkelijk Insituut / Catholic Social-Ecclesiastical Institutehttp://www.ru.nl/kaski/) is based on self-reported information by the Catholic and Protestant churches.http://www.ru.nl/kaski/onderzoek/cijfers- overige/ They reported higher number of church members than what was found by independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Some of that may be attributed to methods of data collection. According tot KASKI, the total number of members of Christian groups in the Netherlands has decreased from approximately 7,013,163 (43.22% overall population) in 2003 to 5,730,852 (34.15% overall population) in 2013.http://www.ru.nl/kaski/onderzoek/onderzoeksvormen/ An additional 4.2% of the population adhere to other Protestant churches. With 32.2% of the Dutch identifying as adhering to a religion, among which 25% adhere to Christianity and 5% to Islam, the Netherlands is one of the least religious countries of Europe. During the late 20th century, in keeping with changes in their society, the Dutch liberalized their policies on abortion, drug use, euthanasia, homosexuality, and prostitution. As a result of the declining religious adherence, the two major strands of Calvinism, the Dutch Reformed Church and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, together with a small Lutheran group, began to cooperate. They identified first as the Samen op weg Kerken (\\"Together on the road churches\\"). Since 2004, they formed the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, a united Protestant church. During the same period, Islam increased from 0% to 5%. The main Islamic immigrants came from Surinam and Indonesia, as a result of decolonization; Turkey and Morocco, as migrant workers; and Iraq, Iran, Bosnia and Afghanistan as political refugees. In the early 21st century, religious tensions between native Dutch people and migrant Muslims has increased in some areas. The popular politician Pim Fortuyn provoked controversy by defending the Dutch liberal culture against what he considered a \\"backward religion\\", conservative Islam. Fortuyn: grens dicht voor islamiet, Volkskrant, 2002-02-09 Stricter immigration laws were enacted. Religious tensions heightened after film director Theo van Gogh was killed in 2004 by Mohammed Bouyeri. A December 2014 survey by the VU University Amsterdam concluded that, for the first time, there were more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the population identified as agnostic (31%) or ietsistic (27%). In the 21st century, a large majority of the Dutch population believes in the separation of church and state, that is, that religion should not play a decisive role in politics or public education. Religion is also decreasingly seen as a social binder. Religion in the Netherlands is generally considered a personal matter, which is not supposed to be propagated in public.Donk, W.B.H.J. van de; Jonkers, A.P.; Kronjee, G.J.; Plum, R.J.J.M. (2006) Atheism, ietsism, agnosticism, and Christian atheism keep rising; the first three being widely accepted and the last being more or less considered to be non-controversial. Among those who adhere to Christianity there are high percentages of atheists, agnostics and ietsists, since affiliation with a Christian denomination is also used in a way of cultural identification in the different parts (especially the south) of the Netherlands.H. Knippenberg, \\"The Changing Religious Landscape of Europe\\", Het Spinhuis, Amsterdam 2005 According to research in 2015, a more generalized rise in individual spirituality has ended. In 2006, 40 percent of respondents considered themselves spiritual. But in 2015, this had dropped to 31 percent. According to the CBS in 2018, 53% of the Dutch were religiously unaffiliated, 37% were Christians (out of whom 22% registered Catholics, 15% Protestants ‚Äì 6% PKN + 6% hervormd + 3% gereformeerd), 5% were Muslims, and 5% adherents of other religions.

It served as the location of an early convict settlement in the early history of Van Diemen's Land, and contrasts sharply with the more developed and populous northern and eastern parts of the island state. Western Tasmania and South West Tasmania with natural resources on 1865 map Climate The west coast has a much cooler and wetter climate when compared to the east coast. Frequent low pressure systems hit the west coast causing heavy rain, snow, and ice. The West Coast Range blocks these systems from impacting the east, therefore making the West Coast a rain catchment with some areas receiving over of rain a year. In winter temperatures at sea level hover around , and when not raining, morning frost is common. The temperatures are much lower inland from the coast with maximums in winter often failing to surpass . Typically, the snow line in winter is around 900 metres (3000 ft), however sea level snow falls several times each winter as well. Summer is mild with maximum temperatures averaging between and , though some days still fail to reach . Despite snowfall usually occurring in winter, it has been known to fall in the middle of summer. The ethos Many outsiders have had difficulty understanding the isolation of the west coast, and the small communities, and the historical context to that isolation. Initially the only way in and out was by sea, and no serviceable roads to either the north or east existed until the 1930s (east) or the 1960s (north). Railways were the main land connection from the 1920s to the 1960s - though that connection was with the north coast, rather than the more populous southeast.See - Railways on the West Coast of Tasmania The treacherous conditions at Hell's Gates at the mouth of Macquarie Harbour, and ocean travel along the exposed western side of Tasmania have made marine travel a dangerous pastime even to the current day, despite modern technology. Memorial plaques to recent lost sailors on the wall at the northern edge of the Strahan wharf illustrate this. The current airstrip is at Strahan, with the airstrip at Queenstown no longer a current registered landing ground. In the 1970s a regular service to the east coast was run by Airlines of Tasmania. All transport services to the west coast are subject to interruption by severe weather. In addition to closures of air and marine service, the roads to the west coast may be blocked for days at a time by ice and snow during severe winter conditions. Hell's Gates, entrance to Macquarie harbour, Western Tasmania The consequence of the isolation, and the ways that the communities coped with the difficulties, were little examined prior to the 1990s, except for parts of Tim Bowden's 1979 Radio Documentary \\"The West Coasters\\", and various references in Geoffrey Blainey's \\"The Peaks of Lyell\\" book and the important works of C.J. Binks http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/617762?q=creator%3A%22Binks%2C+C.+J%22&c;=people and Kerry Pink.http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/554087?q=creator%3A%22Pink%2C+Kerry.%22&c;=people Since the rise of tourism on the west coast, the Franklin Dam issue and the creation of the world heritage wilderness area, a steady number of small publications concerning the history and features of the region have been produced. For a brief time in the early 20th century the west coast had population and political power on a parity with Hobart and Launceston. Following the demise of most of the Zeehan mines, the west coast population has either remained static, or declined relative to other parts of the island. The legacy The environment is described with particular historical understanding by C.J. Binks in \\"Explorers of Western Tasmania\\" Chapter 2 - \\"A Sketch of the Western Country\\". See also West Coast Range The convict era is introduced in articles about Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, Convicts on the West Coast of Tasmania, and Hell's Gates. The reliance on the railways can be found in the separate article West Coast Tasmania Railways. The mining history was captured first in Charles Whitham's Western Tasmania book - and Geoffrey Blainey's Peaks of Lyell and the books that have followed. See also the list at West Coast Tasmania Mines for a list that includes historical names and locations - many now long abandoned. The vast tracts of forest (Huon Pine, among others) in the west coast region have been subject to fire, and exploitation - as well as significant areas now under conservation. The history of the West Coast Piners who utilised the Franklin River and Gordon River and their tributaries is a vital part of west coast history. The legacy of the Hydro Electric Commission (The Hydro) on the west coast is a complex one, due to its sense in the 1940s to 1980s considering the west and south west regions as its 'last frontier' for the remaining catchments for its power development schemes. Photographic record As most of the European activity on the west coast (after the convict era) lies within the invention and use of the camera, most aspects of west coast history have been captured on film. The Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, and the State Library of Tasmania in Hobart are the main holdings of the record, while the late Eric Thomas's collection in the 'Galley Museum' in Queenstown is on a par with both. Some examples of collections: - * Hurley, Frank. Tasmania, A Camera Study John Sands, 1953 * Cox, G.W. and Ratcliff, E.V.R. Tasmania Remembered ( H.J.

Due to the rise of tourism in the 1990s - a considerable number of DVDs and videos are commercially available of the region - going into areas which had been inaccessible as recently as 30 or 40 years ago. Also tourists and hikers have gathered a considerable record of the region which regularly appears in either their own or generally accessible websites on the internet. Bioregion The Tasmanian West bioregion comprises the West Coast region and the South West region. Locality The gazetted locality/suburb named \\"West Coast\\" covers a largely uninhabited region between the Arthur River and Queenstown, and doesn't include the populated towns in the West Coast region. It is in the local government areas of Circular Head (34.6%), Kentish (0.3%), Waratah-Wynyard (27.1%), and West Coast (38%). Its central point is about west of the town of Sheffield. The 2016 census has a population of nil for the state suburb of West Coast. The Southern Ocean forms part of the western boundary. The locality encircles Corinna, Renison Bell, Rosebery and Zeehan, and is adjoined by the localities of Arthur River, Couta Rocks, Cradle Mountain, Gormanston, Granville Harbour, Guildford, Lake Margaret, Lileah, Luina, Mawbanna, Middlesex, Nelson Bay, Parrawe, Queenstown, Roger River, Savage River, Southwest, Strahan, Temma, Togari, Trial Harbour, Trowutta, Tullah, Waratah, and West Takone.

She occasionally writes under the pen name 'Hu Meili' (). Lung's poignant and critical essays contributed to the democratization of Taiwan and as the only Taiwanese writer with a column in major mainland Chinese newspapers, she is an influential writer in Mainland China. She has written 17 books. Lung Ying-tai has held two positions within Taiwan's government as Taipei's first Cultural Bureau Chief (1999‚Äì2003) and as Taiwan's first Culture Minister (2012‚Äì2014). Early life Lung's father, Lung Huai- sheng (), a Kuomintang military police officer, moved his family to Taiwan after the KMT lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949. She is her parents' second child and has four brothers. The first character of Lung's given name, ying (), is her mother's family name ( Ying Mei-jun), and the second character, tai (), is to signify that she is the first child in the family to be born in Taiwan. After attending National Tainan Girls' Senior High School, Lung received her bachelor's degree in Foreign Language and Literature from the National Cheng Kung University and a PhD from Kansas State University in English and American Literature. Early career After returning to Taiwan, she began writing an op-ed column in China Times on the various conditions in Taiwan. Her essays were published together in 1985 in a book of social- political criticism, \\"The Wild Fire,\\" (Ye Huo Ji ÈáéÁÅ´ÈõÜ) when Taiwan was still under the Kuomintang's one-party rule, which cemented her role as an intellectual in Taiwan. She moved to Germany in 1987, partly due to the response to her work that included death threats. Her translated essays had appeared in European newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Her work has appeared in mainland Chinese newspapers since the early 1990s. Her essays include \\"Children Take Your Time,\\" \\"Silver Cactus\\", \\"Rise of thinking,\\" and in 2006, \\"Please Use Civilization to Convince Me\\", an open letter to Hu Jintao following the temporary closure of Freezing Point. She criticised Singaporean minister Lee Kuan Yew and the government's restrictions on personal freedom in 1994 in an article titled, \\"Thank God I Am Not Singaporean\\". She returned to Taiwan to become the first Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau of Taipei in September 1999, and her policies increased the visibility of the arts in Taipei during her four-year term. She resigned in March 2003 to return to writing, noting that \\"being an official is suffocating. I could hardly breathe.\\" Minister Lung during the Free China Boat Homecoming Ceremony in Zhongshan Hall on 11 July 2012. She joined the Journalism and Media Studies Centre of the University of Hong Kong in August 2004. In July 2005, she established the Lung Ying-tai Cultural Foundation and used the foundation as a platform to sponsor literary and artistic endeavours as well as academic lectures. In 2007, Lung was offered a position on the seat on the Control Yuan which she refused. Since 2008 Lung Ying-tai has undertaken the position of Hung Leung Hao Ling Distinguished Fellow in Humanities of University of Hong Kong and Chair Professor of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. She received the 2009 K.T. Li Chair Professor Award from NCKU. Her 2009 book \\"Da Jiang Da Hai 1949\\" (Big River, Big Sea) is about the 1949 civil war and the escape to Taiwan of supporters of the Kuomintang. It sold over 100,000 copies in Taiwan and 10,000 in Hong Kong in its first month of release, but discussion of her work was banned in mainland China following the book launch. In 2009, her book Watching You Go (Musong ÁõÆÈÄÅ) was published, becoming popular across Asia. The book is a collection of 74 works of prose narrating hardships and obstacles Lung has encountered, particularly in relation to her family. Upon the creation of the Ministry of Culture in May 2012 she became the first Minister of Culture of Taiwan. Minister of Culture Lung was inaugurated as Minister of Culture on 21 May 2012, stating a desire that the ministry be independent of political influence. During her 2-year, 7-month tenure, she made statements or announced initiatives on reading, TV culture, and cross-strait exchanges.http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan- relations/2013/04/30/377368/Reciprocity-key.htm On 1 December 2014, Lung tendered her resignation from the ministerial post citing her aging mother as the main reason, with political and media hostility as contributing factors. Personal life After moving to Germany in the late 1980s, she married a German man with whom she has two sons. She was also known as Ying-tai Walther. They were eventually divorced. One of Lung's books, Dear Andreas („ÄäË¶™ÊÑõÁöÑÂÆâÂæ∑ÁÉà„Äã), is a collection of letters and e-mails between her and her older son.

It is located at the corner of 5 Simmonds Street and 78 Fox Street in the Central Business District of the city. Construction of the building started in 1968 and was completed in 1968. It is tall. It was also home to Standard Bank, until the company moved to other site in 1990. The building was built from the top-down, meaning that after the central core was built, the floors were suspended from cantilevered arms with the top floors added first, followed by each lower floor.  Design  The challenge for the designers - the German architect Helmut Hentrich (1905-2001) and the Austrian architect Hubert Petschnigg (1913-1997), who planned the skyscraper in collaboration with the British-Danish-Norwegian engineer Ove Arup (1895-1988) - was to find a spacious square in the crowded Johannesburg CBD to anchor an office building. To keep space used to a minimum, they adopted the \\"hanging\\" design. Apart from the concrete core tower, the Standard Bank Centre was built by Concor of precast reinforced concrete slabs, glass, and steel. The plastic molds in which the concrete slabs were cast gave them a distinctive shape. The steel girders used for the balustrades are 1.5 m high and 24.6 m long. A special slewing crane was designed for the project to lift and mount a quarter of each floor level. Concrete was delivered by night to the construction site to minimize traffic obstruction. The office building stretches to 39 stories, of which five are underground. The lower two stories house the computer center, including the evaluation center with a staff of 300. The bank room offers access to the safe tower stretching through all the lower floors, with delivery access through the lower parking lot. The windows use tinted glass with laminated double glazing for sunlight protection. No special arrangements need to be made for window cleaning, since the 60-cm balustrades make cleaning the outer pane easy. Air vents are located in the corners of the facade. The office is 9.7 m wide. The hanging design eliminates the need for pillars.

The term comes from the Gospel of Luke : \\"Do this in remembrance of me\\", and the attendant interpretation that the Lord's Supper's chief purpose is to help the participant remember Jesus and his sacrifice on the Cross. This viewpoint is commonly held by General Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, segments of the Restoration Movement (such as Jehovah's Witnesses), and some Non-denominational Churches, as well as those identifying with liberal Christianity; it is rejected by other branches of Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Church of the East, the Methodist Churches, the Independent Catholic Churches, and the Reformed Churches (inclusive of the Continental Reformed, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist traditions), all of which variously affirm the doctrine of the real presence.  Zwingli's memorialism  The theology of Huldrych Zwingli, a Protestant Reformer of Switzerland, is commonly associated with memorialism. Zwingli, who was a former Roman Catholic priest, affirmed that Christ is truly (though not naturally) present to the believer in the sacrament or amid a Christian congregation that remembers with strong intensity the events of the Last Supper through the power of God. However, the sacrament - for Zwingli - is not used instrumentally to communicate with Christ, as John Calvin taught. Zwingli argued that the Eucharist is more about the presence of Christ in the minds of people instead of his presence in the elements. This indicates that, although its liturgies remain an important aspect of being a Christian, its potential benefits are not found in any metaphysical interpretation related to the bread and wine used in the ritual. In addition, unlike Lutheran theology, Zwingli maintained that the Scripture and the creeds support the idea that Christ sits at the right hand of God the Father in heaven.

The library ceased to operate after the demolition of the old city hall in 1933. The first modern library opened in 1962 at the new City Hall, which was also the central library for many years before the opening of the Central Library. Over ten thousand library cards were issued in the first month of service, and borrowers were limited to only one book at a time. The second location and the first in Kowloon was the Waterloo Road Library, opened 1965 (later replaced by the Kowloon Public Library in 1984). The Pok Fu Lam Public Library opened next in December 1970 in the newly constructed Wah Fu Estate, and has served that community continuously for over 40 years. The first public library in the New Territories opened in Fuk Loi Estate, Tsuen Wan New Town, in 1974. In 1976 the first mobile library was introduced. The Tsuen Wan Central Library, at the time of its opening in July 1993, was the largest library in Hong Kong. The public libraries were originally administered by either the Urban Council or Regional Council, depending on the location. When the municipal councils were abolished in 1999, the library systems were merged under the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The Hong Kong Central Library was completed in 2001 and is the largest public library in the territory. This twelve-story building is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and serves as the administrative headquarters and main library of the public library network.

Windjammer is a 1958 documentary film that recorded a voyage of the Norwegian sail training ship Christian Radich. Windjammer was produced by Louis de Rochemont and directed by Louis de Rochemont III. It was the only film to be shot in the widescreen Cinemiracle process, which came with a seven-track stereophonic soundtrack. Filming The Christian Radich and its Norwegian crew were filmed while sailing from Oslo, via the island of Madeira, across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, to New York City, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and then back home to Bergen in Norway. The film features a score by Morton Gould, with additional musical performances by cellist Pablo Casals and Arthur Fiedler conducting the Boston Pops Orchestra. A musical highlight through the film is the Piano Concerto of Edvard Grieg, which accompanies the voyage narrative about one of the sea- cadets who is a piano-student preparing to play the concerto in Boston. The film also features a meeting with the German ship Pamir, which sank in a hurricane in September 1957. Presentation The world premiere was at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Hollywood on April 8, 1958 where the movie ran for 36 weeks. The East Coast premiere took place at New York's Roxy Theatre on April 9 where it was shown for 22 weeks on a special curved screen 100 by in size. The film was also exhibited at specially equipped cinemas in America, Canada, and Europe. Later it was shown in wide release in Cinerama theaters worldwide. It was particularly popular in the Scandinavian nations and in its 29-week run in Oslo had more paid admissions (401,320) than the city's population at the time (375,000).

Life Florian's mother, a Spanish lady named Gilette de Salgues, died when he was a child. He was brought up by his grandfather and studied at St. Hippolyte. His uncle and guardian, the Marquis of Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire, introduced him at the ch√¢teau de Ferney and in 1768 he became page at Anet in the household of the Duc de Penthi√®vre, who remained his friend throughout his life. Having studied for some time at the artillery school at Bapaume he obtained from his patron a captain's commission in the dragoon regiment of Penthi√®vre. He left the army soon after and began to write comedies, and was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1788. On the outbreak of the French Revolution he retired to Sceaux, but he was soon discovered and imprisoned; and though Robespierre's death spared him, he died a few months later still in prison.His death certificate, dated 27 fructidor, year II, is available online at Archives municipales de Sceaux The cause of death was tuberculosis. Works Column supporting bust of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian in the grounds of Voltaire's house at Ferney-Voltaire To modern readers, Florian is chiefly known as the author of pretty fables well suited as reading for the young, but his contemporaries praised him also for his poetical and pastoral novels. Florian was very fond of Spain and its literature, doubtless owing to the influence of his Castilian mother, and both abridged and imitated the works of Cervantes. Florian's first literary efforts were comedies; his verse epistle Voltaire et le serf du Mont Jura and an eclogue Ruth were crowned by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1782 and 1784 respectively. In 1782 also he produced a one-act prose comedy, Le Bon M√©nage, and in the next year Galatie, a romantic tale in imitation of the Galatea of Cervantes. Other short tales and comedies followed, and in 1786 appeared Numa Pompilius, an undisguised imitation of F√©nelon's Tel√©maque. In 1788 he became a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, and published Estelle, a pastoral of the same class as Galatie. Another romance, Gonzalve de Cordoue, preceded by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791, and his famous collection of Fables in 1802. Among his posthumous works are La Jeunesse de Florian, ou M√©moires d'un Jeune Espagnol (1807), and an abridgment (1809) of Don Quixote, which, though far from being a correct representation of the original, had great and merited success. Florian imitated Salomon Gessner, the Swiss idyllist, and his style has all the artificial delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest example of the class in English literature is afforded by John Wilson's Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life (written as Christopher North). Among the best of his fables are reckoned The Monkey showing the Magic Lantern, The Blind Man and the Paralytic, and The Monkeys and the Leopard. =Selected works= ;FablesThe entire set of his fables can be found at Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian et les fables , Shanaweb.net *The Blind man and the Paralytic *The Monkey and the Magic Lantern *The Monkeys and the Leopard *The Fable and the Truth *The Crocodile and the Sturgeon' *The Child and the Mirror *The Old Tree and the Gardener *The Nightingale and the Prince *The Two Travelers *The Cricket (also known as True Happiness) ;Theatre *Les Deux Billets (1779) *Le Bon M√©nage (1782) *Le Bon P√®re (1784) *Les Jumeaux de Bergame (1782) ;Other *Pastorales *Vari√©t√©s et contes en vers *Plaisir d'amour, a song *M√©moires d'un jeune Espagnol Famous verses Florian wrote a collection of fables. From these fables several expressions have passed into colloquial French: * Pour vivre heureux, vivons cach√©s: \\"In order to live happily, live hidden\\" * Chacun son m√©tier, les vaches seront bien gard√©es: \\"To each his occupation, and the cows will be well guarded.\\" * Rira bien qui rira le dernier: \\"He who laughs last laughs best.\\" The expression √©clairer la lanterne (\\"light the lantern\\") is also drawn from Florian's fables. His most famous verse is Plaisir d'amour, a poem he put in his story Celestine. The verse became a song which has survived to the 21st century.

Early life Kennedy was born in 1919 in Edinburgh, the son of a career Royal Navy officer, Edward Kennedy, and his wife, Rosalind Grant, daughter of Sir Ludovic Grant, 11th Baronet. His mother Rosalind was a cousin of the Conservative politician Robert Boothby, later Lord Boothby. He had two younger sisters, Morar and Katherine. Morar married the playwright Royce Ryton in 1954. Katherine married Major Ion Calvocoressi in 1947. He was schooled at Eton College (where he played in a jazz band with Humphrey Lyttelton) and studied for a year at Christ Church, Oxford, until the outbreak of war. While at Oxford he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club. Kennedy's father, by then a 60-year-old retired captain, returned to the navy and was given command of , a hastily militarised P&O; steamship, known as an Armed Merchant Cruiser. On 23 November 1939, while on patrol southeast of Iceland Rawalpindi encountered two of the most powerful German warships, the small battleships (or battlecruisers) and trying to break out through the GIUK gap into the Atlantic. Rawalpindi was able to signal the German ships' location back to base. Despite being hopelessly outgunned, Kennedy decided to fight, rather than surrender as demanded by the Germans. Scharnhorst sank Rawalpindi; of her 312 crew, 275 (including her captain) were killed. Kennedy was posthumously mentioned in dispatches and his decision to fight against overwhelming odds entered the folklore of the Royal Navy. His son Ludovic was 20 years old. =Naval officer= Ludovic Kennedy followed his father into the Royal Navy; he served as an officer on destroyers, mostly in the same northern seas. His ship, , was one of those that pursued the battleship Bismarck following the Battle of the Denmark Strait. He witnessed the final battle, until Bismarck was ablaze and its crew began to abandon ship but shortage of fuel forced Tartar to depart for home before Bismarck sank. Kennedy later wrote about this in his 1974 book Pursuit, his chronicle of the chase and sinking of Bismarck. Journalism and broadcasting Having studied for one year at Christ Church, Oxford, before the war, he returned to complete his studies in 1945. At Oxford he helped found the Writers' Club and then sought a means of support while he completed a book on Nelson's captains. After leaving Oxford he began a career as an investigative journalist. Kennedy wrote for a number of publications, including Newsweek. From 1953, he edited and introduced the First Reading radio series on the BBC Third Programme, presenting young writers such as Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin. Later he became a television journalist and a newsreader on ITV‚Äôs Independent Television News alongside Robin Day and Chris Chataway. He presented the BBC's flagship current affairs programme Panorama for several years. Kennedy was interested in miscarriages of justice, and he wrote and broadcast on numerous cases. Kennedy was interested in naval warfare. He wrote and presented a substantial number of television documentaries for the BBC on maritime history in the Second World War, beginning with Scapa Flow, followed by the dramatic narrative of the sinking of the Bismarck in which he was involved. Other subjects included the U-Boat war, the story of HMS Belfast, and the Dieppe Raid and St Nazaire Raid. The Life and Death of the Scharnhorst (1971) brought him into contact with survivors of the battlecruiser that had sunk his father's ship Rawalpindi. The series included Target Tirpitz (1973), a history of the extraordinary attempts to sink the feared German battleship; two of the films led to books. In 1980 he presented an episode of the BBC television series Great Railway Journeys of the World, in which he crossed the United States. From 1980 to 1988 he presented the television review programme Did You See...? He interviewed Peter Cook's character Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling in A Life in Pieces in 1990. He appeared as himself in several episodes on the political comedy series Yes Minister. Kennedy was the subject of an episode of That Reminds Me (2002: season 4, episode 1). Kennedy also expressed to another journalist that there were too many Blacks on television. Private Eye magazine sometimes referred to him as 'Ludicrous Kennedy'. In the long-running BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part, Alf Garnett ‚Äì while attacking BBC personalities ‚Äì spoke of him as a Russian Mick (\\"Mick\\" being a derogatory term for an Irish person), meaning \\"that Ludovich Kennedy!\\" Writing Kennedy's book Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the \\"Bismarck\\" () detailed the career of the Bismarck, her sinking of British battlecruiser Hood, and her destruction by the Royal Navy. =Miscarriages of justice= He wrote several books that questioned convictions in a number of notable cases in British criminal history. One of the first miscarriages of justice he investigated was the conviction and hanging of Timothy Evans in his 1961 book Ten Rillington Place (). Evans was found to have murdered his baby daughter in 1950, but Kennedy contended that he was innocent, and that the murders of his wife and baby had been committed by the serial killer John Christie. Christie was hanged three years after the hanging of Evans, following the discovery of six more bodies at 10 Rillington Place, none of which could be ascribed to Evans. Indeed, two of the skeletons found at the house dated back to the war ‚Äì long before Evans and his family had moved in. After a long campaign, Evans was posthumously pardoned in 1966. The scandal helped in the abolition of the death penalty in the UK. Kennedy's book was filmed in 1970 as 10 Rillington Place, starring John Hurt as Evans and Richard Attenborough as Christie. In 1985, Kennedy published The Airman and the Carpenter (), in which he argued that Richard Hauptmann did not kidnap and murder Charles Lindbergh's baby, a crime for which he was executed in 1936. The book was made into a 1996 HBO film Crime of the Century, starring Stephen Rea and Isabella Rossellini. In 1990, Kennedy became the advisory committee chairman of Just Television, a television production company dedicated to exposing miscarriages of justice. In 2003, he wrote 36 Murders and 2 Immoral Earnings (), in which he analysed a number of noted cases, including the Evans case and those of Derek Bentley and the Birmingham Six, a number of which were affected by claims of police failure, police misconduct or perjury. In it he concluded that the adversarial system of justice in the UK and the United States \\"is an invitation to the police to commit perjury, which they frequently do\\", and said that he preferred the inquisitorial system. Kennedy also wrote: * Sub-Lieutenant: A Personal Record of the War at Sea, 1942 * One Man's Meat, 1953 * Murder Story, 1954 * Trial of Stephen Ward, 1964, * Very lovely people; a personal look at some Americans living abroad, 1969, * Nelson and His Captains (also called Nelson's band of brothers), 1975, * Presumption of Innocence: Amazing Case of Patrick Meehan, 1976, * Death of the Tirpitz (also called Menace ‚Äì The Life and Death of the Tirpitz), 1979, * Wicked beyond belief: The Luton murder case, 1980, * On My Way to the Club, 1990, (his autobiography) * Euthanasia: The Case for the Good Death, 1990, () * Truth to Tell: Collected Writings of Ludovic Kennedy, 1992, * In Bed with an Elephant: Personal View of Scotland, 1995, * All in the Mind: A Farewell To God, 1999, (a critique of Christianity) Politics and campaigns In 1958, Kennedy stood for election to Parliament as the Liberal candidate in the Rochdale by-election called after the death of the sitting Conservative MP, Wentworth Schofield in December 1957. He lost to the Labour candidate, Jack McCann, but achieved an increase in the Liberal vote, pushing the Conservatives into third place. The Rochdale contest was the first British by-election to receive live television coverage (locally, by Granada Television). He stood for Rochdale at the 1959 general election, with a vote share increased from the by-election, but again came second to Labour. In addition to his writing and campaigning on miscarriages of justice, Kennedy campaigned on a number of other issues. A lifelong atheist, he published All in the Mind: A Farewell To God in 1999, in which he discussed his philosophical objections to religion, and the ills he felt had come from Christianity. He was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association, he contributed to New Humanist magazine, he was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland. He was also an advocate of the legalisation of assisted suicide, and was a co-founder and former chair of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. His book, Euthanasia: The Case for the Good Death, was published in 1990. Kennedy resigned from the Liberal Democrats in 2001, citing the incompatibility of his pro-voluntary euthanasia views with those of the then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy (no relation), who was a Roman Catholic. He then stood as an independent on a platform of legalising voluntary euthanasia in the 2001 general election for the Wiltshire constituency of Devizes. He won 2 per cent of the vote and subsequently rejoined the Liberal Democrats.  Personal life  In February 1950 he married the dancer and actress Moira Shearer in the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace. He later remembered their meeting in 1949, when he was reluctantly persuaded by a friend to accept a complimentary ticket to a fancy dress ball held at the Lyceum ballroom in London. Shearer ‚Äì who had recently become famous for her role in The Red Shoes ‚Äì was presenting the prizes at the occasion, and Kennedy later recalled that \\"I felt a tremor run through me when I caught sight of her. She looked even lovelier than in the film.\\" Summoning up his courage, he approached the 23-year-old dancer and asked her to dance. She would be delighted, she told him, only \\"I don't dance very well.\\" She was not, Kennedy revealed, a competent ballroom dancer. The couple had one son and three daughters (Alastair, Ailsa, Rachel and Fiona) from a 56-year marriage that ended with her death on 31 January 2006 at the age of 80.Obituary in The New York Times, 2 February 2006. Retrieved 11 October 2014. Honours He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Strathclyde in 1985. He was knighted in 1994 for services to journalism, on the recommendation of John Major's government. Major's predecessor Margaret Thatcher had vetoed Kennedy's knighthood.  Death  Kennedy died of pneumonia in a nursing home in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 18 October 2009, aged 89.

Smith; January 20, 1969) is an American house producer and hip hop musician from Chicago, Illinois. Career Prior to his entry into the realm of production, Fast Eddie was one of the premier DJs of the early Chicago house movement. His talents earned him spots on WGCI and WBMX. During that period, he produced one of his first singles in collaboration with Kenny \\"Jammin'\\" Jason entitled \\"Can You Dance\\", circa 1986. In 1987, Eddie came out with other house tracks such as \\"The Whop\\", based on the dance of the same name. Eddie then left WGCI for WBMX for a short time and then quit his radio DJ gigs to concentrate on producing. In 1988, Eddie scored one of his biggest hits with \\"Acid Thunder\\" on the DJ International label. However, it was the track \\"Hip House\\" that really established his career as a producer. Eddie popularized the genre of hip house. He scored several hits on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \\"Git On Up\\" (featuring Sundance), which spent a week at number one in 1989, but only reached number 49 in the UK Singles Chart. However, Eddie tried his hand at gangsta rap in 1990 by forming the group America's Most Wanted, and many critics felt he should have stuck to his house music roots. Later that year, he released \\"Make Some Noise\\". At some time during 1995, Eddie made two collaborations that are considered under the genre of ghetto house. The first of these is titled \\"Booty Call\\" with DJ Sneak and the other is titled \\"Pump It\\" with DJ Funk. Both songs gained a lot of airplay on Chicago radio and in clubs.

Location Edinbane lies on the A850 road at the foot of the Waternish Peninsula on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, from Portree and from Dunvegan. The name An t-Aodann B√†n is said to be taken from the white bog cotton plants that can be found on the hill sides. The village is based around the crofts with a small primary school and pottery. Notable buildings in Edinbane village are the former Gesto Hospital (c. 1870), the Edinbane Inn (c. 1900) and Edinbane Lodge, a stone-built hunting lodge built in 1543. History There has been a settlement here since before 1600, but it was Kenneth MacLeod of Greshornish (1 December 1809, died unmarried in 1869) who founded the village. =Kenneth MacLeod of Greshornish= Edinbane LodgeKenneth McLeod's family had farmed land in the Gesto area of Skye for over 500 years. At the age of 15 he went to India, with his fare paid out and one golden guinea in his pocket, given him by Mrs MacDonald of Waternish. After a year's work, he took the river boat down to Calcutta. On the way he went ashore and visited a place where an auction of the contents of a sugar factory was in progress. With his precious Guinea, he bought a copper boiler, which he sold in Calcutta for ¬£30. He now returned to the derelict sugar factory and bought it for very little. This set him on the ladder to making a fortune in India planting indigo. Kenneth MacLeod of Gesto Returning to Skye, he endeavoured to buy the tack of Gesto but MacLeod of MacLeod was not prepared to sell. Kenneth then bought Orbost, Isle of Skye, Edinbane, Skirinish, Greshornishy, Tote and Skeabost and much of Portree. He ensured that the village had a tradesman from each of the important crafts. He set up the first hospital on Skye in Edinbane, aptly named Gesto. It is now boarded up. File:Edinbane Lodge in late 1930's.pngEdinbane Lodge in 1930's.

It was purchased by Kenneth MacLeod of Greshornish in the 1860s and converted into a hunting lodge. In 1920 the Lodge was purchased by Edward Langdale Hilleary, a wealthy London businessman, and his wife Edith (n√©e Robertson), niece of Kenneth MacLeod. In 1927 Edward Langdale Hilleary constructed a small hydro plant on the Abhainn Coishletter just behind the Lodge. The scheme supplied electricity to the nearby Gesto hospital and also powered the Lodge.John MacInnes (2018) The Hillearys of Edinbane.

Prince Akihito was born as Prince Yoshiaki, the seventh son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie. In 1858, he was adopted by Emperor Nink≈ç as a potential heir to the throne. As he was born when the country was still under rule by the Tokugawa Bakufu, he was sent into the Buddhist priesthood, and assigned to serve at the monzeki temple of Ninna-ji in Kyoto, where he adopted the title Ninnaji-no- miya Yoshiaki (‰ªÅÂíåÂØ∫ÂÆÆÂòâÂΩ∞). He returned to secular life in 1867 during the Meiji Restoration, and led imperial forces to Osaka, Yamato, Shikoku and Aizu during the Boshin War to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate. Prince Yoshiaki married Arima Yoriko (June 18, 1852 ‚Äì June 26, 1914), daughter of Arima Yorishige, the former daimy≈ç of Kurume Domain, on November 6, 1869. In 1870, Emperor Meiji assigned him the title of Higashifushimi-no-miya. =Military career= Prince Yoshiaki studied military tactics in England for two years from 1870-1872. Considered a brilliant military tactician, he helped subdue many of the samurai rebellions in the early years of the Meiji period, including the Saga Rebellion of 1874, and the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. The emperor granted him the rank of lieutenant general in the newly created Imperial Japanese Army and awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class). In 1882, he changed the name of his house to Komatsu-no-miya and his personal name from \\"Yoshiaki\\" to \\"Akihito\\", and became therefore known as \\"Prince Komatsu-no-miya Akihito\\". Prince Komatsu rose to the rank of general and received command of the First Imperial Guard Division in 1890. He was nominal commander of the Japanese expeditionary forces in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì95) and became a member of the Supreme Military Council. Following the death of his uncle, Prince Arisugawa Taruhito in 1895, Prince Komatsu Akihito became the chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and received the honorary rank of field marshal. Diplomatic career King Kalakaua of Hawaii, and Yoshie Sano Tsunetani in Japan (1881) Prince Komatsu Akihito also served the Meiji government in a diplomatic capacity. In 1886, he went to England, France, Germany and Russia on behalf of Emperor Meiji. He was sent to Istanbul in 1887 to mark the inaugural step in relations between Ottoman Empire and the Empire of Japan. Prince Komatsu was received in an audience by the Ottoman Emperor ‚ÄòAbdu‚Äôl-Hamid II. In June 1902, Prince Komatsu Akihito returned to the United Kingdom to represent Emperor Meiji at the coronation ceremonies for King Edward VII, and also visited France, Spain, Belgium, Germany and Russia. In his latter years, Prince Komatsu was a patron of the Japanese Red Cross Society and the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, along with other charity institutions. As Prince Komatsu died without heirs, the title of Komatsu-no-miya reverted to his younger brother, Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito. However, to preserve the Komatsu family name, in 1910 the fourth son of Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa was renamed Teruhisa Komatsu, with the peerage title of marquis (koshaku).

The Park lends its name to the Grange Park neighbourhood in the vicinity of the park. Historically, the park was the backyard of The Grange, a manor that eventually was expanded and became the Art Gallery of Ontario. Features After a major renovation completed by July 2017, the park includes the following features: * Henry Moore sculpture Large Two Forms, originally located next to the Art Gallery of Ontario at the corner of Dundas and McCaul streets. * Weston family fountain. * Splash pad and surrounding seating. * Playground facilities geared to age with smaller, softer structures for younger children and taller structures for older children. * A carriage path leading from John Street and circling the park. * An off-leash area for dogs. * Public washrooms. There are a few prominently visible buildings along the borders of the park that act as a backdrop. These include: * Art Gallery of Ontario - on the north side of the park * The Grange - on the north side of the park * Sharp Centre for Design, OCAD University - on the east side of the park * Ruins of St George the Martyr Church - at the John Street entrance to the park History Grange Park was originally the front lawn and garden of the Grange, a manor house built in 1820 by the Boulton family, an influential family in 19th century Toronto. In 1910, Harriet Boulton (also known as Mrs. Goldwin Smith) bequeathed her estate to the Art Museum of Toronto (later the Art Gallery of Ontario) which included the Grange, and the surrounding property. On January 20, 1911, the Art Museum of Toronto reached an agreement with the City of Toronto, where the city would maintain the grounds south of The Grange as a municipal public park. The agreement continues to be in force, with the art museum remaining as the property's owner, and the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division maintains the grounds as a municipal park. In the mid-1970s, Grange Park was expanded to its present-day size by closing portions of two streets: Grange Road from Beverley Street to John Street, and John Street between Grange Road to Stephanie Street. In 2008, the Grange Park Advisory Committee (GPAC) was formed to join local residents, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the City of Toronto, and neighbouring organizations to start the Grange Park Revitalization Project with the goal of renovating Grange Park and restoring it to its natural beauty. By 2009, GPAC produced a design brief. GPAC is a 15-person Committee whose role is to advise on the restoration and revitalization of Grange Park and on an oversight structure for the ongoing maintenance and program for Grange Park. By that time, Grange Park had deteriorated because of restrictions in City funding resulting in uneven pathways, dilapidated benches and playground equipment, many areas of bare ground and poorly maintained trees. On July 10, 2017, after a cost of $15 million and 15 months of construction, a renovated Grange Park officially reopened with many improvements such as expansion of the children's play area, 80 news trees, expanded lawn area, an off-leash dog area, new public washrooms, new water features and new seating areas. As part of the renovation, the Henry Moore sculpture Large Two Formspark was moved from the corner of Dundas and McCaul streets to become the centrepiece of the park. The park was designed by PFS Studio with Thinc Design as executive architects. The AGO, the City of Toronto, the Weston Family, and various community groups jointly fininanced the renovation. There is also an endowment fund to support the park's long-term maintenance. In February 2017, the Grange Community Association requested that the portion of John Street from Queen street West to Stephanie Street be given the ceremonial name of \\"Harriet Boulton Smith Way\\" in honour of the person who bequeathed the Grange estate to become Grange Park and the Art Gallery of Ontario. That portion of John Street was once part of the Grange estate.

Plate spinning relies on the gyroscopic effect, in the same way a top stays upright while spinning. Spinning plates are sometimes gimmicked, to help keep the plates on the poles. Many Chinese acrobatics troupes feature plate spinning, usually in combination with contortion or acrobatic skills. These usually feature performers holding several plates in each hand spinning on sticks. Western plate spinning performers usually present comedy acts and typically feature one performer with an assistant, spinning multiple plates on sticks held vertically in stands. Other forms of plate manipulation include plate waltzing, where plates are spun on their edges on a table top, and plate juggling, where plates are manipulated and thrown by the performers. Some performers have combined several of these elements into restaurant or kitchen- themed acts. The Guinness World Record for spinning multiple plates is held by David Spathaky, assisted by Debbie Woolley, who spun 108 plates simultaneously in Bangkok, Thailand, on television in 1996. He had previously held and broken his own record four times since 1986. In popular culture Carnaval Festival, Efteling The tune \\"Sabre Dance\\" is often played in the background.

In an episode of the Simpsons, at the Springfield Retirement Castle talent show, one participant does a similar act, but uses the dentures of several of the residents. Plate spinning was often seen in HBO's prison drama Oz, where an unnamed prisoner would often be seen spinning a book on the tip of a pen. The popular game show The Generation Game would regularly feature a plate spinner demonstrating his skills, then inviting the contestants to have a go - with smashing results. During the 1960s & 1970s German Performer Wolfgang Bartschelly popularised plate spinning and regularly appeared on television. From the 1980s onward, the mantle was passed to British plate spinner, young Andrew Van Buren who regularly appeared and still can be seen presenting this format of plate spinning on game shows, on television and performing around the world.

Childhood and adolescence A portrait of King George III, Queen Charlotte, and their six eldest children in 1770. Augusta is the baby in her mother's arms. Princess Augusta Sophia was born at Buckingham House, London, the sixth child and second daughter of George III (1738‚Äì1820) and his wife Queen Charlotte. Her father so much wanted the new baby to be a girl that the doctor presiding over the labour thought fit to protest that \\"whoever sees those lovely Princes above stairs must be glad to have another.\\" The King was so upset by this view he replied that \\"whoever sees that lovely child the Princess Royal above stairs must not wish to have the fellow to her.\\" To the King's delight, and the Queen's relief, the baby was a small and pretty girl.Princesses, The Six Daughters of George III. Flora Fraser. The young princess was christened on 6 December 1768, by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Great Council Chamber at St. James's Palace. Her godparents were Prince Charles of Mecklenburg (her maternal uncle, who was visiting England), The Queen-consort of Denmark (her paternal aunt, for whom The Duchess of Ancaster and Kesteven, Mistress of the Robes to The Queen, stood proxy) and The Hereditary Duchess of Brunswick-L√ºneburg (her paternal aunt, for whom The Duchess of Northumberland, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, stood proxy).Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Royal Christenings Lady Mary Coke declared the month-old Augusta \\"the most beautiful infant I ever saw\\". Princess Augusta was the middle of the elder trio of princesses that consisted of her, her older sister Charlotte (born 1766) and her younger sister Elizabeth (born 1770). In 1771, the two elder Princesses started travelling to Kew to take lessons under the supervision of Lady Charlotte Finch and Miss Frederica Planta. The Princesses, who had formerly been very close to their brothers now saw little of them, except when their paths crossed on daily walks. In 1774, Martha Goldsworthy, or \\"Gouly\\" became the new head of their educations. The Princesses learned typically feminine pursuits, such as deportment, music, dancing, and arts, but their mother also ensured that they learned English, French, German, Geography, and had well-educated governesses. Princess Augusta, aged thirteen. The young Augusta was a great favourite with Miss Planta, who called her \\"the handsomest of all the Princesses\\" though compared to her older sister, she was \\"childish\\". However, the princess was painfully shy, and stammered when in front of people she didn't know. From an early age Augusta was fixed on being good and was often upset when she did not succeed. Her behaviour veered in between troublesome and well-mannered. She sometimes threw tantrums and hit her governesses, though she also often had a calm disposition and family-minded ways. She strongly disliked the political tensions that by 1780 had sprung up between her elder brothers and their parents, and preferred to occupy herself with her coin collection. As all her sisters were, Augusta was sheltered from the outside world so much that her only friends were her attendants, with whom she kept up a frequent correspondence. In 1782, Augusta had her debut into society at the King's birthday celebrations. As she was still terrified of crowds, her mother did not tell her daughter about her debut until two days before it happened. Later that year, the Princess's youngest brother, Alfred, died, followed eight months later by her next youngest brother, Octavius. When the Princesses went to see the summer exhibition in 1783 at the Royal Academy, they were so distraught by the portraits of their two youngest brothers that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. In August 1783 came the birth of Augusta's youngest sibling, Amelia. She stood as a godmother, along with Charlotte and George. Although the birth of her sister did not erase the pain she felt at losing her brothers, Augusta did not dwell on their deaths as her father did. By the time they reached their teens, the three eldest Princesses were spending a great deal of time with their parents. They accompanied them to the theatre, to the Opera, and to Court, and their once academic lessons began to wind down, with music and the arts becoming the new focus. They heard famous actresses such as Sarah Siddons read, and along with Charlotte and their parents, Augusta met John Adams when he was presented to the Queen. The three girls were always dressed alike at public functions, the only difference ever in their dresses being colour. Though so often displayed in public, Augusta still was happiest at home, where she adored her younger brothers Ernest, Augustus, and Adolphus. She was also extremely close to her sister Elizabeth, as Charlotte was often haughty and overly conscious of her position as Princess Royal. Early adulthood Since they were quickly approaching a marriageable age, Augusta and the Princess Royal were given their first lady- in-waiting in July 1783. Augusta frequently wrote to her elder brother William, who was in Hanover for military training. She was a good correspondent, telling him family news and encouraging him to tell her what was happening in his life. She revelled in his attention and in the little gifts he sent her, even though the Queen tried to discourage William from taking up his sister's valuable time. Though their academic lessons were nearly over, the Queen was loath to have her daughters waste time, and made sure that the Princesses spent hours studying music or art, learning many types of specialty work from different masters. The princesses did not \\"dress\\" until dinner, wearing morning gowns nearly all day. Even when \\"dressed\\", the Royal family often wore plain clothes, far removed from the ornate splendour of other courts. As there were six princesses, the Queen's expenses even for these clothes were enormous, and she tried to keep costs down and within the allowance she was given. Moving into this new phase of life meant that the amount of money the Queen was spending on her three eldest daughters was rapidly increasing. The Princesses constantly needed dresses, hats, trimmings, fans, and other items. The quarterly expense for their clothes was estimated to be ¬£2000, and the expense of all their servants and tutors added to that. Yet it all paid off in one way: the Princesses were quickly becoming a familiar sight to the public. When their group portrait was exhibited to the people, it was marvelled at for the porcelain impersonal beauty they displayed. They were dressed the same, and only their accessories hinted at the very different personalities that lay underneath the painted masks. By 1785, Augusta and Charlotte were reaching an age where they could be considered as potential brides for foreign princes. In that year the Crown Prince of Denmark (later King Frederick VI) indicated to King George III that he would break off every other discussed proposal for the hand in marriage of a British princess. He was also supposed to prefer Augusta to her older sister. However, the King declared that after the horrible treatment of his younger sister by the Crown Prince's father, King Christian VII, he would never send one of his daughters to the Danish court. As their friends and ladies of the court began to get married, the princesses wondered when their turn would come. In 1797, she received a proposal from Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden, a proposal given without the approval of the Swedish royal house. (search for all versions on WorldCat) A British princess, especially from so fertile a mother, was a prize, but Augusta's father seemed increasingly unwilling to allow his daughters to marry.Princesses, the Six Daughters of George III. Flora Fraser. Relationship with Brent Spencer Largely denied access to personal relationships with men of their own rank, several of the daughters of George III embarked on such romances with gentleman at court. Augusta Sophia first met Sir Brent Spencer, a senior Anglo-Irish officer in the British Army, around 1800. As she wrote to her brother, the future King George IV, then Prince Regent, in 1812, the two had entered into an understanding around 1803, while Spencer was stationed in England. In 1805 he was appointed as an equerry to the king. The couple conducted their romance with the utmost privacy, and Augusta asked the Prince Regent in 1812 to consent to her marrying Spencer, promising further discretion in their behaviour.Dorothy Margaret Stuart, The Daughters of George III (Fonthill Media, 2017), pp 110‚Äì120 While no record of a marriage between the two exists, it was noted at the court of Hesse-Homburg at the time of her sister Elizabeth's marriage in 1818 that Augusta was \\"privately married.\\" It was Spencer who informed Augusta of her mother's death later that year, and Spencer was said to be holding a locket with Augusta's picture when he died in 1828.A Royal Experiment. Janice Hadlow. Later life According to a flyer held by the V&A; Archives, Princess Augusta was a patron of L. Bertolotto's flea circus. In 1828 Augusta was heard to remark to a friend: ‚ÄúI was ashamed to hear myself called Princess Augusta, and never could persuade myself that I was so, as long as any of the Stuart family were alive; but after the death of Cardinal York [in 1807], I felt myself to be really Princess Augusta‚Äù.L.

The building was the tallest building in Johannesburg when it was finished in 1958. The building was so high compared to other buildings in Johannesburg that it was the only one that could be seen from the patch of veld that is now called Kensington B.  Background  Eskom Centre replaced Eskom House, a building in the city centre built in 1937. The location is in Braamfontein on a block surrounded by Smit, Harrison, Loveday and Wolmarans Streets. Situated on the site of an old dairy and residential properties, the land was purchased for R522,441. The architects were R C Rinaldi & Partners and would be built R3,709,241. The construction period was twenty-seven months with the building completed in October or November 1958. The building has 17 floors, was a height of 61.24 metres and had an underground area 13.6 metres below ground level. By the middle of the sixties, the company had again outgrown the building with staff spread out to other buildings.

The Villa Farnesina is a Renaissance suburban villa in the Via della Lungara, in the district of Trastevere in Rome, central Italy. Description The villa was built for Agostino Chigi, a rich Sienese banker and the treasurer of Pope Julius II. Between 1506‚Äì1510, the Sienese artist and pupil of Bramante, Baldassare Peruzzi, aided perhaps by Giuliano da Sangallo, designed and erected the villa. The novelty of this suburban villa design can be discerned from its differences from that of a typical urban palazzo (palace). Renaissance palaces typically faced onto a street and were decorated versions of defensive castles: rectangular blocks with rusticated ground floors and enclosing a courtyard. This villa, intended to be an airy summer pavilion, presented a side towards the street and was given a U-shaped plan with a five- bay loggia between the arms. In the original arrangement, the main entrance was through the north facing loggia which was open.Coffin David, The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome, Princeton University Press 1979, p. 91 Today, visitors enter on the south side and the loggia is glazed. Chigi also commissioned the fresco decoration of the villa by artists such as Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo, Giulio Romano, and Il Sodoma. The themes were inspired by the Stanze of the poet Angelo Poliziano, a key member of the circle of Lorenzo de Medici. Best known are Raphael's frescoes on the ground floor; in the loggia depicting the classical and secular myths of Cupid and Psyche, and The Triumph of Galatea. This, one of his few purely secular paintings, shows the near-naked nymph on a shell-shaped chariot amid frolicking attendants and is reminiscent of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. This same \\"Galatea\\" loggia has a horoscope vault that displays the positions of the planets around the zodiac on the patron's birth date, 29 November 1466. The two main ceiling panels of the vault give his precise time of birth, 9:30 pm on that date. At first floor level, Peruzzi painted the main salone with trompe-l'≈ìil frescoes of a grand open loggia with an illusory city and countryside view beyond. The perspective of the painted balcony and colonnade is very accurate from a fixed point in the room. In the adjoining bedroom, Sodoma painted scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, the marriage of Alexander and Roxana, and Alexander receives the family of Darius. The villa became the property of the Farnese family in 1577 (hence the name of Farnesina). Also in the 16th century, Michelangelo proposed linking the Palazzo Farnese on the other side of the River Tiber, where he was working, to the Villa Farnesina with a private bridge. This was initiated, remnants of a few arches are in fact still visible in the back of Palazzo Farnese towards via Giulia on the other side of the Tiber, but was never completed. Later the villa belonged to the Bourbons of Naples and in 1861 to the Spanish Ambassador in Rome, Bermudez de Castro, Duke of Ripalta. Today, owned by the Italian State, it accommodates the Accademia dei Lincei, a long-standing and renowned Roman academy of sciences. Until 2007 it also housed the Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe (Department of Drawings and Prints) of the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica, Roma. The main rooms of the villa, including the Loggia, are open to visitors.

The village is entirely built of stone and was probably established as a defense against the Saracens in the 13th century. Abandoned in the 1950s, Colletta has been the subject, in the late 1990s, of a restoration project operating on two levels. On one level, has been made a general restoration of the ancient settlement, respecting the original materials and building techniques (the restoration plan was developed by architect Giancarlo De Carlo); on another level, the village has been provided with a sophisticated technological infrastructure (the telematization project was conceived by Valerio Saggini and planned by Valerio Saggini and Stefania Belloni) which has enabled new inhabitants to benefit from the widest possible range of telecommunications resources. In this way, they are able to enjoy the peace and isolation offered by the village while staying in touch with the work environment and, more generally, with the information resources available all over the world. Thus it is possible for people to have the chance to \\"telecommute\\", to spend long periods in Colletta; periods which do not necessarily have to coincide with official holidays, or even decide to move their primary residence to Colletta.

The epic is an instance of oral tradition, going back to the 13th century and narrated by generations of griot poets or jeliw (djeli). There is no single or authoritative version.Bulman, Stephen P. D. 1997. A checklist of published versions of the Sunjata epic. History in Africa 24. 71‚Äì94. Material pertaining to the epic first began to be collected during the early 20th century in French Sudan, notably by the French elite school √âcole William Ponty, resulting in the \\"modern\\" version of the tale as considered standard today, as published in \\"novelistic\\" form in French translation by Djibril Tamsir Niane in 1960 (English translation 1965). Historical context and significance The amount of historicity of the events portrayed in the epic is open to debate. There are some limited 14th-century Arabic historiographic sources available on the early history and of the Mali Empire, notably the records of Ibn Khaldun. Therefore, the evidence of oral tradition may be critical in reconstructing the historical events of the period. Oral tradition necessarily undergoes significant changes over the course of several centuries, but scholars have nevertheless attempted to pinpoint elements in the epic that might reflect historical events. Written summaries of the epic existed in Arabic before 1890. During the 1890s, versions of the epic were collected by French officials and published in French and German translation beginning in 1898. Western-educated West Africans began to produce literary versions of the tale beginning in the 1930s. This was notably the case at the French elite school, √âcole William Ponty, which staged a drama based on the story in 1937. This period represents the first interaction of the oral tradition with literacy and modernity, and the transformations undergone by the narrative in the context of the 1937 presentation ... eventually resulted in the form of the epic which became most influential in the 1940s and 1950s, before the first \\"novelistic\\" treatment by Niane (1960). The first line-by-line transcription of the epic as told by a griot was made in 1967.. As an oral historical epic, Sundiata conveys information not only about the history of the Mali Empire, but also about the culture of the Mande ethnic group. Mande family structures had two elements‚Äîconstructive (badenya) or destructive (fadenya). Fadenya, or \\"father-child-ness,\\" is the rivalry between half- siblings, and is represented in the epic of Sundiata by the animosity between Sundiata, son of Sogolon, and Dankaran Touman, son of Sassouma (king Nare Marghan's first wife). The destructive forces of fadenya eventually cause Sundiata and his mother to be exiled from Mali, in the fear that Sassouma would hurt Sogolon's family. Badenya, or \\"mother-child-ness,\\" is the affection between children of the same mother. This is represented in the epic by the support of Sundiata's sister, Kolonkan, in watching over him against Sassouma's attempts at witchcraft, and by his siblings' later support of him in his battle to reclaim Mali. Maternal support is also important for Sundiata to overcome his physical impairment and begin to walk in response to his mother's pleading. The importance of the mother is underscored by the narrator, who says \\"the child is worth no more than the mother is worth.\\"Niane 1965, p. 22. Significantly, Sundiata needed both the opposing forces of fadenya and badenya to fulfill his destiny, indicating that both elements are necessary to Mande culture . The epic of Sundiata is still an integral part of Mande traditional culture and the story continues to be retold by griots and through masked ritual performances. Today the epic of Sundiata has also become part of the official national mythology of the republics of Mali, Gambia, Senegal and Guinea and is studied in history lessons in primary school curricula..  Plot  In the Epic of Sundiata (also spelled Son-Jara or Sundjata) Nar√© Maghann Konat√© (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a soothsaying hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konat√© married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Nar√© Maghann Konat√© was already married to Sassouma Beret√© and had a son by her, Dankaran Toumani Ke√Øta. However, when two Traor√© hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prophecy and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata Keita, who was unable to walk throughout his childhood. Sassouma was jealous of the child and mother and would make fun of Sundiata for his inability to walk and the ugliness he inherited from his mother.Feremu, Sokana. Sundiata - Short Version. Despite his physical weakness, the king still granted Sundiata his own griot at young age; this was in order to have them grow together and provide constant consultation as was custom.Niane 1965, p. 18. With the death of Nar√© Maghann Konat√© (c. 1224), his first son, Dankaran Tuman, assumed the throne despite Konat√©'s wishes that the prophecy be respected. Sundiata and his mother, who now had given birth to two daughters and adopted a second son from Konat√©'s third wife Namandj√©, suffered the scorn of the new king and his mother. After an insult against Sogolon, Sundiata requested an iron rod from the blacksmith Nounfari, which broke when he tried to use it in order to pull himself upright and walk. Only when he used a branch of S'ra (African baobab or Adansonian tree) was he able to walk. In one version of the epic, Sundiata is able to walk after his father dies and his mother orders him to do so. He then becomes a great hunter. Nonetheless, the hatred of Sassouma Beret√© and Dankaran Toumani Keita soon drove Sundiata, his mother, and his two sisters into exile in the Mema kingdom. In one version of the epic, Sundiata and his mother are not exiled. Sogolon feels that she and her son are in danger because of Sassouma's jealousy and left to keep them safe. Neighboring kingdoms are unwilling to harbor Sundiata and Sogolon in fear of what Sassouma and her son would do, but the Mema people take them in. While living in the Mema kingdom, Sundiata began to grow \\"as strong as a lion\\", and he fought with the greatest general of the Mema people, Moussa Tounkara. Sundiata became such a great warrior to the degree that he was made heir to the Mema throne. However, Sogolon encouraged him to \\"fulfill his destiny\\" and return to Mali to become king. Meanwhile, Soumaoro Kant√©, a historical leader of the Sosso people who rose to prominence after the demise of the Ghana Empire but who is portrayed in the epic as a cruel sorcerer king, attacked the Mandinka kingdom, causing Dankaran Toumani to take flight in fear. Before reaching Mali, Soumaoro had conquered nine kingdoms in the former Ghana Empire. The oppressed Mandinka people then sent for the exiled Sundiata. Forging a coalition of neighboring small kingdoms, Sundiata waged a war against the Sosso, finally Sundiata was later crowned with the title \\"Mansa,\\" or \\"king of kings\\", as the first ruler of the Mali Empire. He soon set about organizing the nucleus of the empire, presenting the Gbara of nobles and notables at his coronation with an oral constitution known as the Kouroukan Fouga. His model for government would guide the empire into greatness. His exploits have even been compared to those of Alexander the Great by some griots.Niane 1965, p. 1.

The flagship implementation of the Sally‚ÄìAnne test was by Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie, and Uta Frith (1985); Pdf. in 1988, Leslie and Frith repeated the experiment with human actors (rather than dolls) and found similar results.  Test description  To develop an efficacious test, Baron-Cohen et al. modified the puppet play paradigm of Wimmer and Perner (1983), in which puppets represent tangible characters in a story, rather than hypothetical characters of pure storytelling. In the Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith study of theory of mind in autism, 61 children‚Äî20 of whom were diagnosed autistic under established criteria, 14 with Down syndrome and 27 of whom were determined as clinically unimpaired‚Äîwere tested with \\"Sally\\" and \\"Anne\\". In the test process, after introducing the dolls, the child is asked the control question of recalling their names (the Naming Question). A short skit is then enacted; Sally takes a marble and hides it in her basket. She then \\"leaves\\" the room and goes for a walk. While she is away, Anne takes the marble out of Sally's basket and puts it in her own box. Sally is then reintroduced and the child is asked the key question, the Belief Question: \\"Where will Sally look for her marble?\\"  Outcomes  For a participant to pass this test, they must answer the Belief Question correctly by indicating that Sally believes that the marble is in her own basket. This answer is continuous with Sally's perspective, but not with the participant's own. If the participant cannot take an alternative perspective, they will indicate that Sally has cause to believe, as the participant does, that the marble has moved. Passing the test is thus seen as the manifestation of a participant understanding that Sally has her own beliefs that may not correlate with reality; this is the core requirement of theory of mind. In the Baron-Cohen et al. (1985) study, 23 of the 27 clinically unimpaired children (85%) and 12 of the 14 Down syndrome children (86%) answered the Belief Question correctly. However, only four of the 20 autistic children (20%) answered correctly. Overall, children under the age of four, along with most autistic children (of older ages), answered the Belief Question with \\"Anne's box\\", seemingly unaware that Sally does not know her marble has been moved. The test is by no means fully conclusive; however, its application is telling about social development trends in autism.  Criticism  While Baron-Cohen et al.'s data have been purported to indicate a lack of theory of mind in autistic children, there are other possible factors affecting them. For instance, individuals with autism may pass the cognitively simpler recall task, but language issues in both autistic children and deaf controls tend to confound results. Ruffman, Garnham, and Rideout (2001) further investigated links between the Sally‚ÄìAnne test and autism in terms of eye gaze as a social communicative function. They added a third possible location for the marble: the pocket of the investigator. When autistic children and children with moderate learning disabilities were tested in this format, they found that both groups answered the Belief Question equally well; however, participants with moderate learning disabilities reliably looked at the correct location of the marble, while autistic participants did not, even if the autistic participant answered the question correctly. These results may be an expression of the social deficits relevant to autism. Tager-Flusberg (2007) states that in spite of the empirical findings with the Sally-Anne task, there is a growing uncertainty among scientists about the importance of the underlying theory-of-mind hypothesis of autism. In all studies that have been done, some children with autism pass false-belief tasks such as Sally- Anne.  In other hominids  Eye tracking of chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans suggests that all three anticipate the false beliefs of a subject in a King Kong suit, and pass the Sally‚ÄìAnne test.

Francisco Espoz Ilund√°in (17 June 1781 ‚Äì 24 December 1836), being better known as Francisco Espoz y Mina, was a Spanish guerrilla leader and general. Biography He was born in Idocin in Navarre. His father, Juan Esteban Espoz y Mina, and his mother, Maria Teresa Hundain y Ardaiz, belonged to the class of yeomen, rural smallholders. Mina worked on the small family farm until 1808. When Napoleon endeavoured to seize Spain in that year he enlisted in the Doyle regiment, and then entered the guerrilla group commanded by his nephew Francisco Javier Mina. When Javier was captured by the French on 21 March 1810, seven men of the group chose to follow Francisco, and on 1 April 1810 the Junta of Aragon gave him the command of the guerrilleros of Navarre. His first act was to arrest and shoot at Estella a certain Echevarria, who, under pretence of being a guerrillero, was in fact a brigand. The national government in Cadiz gave him rank, and by 7 September 1812 he had been promoted to the rank of commander-in-chief in Upper Aragon, on the left bank of the Ebro. In the interval he claimed that he had fought 143 actions big and little, had been repeatedly wounded with bullet, sword and lance, had taken 13 fortified posts, and 14,000 prisoners, and had never been surprised by the French. Though some maintain that he was not at his best as a leader in battle, as a strategist Espoz y Mina was very successful and displayed great organizing capacity. The French authorities were compelled to allow him to levy customs dues on all goods imported into Spain, except contraband of war, which he would not allow to pass without fighting. The money thus obtained was used to pay his bands a regular salary. He was able to avoid levying excessive contributions on the country and to maintain discipline among his men, whom he had brought to a respectable state of efficiency in 1812. Espoz y Mina claimed that he immobilized 26,000 French troops which would but for him have served with Marshal Marmont in the Salamanca campaign. In the campaign of 1813 and 1814 he served with distinction under the Duke of Wellington. After the restoration of Ferdinand VII he fell into disfavour. On 25/26 September he attempted to bring about an uprising at Pamplona in favor of the Liberal party,Stanley G. Payne, Politics and the Military in Modern Spain (Stanford University Press, 1967), p. 18. but failed, and went into exile. His political opinions were democratic and radical, and as a yeoman he disliked the \\"hidalgos\\" (low-ranking nobles). The Revolution of 1820 brought him back, and he served the Liberal party during the Trienio Liberal in Galicia, Leon and Catalonia. In this last district he made the only vigorous resistance to the French intervention in favor of Ferdinand VII. On 1 November 1823 he was compelled to capitulate, and the French allowed him to escape to England by sea. In 1830 he took part in an unsuccessful rising against Ferdinand. On the death of the king he was recalled to Spain, and the government of the regent Christina gave him the command against the Carlists in 1835, though they feared his Radicalism. By this time, years, exposure and wounds had undermined his health. He was also opposed to Tom√°s de Zumalac√°rregui, an old officer of his in the War of Independence, and an even greater master of irregular mountain warfare. His health compelled him to resign in April 1835, and his later command in Catalonia was only memorable for the part he took in forcing the regent to grant a constitution in August 1836. He died at Barcelona on 24 December 1836. In 1825 Espoz y Mina published A Short Extract from the Life of General Mina, in Spanish and English, in London. Mention is made of him in all histories of the affairs of Spain during the first third of the 19th century. His full Memoirs were published by his widow at Madrid in 1851‚Äì52. The Plaza de Mina in Cadiz, Spain is named after him.

Radio career Cash was born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, in 1942, and grew up in London. He began his career in broadcasting in Canada; he visited the country while in the British Merchant Navy, and acquired a North American-sounding accent. He returned to the UK in the 1960s and joined pirate station Radio London at the age of 21 after meeting up with the programme director, Ben Toney. Toney persuaded him to join the station as the afternoon DJ and writer for commercials. Once on board with Radio London, Cash teamed up with Kenny Everett for the Kenny & Cash Show, amongst the most successful of all pirate radio programmes. After the parliament outlawed the pirate stations in 1967, Cash joined Radio Luxembourg, then became one of the first-day DJs on BBC Radio One. Cash's popular Sunday show Cash At Four attracted guests such as Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, John Cleese, Lady Antonia Fraser, Rolf Harris, and David Bellamy. In 1973, Cash started working at Capital Radio as production manager and presenter. He stayed at Capital for 21 years, reprising the Kenny & Cash Show, hosting a lunchtime quiz competition \\"Cash on Delivery\\" (COD) and the weekend programmes for Capital Gold. After the success of his best selling first novel The Rating Game, he left Capital in 1994 to concentrate on his writing. Cash latterly worked for the BBC, broadcasting his weekend shows on Saturday (vintage charts from the years 1965-1984) and Sunday nights (country and rock and roll) to BBC Radio Kent, BBC Sussex, BBC Surrey, BBC Radio Solent, BBC Radio Berkshire and BBC Radio Oxford. On 4 December 2011, at Anna Maria Island in the U.S. state of Florida, Cash married Sara Davies (born 1957), they had originally met in 1989, and went on to appear on his BBC radio show where she was called 'Emily Email' and became a co-presenter. They lived in Hollingbourne, Kent. Film and television Dave Cash hosted a few episodes of BBC TV series Top of the Pops; however, only the episode of 15 February 1968 still survives. He co- hosted this edition with Jimmy Savile. In 1970, Cash wrote and performed The Radio Programme, a 26-part sitcom/music show produced at HTV and sold to the ITV network, NBC, and stations across Europe. Guests included Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Harris and Terry-Thomas. It was on this show that he met his third wife, actress Monica Evans, with whom he had two children. In 1979, Cash appeared as himself in the cult hit Quadrophenia and took a cameo role alongside Dennis Hopper in The American Way. In 1988, he co-wrote and produced At Last It's Hogmanay with Billy Connolly and Robbie Coltrane for Channel 4. Books and articles In 1991, Cash's first novel The Rating Game made the best-seller charts in four weeks followed in 1993 by All Night Long, and King of Clubs in 1995. In 2006 he began working on a book designed to be both an autobiography and a history of pirate radio. He was also developing the first ever \\"triography\\": a biography written by Cash and his two best friends detailing their road trip to Mexico. Other work On 9 May 2011, One Media Publishing released a collection of over 1,000 albums compiled by Cash, featuring artists from a diverse range of musical genres, including Toni Braxton, Django Reinhardt, Usher, Aaliyah, The Troggs, Chaka Khan, Elvis Presley, Sham 69, Lou Reed and Jerry Lee Lewis. These albums are currently available via digital music stores only. Death Cash died suddenly on 21 October 2016 aged 74, after collapsing of a massive heart attack at his home. Cash was cremated, and in August 2017 his ashes were scattered by fellow DJ Johnnie Walker off the Harwich coast.

In addition to runway and street fashion from Canada and abroad, the magazine covers music and entertainment, health and beauty, and feature stories relevant to young Canadian women. Flare celebrated its 30th anniversary on November 5, 2009, with a reception and party at the Royal Ontario Museum. Flare was the brainchild of Donna Scott, who was assigned by Maclean-Hunter management to two of its magazines, Teen Generation and Miss Chatelaine. Scott concluded the run of both magazines and created Flare, aimed at young career women who, until that time, only had access to American fashion magazines. Under the direction of its first editor, Keitha Maclean, Flare became Canada's first successful fashion magazine. Donna Scott retired from Flare and went on to Chair the Canada Council for the Arts.

During that time, they changed very little, apart from growing much larger in size; by the late Miocene, they had become the largest land animals of their time. Their most distinctive features were the downward-curving tusks on the lower jaw. Deinotheres were not very diverse; the only three known genera are Chilgatherium, Prodeinotherium, and Deinotherium. These form an evolutionary succession, with each new genus replacing the preceding one. Unlike the various mammoth and mastodont lineages, the deinotheres died out in the early Pleistocene, rather than continuing through the ice age. Description The body shape and proportions of deinotheres were very much like those of modern elephants. The legs were long, like modern elephants, but the skull was rather flatter than that of true elephants. The upper jaw lacked incisor and canine teeth, but possessed five low-crowned molars on each side, with the same number in the lower jaw. Deinotheres used their front teeth for crushing their food, and the back teeth for shearing (slicing) the plant material. The front part of the lower jaw was turned downwards, and bore the two tusk-like incisors. These curved downwards and backwards in a sort of huge hook, and constituted the most distinct feature of the deinotheres. The tusks were used to strip vegetation rather than for digging. Ecology Deinotheres were \\"shearing browsers\\" adapted for feeding on plants above ground level. The way they chewed their food was probably similar to that of modern tapirs, with the front teeth being used to crush the food, while the second and third molars have a strong vertical shearing action, with little lateral (side-to-side) movement. This chewing action differs from both that of gomphotheres (lateral grinding) and elephants (horizontal shearing). Deinothere molars show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation, with the down- turned lower tusks being used for stripping bark or other vegetation. Deinotherium giganteum has a more elongated lower fore limb than early and middle Miocene Prodeinotherium, indicating a more efficient stride as an adaptation to the spread of savannas in Europe during the late Miocene. Deinotheres probably migrated from forest to forest, traversing the wide and (to them) useless grasslands.  Evolutionary history  The ancestry and evolutionary relationships of the deinotheres remain obscure. They are thought to be related to the barytheres, due to similarities in the structure of the teeth. They clearly diverged from the rest of the proboscideans at a very early date. In the 1970s, several researchers placed them in a separate order to the Proboscidea, but this view is not followed nowadays. The oldest known deinothere is Chilgatherium harrisi from the late Oligocene. Its fossil remains have been found in the district of Chilga in Ethiopia (hence the name). This indicates that, like other proboscideans, deinotheres evolved in Africa. Chilgatherium was quite small, about midway between a large pig and a small hippopotamus in size. By the early Miocene, deinotheres had grown to the size of a small elephant, and had migrated to Eurasia. Several species are known, all belonging to the genus Prodeinotherium. During the late middle Miocene, these modest-seized proboscideans were replaced by much larger forms across Eurasia. In Europe, Prodeinotherium bavaricum appeared in the early Miocene mammal faunal zone MN 4, but was soon replaced by Deinotherium giganteum in the middle Miocene. Likewise in Asia, Prodeinotherium is known from the early Miocene strata in the Bugti Hills, and continued into the middle Miocene Chinji Formation, where it was replaced by D. indicum. While these Miocene deinotheres were dispersed widely and evolved to huge elephant size, they were not as common as the contemporary (but smaller) Euelephantoidea. Fossil remains of this age are known from the France, Germany, Greece, Malta, and northern India and Pakistan. These consist chiefly of teeth and the bones of the skull. After the extinction of the indricotheres at the end of the early Miocene, the deinotheres were (and remained) the largest animals walking the Earth. The late Miocene was the heyday of the giant deinotheres. D. giganteum was common from Vallesian and Turolian localities in Europe. Prodeinotherium, which was reasonably well represented in the early Miocene of Africa, was succeeded by D. bozasi at the beginning of the late Miocene. And in Asia, D. indicum was most common in the late-Miocene Dhok Pathan Formation. Fossil teeth of D. giganteum, from the late-Miocene Sinap Formation at the Turkish site of Kayadibi are larger than those from older localities, such as Eppelsheim, Wissberg, and Montredon, indicating a tendency for increasing size of members of the species over time. These were the biggest animals of their day, protected from both predators and rival herbivores by virtue of their huge bulk. The largest mammoths did not approach them in size until the Pleistocene. With the end of the Miocene, deinothere fortunes declined. D. indicum died out about 7 million years ago, possibly driven to extinction by the same process of climate change that had previously eliminated the even more enormous Indricotherium. While in Europe, D. giganteum continued, albeit with dwindling numbers, until the middle Pliocene; the most recent specimen is from Romania. In its original African homeland, Deinotherium continued to flourish throughout the Pliocene, and fossils have been uncovered at several of the African sites where remains of hominids have also been found. The last deinothere species to become extinct was D. bozasi. The youngest known specimens are from the Kanjera Formation, Kenya, about 1 million years ago (early Pleistocene). The causes of the extinction of such a successful and long-lived animal are not known, although a small number of other species of African megafauna also died out at this time.

He was born in North Carolina. Early life and career James Clinton Neill was born in 1788 in Rowan County, North Carolina, the third child (and third son) of James Neill and Hannah Clayton Neill.King, C. Richard, James Clinton Neill, The Shadow Commander of the Alamo, Eakin Press; William Clinton Neill (James Clinton's grandfather), was a captain in the American Revolution, who along with five of his sons, including James Clinton's father James, fought in the War for Independence. James Clinton's uncle, Lieutenant William Neill, was killed at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill. The Clinton middle name comes from both his paternal grandfather and grandmother, Captain William Clinton Neill and his wife Mary \\"Polly\\" Clinton Neill. By at least 1807, some members of the James Neill family had moved to south-central Tennessee, in and around Bedford and Marshall counties. In this vicinity, James Clinton married Margaret Harriett Ferguson in 1807. It is likely that James Clinton Neill was acquainted with a near-neighbor around those parts at the same time, David Crockett, another Tennessean who would become a Texas Revolution hero. Like Crockett, J.C. Neill fought in the Creek Indian War, enlisting with the West Tennessee Militia (protecting present day Alabama). He enlisted on October 1, 1813 and was discharged on March 15, 1815. He participated in the latter part of the War of 1812, during the Creek War. Although wounded, he fought in the decisive battle against the Red Sticks, at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Neill served as a captain under Major William Woodfolk. The battalion was designated as \\"Separate Battalion of West Tennessee Militia\\". This battalion was based at Fort Jackson most of the time from late November 1814 to early 1815. Some of the men were stationed at Fort Decatur, where the remnants of the defeated Creek Nation came to surrender, seeking food and supplies (surrendering Creeks also went to Fort Jackson). One company, under Captain Abner Pearce, was stationed at Fort Montgomery. Woodfolk was a wealthy land speculator who owned a large plantation in Jackson County. In addition to potentially sharing time with Davy Crockett, during this military service James Clinton Neill may well have also met his future Texas Revolution commander, Sam Houston. =Politician= By at least 1820, J.C. Neill had moved his family to Greene County, Alabama. He served in the Alabama state legislature and was also a justice of the peace in Jackson County. He lived in Tennessee (present day Alabama) with his wife Margaret Harriett, who bore him three childrenGeorge Jefferson Neill (b. 1808), Samuel Clinton Neill (b. 1815) and Harriett (b. 1820). The family moved to Texas in 1831 with Stephen F. Austin's third colony where he received a league of land (4,428) acres. They settled in (Viesca District) which is now Milam County. Neill served as a district representative in the Convention of 1833. Texas Revolution =Militia captain= Due to his previous experience in battle, Neill had some knowledge of artillery. In 1834 Neill and his family moved to Mina, modern day Bastrop. On September 28, 1835, when armed conflict with Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's Mexican troops seemed inevitable, he joined the Texian militia as a captain of artillery. On October 2, 1835, he saw action at the conflict at Gonzales. Texian John Holland Jenkins recorded that Neill actually fired the famed Gonzales \\"Come and Take It\\" cannon, crediting him with firing \\"the first shot of the Texas Revolution.\\" After Gonzales, James would move onwards to the Alamo and join with Stephen F. Austin's forces in the Siege of Bexar. From December 5-10, Neill's battery provided covering fire for the assault on San Antonio de B√©xar. He had gained an additional artillery piece from the Battle of Concepci√≥n and two more from the New Orleans Grays. They would be placed in the Texian post, just west of the Alamo, confronting the town, however their fire could not shake Cos from Bexar. Then, Neill and his command formed a plan. They took a cannon across the San Antonio River and fired upon the Alamo as a diversionary tactic.Hardin (1994), p. 80. The plan worked and the Texians were able to enter into Bexar. House to house fighting would eventually push the Mexicans back and into the Alamo. On December 8, the Mexican Army made a counterattack, Neill and his crew were there to answer back with canister. The flying hailstorm would quickly end the advance, ultimately resulting in the surrender of the Mexican forces on December 9.Hardin (1994), p. 88. =Military officer= On December 7, the Texas General Council had commissioned Neill lieutenant colonel of artillery in the regular Texian army. Having received several captured Mexican field pieces to augment his firepower, he now commanded over twenty artillery pieces, the largest amount west of the Mississippi River and north of the Rio Grande. Neill had been recommended for the commission by one of his neighbors, D. C. Barrett, who wrote to Texian Army commander Sam Houston that \\"age and experience with his militia rank & title, would seem to justify his first commission as a field officer\\".quote in Winders (2004), pp. 88-9. =Alamo commander= On December 21, 1835, Houston requested that Neill, now a lieutenant colonel of an artillery company, take command of the Texian and Tejano garrison stationed at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Bexar. The orders also specified that Neill should make a report to Houston detailing the current state of the defenses in the city and what improvements were needed.Winders (2004), p. 89. The Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, with fewer than 100 soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836. Neill wrote to the provisional government: \\"If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it\\".Todish et al. (1998), p. 29. Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison was likely unable to withstand a siege greater than four days.Todish et al. (1998), p. 30. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance.Todish et al. (1998), p. 31.A week after Neill sent his letter, the Texian provisional legislature impeached the governor, who in turn disbanded the legislature. The interim constitution had given neither party the authority to take those actions, and no one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge. (Todish et al. (1998), pp. 30-1.) Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army;Houston, James Fannin, Frank W. Johnson, and Dr. James Grant (Todish et al. (1998), p. 30.) on January 14 Neill approached Houston for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition. On January 17, 1836, James Bowie arrived to evaluate the situation, with the suggestion from Sam Houston to remove the artillery and blow up the Alamo. Houston had written the Provisional Government asking for approval of his orders. Houston sent Bowie to San Antonio because he trusted Bowie's opinion. Instead of leaving the Alamo and falling back to Gonzales or Copano Bay, Bowie and Neill became committed to its defense. Bowie, impressed with Neill's leadership, wrote, \\"No other man in the army could have kept men at this post, under the neglect they have experienced.\\" Despite Houston's orders to have the Alamo destroyed as indefensible, Neill and Bowie vowed \\"... we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy.\\" However, Neill was soon badly in need of supplies, as well as soldiers. On February 11, Neill left the Alamo, to care for his family, overcome with a serious illness.Handbook of Texas/Neill He transitioned command to William Barret Travis, the highest-ranking regular army officer in the garrison. Due to a rift in the command of the Alamo between Bowie and Travis, Neill returned to the Alamo on February 14 and settled the dispute.Lindley (2003), p. 310. A resolution was reached; Bowie and Travis would hold joint command of the Alamo. Neill would leave San Antonio just before the siege of the Alamo. On the day of the final Alamo battle, Neill was in Gonzales steadily working to increase the roster of the Alamo relief forces. In Gonzales, he signed a personal voucher on March 6, for ninety dollars to buy medicine for the Alamo garrison. Neill was intent on heading back to the Alamo where unknown to him, the fort had already fallen to Mexican troops on March 6, during the Battle of the Alamo. On March 7, Neill with Burleson gathered 50 men and headed for the Alamo. They came close to the Alamo but were repulsed by Mexican cavalry. Neill returned to Gonzales on March 10 after leaving a small party of scouts to observe, who also returned to Gonzales the next day.Steve Goodson, The Runaway Scrape =Army commander= From late February until Houston's arrival on March 11, Neill had been in command of the relief troops gathering at Gonzales.Lindley (2003), p. 310. Two days later, on March 13, word was received that the Alamo had fallen. Thus, Neill once again relinquished his command and joined the withdrawal of Sam Houston's army to Groce's Retreat on the Brazos River. Unable to transport their cannons, Houston ordered them dumped into the Guadalupe River before abandoning Gonzales. That changed on April 11 when the \\"Twin Sisters\\" --two matched six-pounders-- reached the Texian camp. The brass cannons were a gift from the people of Cincinnati, Ohio. Since Neill was a ranking artillery officer, Houston named him to command the revived artillery corps. On April 20, Neill commanded the Twin Sisters during the Battle of San Jacinto.Neill did command the Twin Sisters cannons on April 20th, but this was during a skirmish on the day before the final battle took place. During this fight, his artillery corps repulsed an enemy probe of the woods in which the main Texian Army was concealed. Neill was seriously wounded when a fragment of a Mexican grapeshot caught him in the hip. The final Battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21. Later life 1838: received a league of land (including a parcel in Henderson County along the confluence of Walnut Creek and the Trinity River) for his services during the revolution.Texas General Land Office Land Grant Records 1839: ran for the position of major general of militia, losing to newcomer Felix Huston. 1842: led a ranging expedition along the upper Trinity River, to control hostile Indians. 1844: appointed as an Indian agent, responsible for vast areas of Texas. 1845: granted a lifetime pension of $200 a year, as compensation for San Jacinto injuries. =Death= In 1848, he died at his home on Spring Creek in Navarro County, Texas and was buried next to his wife, who had died near Seguin, Texas in February 1836.Lindley (2003), p. 316. =Legacy= On land owned with two partners, David Reed Mitchell and Thomas I. Smith, one hundred acres was donated on which the town of Corsicana, Texas would be founded in 1848.David Reed Mitchell, marker In 1936 a Texas centennial marker was placed in Guadalupe County, Seguin, Texas in his honor. In 1986 a Texas sesquicentennial marker was placed in Navarro County, Corsicana, Texas in his honor.

Beginning in 1975, Flemmi was a top echelon informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite delivering a great deal of intelligence about the inner workings of the Patriarca crime family, Flemmi's own criminal activities proved a public relations nightmare for the FBI. He was ultimately brought up on charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and pleaded guilty in return for a sentence of life in prison. Early years Stephen Joseph Flemmi was the eldest of two or three sons (one brother was Vincent Flemmi) born to Italian immigrants Giovanni and Mary Irene Flemmi in Boston, Massachusetts. He was raised in the Orchard Park tenement located at 25 Ambrose Street in Roxbury, Massachusetts. His father was a bricklayer and veteran of the Royal Italian Army during World War I, and his mother was a full-time homemaker. Flemmi enlisted in the Army in 1951 at the age of 17 and served two tours of duty in Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. He was awarded the Silver Star and Bronze Star Medal decorations for valor and honorably discharged in 1955. Relationship with James J. Bulger James Bulger (right), probably in the 1980s In 1965, James J. \\"Whitey\\" Bulger was released from Federal prison after serving a nine-year sentence for robbing banks. After a few years of working as a janitor, he became an enforcer for South Boston mob boss Donald Killeen. After Killeen was murdered by an enforcer for the Mullen Gang, Winter Hill Gang boss Howie Winter mediated the dispute between Bulger and the remaining Killeens and the Mullens, who were led by Patrick Nee. Winter soon chose Bulger as his man in South Boston. Shortly afterward, Bulger became partners with Flemmi. At this time, the Boston FBI office tried to convince Bulger to become an informant, but he refused. Bulger allegedly told Flemmi that he knew his secret. Flemmi has insisted that he did not know at the time that Bulger was also an informant. Kevin Weeks, however, insists that Flemmi's story is untrue. He considers it too much of a coincidence that Bulger became an informant a year after becoming Flemmi's partner. He has written off his belief that Flemmi had probably helped to build a Federal case against him. Weeks has said that Bulger was likely forced to choose between supplying information to the FBI or returning to prison. Married life In the 1950s, Flemmi was married to an Irish-American woman named Jeanette, from whom he later became estranged. By 1980, he planned to divorce Jeanette to marry his longtime mistress, Marilyn DeSilva, but it is unknown whether he ever followed through with the legal actions. Throughout his life, Flemmi was engaged in clandestine affairs with several other women, including sisters Debra Davis and Michelle Davis, and Deborah Hussey. Flemmi met Debra Davis at a jewelry store, and the couple dated for more than seven years. In 1981, Bulger is said to have killed Davis because she knew that Flemmi was an informant. Four years after killing Davis, in 1985, Flemmi and Bulger killed Deborah Hussey, who was also Flemmi's stepdaughter (born to his common-law wife, Marion A. Hussey). Deborah was first sexually molested by Flemmi in her teens‚Äîshe informed her mother that Flemmi had molested her for years‚Äîand had been his girlfriend since. In the days prior to her murder, Hussey was close to breaking up with Flemmi and telling her mother about their relationship, which is thought to have been the motive for her murder. It is thought that Flemmi, Bulger, and Weeks lured her to the house at 799 East Third Street in South Boston and garrotted her. Her body was then buried in the basement. According to Kevin Weeks, Relationship with the FBI Rico first recruited Flemmi as an informant in 1965. In 1997, shortly after The Boston Globe disclosed that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, former Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks met with John Connolly, who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, \\"The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them.\\" According to Weeks, Arrest and imprisonment In December 1994, Connolly informed Bulger and Flemmi that several imprisoned Jewish-American bookmakers had agreed to testify to paying them protection money. As a result, sealed indictments had come from the Department of Justice and the FBI was due to make arrests during the Christmas season. In response, Bulger fled Boston on December 23, 1994, accompanied by his common law wife, Catherine Greig. According to Kevin Weeks, Flemmi, however, chose to remain in Boston and was swiftly taken into custody and incarcerated at the Plymouth County House of Correction. During the discovery phase, two of Flemmi's co-defendants, Boston mafiosi Frank Salemme and Bobby DeLuca, were listening to tape from a roving bug, which is normally authorized when the FBI has no advance knowledge of where criminal activity will take place. They overheard two of the agents who were listening in on the bug mention that they should have told one of their informants to give \\"a list of questions\\" to the other wiseguys. When their lawyer, Tony Cardinale, learned about this, he realized that the FBI had lied about the basis for a roving bug in order to protect an informant. Suspecting that this was not the only occasion that this happened, Cardinale sought to force prosecutors to reveal the identities of any informants used in connection with the case. Eventually, both Bulger and Flemmi were revealed to be FBI informants. Flemmi believed that as a result, he had protection from the FBI, but not immunity. He initially planned to prove through his own testimony and that of others that he was being prosecuted for crimes that were effectively authorized by the FBI. He believed that as a result, Judge Mark L. Wolf would have no choice but to throw out the entire indictment. Flemmi's problem was that he couldn't really come clean. Without immunity, he couldn't admit to killings he hadn't been charged with. By the time Flemmi took the stand, in August 1998, John Martorano had pleaded guilty and started outlining the details of almost twenty murders he'd committed. Many of his murders had been done at the direction of Bulger and Flemmi, who had paid him more than $1 million during his years as a wanted fugitive between 1978 and 1995. To many questions about the murders Flemmi was involved in, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment. However, by 2000, it was obvious this gambit had failed. Out of desperation, he ordered Weeks to get in touch with retired state police lieutenant Richard J. Schneiderhan, a lifelong friend who had been on Winter Hill's payroll for virtually his entire career, to leak information about several wiretaps investigators were monitoring in hopes of tracking down Bulger. However, when Weeks reached a plea bargain a year later, he admitted Schneiderhan's role in the leak. Schneiderhan was ultimately convicted of obstructing justice and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. In 2000, Flemmi's brother Michael, then a retired Boston Police Department officer, was arrested for moving an arsenal of more than 70 weapons from their mother's shed after learning that it was to be the target of a search warrant. He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 10 years in prison. A year later, he pleaded guilty to selling a load of Flemmi's stolen jewelry for $40,000. By 2003, Flemmi realized he was at the end of his tether. Salemme and several others had joined Weeks in turning informer, and had disclosed enough information to ensure Flemmi would die in prison. He also potentially faced the death penalty for murders in Florida and Oklahoma. In October, Flemmi pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Boston to 10 counts of murder and accepted a sentence of life in prison without parole. He made the decision as a part of a deal to reduce the sentence for his brother, Michael Flemmi. Flemmi testified against Connolly at the latter's trial for the murder of John Callahan, the former president of World Jai Alai. Callahan had been killed in 1981 after he was implicated in the murder of his successor as president, Roger Wheeler. According to Flemmi, Connolly told him and Bulger that Callahan could potentially turn state's evidence and implicate them in Wheeler's murder.http://archive.boston.com/news/specials/whitey/articles/profile_of_john_callahan/ He also testified against Bulger in the latter's 2013 trial for murder and racketeering, at which Bulger was sentenced to life plus five years. In popular culture In the Whitey Bulger biopic Black Mass (2015), Flemmi is portrayed by Rory Cochrane. In the movie The Departed (2006), Flemmi was the inspiration for the character Mr. French, portrayed by Ray Winstone.

Albenga has the nickname of city of a hundred spires. The economy is mostly based on tourism, local commerce and agriculture. Albenga has six hamlets: San Fedele, Lusignano, Campochiesa, Leca, Bastia, Salea. Towers of Albenga. History A settlement of pre-Roman origins on the west side of the Ligurian coast, it was founded around the 4th century BC on the slopes of the coastal hills, becoming the capital of the Ingauni Ligures tribe, who dedicated themselves to marine activities and controlled a large territory between Finale and Sanremo. During the Second Punic War the city allied itself with the Carthaginians, but was defeated by the Romans under proconsul Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus in 181 BC. The following year the Romans and the Ingauni signed a foedus (alliance agreement) which began the total Romanization of the whole region. Put under Latin rights in 89 BC, Albingaunum was granted Roman citizenship in 45 BC under Julius Caesar, starting to enjoy, with the beginning of the Empire, a period of prosperity. A further boost for the city came from the building of the Via Julia Augusta (13 BC), connecting it to southern France and Spain. In the meantime the intense exploitation of the flat land around the city continued; an inscription records the restoration of the walls, forum, and harbor, by Constantius in A.D. 354. During the 5th century, the city suffered from raids by the Visigoths, who partly destroyed and sacked it. The old Municipium, which now in a disastrous conditions, was rebuilt through the intervention of emperor Constantius III who gave the city stability and a defensive structure that allowed it to survive through the following centuries. Albenga established itself as a commune in 1098; in that same year it took part in the First Crusade with vessels, men and money, receiving rights of free trade by the King of Jerusalem. From that time on, the Golden Red Cross coat of arms was displayed on its ships and on its towers. Later, after the invasion of northern Italy by emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the city supported him thanks to its Ghibelline allegiance, which was never abandoned during the following centuries. In 1159 it received imperial investiture for all its territory. In 1798 Albenga was declared capital of the Centa Jurisdiction, as part of the short living constitution of the Ligurian Republic. In 1815 the city, together with the whole of Liguria, was assigned to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, becoming the capital of a province including Andora and Finale Ligure. In 1863, after the unification of Italy, the province was reduced to a district, and was abolished completely in 1927. At the time Albenga had been reduced to an agricultural village, overtaken by other coastal towns in both economic and demographic development, owing to their superior touristic appeal. =The name= The name of Albenga comes from the Latin Alb√≠ngaunum that comes from Album Ingaunum, that is means the capital city + genitive plural in -um. The ethnonym Ingauni ing consists of Indo-European origin, and a name of Gaulish-ligurian land. Album comes from alb o alp an ancient pre-Indo-European (rock, hill), often erroneously assocciata to \\"album\\" a Latin word meaning white or clear. The first name was Album Ingaunum, but when it was conquered by the Romans, the name became Albingaunum; after the Roman Empire the name became Albinauno and near the 1000 became Albingano. Only in the 14th century did the name become Albenga. Geography Grazing sheep in the Centa riverbed Albenga is located in the west Riviera. It has a homonymous plain at the mouth of the river Centa, which over the centuries has been the architect of the Albenga's plain, remodeling the ground several times and forcing the Albenganesi to adopt embankments and bridges since its foundation. Until the 17th century, it based its economy on maritime trade, as the city was built on the delta of the Centa and was surrounded by walls and bridges. With the closure of other roads estuary delta, which occurred first at the hands of the Genoese and later as the work of nature, now the river runs along the center flowing to the estuary. Even the memory of the old bridges was deleting itself. It is the main center of the district Albenganese, which extends from Finale to Andora and its hinterland. It includes the nature reserve of island Gallinara, where apparently lived St. Martin of Tours. Just dedicated to this saint was a monastery on the island. After 1064 it became the possession of the abbey of Abbadia Alpina. =Climate= The climate is mild along the coast, with mild winters and both hot and cold summers, rarely mitigated by the sea breeze. The inner part of the plain has more continental characteristics, which create a greater temperature range, with harsher winters and summers. Main sights Built on the ancient orthogonal structure that had the current \\"Via Medaglie d'oro\\" and \\"Via Enrico d'Aste\\" respectively as the Roman camp main road axes (cardo and decumanus), the town has its planimetric hub in the historical San Michele Square. Around it some palaces were built, which were historically the seats of political and religious authorities. =Cathedral of St Michael Archangel= Built on the basic structures of the early Christian basilica put up by orders of Constantius III between the 4th and 5th century, it has a fa√ßade with traces of the transformation from Romanesque to Gothic. From this same period are the two lateral portals of the main facade and a third one the left side of the church, that hosts a restored Lombard bas-relief; the central portal dates from 1669. The current design is the result of further elevations. The restoration works between 1964 and 1967 brought back the cathedral design to its original medieval aspect. The nearby steeple was attached to the church in the 13th century, built over the ruins of the old bell tower between the years 1391 and 1395. This construction is one of the last local examples of the use of bare bricks, progressively replaced by plastering. The Baptistery of Albenga. =Albenga Baptistery= The baptistery is located to the side of the Cathedral, as it was typical of the early Christian structures, and can be visited from the Loggia of the old City Hall Palace. It has an octagonal interior dating to the 5th century. The current appearance dates from a late 19th-century restoration work, carried on by Alfredo D'Andrade. During those works, the original basin vaulted roof, built with the Byzantine-Ravennate technique of the \\"tubi fittili\\" (terracotta tubes), was completely destroyed. The mosaic decorations of the vault of the presbytery go back to the 5th and 6th centuries. =Old City Hall Palace= Dating back to the early 14th century, it has undergone several renovations over the years before receiving its present appearance. It housed the Council Hall (the big bell still calls the citizens when the council committee meets in the new town hall) and the jail. The lower floor dates from the 14th century, while the upper one was reconstructed in 1387‚Äì1391. The fa√ßade towards the baptistery has Ghibelline-style merlons with two large staircases. Since 1933, it houses the Ingauni Museum. The latter, established in 1933 by Nino Lamboglia, collects objects and medieval Roman (sculptures, inscriptions, sarcophagi and 15th-century frescoes), archaeological and epigraphic collections. =Old Bishop's Palace= Located near the baptistery, it dates from the 11th century, with a 13th-century portal. It is the seat of the local bishop and houses the Holy Art Museum. The wing leading to the baptistery show several construction phases from the 13th and 14th centuries. The decoration with black and white stripes was added in 1463 under bishop Napoleone Fieschi. The heraldic fresco is by Giovanni Canavesio (1477). The Diocesan Museum of Albenga occupies a series of rooms decorated with frescoes, it houses works of art and findings from the excavation of the cathedral. Among the paintings stand out a St. John attributed to Caravaggio and The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine by Guido Reni. =Ancient remains= Restructured by Emperor Augustus in 13 BC, the Via Julia Augusta was the most important communication link in the Riviera up until the construction of the Napoleonic road closer to the sea, the current site of the Via Aurelia. Its path, with plenty of Roman buildings destined to funerary celebrations, makes an archaeological walk beautiful also from a panoramic an naturalistic point of view. Albenga is also home to the remains of a Roman amphitheatre dating from the 3rd century BC. It represents the only example of theatrical construction known on the entire Western Riviera. Placed a short distance away from the Amphitheatre and from the Via Julia Augusta, is the so-called Pilone, standing over the eastern slope of the Mount. This is the most renowned and characteristic Ingaunian funeral monument. Also in the mount area is the Palaeo-Christian Basilica of S. Calocero (4th‚Äì5th century). It was built on the latter martyr's tomb. =Other sights= Other sights include: *South of the historical center is an archaeological area discovered during the excavations for the enlargement of the riverbed between 2001 and 2002. Here, by the river, were found the ruins of the old thermal system and those of the early Christian complex with medieval San Clemente Church. *Pontelungo (\\"Long Bridge\\"), the only documented medieval bridge (c. 13th century). The Sanctuary of Nostra Signora di Pontelungo (early 18th century) is located nearby. *Palazzo Peloso Cepolla (16th century). It has a corner tower from the 13th century. The entrance hall houses a fresco depicting the Roman usurper Proculus, while the piano nobile has several Renaissance and Roman marble busts. It is home to Roman Naval Museum, established in 1950. It gathers more than a thousand Roman amphorae recovered from a ship in the 1st century BC, sank in the waters of Albenga. It was the first Roman cargo ship discovered and explored the bottom of the Tyrrhenian Sea. There is also a section of the caves of prehistoric materials from val Pennavaira. *Torre Oddo, a tower with typical Ghibelline merlons *The piazzetta dei Leoni (\\"Lions' Small Square\\"), located between the cathedral's apse and the Costa family medieval buildings. The latter brought the three Renaissance-style peperino lions from which the square takes its name in 1608. * Museum of the Oil Civilization. Located in an old mill site owned by the family Sommariva, it is an ethnographic exhibition dedicated to the processing of olives, olive oil and wine. Tourism Besides being an important historical town, Albenga is a coastal and touristic resort town of the Riviera Ligure. Its coasts has a length of some 4 km of fine sand mixed with pebbles, with bathing establishments, divided in small public beaches and other managed and fully equipped. The sea promenade is 3 km long. The private island of Gallinara is less than one naval mile from Albenga. Gallinara Island.

This modern track has linked the two sides quickly Albenga divided by the river Centa. The city is the crossroads of main roads, built over the past centuries, which connect with the nearby Piedmont, as evidenced by names such as street to Piedmont. There are 5 roads in the world that bear the name of ALBENGA: four are in North America and one in the Southern Hemisphere, it is Albenga Avenue Coral Gables, Florida; Albenga Road Northwest to Palm Bay, Florida; Southwest Albenga Avenue Port Saint Lucie, Florida; Albenga Lane in North Port, Florida and Albenga Place to Secret Harbor, Western Australia. =Highway= Albenga is accessible via the A10 Highway from its own. Since 1969 started the process of a project for a road that can unite the plain directly and quickly with its hinterland, with the Val Bormida, then the A6 Highway and the Piedmont, then go to England and connect with the A26 Highway, this project will form the Highway Predosa-Albenga, in 2010 has been kicked off for the final design. =Railway= Albenga has its own railway station, located on the line Genoa-Ventimiglia. The station was opened in 1872, but the current passenger building, designed by Roberto Narducci, dates back to 1930. The existing railway line, for long stretches of single track, will be replaced by a new double track line, located further upstream, the new project includes a large station in the village of Bastia. =Airport= In the nearby town of Villanova d'Albenga is the Airport International \\"C. Panero\\", which opened in 1922. In this space there is also the barracks of the 15 ¬∫ Helicopters core of Carabinieri.

In 1987 he became the first South Asian to earn the Grandmaster title. Early life Murshed was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to Manzur Murshed and Najma Ahmed. He picked up the game from his older brother. His neighbor was Jamilur Rahman, who later became a national champion himself. These favorable conditions may have contributed to the young Murshed's devotion to chess. Murshed passed his SSC exam in 1983 from St. Joseph High School and HSC exam in 1985 from Dhaka College.. Career =Domestic chess= As a nine- year-old, Murshed entered the preliminary rounds of the national chess championship. Although he failed to qualify, he left a lasting impression on all present. By the age of 12, he was considered one of the top players in Bangladesh. In 1978, he finished first in the national championship with two others, but ultimately placed third on a tie-breaker. He went on to win the next four national championships in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982. He became the national champion again after 30 years in 2012. =International chess= In 1979, Murshed played in his first international competition at Kolkata, India. In 1981, placed second in the zonal tournament, held in Sharjah, UAE the same year, earning his International Master Title in the process. Later that year, he tied for first in the Asian Junior Championship, held in Dhaka, but was counted second on tiebreak since he had fewer wins (and losses) than Ricardo de Guzman (Philippines) who was awarded the title and automatic IM. Murshed participated in the 1982 World Junior Chess Championship, and although he failed to replicate his recent success, his game against Lars Schandorff of Denmark (later a grandmaster) was selected as the best game of the tournament. Murshed earned his first Grandmaster norm in 1984 due to his success in Bela Crkva Open, Yugoslavia (1983), Oakham School Youth Tournament (ahead of Nigel Short and Maxim Dlugy), Novag Commonwealth Chess Tournament 1984, Hong Kong 1984. He earned his second grandmaster norm in 1986, thanks to his solid performance in Capstain International Tournament, Dhaka (1985) and Calcutta Grandmasters Tournament, Calcutta (1986). In 1987, FIDE awarded him the Grandmaster title, making him the first GM in South Asia. Upon earning his bachelor's degree in economics, Murshed returned to chess. However, his playing declined when he found it hard to adapt to the new generation of information driven chess. Nonetheless, he still found success from time to time in the international scene: first in the Goodrich, India (1991), second in the GM Tournament, Cebu, Philippines (1992), third in the Doha Chess Festival, Qatar (1993), T-1st place with two other contestants in the zonal tournament (1993), and finally, T-2nd place in the Commonwealth Chess Championship in 2004. In November 2009 he tied for 3rd‚Äì8th with Anton Filippov, Elshan Moradiabadi, Merab Gagunashvili, Alexander Shabalov and Vadim Malakhatko in the Ravana Challenge Tournament in Colombo =Chess teams= He played for Bangladesh in the Chess Olympiads of 1984, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2014. Education After earning his Grand Master title, Murshed went to the University of Pennsylvania to study economics. He played in only a handful chess tournaments during this time, but earned his bachelor's degree. Style of play Murshed plays primarily positional chess. He builds up small advantages, ultimately leading to a victory.

Wright Mills, in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the military, corporate, and political elements of society and suggests that the ordinary citizen is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities. Background The book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, White Collar: The American Middle Classes, which examines the then-growing role of middle managers in American society. A main inspiration for the book was Franz Leopold Neumann's book Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. Behemoth had a major impact on Mills.C.Wright Mills: Power, Politics and People, (New York, 1963 p.174) Summary The Joint Chiefs of Staff, pictured here in 1949, are one of six ruling elites Mills identified. According to Mills, the eponymous \\"power elite\\" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \\"the underlying populations of the world.\\" The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) \\"two or three hundred giant corporations\\" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from \\"a decentralized set of several dozen states\\" and \\"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\\" and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of \\"distrust fed by state militia,\\" but now an entity with \\"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.\\" Importantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that \\"often they are uncertain about their roles\\" and \\"without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Onecide.\\" Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at eastern establishment universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. But, Mills notes, \\"Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?\\" Mills identifies two classes of Ivy League alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon fraternity or final club, such as Porcellian and Fly Club, and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private preparatory academies, where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. Historically prominent families, such as the Kennedy family, form the \\"Metropolitan 400\\". Shown here are Rose and Joseph Kennedy in 1940. The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: * the \\"Metropolitan 400\\": members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the Social Register * \\"Celebrities\\": prominent entertainers and media personalities * the \\"Chief Executives\\": presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector * the \\"Corporate Rich\\": major landowners and corporate shareholders * the \\"Warlords\\": senior military officers, most importantly the Joint Chiefs of Staff * the \\"Political Directorate\\": \\"fifty-odd men of the executive branch\\" of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the Executive Office of the President, sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the Democratic and Republican parties but usually professional government bureaucrats Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: \\"Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.\\" Reception and criticism Commenting on The Power Elite, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. derisively said, \\"I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again.\\" Adolf Berle noted the book contained \\"an uncomfortable degree of truth\\", but Mills presented \\"an angry cartoon, not a serious picture\\". Dennis Wrong described The Power Elite as \\"an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation\\". A review of the book in the Louisiana Law Review bemoaned that the \\"practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research\\". Nonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, G. William Domhoff wrote, \\"Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago\\". Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that The Power Elite was \\"vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering\\" but declared that its historical value \\"seems assured\\". In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars. https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Military_Economy_and_the_State.html?id=H1VIMwEACAAJ&redir;_esc=y In popular culture In 2017, episode 5 of the Netflix TV series Mindhunter contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah \\"Debbie\\" Mitford, writes a paper on The Power Elite. In the Noah Baumbach film While We're Young, the protagonist Josh Schrebnick is a documentarian who cites Mills, and frequently cites the expertise of the subject of his documentary, Ira Mandelstam's views as they relate to The Power Elite.

His father, Israel Minor, was a merchant who made a large fortune in the pharmaceutical business. As a young man, Robert Minor worked as a bookkeeper in New York City but decided to study art in his early thirties. After studying in New York with painter Alfred Cornelius Howland, Minor went abroad in 1871 to continue his artistic education. He visited various galleries in England before traveling to Barbizon, France, where he studied under Diaz. He later studied in Antwerp under Joseph Van Luppen and Hippolyte Boulenger. In 1874, he was vice president of the Soci√©t√© artistique et litt√©raire of Antwerp. On his return to the United States in 1874, he opened a studio in New York. He painted for many years out of his studio in the Old University Building of New York University. Painting in the Adirondack Mountains and later in Waterford, Connecticut, Minor soon became known for his landscapes resembling the Barbizon School. Under the influence of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant, he also began to paint in a Tonalist style. His painting Great Silas at Night (1897) displays his adoption of the Tonalist style while his lingering Barbizon style can be seen in A Hillside Pasture. From the 1890s until his death, Minor exhibited frequently with the Tonalists in New York. In 1897, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design, New York. In 1900, Minor achieved the height of his success at the historic William T. Evans sale in 1900, where his painting The Close of Day (private collection) fetched $3,050, the highest price for a landscape by a living American painter at that auction. Over the course of his lifetime, Minor was a member of the Society of American Artists and the Salmagundi Club. He exhibited in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, and elsewhere in the United States, as well as in the Royal Academy of London and the salons of Paris and Antwerp. Minor was plagued with bad health during the last decade of his life, decreasing the quantity and likely the quality of his works. He died at his home in Waterford, Connecticut, on August 4, 1904. His paintings are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Mead Art Museum, the Lyman Allyn Museum, the Florence Griswold Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Newark Museum, the Robert Hull Fleming Museum, the Haggin Museum, the Salmagundi Club, the Memorial Art Gallery, and the University of Arizona Museum of Art. Work His paintings are characteristic of the Barbizon school and Tonalism, and he was particularly happy in his sunset and twilight effects; but it was only within a few years of his death that he began to have a vogue among collectors.

Emphasis is laid on efficient support for array processing via data parallelism. Efficiency concerns are essentially twofold. On the one hand, efficiency in program development is to be improved by the opportunity to specify array operations on a high level of abstraction. On the other hand, efficiency in program execution, i.e. the runtime performance of programs, in time and memory consumption, is still to be achieved by sophisticated compilation schemes. Only as far as the latter succeeds, the high-level style of specifications can actually be called useful. To facilitate compiling to efficiently executable code, certain functional language features which are not considered essential for numerical applications, e.g. higher-order functions, polymorphism, or lazy evaluation, are not (yet) supported by SAC. These may be found in general-purpose functional languages, e.g. Haskell, Clean, Miranda, or ML. To overcome the acceptance problems encountered by other functional or array based languages intended for numerical / array intensive applications, e.g. SISAL, NESL, Nial, APL, J, or K, particular regard is paid to ease the transition from a C / Fortran like programming environment to SAC. In more detail, the basic language design goals of SAC are to: * provide a purely functional language with a syntax very similar to that of C in order to ease, for a large community of programmers, the transition from an imperative to a functional programming style; * support multi- dimensional arrays as first class objects; * allow the specification of shape- and dimension-invariant array operations; * provide high-level array operations that liberate programming from tedious and error-prone specifications of starts, stops and strides for array traversals thereby improving code reusability and programming productivity, in general. * incorporate a module system that allows for separate compilation, separate name spaces, and abstract data types, and, additionally, provides an interface to foreign languages in order to enable reuse of existing code; * provide means for a smooth integration of states and state modifications into the functional paradigm based on uniqueness types; * use the module system, the foreign language interface, and the integration of states in order to create a standard library which provides a functionality similar to that of the standard C libraries, e.g. powerful I/O facilities or mathematical functions; * facilitate the compilation to host machine code which can be efficiently executed both in terms of time and space demand; * facilitate the compilation for non-sequential program execution in multiprocessor environments.

Ammonium iron(II) sulfate, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2.6H2O, is named Mohr's salt after him. Life Mohr was born in 1806 into the family of a prosperous druggist in Koblenz. The young Mohr received much of his early education at home, a great part of it in his father's laboratory. This experience may be responsible for much of the skill Mohr later showed in devising instruments and methods of chemical analysis. At the age of twenty- one he began to study chemistry under Leopold Gmelin, and, after five years in Heidelberg, Berlin and Bonn, he returned with the degree of PhD to join his father's establishment. Mohr's father died during 1840 at which time Mohr assumed control of the family business. He retired from it for a life of scientific leisure in 1857, but at the age of fifty-seven some serious financial losses caused him to become a privatdozent in Bonn. In 1867 he was appointed, by the direct influence of the government, extraordinary professor of pharmacy. Work Mohr buretteMohr was the leading scientific chemist of his time in Germany, and the inventor of many improvements in analytical methodology. He invented an improved burette which had a tip at the bottom and a clamp (a 'Mohr's clip'), which made it much easier to use than its predecessors, which were more similar to a graduated cylinder. His methods of volumetric analysis were expounded in his Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrir-methode (1855) (Instructional Book of Titration Methods in Analytical Chemistry), which won special commendation from Liebig and ran to many editions. Page 3 shows Mohr's burette. His Geschichte der Erde, eine Geologie auf neuer Grundlage (1866) (History of the Earth, a Geology on a New Basis), was also widely circulated.

Rajio tais≈ç were introduced to Japan in 1928 as a commemoration of the coronation of Emperor Hirohito. The idea for radio broadcast calisthenics came from the US, where during the 1920s the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. sponsored 15-minute radio calisthenics in major cities in the US. Visiting employees of the Japanese postal insurance division brought samples of the exercises from the US back to Japan. The exercises were widely used to improve the health of Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s. The exercises were introduced to several other pacific nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia during Japan's colonization period. After Japan's defeat in 1945, the broadcasts were banned by the occupying powers for being too militaristic in nature. After several rewrites to the exercise routine, it was reintroduced by NHK radio in 1951 with the support of the education ministry, health ministry, the Japan Gymnastic Association and the Japan Recreation Association.

The first recorded observations of them are thought to have been telescopic observations by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Although the extreme crescent phase of Venus has since been observed with the naked eye, there are no indisputable historical pre-telescopic records of it being described or known. Observation The orbit of Venus is 224.7 Earth days. The phases of Venus result from the planet's orbit around the Sun inside the Earth's orbit giving the telescopic observer a sequence of progressive lighting similar in appearance to the Moon's phases. It presents a full image when it is on the opposite side of the Sun. It shows a quarter phase when it is at its maximum elongation from the Sun. Venus presents a thin crescent in telescopic views as it comes around to the near side between the Earth and the Sun and presents its new phase when it is between the Earth and the Sun. Since the planet has an atmosphere it can be seen at new in a telescope by the halo of light refracted around the planet. The full cycle from new to full to new again takes 584 days (the time it takes Venus to overtake the Earth in its orbit). The planet also changes in apparent size from 9.9 arc seconds at full (superior conjunction) up to a maximum of 68 arc seconds at new (inferior conjunction). Venus reaches its greatest magnitude of ‚àí4.5 when it is an intermediate crescent shape at the point in its orbit, when it is 68 million km away from the Earth (a combination of its closeness and the fact that it is 28% illuminated).souledout.org - Venus Has Phases ... Like the Moon History Diagram of the orbit of Venus in relationship to the Earth, observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610 The official first observations of the full planetary phases of Venus were by Galileo at the end of 1610 (though not published until 1613 in the Letters on Sunspots). Using a telescope, Galileo was able to observe Venus going through a full set of phases, something prohibited by the Ptolemaic system. (The Ptolemaic system would never allow Venus to be fully lit from the perspective of the Earth, as this would require it to be on the far side of the Sun, which is impossible if Venus's orbit in its entirety is between the Earth and the Sun, as the Ptolemaic system requires).Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus (slide 4) This observation essentially ruled out the Ptolemaic system, and was compatible only with the Copernican system and the Tychonic system and other heliocentric models such as the Capellan and Riccioli's extended Capellan model. There is some controversy about Galileo's claim to first observing the phases of Venus: In December of 1610, Galileo received a letter from fellow scientist Benedetto Castelli, asking if the phases of Venus were observable through Galileo's new telescope.Phases of Venus Days later, Galileo wrote in a letter to Johannes Kepler saying that he had observed Venus going through phases, but took complete credit for himself. It is unclear, lacking copies of any earlier correspondence, whether Castelli was telling Galileo of it for the first time, or responding to Galileo having previously informed him of it.The Phases of Venus and Heliocentricity: A Rough Guide Curiously, Galileo's letter to Kepler was encrypted so that Kepler could not scoop Galileo before he had made more exhaustive observations: Galileo took a sentence stating that Venus went through phases: :Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum (The mother of love imitates the shape of Cynthia) And scrambled the letters into a strange anagram: :Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur o.y. (These are now too young to be read by me) Cynthia was a popular epithet for the moon, the mother of love of course being Venus. He sent the anagram to Kepler, then a few months later sent the decoded version. This way he had proof of having made the observation, without Kepler being able to publish it earlier.Galileo Galilei's Anagram This technique of hiding encoded announcements in letters was not uncommon at the time. Naked eye observations The extreme crescent phase of Venus can be seen without a telescope by those with exceptionally acute eyesight, at the limit of human perception. The angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1 minute of arc. The apparent disk of Venus' extreme crescent measures between 60.2 and 66 seconds of arc, depending on the distance from Earth. Mesopotamian priest-astronomers described Ishtar (Venus) in cuneiform text as having horns which has been interpreted as indicating observation of a crescent. However, other Mesopotamian deities were depicted with horns, so the phrase could have been simply a symbol of divinity.

History In 1831 the traders of the port of Cardigan made an application to build a light, and this was authorised in 1834. Designed by James Walker, the lighthouse was built on the island in 1839, acting both as a waymark for vessels navigating offshore and as assistance to ships navigating around the Bishops and Clerks island group. The lighthouse was converted to electric operation in 1959, and in 1971 a helipad was constructed at the site. Finally, the lighthouse was automated and demanned in 1983. Like many in the UK, it is now monitored from the control centre at Trinity House in Harwich, Essex, England. Architecture The tower is built of granite, and is circular with a slight taper. A cornice at the top of the tower has iron railings, this is unusual in lighthouses designed by James Walker. Accommodation for the keepers was provided in two adjoining houses, which were built at the same time as the tower. Other buildings accommodate equipment. Seabirds It was built in the path of many migrating sea birds, and the brilliance of the light at night often led the birds to dash themselves against the lantern. Many died and, when Trinity House and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds teamed up, they together came to the conclusion to build special bird perches on the side of the lighthouse lantern.

Development started in September 1942 in response to United States Army Air Forces requirement for a fighter possessing an extremely high rate of climb, using the most powerful liquid- cooled engine then available, the Allison V-3420. The program was cancelled after only a small number of prototypes and production aircraft had been completed, as it was no longer required in its original role, could not be quickly deployed, and possessed no significant advantages over aircraft already in production. Design and development The first XP-75 in flight In October 1942, the contract for two prototypes, designated \\"XP-75\\", was signed with the Fisher Body Division of GM. The design concept was to use the outer wing panels from the North American P-51 Mustang, the tail assembly from the Douglas A-24 (SBD), and the undercarriage from the Vought F4U Corsair in a general layout much as in the Bell P-39 Airacobra with the engine located amidships with the contra-rotating propellers driven through extension shafts. At an early design stage, however, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk outer wing panels were substituted for the P-51 panels. In mid-1943, the need for long-range escort fighters became more urgent than fast climbing interceptors so a decision was made to order six more XP-75 airplanes modified for the long-range role. At this time, an order for 2,500 production aircraft was also let, but with the stipulation that if the first P-75A was not satisfactory the complete order might be canceled. At the time, General Motors was busy in several projects towards the war effort, including the mass production of several different aircraft types, among them the Grumman TBF Avenger. Some sourcesWinchester 2005 claim that the P-75 was the result of a scheme to get General Motors out of being forced to build Boeing B-29 Superfortresses; the P-75 project being a \\"high-priority\\" project to help GM avoid the added strain of Superfortress production. The \\"Eagle\\" was given extensive media coverage prior to its first flight, being trumpeted as a \\"wonder plane\\".O'Leary 1994, p. 81. Operational history Fisher P-75A in flight Powered by a V-3420-19 24-cylinder engine rated at 2,600 hp driving co-axial contra-rotating propellers, the XP-75 flew for the first time on 17 November 1943. The second XP-75 flew shortly thereafter, with all six long-range XP-75s entering the test program by the spring 1944. The test program brought up numerous teething problems, including miscalculation of the fighter's center of mass, failure of the engine to produce its expected power, inadequate engine cooling, high aileron forces at high speed, and poor spin characteristics. Redesigns were introduced into the long-range XP-75s including a modified tail assembly, new \\"bubble\\" canopy, and a V-3420-23 engine that corrected most of the deficiencies by the time the first P-75A Eagles entered flight testing in September 1944. By this time, the Army Air Forces had decided to limit the number of combat aircraft types in production and not enter into large-scale production of new types that might not be available before the war ended. As the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning and North American P-51 Mustang demonstrated excellent long-range capabilities, the production run of the P-75A Eagle was subsequently terminated on 6 October 1944. It was decided to use the six completed production aircraft for experimental work and development of the V-3420 engine. As a result of those events, the P-75A did not complete formal performance trials due to termination of the production contract. Ultimately, only eight XP-75s and six P-75As were built.

The main settlement is the village of Halton, or Halton-on-Lune, in the west, and the parish stretches to the hamlet of Aughton in the east. It lies in the City of Lancaster district of Lancashire, and has a population of 2,227, down from 2,360 in 2001.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Lancaster Retrieved 2009-09-18 Halton Halton consists primarily of modern housing, amongst which can be found a number of 17th- and 18th-century buildings. It has a primary school and there is a post office and other local amenities including a very successful community centre. The village is on the edge of the new Heysham to M6 Link Road.Heysham to M6 Link, Lancashire County Council, accessed 16 October 2011 Halton railway station was on the opposite bank of the river from the village, linked by a narrow toll bridge. The station closed in 1966, but the station building and part of one platform survive as the Lancaster University boat house, that sits beside the cycle path that was once the now disused \\"little\\" North Western Railway. =History= Halton was the centre of important Anglo-Saxon manor held by Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold before the Norman Conquest. Count Roger of Poitou who held the fee after the regime change, and his successors, preferred Lancaster. The 19th-century textile mills once harnessed the power of the Lune. Earthworks on Castle Hill show evidence of an 11th-century Norman motte and bailey castle. In the churchyard of St Wilfrid's Church stands the Halton Cross believed to have been carved by Norsemen over 1,000 years ago. Halton Castle was situated within the village of Halton. It is likely that a motte and bailey castle was constructed on the site in the late 11th century. However Halton's prominence was lost in the 12th century when favour shifted to Lancaster, and Halton Castle was abandoned. Only earthworks now remain and it is privately owned with no public right of way. Halton Hall was part of the Manor of Halton and stood for several centuries on the banks of the River Lune before being demolished in the 1930s. Industry Forge Bank weir In 1752 a charcoal blast furnace was erected on the Cote Beck, where the M6 motorway crosses Foundry Lane, and by 1755 the Halton Furnace Company ran it with those at Leighton and Caton Forge. The furnaces produced pig iron. The chamber was charged with charcoal, limestone, and ore and a blast of air was blown into the base using water driven bellows. The molten iron (1530 C) ran down the furnace and was intermittently released in to the 'pig bed' of sand. It could produce 20 tons of pig iron a week- working for several weeks at a time. The 3-5% carbon pig iron was then decarburised in forges and purified in a finery forge to remove carbon and silicon in a process that used a trip hammer. In the chafery the metal was reheated and shaped with a trip hammer into an malleable iron bar. There were two forges on the river in Halton- the upper forge had six water-wheels, two fineries and two chaferies, the lower forge had a tilt and lift hammer. Coke furnaces had displaced most charcoal furnaces by 1800, though Halton hung on until 1845 servicing local need. Nothing remains to be seen. There was intensive industrial activity on the river bank in the 18th century with the forges and the construction of two water powered cotton mills: Forse Bank mill (1744) and Low Mill. Little to nothing now remain. Forse Bank mill whose name morphed into Forge Bank Mill was upstream. Water was taken from above the weir and two parallel leets powered all the buildings. The mills have separate origins but eventually merged. Forse bank started spinning flax, in 1821 it was spinning cotton but in 1826 it was flax. Other buildings, including a forge were acquired and converted. After the Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1861, the spinning stopped - but in 1862 it was producing oilcloth, thus weaving. Eventually it was purchased by Williamson, who moved linoleum and oilcloth manufacture to Lancaster. Cotton weaving stopped in 1941. Part of the site has been developed with rural town houses, which are not universally popular. Further development is currently stopped. Railway In 1849, the \\"little\\" North Western Railway built Halton stationButt, p.112 on the other bank of the Lune, primarily to serve the forge. During construction it was linked to Halton village by a ferry. Eight lives were lost when this capsized. In December 1849, the railway company built a toll bridge. It was washed away replaced in 1869 and replaced for the second time in 1913. When the railway closed in 1966, the bridge fell into disrepair, it has been restored and is now free and open to small cars, pedestrians and cycles. The original timber station was destroyed by fire on 3 April 1907. A spark from the engine of a passing Heysham- boat train set fire to a wagon of oil drums by the goods shed. The fire brigade were unable to cross the narrow bridge and it was left to a special trainload of railway workers from Lancaster to pass buckets of water from the river. The station was rebuilt in brick and timber and the building survives to this day, used as storage by Lancaster University Rowing Club, with a public car park occupying the former track bed. The bridge is on National Cycle Network Route 90, and the trackbed on Route 69. Aughton St Saviour's Church, located on Aughton Road to the north of the hamlet. Aughton () was known as 'Actun' in the 1086 Domesday Book, meaning a place where oak trees grow. A riverside hamlet by the River Lune, Aughton consists mainly of stone cottages and St Saviour's Church, which is located on Aughton Road to the north of the hamlet. The church was built in 1864 and designed by architect E. G. Paley. Aughton lies within the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Every 21 years the gigantic Aughton Pudding is baked over a celebratory weekend. The pudding made in 1992 was entered into the Guinness Book of Records as the largest, but the festival itself was run at a loss. The festival in 2013 was a great success. No world record was attempted but the attendance was over 5000 and the profit made divided between good causes, St Saviour's and the Recreation Rooms. This money was later loaned to Broadband 4 Rural North to bring broadband to the village on 14 August 2014.

It was erected in 1861 by engineer James Douglass to replace a previous lighthouse which had been erected in 1776 on the same rock. It is the most remote lighthouse operated by Trinity House. Previous lighthouse A model of the original lighthouse, on view at the Science Museum, London = History = The original Smalls Lighthouse was erected between 1775 and 1776, to the plans of Liverpool musical-instrument maker Henry Whiteside. It stood on nine oak pillars, allowing the sea to pass through beneath. Although it suffered from some rocking, it stood for 80 years. During its life a significant number of extra struts were added beyond the original nine. The pillar-based design has since been used successfully in many maritime structures. When Whiteside visited the lighthouse in 1777, he was stranded for a month by gales which showed no sign of abating so that supplies were almost exhausted. He wrote a message to a friend in St. David's placed in a bottle inside a casket with a note to the finder \\"We doubt not but that whoever takes this up will be so merciful as to cause it to be sent to Thomas Williams, Esq, Trelithin, near St. David's, Wales\\". Two days later it arrived almost outside the door of the addressee to whom it was duly delivered. Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy The old lighthouse brought about a change in lighthouse policy in 1801 after a gruesome episode, sometimes called the Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy. Thomas Howell and Thomas Griffith, the two-person team that managed the lighthouse, were publicly known to quarrel. When Griffith died in a freak accident, Howell feared that if he discarded the body into the sea, authorities might accuse him of murder. As Griffith's body began to decompose, Howell built a makeshift coffin for the corpse and lashed it to an outside shelf. Stiff winds blew the box apart, and the body's arm fell within view of the hut's window. As the winds would blow, gusts would catch the arm and move it in a way that made the appendage appear to beckon. In spite of his former partner's decaying corpse and working the lighthouse alone, Howell was able to keep the house's lamp lit. When Howell was finally relieved of duty, the impact of the situation was so emotionally taxing that his friends did not recognize him. As a result, the governing body changed the lighthouse policy to make lighthouse teams rosters of three people, which continued until the automation of British lighthouses in the 1980s. 1831 disaster In 1831 the tower was assaulted by a wave of such proportions that the floor of the keepers' room was torn up and slammed against the ceiling, injuring all the keepers, one so severely that he died. However the damage was repaired and the lighthouse survived another thirty years before it was replaced. =In media= In 2011 the Smalls Lighthouse Tragedy was the subject of a B.B.C. radio play called The Lighthouse, written by Alan Harris.Retrieved 13 Sept 2011 \\"The Lighthouse\\" at bbc.co.uk The 2016 film The Lighthouse, directed by Chris Crow, is also loosely based on the incident. Francis Lynch composed a chamber opera based on the incident, For Those in Peril, which premiered on 9 February 2018 at St Matthew's Church in Evanston, Illinois. The 2019 film The Lighthouse by Robert Eggers was partly inspired by the tragedy. Current lighthouse The Smalls Lighthouse from several miles away The first stone of the new lighthouse tower was laid on 26 June 1857, Trinity House having bought out the previous leaseholders in 1836. The tower was completed in 1861. In 1978 a helideck was erected above the lantern and in 1987 the lighthouse was automated. It is the first wind- and Solar-powered lighthouse in the U.K. Although it has only a 35-watt bulb, with the aid of lenses, this can be seen up to away. It was the first lighthouse in the country to have a flushing toilet installed. The lighthouse's story was presented in the 2006 BBC Television programme Coast, Series 1, episode \\"Bristol to Cardigan Bay\\". Captain T. H. Sumner Smalls Lighthouse is important in the history of navigation. In 1837 the American Captain Thomas Hubbard Sumner discovered the concept of celestial position lines, the circle of equal altitude, as he was approaching Smalls Lighthouse in thick weather; they form the basis of nearly all modern celestial navigation and were sometimes called Sumner Lines.Bowditch, American Practical Navigator (1958) HO Pub No 9, p55 See also * List of lighthouses in Wales References External links * Trinity House * Includes an analysis of the origins of the name 'The Smalls' Category:Lighthouses completed in 1861 Category:Lighthouses in Pembrokeshire Category:Islands of Pembrokeshire Category:Uninhabited islands of Wales Category:1861 establishments in Wales Category:Grade II listed lighthouses Category:Grade II listed buildings in Pembrokeshire ","title":"Smalls Lighthouse"},{"id":"2180077","text":"Cwmanne Tavern Cwmann is a small village in Wales near Lampeter, just on the Ceredigion border with Carmarthenshire, in the community of Pencarreg.

It is functionally associated with the glossopharyngeal nerve and innervates the parotid gland for salivation. It is one of four parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck. The others are the ciliary ganglion, the submandibular ganglion and the pterygopalatine ganglion. Structure and relations The otic ganglion is a small (2‚Äì3 mm), oval shaped, flattened parasympathetic ganglion of a reddish-grey color, located immediately below the foramen ovale in the infratemporal fossa and on the medial surface of the mandibular nerve. It is in relation, laterally, with the trunk of the mandibular nerve at the point where the motor and sensory roots join; medially, with the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, and the origin of the tensor veli palatini; posteriorly, with the middle meningeal artery. It surrounds the origin of the nerve to the medial pterygoid. Laterally, mandibular nerve Connections The preganglionic parasympathetic fibres originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve. They leave the glossopharyngeal nerve by its tympanic branch and then pass via the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion. Here, the fibers synapse and the postganglionic fibers pass by communicating branches to the auriculotemporal nerve, which conveys them to the parotid gland. They produce vasodilator and secretomotor effects. Its sympathetic root is derived from the plexus on the middle meningeal artery. It contains post-ganglionic fibers arising in the superior cervical ganglion. The fibers pass through the ganglion without relay and reach the parotid gland via the auriculotemporal nerve. They are vasomotor in function. The sensory root comes from the auriculotemporal nerve and is sensory to the parotid gland. The motor fibers supplying the medial pterygoid and the tensor palati and the tensor tympani pass through the ganglion without relay. The ganglion is connected to the chorda tympani nerve and also to the nerve of the pterygoid canal. These pathways provide an alternate pathway of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. These fibers do not pass through the middle ear. Clinical significance Frey's syndrome in which salivation will induce perspiration at the parotid region, accompanied by erythema.

Summary At first it appears to be the autobiography of Harry Hubbard, which is made up of anecdotes of his life and actions with the CIA, covert operations in Uruguay, the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Mafia in the 60's and the assassination of JFK. The very beginning of the book starts with Harry being told by a friend that his mentor Hugh Montague (a top level CIA officer) has either been assassinated or committed suicide on his boat. He then is told by his wife, Kittredge (a CIA member), that she has been unfaithful and is in love with another high level CIA intelligence officer. Under perceived threat of his own assassination by the CIA he escapes to Moscow. It is there that he rereads in a hotel room the dense manuscript of his life at the CIA which he has documented and kept secret over his career. At that point, the book really begins. It details the life of a CIA intelligence officer who has connections to the highest levels of the CIA.

Lebowski Fest has also appeared on the Food Network program \\"Ace of Cakes.\\" The episode named \\"The Big Cakeowski\\" features the Charm City Cakes staff creating and delivering a movie-themed cake to Lebowski Fest in Louisville. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.

It is bordered medially by the medial epicondyle of the humerus, laterally by the olecranon process of the ulna and the tendinous arch joining the humeral and ulnar heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The roof of the cubital tunnel is elastic and formed by a myofascial trilaminar retinaculum (also known as the epicondyloolecranon ligament or Osborne band). Chronic compression of this nerve is known as cubital tunnel syndrome, a form of repetitive strain injury akin to carpal tunnel syndrome (although the role of repetitive stress in causing carpal tunnel syndrome is controversial).

Construction and dimensions An application to build the Lighthouse was made in March 1827 on behalf of traders in Carmarthen Bay. It was commissioned by Trinity House and built by Joseph Nelson at a cost of ¬£4,460. The light was first lit in 1829. The Lighthouse is a squat, round, brick-lined limestone tower of 17.07 m (56 ft), with walls 0.91 m (3 ft) thick at the base and thick at the top. The light stands 64 m (210 ft) above high- water mark. It acts in conjunction with the Lundy North lighthouse to the south, and has a range of . The former oil store for the lighthouse is a listed structure. Lantern and lamp Lantern and optic in 2013 The present lantern was fitted around the middle of the nineteenth century and consisted of 20 Argand lamps and reflectors, subsequently replaced by a helical lantern later in the nineteenth century. The Lighthouse was converted to automatic operations in 1929. It was the last Trinity House lighthouse to be powered by gas, eventually being converted to electricity in 1997. The light was intended to help coastal traffic trading limestone and coal to mid and north Wales but the light also helped long-distance and north American traffic identify the Bristol Channel and avoid confusion with the English Channel. Keeper's cottages The lighthouse keepers' cottages, that flank the Lighthouse, are two-storey, with hipped roofs, octagonal chimneys, and a one-storey linking corridor. This forms a ‚ÄòU‚Äô-shape, with the Lighthouse at the centre of the south side, and enclosed gardens to the north. The cottages were built around 1868-70 by T. C. Harvey, C.E.

Synopsis Mary Giordano (Alicia Silverstone) is a beautiful and intelligent Catholic school-senior in Burlingame, California. She is addicted to mystery novels (graphic and otherwise), film noir and detective magazines (hence the movie's title). All of this has inspired her to become a police officer, like her father who was slain in the line of duty years ago. Mary's ambition to this end amuses her siblings John and Vicky, as well as their widowed mother Celia. Mary gets wind of a case involving the serial killer of several teenage girls, including a handful of her classmates. She launches her own investigation, which gets her in trouble with her late dad's partner, Detective Jerry Guinn (Bill Nunn). Guinn wants Mary as far away from the field as possible...ostensibly because she just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop, but also out of concern for her well-being. Undaunted, Mary enlists the aid of police cadet Tony Campbell (Kevin Dillon) to sniff out the murderer; gradually, the two fall in love. Ultimately, the name \\"Tony Campbell\\" is revealed to be an alias; his real name is Daniel Henry Moffat, and he proves to be the killer both Mary and Guinn are looking for. Moffat outwits and kills Guinn, only to be outwitted and killed himself by Mary. Just weeks after graduation from the 12th grade, she is seen in a police uniform - having succeeded in her aspiration of following in her father‚Äôs footsteps and joining the police department.

Reasons for the discount can range from the closure of a production company to a steep decline in an item's popularity in the aftermath of a fad or scandal. Another reason for the discount can be the particular product line being discontinued. The origin of the term comes from the fact such items would be found in an isolated bin rather than on store shelves. The phrase \\"bargain basement\\" is now a synonym. \\"Bargain basement\\" used to be a literal basement in downtown department stores. Clearance merchandise would be placed there regardless of which section of the store it originally came from. \\"Hutzler's Downstairs\\", an outlet for discounted merchandise opened in the basement of Hutzler's Baltimore department store in September 1929, was an early example of bargain basements.

In the course of his career, South has wrestled for professional wrestling promotions such as Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1984-1985)= South began wrestling in 1984, having his first match on December 26, 1984 in Championship Wrestling from Florida. Teaming with Mike Allen at a CWF TV taping, the rookie lost to the Pretty Young Things (Koko B Ware and Norvell Austin). South next appeared in Mid South Wrestling, teaming with Rocky King to take on Kamala in a two on one match on January 2, 1985 in Shreveport, Louisiana. =National Wrestling Alliance (1985-1989)= South next appeared in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). South made his debut on the April 6, 1985 edition of World Championship Wrestling, the inaugural broadcast of the show after Jim Crockett acquired the TBS time slot. That night a young South teamed with Greg Stone to face Ivan Koloff & Krusher Kruschev (Barry Darsow). A week later he had his first singles match, losing to Magnum TA on the Saturday night program.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp85.htm On June 1, 1985 he received his first ever match (non-title) with then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair. He would become Ric Flair's favorite journeyman to wrestle as Flair considered him a great worker. South was used as enhancement talent but he always got in some offense and was very good at getting heel heat with the fans. He did however gain his first victory September 14, 1985 when he defeated Mack Jeffers in Columbus, Georgia. While still frequently wrestling in for Crockett, South also wrestled in Georgia Championship Wrestling and captured his NWA Georgia Junior Heavyweight Championship in 1986 in between stops for JCP. South also made appearances in NWA affiliate Central States Wrestling in the fall of 1986. In his first match there, he defeated Colt Steel on October 26 in Kansas City, Missouri, followed up by a win two days later against Mark Fleming. After a loss to Steel on November 21, 1986, South ended his run in CSW with another win over him on November 27, 1986 in Kansas City, Kansas. He then returned to Mid Atlantic Wrestling, where he began to frequently team with Gary Royal in the masked jobber tag teams the Cruel Connection, Mexican Twin Devils and the Gladiators. As the Gladiators, South and Royal jobbed for Bill and Randy Mulkey giving the perennial jobber tag team their only televised win on World Championship Wrestling. In the first round of the 1987 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup, South teamed with Steve Keirn and wrestled Mike Graham and Nelson Royal to a draw. Throughout the year he continued to team with Royal - usually as the Gladiators - and gained occasional victories in singles competition. In 1988 they were redubbed The Cruel Connection, and on April 22 entered the 1988 Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup but lost to The Sheepherders in the first round. =World Wrestling Federation (1988-1990)= While still wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions, South made his first World Wrestling Federation appearance on August 2, 1988 at a TV taping for WWF Wrestling Challenge. He wrestled The Honky Tonk Man in a non-title match.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm On the August 24, 1988 taping of Challenge, South wrestled The Blue Blazer, the match being the masked Owen Hart's first televised WWF match. South would have matches with a wide area of WWF performers, including Brutus Beefcake, Jimmy Snuka, The British Bulldogs, Sam Houston, The Rockers, Rhythm & Blues, and The Ultimate Warrior. On August 2, 1989 he was defeated by Al Perez in the latter's debut match.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm His final appearance came on the January 20, 1990 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling where he teamed with Alan Martin to face Demolition.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm =World Championship Wrestling (1989-1995)= During the fall of 1988 Jim Crockett promotions was acquired by Ted Turner and ultimately rebranded World Championship Wrestling; during this time South continued as a regular. On April 1, 1989 South would lose to The Great Muta's WCW debut, and then enter a house show series with him that month. Two months later he became part of wrestling history on Clash of the Champions VII. Teaming with Cougar Jay, he faced off against The Ding Dongs on June 14, 1989 in a match held in a sweltering Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Although new WCW Vice President Jim Herd was expecting a strong reaction for his new tag-team, the crowd turned virulently against them. While each Ding Dong took turns ringing a giant bell at ringside while the other wrestled, the crowd booed and announcer Jim Ross was noticeably embarrassed. South's opponents are now regarded as having one of the worst gimmicks of all time. Gary Royal would depart WCW after 1989, leaving South to soldier on in singles matches wrestling under his own name or as \\"Cruel Connection #1\\". He faced a wave of incoming new talent, including Johnny B. Badd, Van Hammer, and Marcus Bagwell as the new decade progressed. After 1992 his appearances became infrequent. In August 20, 1993 when he teamed with The Italian Stallion to face The Cole Twins at a house show in Bluefield, West Virginia in what would be his only match of the year.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm In 1994 he returned for WCW Saturday Night matches against Alex Wright, Jim Duggan, and Dave Sullivan. In 1995 he would team with various opponents in matches against Stars & Stripes and The Nasty Boys. On May 27, 1995, just over ten years after joining the promotion he would have his last match when he teamed with Mike McKeefer in a WCW Saturday Night match that saw them defeated by The Nasty Boys.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw95.htm =World Wrestling Federation (1993-1994, 1996)= South returned for one match at a television taping on March 7, 1993 and faced Tatanka Fayetteville, North Carolina.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/93.htm However in 1994 he would make numerous appearances, starting on January 17 edition of Monday Night Raw where he was defeated by Tatanka in Richmond, Virginia. On February 5, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars he wrestled Doink the Clown, and in April faced Lex Luger in a losing effort. As the year progressed he would have matches with Sparky Plugg (Bob Holly and The Bushwhackers.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm George South made one more WWF appearance in 1996, wrestling Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts on the June 1st edition of WWF Superstars. http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm =Pro Wrestling Federation (1991-1999)= While still making appearances in WCW, South joined the Pro Wrestling Federation, a new promotion that was promoted by The Italian Stallion, who promoted the company with some help from South. On June 15, 1991 he captured the PWF Junior Heavyweight Championship. He would hold this title for 460 days before finally losing it to Flaming Youth on September 17, 1992. South would become the top heel in the PWF, winning the Junior Heavyweight title on multiple occasions. He also reformed his Cruel Connection team with Gary Royal when his former partner joined the promotion. South feuded with Flaming Youth and The Southern Rocker throughout 1993. On June 18, 1994 he teamed with the Italian Stallion and won the PWF Tag-Team Championship, defeating Austin Steele & Terry Austin. He would go on to win that title several times, but his greatest PWF achievement came on September 14, 1995 when he beat Star Ryder (Ray Hudson) to win the PWF Heavyweight Championship at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina. South would eventually have to vacate the title, and lost a tournament finale to crown a new champion October 21, 1995 to The Italian Stallion. In 1996 he regained the PWF Heavyweight Championship and continued feud with the Stallion, as well as Carolina Dreamer. Stallion and South would trade the championship during 1996 and 1997. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994-1995)= As South continued his reign as a top heel wrestler in the PWF, he also made a foray into Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in 1994. He made his debut on their October 15, 1994 television program, facing Tracy Smothers, then would wrestle Boo Bradley and Bruiser Bedlam later in the year.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/smw94.htm On January 2, 1995 he received a title shot against SMW TV Champion Buddy Landell in a \\"Beat The Champ\\" challenge but was unsuccessful. Later in the year he would face Al Snow, Unabom, and Bobby Blaze before leaving the promotion in April 1995. =Later career (2000-Present)= South in 2011 South is a born-again Christian and says one of his biggest thrills was passing a Christian tract to Hulk Hogan in WCW who told him he needed it. In 1999 three full-color cartoon tracts were produced for South entitled The Greatest Match Ever, Who is Your Tag-Team Partner?, and Who Are You Wrestling Against?, illustrated by comics artist Steven Butler, packaged by The Nate Butler Studio, and published by PowerMark Productions. When the PWF closed in 1999, South opened his own promotion called the Exodus Wrestling Alliance. He still runs shows as of 2005 in the Mid-Atlantic area and participates in Christianity/wrestling shows with Nikita Koloff and Ted DiBiase. One of his gimmicks is the fact that he gets heel heat from the fans by sticking his tongue out at them and taunting them about how he is manhandling their hero in the ring. He is proud of the fact that he does not have to get crude, use profanity, or become vulgar to get heel heat. An important part of South's modern day matches are moves and performances intended to pay tribute to the great wrestling stars of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including Wahoo McDaniel, Blackjack Mulligan, Brute Bernard, Two Ton Harris, Paul Jones, Ricky Steamboat, Tully Blanchard, the Anderson Brothers, and others. South's most significant recent match was against Brad Armstrong in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at the Wrestling Night of Legends II. In 2013, South participated in the Brad Armstrong Memorial Event, in a tag-team match alongside Bob Orton Jr. against Tim Horner and Tom Prichard. During the match, Orton and South didn't get along too well to the point South tried to sucker-punch Orton, Orton would later enter the ring and superplex South, letting Horner pin South while Orton was walking down the ramp. In 2018 he teamed with Zane Dawson at the NCWA's 10th Annual Ivan Koloff Tag Team Tournament and captured the NCWA Tag-Team Championship when his team defeated Chet Sterling and Dave Dawson. Later that year South joined the America's Most Liked Wrestling promotion, and on November 25, 1998 he defeated Caleb Konley to win the AMLW Title. South made several successful title defenses in 2019, including beating Konley in a loser leaves AML match on January 27 and defeating Fallah Bahh. CW Anderson finally ended South's title reign on July 28, 2019 at an event in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. However on December 1, 2019 he regained the title from Anderson and remains AML Champion as of March 2020. Over thirty years after the NWA Jim Crockett Promotion was purchased by Turner Broadcasting, George South made his first appearance back in the National Wrestling Alliance when he wrestled Colby Corino in dark match at NWA Powerrr on December 15, 2019. South trains up and comers at the Rings wrestling training facility in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesdays. His son, George South Jr., is also now a wrestler.

Career Born in New York's Brooklyn in 1966, Williams went to school to become an audio engineer and worked as a janitor at New York's Quad Recording Studios. At the time Robert Clivill√©s and David Cole frequently used this studio. Clivill√©s and Cole heard and liked Williams' baritone timbre and rhythmic flow and they recruited Williams to rap on their 1990 debut album Gonna Make You Sweat. Williams' rapping can be prominently heard on many of the songs on the album, including Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\", as well as other major hits \\"Here We Go (Let's Rock & Roll)\\" and \\"Things That Make You Go Hmmm...\\" (both released as singles in 1991).

It is largely innervated by the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve); and its axons project to the lacrimal glands and nasal mucosa. The flow of blood to the nasal mucosa, in particular the venous plexus of the conchae, is regulated by the pterygopalatine ganglion and heats or cools the air in the nose. It is one of four parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck, the others being the submandibular ganglion, otic ganglion, and ciliary ganglion. Structure The pterygopalatine ganglion (of Meckel), the largest of the parasympathetic ganglia associated with the branches of the maxillary nerve, is deeply placed in the pterygopalatine fossa, close to the sphenopalatine foramen. It is triangular or heart-shaped, of a reddish-gray color, and is situated just below the maxillary nerve as it crosses the fossa. The pterygopalatine ganglion supplies the lacrimal gland, paranasal sinuses, glands of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and pharynx, the gingiva, and the mucous membrane and glands of the hard palate. It communicates anteriorly with the nasopalatine nerve. Roots It receives a sensory, a parasympathetic, and a sympathetic root. =Sensory root= Its sensory root is derived from two sphenopalatine branches of the maxillary nerve; their fibers, for the most part, pass directly into the palatine nerves; a few, however, enter the ganglion, constituting its sensory root. =Parasympathetic root= Its parasympathetic root is derived from the nervus intermedius (a part of the facial nerve) through the greater petrosal nerve. In the pterygopalatine ganglion, the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the greater petrosal branch of the facial nerve synapse with neurons whose postganglionic axons, vasodilator, and secretory fibers are distributed with the deep branches of the trigeminal nerve to the mucous membrane of the nose, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, roof of the mouth, upper lip and gums, and upper part of the pharynx. It also sends postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal nerve (a branch of the Ophthalmic nerve, also part of the trigeminal nerve) via the zygomatic nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (from the trigeminal nerve), which then arrives at the lacrimal gland. The nasal glands are innervated with secretomotor fibers from the nasal branches. Likewise, the palatine glands are innervated by the nasopalatine, greater palatine nerve and lesser palatine nerves. The pharyngeal nerve innervates pharyngeal glands. These are all branches of maxillary nerve. =Sympathetic root= The ganglion also consists of sympathetic efferent (postganglionic) fibers from the superior cervical ganglion. These fibers, from the superior cervical ganglion, travel through the carotid plexus, and then through the deep petrosal nerve. The deep petrosal nerve (carrying postganglionic sympathetics) joins with the greater petrosal nerve (carrying preganglionic parasympathetics) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal, which passes through the pterygoid canal before entering the ganglion. The Stellate Ganglion is at the bottom of the Cervical Sympathetic Chain. Fibers from the Stellate Ganglion (SG) pass up the chain to the Supeior Cervical Sympathetic Ganglion and into / through the Sphenopalatine Ganglion. =Branches= *Orbital branches *Nasopalatine nerve *Greater palatine nerve *Lesser palatine nerve *Medial and Lateral Posterior Superior and Posterior Inferior Nasal Branches *Pharyngeal branch of maxillary nerve Blockade and Neuromodulation of the Pterygopalatine ganglion (Sphenopalatine Ganglion, SPG) Blockade of the ganglion with local anesthetic, clinically referred to as a ‚Äòsphenopalatine ganglion block‚Äô (SPG) may be performed transcutaneously with a small needle, or topically via the nose with local anesthetic soaked swabs. The topical SPG is used for treatment of persistent migraines and cluster headaches, demonstrating relief within 10-20 minutes. Increasingly the SPG is also used to treat post-dural-puncture headache (PDPH), and may be as effective as an epidural blood patch when used for PDPH. Self-Administration of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Blocks with Cotton-Tipped Catheters with continual capillary feed is the most cost-effective method of treatment and has the benefit of allowing patients to avoid visits to physicians and Emergeny Departments. After initial visit Self-Administered SPG Blocks (SASPGB) are less than $1.00 per application. Frequent repeated administration of SPG Blocks seems to increase effectiveness initially, after which decreased frequency is required. Self-Administered SPG Blocks can be used to treat acute pain symptoms, and prophylactically to reduce the onset of painful conditions and anxiety. SASPGB SASPGB are extremely helpful for treatment of Migraines, Chronic Daily Headaches, Anxiety and TMJ Disorders. Sphenopalatine Ganglion Blocks and SASPGB are also effective in about of cases of essential hypertension. The Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block has been called \\"The Miracle Block\\" after publication of Albert Bengamin Gerber's book _Miracles on Park Avenue_ , the story of octogenerian ENT Dr. Milton Reder, whose entire medical practice was based on SPG Blocks. There are multiple new devices utilized for Neuromodulation of the Sphenopalatine Ganglion. There is one non-invasive device, a Myomonitor, an Ultra Low Frequency TENS (ULF-TENS) that has been utilized safely for more than 50 years by neuromuscular dentists in the diagnosis and treatment of TMJ disorders and orofacial pain conditions. Spenopalatine Ganglion Neuromodulation (possible vagal nerve) is a fortunate secondary effect making it extremely effective for TMD.

He is also variously referred to in the literature as Charles Delafontaine and Charles de Lafontaine. was a celebrated French \\"public magnetic demonstrator\\",Gauld (1992), p.163. who also \\"had an interest in animal magnetism as an agent for curing or alleviating illnesses\\".Crabtree (1988), p.145. Family Charles Lafontaine was born in Vend√¥me, Loir-et-Cher, France on 27 March 1803. He was related to the famous fabulist, Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695);Lafontaine (1866, II), p.273. and, belonging to a theatrical family, he was involved with the theatre from an early age. He died in Geneva, Switzerland on 13 August 1892. =Appearance= At 5'9\\" (175 cm) he was neither short nor tall, his dark hair was brushed forward, his countenance \\"rather austere, perhaps thoughtful\\", and his beard was \\"prodigious\\".Animal Magnetism, The Times, (Tuesday, 20 July 1841), p.5. Given the English fashion of the day for a clean-shaven face, Lafontaine‚Äôs beard was a subject of some considerable notoriety when he arrived in England ‚Äî Spencer Timothy Hall's description of Lafontaine at a conversazione in 1841 is typical: Richard Harte, former journalist with the New York Telegram, one- time member of the Theosophical Society Adyar (1877-1893), a former editor and regular contributor (often under the nom de guerre \\"D.C.K.\\") to The Theosophist, and author of The New Psychology, observed that, Animal magnetism He was introduced to mesmerism in Brussels, in 1831, by the Belgian lithographer, inventor, and scholar Jean Baptiste Ambroise Marcelin Jobard (1792-1861), who later become the director of the Royal Museum of Industry at Brussels. He then went on to study the works of Marquis de Puys√©gur (1751-1825) and Joseph-Philippe-Fran√ßois Deleuze (1753-1835) and, abandoning the theatre altogether,Although his brother continued to pursue a theatrical career (Lafontaine, 1866, I, pp.29-34). he began touring parts of Europe. A detailed description of Lafontaine's magnetization technique, translated directly from the text of the fifth (1886) edition of his L'art de magn√©tiser, is presented at Hart (1903), pp.66-69. United Kingdom He decided to come to England in June 1841, and soon began to lecture in London. According to Goldsmith (1934, p.225), Lafontaine \\"attracted considerable attention by mesmerizing a lion in the London Zoo\\".Given the extent to which so many of Lafontaine's accounts of events are difficult to substantiate, it is significant that (a) Goldsmith does not cite a reference for this statement involving Lafontaine and a lion at the Zoo; (b) there is no account of any such event in the newspapers of the time; (c) there is no reference of any sort to any such event in any of the literature (except, of course, those which cite Goldsmith as their source); and, further, on the basis that the Gardens of Zoological Society of London were not open to the public until 1847, it is highly likely that this account has no truth to it. Lafontaine had almost no English at all, and had to use interpreters; also, he traveled with young assistants, one of whom was identified as ‚ÄòEugene‚Äô (or M. Eug√©ne), a French youth approximately 18, and a number of young (English) women who assisted him from time to time. On leaving London, he conducted ‚Äúa lengthy tour of the provinces, visiting Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Ireland and Scotland‚Äù (Gauld, 1992, p.204). Although, from time to time, Lafontaine ‚Äòtreated‚Äô individuals, he was principally what Gauld (1992, p.203) describes as a ‚Äúmagnetic demonstrator‚Äù; and, on most of the occasions in which he had provided ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô, the events were intended to be demonstrations, rather than the expression of the activities of a professional therapist.In relation to Lafontaine's claim to have supplied mesmeric anaesthesia for surgery, on occasion, whilst he was in England, Gauld (1992, p.204) notes that, in January 1842, whilst in Sheffield, Lafontaine (at Lafontaine (1866, I, p.320-321) claims to have provided the mesmeric anaesthesia for surgeon George Calvert Holland (1801-1865), \\"for the painless amputation of a leg\\". However, in relation to constant issue of the veracity of Lafontaine‚Äôs own (otherwise unreported) claims being open to question, it is important to note that the surgeon in question (Holland, 1848) makes no mention whatsoever of such an astonishing event ‚Äî and, moreover, George Sandby (1848, pp.47-54) makes no mention of any such event within his exhaustive list of operations under mesmeric anaesthesia compiled six years later. =James Braid= Manchester surgeon, James Braid's first direct observation of the operation, and associated phenomena, of animal magnetism was at Lafontaine's third Manchester conversazione on 13 November 1841. Braid always maintained that he had gone to Lafontaine's demonstration as an open- minded sceptic ‚Äî eager to examine the evidence and, then, form a considered opinion of Lafontaine's work. He was neither a closed-minded cynic intent on destroying Lafontaine, nor a deluded and na√Øvely credulous believer seeking authorization of his already formed belief.Neurypnology (1843), p.2.For an extended account of the interactions between Braid and Lafontaine, see Yeates (2013), pp.103‚Äì308 passim. Braid was amongst the medical men who were invited onto the platform by Lafontaine. Braid examined the physical condition of Lafontaine's magnetised subjects (especially their eyes and their eyelids) and concluded that they were, indeed, in quite a different physical state. Braid always stressed the significance of his attending Lafontaine‚Äôs conversazione in the development of the theories, techniques, and practices of hypnotism. In Neurypnology (1843, pp.34-35) he states that he had earlier been totally convinced by a four-part investigation of Animal Magnetism published in The London Medical Gazette (i.e., Anon, 1838) that there was no evidence of any magnetic agency at all. The concluding paragraph of the final article read: ::This, then, [in conclusion,] is our case. Every credible effect of magnetism has occurred, and every incredible is said to have occurred, in cases where no magnetic influence has been exerted, but in all which, excited imagination, irritation, or some powerful mental impression, has operated: where the mind has been alone acted on, magnetic effects have been produced without magnetic manipulations: where magnetic manipulations have been employed, unknown, and therefore without the assistance of the mind, no result has ever been produced. Why, then, imagine a new agent, which cannot act by itself, and which has never yet even seemed to produce a new phenomenon?Anon, The London Medical Gazette, Vol.20, No.538, (24 March 1838), p.1037. And, as well as the strong impression made upon Braid by the Medical Gazette's article, there was also the more recent impressions made by Thomas Wakley‚Äôs exposure of the comprehensive fraud of John Elliotson‚Äôs subjects, the Okey sisters,See Clarke, 1874. ::[all of which] determined me to consider the whole as a system of collusion or illusion, or of excited imagination, sympathy, or imitation. I therefore abandoned the subject as unworthy of farther investigation, until I attended the conversazioni of Lafontaine, where I saw one fact, the inability of a patient to open his eyelids, which arrested my attention; I felt convinced it was not to be attributed to any of the causes referred to, and I therefore instituted experiments to determine the question; and exhibited the results to the public in a few days after. ‚Äî (Braid, Neurypnology (1843), p.35; emphasis added). Braid attended two more of Lafontaine's conversazione (his fourth and fifth). By the fifth (on Saturday 20 November 1841), Braid was convinced of the veracity of some of Lafontaine's effects and phenomena; and, in particular, whilst Braid was convinced that a transformation from, so to speak, condition1 to condition2, and back to condition1 had really taken place, he was convinced that no magnetic agency of any sort (as Lafontaine claimed) was responsible for these veridical events. He also rejected outright the assertion that the transformation in question had \\"proceeded from, or [had been] excited into action by another [person]\\" (Neurypnology, p.32). On returning home on the evening of Saturday 20 November 1841, Braid performed his experimentum crucis; and, operating on the principle of Occam's Razor (that 'entities ought not to be multiplied beyond necessity'), and recognizing that he could diminish, rather than multiply entities, Braid made an extraordinary decision to perform a role-reversal and treat the operator- subject interaction as subject-internal, operator-guided procedure; rather than, as Lafontaine supposed, an operator-centred, subject-external procedure. Braid emphatically proved his point by his self-experimentation with his \\"upwards and inwards squint\\". In other words, rather than it being due, as Lafontaine supposed, to the charismatic influence of the operator's downward gaze, compounding the transfer of magnetic fluid that was supposedly being transferred, via the operator, through the subject's thumbs which were being tightly held by the operator, it was a simple biophysiological reflex produced by the subject's upward gaze. And, further, Braid's use of 'self-' or 'auto- hypnotism' (rather than 'hetero-hypnotism'), entirely by himself, on himself, and within his own home, clearly demonstrated that it had nothing whatsoever to do with the 'gaze', 'charisma', or 'magnetism' of the operator ‚Äî all it needed was a subject's 'fixity of vision' on an 'object of concentration' at such a height and such a distance from the bridge of their nose that the desired 'upwards and inwards squint' was achieved. And, at the same time, by using himself as a subject, Braid also conclusively proved that none of Lafontaine's phenomena were due to magnetic agency. Braid conducted a number of experiments with self-hypnotization upon himself, and, by now convinced that he had discovered the natural psycho-physiological mechanism underlying these quite genuine effects, he performed his first act of hetero- hypnotization at his own residence, before several witnesses, including Captain Thomas Brown (1785‚Äì1862) on Monday 22 November 1841 ‚Äì his first hypnotic subject was Mr. J. A. Walker. (see Neurypnology, pp.16‚Äì20.) The following Saturday (27 November 1841), Braid delivered his first public lecture at the Manchester Athen√¶um, in which, among other things, he was able to demonstrate that he could replicate the effects produced by Lafontaine, without the need for any sort of physical contact between the operator and the subject. = M‚ÄòNeile's \\"Satanic Agency and Mesmerism\\" sermon = On the evening of Sunday, 10 April 1842, the controversial Liverpool cleric Hugh M‚ÄòNeile preached against \\"Mesmerism\\" for more than ninety minutes to a capacity congregation.His text was 2 Thessalonians ii. 9,10: \\"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.\\"See Yeates (2013), pp.273-308. He began, speaking of \\"latter days\\" ‚Äî following which, Christ would return to Earth, and peace would reign for 1,000 years ‚Äî and how, as the second advent neared, \\"satanic agency amongst men\\" would become ever more obvious; and, then, moving into a confusing admixture of philippic (against both Lafontaine and Braid, as, among other things, \\"necromancers\\"), and polemic (against animal magnetism), where he concluded that all mesmeric phenomena were due to \\"satanic agency\\". The sermon was reported on at some length in the Liverpool Standard, two days later;\\"The Rev. Hugh M‚ÄòNeile on Mesmerism\\", The Liverpool Standard, No.970, (Tuesday, 12 April 1842), p.3, col.G: the corrected text of the article is at Yeates (2013), pp.591-598. with all other newspaper reports being derived from the Liverpool Standard reporter's account. M‚ÄòNeile allowed the entire text of his original sermon, as transcribed by a stenographer (more than 7,500 words), to be published on Wednesday, 4 May 1842.M‚ÄòNeile (1842); for a corrected and annotated text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.621-670. M‚ÄòNeile's publication forced Braid to publish his own response as a pamphlet; which he did on Saturday, 4 June 1842.Braid (1842); the corrected and annotated text of the publication is at Yeates (2013), pp.671-700. There is no contemporary record of any response by Lafontaine, either in print, or verbally in his lectures.However, in his \\"memoirs\\", Lafontaine speaks briefly of the sermon (1847, p.354; 1866, I, p.341-343); of it causing \\"a great stir\\" in Liverpool (1866, I, p.342), M‚ÄòNeile's accusation of Lafontaine being \\"an agent of Satan, if not the devil himself\\" (1866, I, p.342), and magnetism being \\"the devil‚Äôs work\\" (1847, p.354). In 1866, a long way from 1842 Liverpool, Lafontaine presented a story ‚Äî which it is not reported in any of the contemporary newspaper accountsFor example, an extended account of Lafontaine's 12 April 1842 conversazione, delivered to a small audience, clearly reports that, although Lafontaine's interpreter, Liverpool surgeon John Nottingham (1811-1895), F.R.C.S., M.R.C.P., made a single, brief, inconsequential remark on M‚ÄòNeile's sermon (to the effect that M‚ÄòNeile's sermon had \\"induced\\" him to \\"examine\\" mesmerism) in response to a question from an audience member, he was not translating anything Lafontaine had said; and, moreover, there is no record of Lafontaine saying anything at all in relation to M‚ÄòNeile at that conversazione (and given that M‚ÄòNeile sermon was very much a topic du jour, any comment by Lafontaine would most certainly have been reported). ‚Äî in which he claimed that, \\"to Mac Neil‚Äôs great mortification\\", (a) the Liverpool public (in particular women) flocked in droves to his 12 April lecture; (b) that (his interpreter) Nottingham was extremely caustic in his ridicule of the credulity, superstition and ignorance displayed by M‚ÄòNeile; and (c) \\"to the audience‚Äôs delight\\", Nottingham had loudly demanded M‚ÄòNeile‚Äôs presence, along with official church documents attesting that Lafontaine‚Äôs magnetic practices were damnable (1866, I, p.342). In another of Lafontaine's (unsubstantiated from any other source) accounts in his \\"memoirs\\", he claims that, at some unspecified time several years later, he was dining in Paris with \\"baronet sir Richard Dennis\\" [sic], who introduced him to M‚ÄòNeile. M‚ÄòNeile, who was, initially, \\"outraged by [Lafontaine‚Äôs] presence\\", allegedly calmed down a little when \\"Dennis\\" explained that Lafontaine was \\"the rescuer of the baronet‚Äôs two nieces\\". Lafontaine conducted several experiments on a somnambulist (whom he had 'conveniently' brought along with him); and the success of his experiments, according to Lafontaine, \\"removed the blindfold from poor Mr. Mac Neil\\", and, at last, allowed him to see the truth of animal magnetism.It seems that this is, yet, another of Lafontaine's fanciful anecdotes. There is no independent verifiable evidence of (a) Lafontaine ever meeting M‚ÄòNeile (in France or otherwise); (b) the time/location of this supposed dinner; (c) the existence of ‚Äúbaronet sir Richard Dennis‚Äù; and, as a consequence, (e) \\"the baronet's two nieces\\"; and, also, (c) Lafontaine as \\"rescuer\\" (of anyone, let alone the \\"baronet's\\" two nieces). =Financial disaster= Overall, Lafontaine's tour of the United Kingdom was a financial disaster; and, perhaps, largely due to the impact of M‚ÄòNeile's sermon, Lafontaine‚Äôs subsequent lecture tour of the north was a complete financial failure, and just before he returned to France, and he was forced to send a letter to a supporter in Leeds, subsequently published in the Leeds Mercury of 17 September 1842, requesting funds.Anon, 1842. Writing in 1843, John Elliotson observed that it seemed clear that Lafontaine came to England for \\"pecuniary\\" reasons, and left because he eventually \\"found the affair unsuccessful\\". Despite Elliotson's view that Lafontaine was \\"a less educated man\\" than Jules du Potet de Sennevoy (who had visited England four years earlier), he felt that Lafontaine‚Äôs visit had done \\"great good\\", and \\"more ostensible good\\" than had that of du Potet de Sennevoy \\"because [Lafontaine] came at a period when the conviction of the truth [of mesmerism] had become much more diffused, and persons were more disposed to attend to the subject\\".S.I.L.E., 1843, p.93. France and Europe He returned to France in late 1842, and subsequently travelled widely around Europe and the Mediterranean. =Naples= According to his own account, Lafontaine visited Naples in 1849 and ‚Äî having restored sight and hearing to some ‚Äî was accused of blasphemously replicating the miracles of Christ. This placed him in controversial circumstances, and he was fortunate that the French Consul intervened on his behalf at the King‚Äôs Ministerial Council; and, according to Lafontaine, due to the Consul‚Äôs representations, King Ferdinand II (1810-1859) eventually made a royal decree: \\"I consent to M. Lafontaine remaining in Naples, on the condition that will he not restore sight to the blind, or hearing to the deaf\\".\\"Je consens √† ce que M. Lafontaine reste √† Naples, √† condition qu'il ne fera pas voir des aveugles, ni entendre des sourds-muets\\" (Lafontaine, 1866, II, p.272). =Pope Pius IX= Soon after leaving Naples, he was granted an audience with Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti (1792-1878), or Pope Pius IX, in Rome on 14 November 1849. At the beginning of their discussion, having agreed that such things as ‚Äòelectricity‚Äô and ‚Äòmagnetism‚Äô were natural, and having read King Ferdinand‚Äôs decree, the Pope raised the issue of the possible dangers of ‚Äòanimal magnetism‚Äô. After some discussion with Lafontaine (in which Lafontaine claimed to have cured many ‚Äòincurable‚Äô diseases, including paralysis, epilepsy, and restored the faculties to the permanently deaf, mute, and blind) and some extensive demonstrations involving both the physical methods of intervention and the consequent manifestations (Lafontaine remarks that the time spent was far longer the usual four to five minutes allocated to such audiences) the Pope is said to have remarked: \\"Well! Mr. Lafontaine, let us wish and hope that, for the good of humanity, animal- magnetism may soon be generally employed\\".\\"Eh bien! Monsieur Lafontaine, souhaitons et esp√©rons que, pour le bien de l'humanit√©, le magn√©tisme pourra bient√¥t √™tre g√©n√©ralement employ√©.\\" (Lafontaine, 1866, II, p.346). =Switzerland= He returned to France in January 1850; and, soon after, moved to Switzerland, where he remained until his death. =Le Magn√©tiseur= He published the journal Le Magn√©tiseur: Journal du Magn√©tisme Animal in Geneva from 1859 to 1872. =Louis Lad√© and Fran√ßois-Auguste Lad√©= In April 1868, an 18 years old, Am√©lie Patonier, died as a consequence of incompetent treatment that had been delivered by the Swiss physician Fran√ßois-Auguste Lad√© (1841-1866). A lethal over-dose of morphine had been administered to the young woman within a mixture that had been prepared by Louis Lad√©, a trained pharmacist, and father of the physician in question. The girl‚Äôs death was investigated in a very unsatisfactory fashion and, despite much evidence pointing to the incompetence and malpractice of both Lad√©s, neither was put on trial. The girl‚Äôs father, Jean-Pierre Patonier, published a pamphlet, giving precise details of the evidence that had been provided to the coroner, denouncing the failure of the justice system. Lafontaine reprinted the text of Patonier's pamphlet, with some additional supportive editorial commentary in the September 1868 edition of Le Magn√©tiseur, under the title \\"Un Scandale medical\\";Lafontaine (1868), pp.165-172. Lafontaine was sued for slander; he lost the case, and made a reparation/damages payment of 2,000 francs. Death Lafontaine died in Geneva, Switzerland on 13 August 1892, a comparatively wealthy man.

Apotheosis of Aeneas Born near Lodi, he studied at the University of Pavia, and went on to write some fifty works of both prose and poetry. His greatest reputation came as the writer of brief epics, the most famous of which was his continuation of Virgil's Aeneid, known variously as the Supplementum (Supplement) or Aeneidos Liber XIII (Book 13 of the Aeneid). Completed in 1428, this 600-line poem starts immediately after the end of Virgil's epic, and describes Aeneas's marriage to Lavinia and his eventual deification. It is elegantly written, and its combination of classical learning and piety made it very popular in its day; it was often included in editions of the Aeneid in the fifteenth and sixteenth-centuries. An electronic text can be found at the Latin Library. Vegio also wrote an epic Astyanax (1430), on the death of the son of Hector, prince of Troy, and a four-book epic Vellus Aureum (the Golden Fleece) (1431).

Before that, he was at Georgia State. Bechtel earned his PhD from the University of Chicago and his BA from Kenyon College. Bechtel's work in philosophy has focused on the philosophy of the life sciences. In particular, he has worked on cell biology, biochemistry, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Bechtel advocates a mechanistic approach to philosophy of science, taking the view that phenomena are often explained by specifying mechanisms. He argues that although this is more naturally in accordance with the actual methodology of life scientists, it contrasts with the traditional model of deduction from laws supported by mainstream philosophy of science. Bechtel has also written about the nature of scientific discovery. He is the editor of the journal Philosophical Psychology.

Biography Magan was born on 15 December 1910. He was a son of farmer James Magan and his wife Elizabeth Foley, of Kilmore, Dunshaughlin, County Meath.Census of Ireland, 1911. Magan was interned in the Curragh during the Irish Emergency (during the Second World War). In March 1946, he was arrested along with a number of other IRA men in the Ardee Bar, Dublin. Jailed, he was released in December 1946 along with Micksie Conway. Both men resumed their attempts to reorganise the IRA. A lifelong bachelor and County Meath farmer, Magan sold his farm and devoted all his time and money to the IRA. He was appointed IRA chief of staff by the IRA Army Executive at its convention in September 1948. The IRA had almost been destroyed in the 1940s and Magan immediately set out to reorganise the political and military wings of the Republican Movement, namely the IRA and Sinn F√©in, along with Michael Traynor, Paddy McLogan, and Tom√°s Mac Curtain. Magan was not a popular choice for the position and several members of his previous IRA Army Council were not impressed by him but did not oppose his nomination outright. Magan drew support chiefly from Dublin delegates, who felt that \\"the Army needed a steel core and that Magan could supply it\\". Magan was a determined physical force traditionalist. According to J. Bowyer Bell, he \\"wanted to create a new Army, untarnished by the dissent and scandals of the previous decade\\", with \\"no shadow of a gangster gunman, no taint of communism, but a band of volunteers solely dedicated to reuniting Ireland by physical force\\". Tim Pat Coogan describes him as \\"priest-like - who had given all his money, time and thought to the IRA, a deeply religious man of the old- guard school of Irish Catholicism [and] when he was again interned in the Curragh during the 1950s Border Campaign he organised a flourishing branch of the Legion of Mary\\". At the 1950 Sinn F√©in Ardfheis, Magan was elected honorary joint secretary of the party. Coogan recounts that Magan's Sinn F√©in submitted key political and economic policies for review by friendly clergy, \\"to ensure that they contained nothing contrary to Catholic teaching\\". In May 1951, the IRA leadership established a Military Council to draft an overall plan for the Republican Movement as a whole. Its members were Magan (as Chief of Staff), Tom√°s Mac Curt√°in (as chairman of the Army Council), P√°draig Mac L√≥g√°in (as president of Sinn F√©in and chairman of the IRA Army Executive), a former British army officer with World War II experience service who was an expert on guerrilla warfare, and one other person. In 1953, Magan played a role in organising and carrying out the Felstead arms raid. Unlike Se√°n Mac Stiof√°in, Cathal Goulding, and Manus Canning, later jailed for the raid, Magan evaded arrest and managed to return safely to Ireland. Magan was chief of staff at the commencement of the IRA's Border Campaign, codenamed Operation Harvest, which began on 11 December 1956. He resigned from the Republican Movement in 1962 in a dispute over the relationship between the IRA and Sinn F√©in.Bowyer Bell, pp. 338‚Äì339 Magan, who lived at 45 Lower Dodder Road in Rathfarnham, Dublin, subsequently worked as a taxi driver. He died on 4 July 1981 at Meath Hospital.Irish Independent, 6 July 1981. On 8 July 1981 he was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.Irish Press, 9 July 1981. A lifelong bachelor, he was survived by his sisters, nieces and nephews. References Sources \\"Bodenstown: IRA GHQ reorganised\\", Saoirse, June 1997.

Frederick Powell (15 August 1928 - 20 April 2013), credited as Nosher Powell, Freddie Powell, or Fred Powell, was an English actor, stuntman, and boxer. Life and career Powell was born in Camberwell, London, England. His younger brother, Dinny Powell (Dennis Powell, born 1932 in Camberwell) followed a similar career, acting and stunt co-ordinating many films, as have his sons Greg Powell and Gary Powell.\\"The family who do stunts for James Bond\\", The Times, 24 May 2009 Powell had an extensive but mostly uncredited career in stunt work and acting, including as stuntman in 14 James Bond films. Amongst his TV work, was the role of the powerful thug Lord Dorking in Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), in 1969. On 26 April 1972 he was guest of honour in an episode in the UK version of This Is Your Life. Apart from his acting career, Powell was a heavyweight boxing champion in the worlds of unlicensed fighting and the professional arena. He also worked as a sparring partner for Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson and Muhammad Ali, amongst others. The last fight of his career was against Menzies Johnson in 1960. Powell won the fight on points, over eight rounds. According to his autobiography, Powell had a total of seventy-eight fights: fifty-one as a professional, with nine losses, though he was never knocked out. Boxrec.com, though, lists Powell as losing sixteen times as a professional, with nine of those losses being by KO, two by TKO and five on points. He also acted as a \\"minder\\" for a number of celebrities, including John Paul Getty Jr. and Sammy Davis, Jr. Death Powell died in his sleep on 20 April 2013. The news was reported via the official Nosher Powell website and actress Fran√ßoise Pascal on Facebook.

Dispersion Shifted Fiber is a type of single-mode optical fiber with a core-clad index profile tailored to shift the zero-dispersion wavelength from the natural 1300 nm in silica-glass fibers to the minimum-loss window at 1550 nm. The group velocity or intramodal dispersion which dominates in single-mode fibers includes both material and waveguide dispersion. Waveguide dispersion can be made more negative by changing the index profile and thus be used to offset the fixed material dispersion, shifting or flattening the overall intramodal dispersion. This is advantageous because it allows a communication system to possess both low dispersion and low attenuation. However, when used in wavelength division multiplexing systems, dispersion-shifted fibers can suffer from four-wave mixing which causes intermodulation of the independent signals. As a result, nonzero dispersion shifted fiber is often used. Dispersion-shifted fiber is specified in ITU-T G.653. References *L.G. Cohen, C. Lin, and W. G.

It is in Yau Tsim Mong District. It was built by the Urban Council and inaugurated on 27 April 1983. The opening of the stadium coincided with the 100th anniversary of the Urban Council. The coliseum has 12,500 seats, which is the second largest among indoor facilities in Hong Kong, only behind the 2005-opened AsiaWorld‚ÄìArena. It is now managed by the Leisure and Cultural Service Department of the Hong Kong Government. Facilities The Hong Kong Coliseum consists of a big arena and a number of conference rooms. =Arena= Hong Kong Coliseum, the inverted pyramid-like construction, right behind the MTR Hung Hom station. The arena is rectangular with sides 41m each, with a concrete cement flooring. During performances, the floor may be covered with different overmounted floorings, such as demountable wooden flooring or various rubberized roll-outs, to facilitate the set-up of sporting equipment and the playing of different sporting activities such as futsal, badminton, basketball, volleyball and ice-skating. Moreover, the floor can hold strong pressures up to 1,800 kg/m2, which cannot even be done by industrial buildings. This facilitates the set up of stages, platforms and sound equipments during concerts and other concert-like performances that requires an elevated stage and good PA systems. Different technical equipments and a 4-side colour television projection system are also present to project the performer's image onto a screen, so that audience sitting around the rear side of the stadium can also see clearly. =Conference Rooms= The Hong Kong Coliseum offers both open and sheltered areas for holding conventions and conferences. The demountable open stage provides the arena with an excellent forum for public assemblies as well as staging live television broadcasts of opening ceremonies. =Reception Room= The reception room acts as an assistant facility for hirers of the arena and the conference rooms to accommodate visiting VIPs. The room can hold 60 persons. Events Even though its formal name in Chinese roughly translates to \\"Sports Arena\\", the venue often serves as a concert venue for popular singers. In addition, some universities rent it every year for congregation. Some performances like ice- skating also choose Hong Kong Coliseum as their stages. It was also used every year from 1991 to 2010 to hold the Miss Hong Kong Pageant, except for 2008. It also hosts a part of the FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League (before: FIVB World Grand Prix) for volleyball every year. On 3 June 2001, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Where Dreams Come True Tour supporting their album Coast to Coast. =Venue for 2009 East Asian Games= The Hong Kong Coliseum was one of the venues for the 5th East Asian Games that was hosted in Hong Kong in 2009.

The team was made up of brothers James and Mack Jefferson, known under the ring names Mack and Jim Jeffers and later on as Spike and Basher respectively. The duo's ring characters was that of two motorcycle police officers. Team history Mack and James Jefferson began wrestling in 1984 under the ring names Mack Jeffers and Jim Jeffers working as a regular team from more or less the beginning, billed as \\"The Jeffers\\". In 1986 the team decided to change their image, adopting the monikers Spike and Basher, the Mod Squad, a pair of motorcycle police officers, completed with uniforms and motorcycle helmets that the team used to help them win matches, pushing the perception that they were bad guys. The MOD Squad had their first taste of success in the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they were managed by J.D. Costello. On March 24, 1986 the team defeated The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship. The CWA bookers decided to move the tag team championship onto the team of Giant Hillbilly and Jerry Lawler 91 days later on June 23. By the end of the year the MOD Squad had moved on to another territory, working around Kansas City for the Central States Wrestling promotion. On January 1 Spike and Basher became the NWA Central States Tag Team Champions by defeating Dave Peterson and Todd Champion. Their run on top of the tag team division was ended 56 days later as the team of Bart Batten and Ric McCord defeated them. The following month the MOD Squad defeated The Southern Boys (Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers) to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. In April, 1987 the MOD Squad were invited to participate in the second annual Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament, defeating the veteran team of Wahoo McDaniel and Baron von Raschke in the first round, but were defeated by Four Horsemen representatives Lex Luger and Tully Blanchard in the second round. The following week they lost the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship to The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn) on a show in Florida. The MOD Squad challenged the Fabulous Ones for the Florida Tag Team Championship as part of the Eddie Graham Memorial Show on May 9, 1987 but lost. The brothers competed on two of the National Wrestling Alliance The Great American Bash shows in the summer of 1987, first on July 4, 1987 in Atlanta, Georgia Spike and Basher competed in singles matches losing to LazorTron and Jimmy Valiant on undercard matches. 2 weeks later at the July 18 Great American Bash show they were unsuccessful in their challenge for the NWA World Tag Team Championship as they lost to the Rock and Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson. Their last high-profile match took place on February 6, 1990 as part of World Championship Wrestling's Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout show where they lost to the team of Flyin' Brian and The Z-Man in the second match of the night.

It is native to East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East). It is commonly known as balloon flower (referring to the balloon-shaped flower buds), Chinese bellflower, or platycodon.  Description  Growing to tall by wide, it is an herbaceous perennial with dark green leaves and blue flowers in late summer. A notable feature of the plant is the flower bud, which swells like a balloon before fully opening.http://platycodon.net/ The five petals are fused together into a bell shape at the base, like its relatives, the campanulas. Platycodon nudiflorus0.jpgswelling balloon-shaped buds Afbeelding-074-Platycodon grandiflorus.tifPlatycodon grandiflorus by Abraham Jacobus Wendel, 1868 Ecology Platycodon grandiflorus is a perennial plant which is commonly grown in mountains and fields. It is 40 to 100 centimeters high and has thick roots, and white juice comes out when the stem is cut. Leaves are 5 to 12 centimeters long, with narrow ends and teeth on the edges. Flowers bloom purple or white in July and August, with one or several running upward at the end of the circle. The flower crown is divided into five branches in the shape of an open bell. It lives throughout Japan, China, and eastern Siberia, including the Korean Peninsula. Cultivation Pink flowered form This plant is hardy down to , and can therefore be cultivated in all temperate zones. It dies down completely in winter, reappearing in late spring and flowering in summer. However, plants are widely available from nurseries in full flower from April onwards. Though the species has blue flowers, there are varieties with white, pink, and purple blooms. In Korea, white flowers are more common. This plant, together with its cultivars 'Apoyama group' and 'Mariesii', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.  Uses  = Culinary =  Korea  In Korea, the plant as well as its root are referred to as (). The root, fresh or dried, is one of the most common vegetables. It is also one of the most frequent ingredients in bibimbap. Sometimes, rice is cooked with balloon flower root to make . Preparation of the root always involves soaking and washing (usually rubbing it with coarse sea salt and rinsing it multiple times), which gets rid of the bitter taste. The root is also used to make desserts, such as . Syrup made from the root, called (balloon flower root honey), can be used to make (balloon flower root tea). The root can be used to infuse liquor called , typically using distilled soju or other unflavored hard alcohol that has an ABV higher than 30% as a base. In addition, other ingredients include calcium, fiber, iron, minerals, proteins and vitamins. Bottlenose is a good product for its thick roots, faithful interior, and strong taste. It is used as an anti-inflammatory, Jinhae, analgesic, sedative, and fever agent. It is also effective in reducing cholesterol, which can be effective in blood related diseases and high blood pressure. Doraji is good for young children and elderly people who have weak immune systems that are vulnerable to respiratory diseases, as well as for asthma, which can be called respiratory illness.

A behavior chain is a sequence of behaviors that happen in a particular order where the outcome of the previous step in the chain serves as a signal to begin the next step in the chain. In terms of behavior analysis, a behavior chain is begun with a discriminative stimulus (SD) which sets the occasion for a behavior, the outcome of that behavior serves as a reinforcer for completing the previous step and as another SD to complete the next step. This sequence repeats itself until the last step in the chain is completed and a terminal reinforcer (the outcome of a behavior chain, i.e. with brushing your teeth the terminal reinforcer is having clean teeth) is achieved. For example, the chain in brushing your teeth starts with seeing the toothbrush, this sets the occasion to get toothpaste, which then leads to putting it on your brush, brushing the sides and front of mouth, spitting out the toothpaste, rinsing your mouth, and finally putting away your toothbrush. To outline behavior chains, as done in the example, we use a task analysis. Chaining is used to teach complex behaviors made of behavior chains that the current learner does not have in their repertoire. Various steps of the chain can be in the learner‚Äôs repertoire, but the steps the learner doesn‚Äôt know how to do have to be in the category of can‚Äôt do instead of won‚Äôt do (issue with knowing the skill not an issue of compliance). There are three different types of chaining which can be used and they are forward chaining, backward chaining, and total task chaining (not to be confused with a task analysis).  Task Analysis  In order to implement a behavior chain procedure, first you must recognize all the steps in the chain you wish to teach. To do so, you conduct a task analysis which can be done in one of three ways. The first way is for you to ask someone who is an expert on the task what all the steps involved are. The second is to watch someone do the chain who is competent enough to complete it and list all the steps you see. The last, and most common way it is done, is to complete the behavior chain yourself and outline the steps that you did. Task analysis can be as detailed as necessary depending on the ability of the learner. For example, a task analysis of hanging up a shirt for a typically developing 10-year-old may be to first grab a hanger, grab a shirt, put the hanger in the hole for the head, then hang it in the closet. For an atypically developing 10-year-old, it may be get a hanger, grab a shirt, hold the hanger by the hook, put one side of the hanger in the head hole, put the other side of the hanger in the head hole, then hang up the shirt in the closet. Typically, the task analysis will have three parts outlined for each step, the SD associated, the behavior, and the outcome which serves as the reinforcer for the previous step and SD for the next step. Using the hanging up a shirt example again, the SD for putting the hanger in the head hole is holding a shirt and a hanger, the behavior is putting the hanger in the hole, and the reinforcer/SD for the next step is holding the hanger with the shirt held on it.  Types of chaining  As mentioned earlier, there are three different chaining procedures: forward chaining, backward chaining, and total task chaining. Although the research has not concluded which procedure is best, the procedure that you use will be determined by the skillset of the learner as well as the what works best for the learner. The whole point of using chaining is to teach a complex behavior by breaking it into multiple, easier steps that when done in order create the complex behavior. For example, washing hands is a complex behavior that can be broken down into 7 easy steps: turn on water, get hands wet, get soap, scrub hands, rinse hands, turn off water, dry hands. = Forward chaining = Forward chaining is a procedure where the learner completes the first step in the chain and then is prompted through the remaining steps in the chain. Once the learner is consistently completing the first step, you have them complete the first and second step then prompt the remaining steps and so on until the learner is able to complete the entire chain independently. Reinforcement is delivered for completion of the step, although they do not attain the terminal reinforcer (outcome of the behavior chain) until they are prompted through the remaining steps. = Backward chaining = Backward chaining is just like forward chaining but starting with the last step. The tutor will prompt the learner through all the steps in the chain except the last one. The learner will complete the last step in the behavior chain independently and once they are doing so consistently, you can begin to have them do the second to last step and the last step and so on until they complete all the steps in the chain independently. The biggest benefit of using a backwards chain is that the learner receives the terminal reinforcer (the outcome of the behavior chain) naturally. Backward chaining is the preferred method when teaching skills to individuals with severe delays because they complete the last step and see the direct outcome of the chain immediately rather than having to be prompted through the remaining steps to receive that reinforcement. = Total task chaining = Total task chaining is a procedure where you allow the learner to try to independently complete each step in the chain and if they don‚Äôt complete the step correctly, then the tutor will prompt the learner through that step then, again, allow them to independently complete the next step. Total task chaining can be used for individuals who know how to complete all the steps in a chain but don‚Äôt know how to do them in the correct order. Typically, it is used with individuals who do not have severe impairments and when the chain is not very long.  Error correction  When an error occurs at any point in the behavior chain, there is a procedure which should typically be followed. Of course, this is a case by case situation, but typically at the point of error, you will want to take one step back and complete the step before the error occurred and then prompt the following step that the error happened at. Ideally, you would then be able to go back to the step before the error occurred and have them do that step and the following step independently. For example, if with washing hands the learner makes an error when rubbing their hands, you will have them get soap again and then prompt them to scrub their hands. After, again depending on the client and person who is in charge of the program, you will want to have them get soap again and see if they independently scrub their hands. The reason you go one step back instead of just prompting the step that was wrong is because you want to create the associations with that previous step and performing the next step correctly. You want the learner to know that, for example with washing hands and getting the scrubbing step wrong, seeing the soap in their hands means that they need to scrub their hands together. If you just prompt them to scrub their hands without them getting the soap first, then you may run into the issue of them not knowing that they need to scrub with soap. Additionally, you run the risk of adding incorrect steps into your chain if you prompt without completing the previous step. Using the same example, if the learner gets soap then rinses it off and you regularly prompt them to rub their hands together without getting soap, they may add the step of rinsing the soap off their hands before scrubbing to the chain.

It is probably the oldest surviving multi-level fully cast-iron framed building in the world, being three years earlier than the Menier Chocolate Factory in Noisiel, France, which are both amongst the few ever built. Named after its original owner, John Watson, the cast and wrought iron structure of the building was prefabricated in England, and it was constructed between 1867‚Äì69. The hotel was leased on 26 August 1867 for the terms of 999 years at yearly rent of Rupees 92 and 12 annas to Abdul Haq. It was closed in the 1960s and was later subdivided and partitioned into smaller cubicles that were let out on rent as homes and offices. Neglect of the building has resulted in decay and, despite its listing as a Grade II‚ÄìA heritage structure, the building is now in a dilapidated state. A documentary film about the building was made in 2019 called The Watson's Hotel. Design Watson's Hotel was designed by the civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who had worked on the Crystal Palace in London in 1850, and went on to design a number of cast and wrought-iron structures such as bridges and market halls, notably the Albert Bridge in London the St Pancras Station station roof (co- designer). The building's cast iron and wrought-iron components were prefabricated by the Phoenix Foundry Company in Derby, England, and assembled on site. The iron frame is composed of relatively large-scale pieces, heavier than that used on the Crystal Palace, able to support the five levels, timber and tile floors, and the infill brick walling. The design responded to the tropical environment by placing the access on external cantilevered walkways that surround the main facades, and incorporating a large lightwell behind. The Menier Chocolate Factory in Noisiel, France, designed by architect Jules Saulnier, is often credited as the first multi-story building with a structure entirely composed of cast-iron, but it was built slightly years later, beginning in 1969, completed in 1872. History John Hudson Watson was born in 1818 in Castle Carrock, England to a farming family, but moved to London in the 1840s and established a drapery business. Arriving with his brother and two sons in Bombay in 1853, they developed a successful drapery business. Buying plots 11 & 12 at the first auction of newly created Esplanade sites in August 1864, his original plan for the building was to use it as additional office and showroom for his thriving business nearby, but by late 1865 the plans had evolved into a luxury hotel, and he started to begin to ship prefabricated cast iron components from England as early as October 1865. According to the text on a painting commissioned by Watson's son in c1901 that now hangs at the Watson Institute in Castle Carrock, all elements including the cast iron, brick, stone and tiles, were imported.The inscription reads \\"‚ÄúThis building was designed in London for John Watson of Gelt Hall by Messrs Ordish and Le Febre. The materials for this were wholly English; the iron frame from Derby, the bricks and cement from the bank of the Thames, the tiles from Staffordshire, and finally the red stone plinth and column bases from Penrith.‚Äù The hotel was built between 1867 and 1869, but interior work meant it did not finally open until 4th February 1871. By then, Watson had returned to England, where he died in May 1871, leaving his son John Watson Jr, to manage the hotel and drapery business. The original design, as displayed on the painting in the Watson Institute, included plans for traditional European mansard roof, however it was built as a simplified flat roofed form. The hotel as an exclusive Europeans-only business, and it was one of the most renowned hotels in the city in its day. The five-storied structure housed 130 guest rooms, as well as a lobby, restaurant and a bar at the ground level. The hotel also had a atrium, originally used as a ballroom, with a glass skylight. At its peak, Watson's hotel employed English waitresses in its restaurant and ballroom, inspiring a common joke at the time: \\"If only Watson had imported the English weather as well.\\" Ownership appears to have been vested in Watson's wife Hannah Maria Watson, who entered into a lease deed with Sardar Abdul Haq, Diler ul Mulk, and Diler ul Daula, for a term of nine hundred and ninety nine years on 26 August 1867.Later on, another indenture was made on the date 22 12 1885, between the trustees of Port Trust of Bombay and Sardar Diler ul Mulk in which land on the Wellington Reclamation Estate of Bombay of 8129 sq.yards was leased by the Sardar Abdul Haq for a term of fifty years from 01-01-1880. John Watson Jr returned to England in 1896, and with competition from the grand Taj Mahal Hotel which opened in 1903, Watson's lost its premier status. In 1920, Watson's ceased to be a hotel, and had been renamed Mahendra Mansion. It 1944, it was renamed Esplanade Mansion, and in the 1960s it was partitioned into small cubicles and rented converted as housing and offices. Over the years, apathy toward the building by the occupants and owners has resulted the building decaying, the atrium has been used as a dumping ground, there are several illegal alterations, and by 2005 it was in a seriously dilapidated state. One of the possible reasons proffered is the fact that the rent collected is low, and cannot be raised sufficiently due to rent stabilisation laws, and tenants are also protected. , building had 53 families and 97 commercial establishments. Most of the commercial establishments are chambers of lawyers attached to the adjacent Bombay Civil & Session Courts and the nearby Bombay High Court. Having been owned by the Tatas, in the early 80s it was sold to Sadik Ali.Rs. 450 crore heritage mansion up for redevelopment, Mid-Day.com, July 04, 2013 File:Bombay Esplanade Hotel LACMA M.90.24.6.jpgthumbIn the late 1860's.

In retaliation he built the Taj Hotel, a hotel that stands near the Gateway of India, in 1903. However many historians, notably author Sharada Dwivedi, dispute this legend on the basis of a lack of evidence to prove that \\"Tata was a man of vengeance\\". Current state The building's poor structural condition has been commonly remarked, and efforts by heritage activists to persuade its present owner to invest in restoration have been unsuccessful. The current state of the building was publicized by Italian architect Renzo Piano, and as a result of his efforts, the building was listed in June 2005 on the list of \\"100 World Endangered Monuments\\" by the World Monuments Fund, a New York-based NGO. Just a few days after its nomination, part of the building's western fa√ßade, originally balconies developed into small offices, collapsed, killing one person and crushing several cars and motorcycles parked in the street below. The building is listed as a Grade II‚ÄìA heritage structure. On 13 June 2010, the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) gave its approval for the 130-year-old structure to be restored. The restoration work was to be paid for and carried out by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA). No action was taken until 2019 when MADA sought advice on restoration from a panel from IIT, wherein they observed \\"Repairs will be dangerous as many structural elements of the building are not rigidly connected to each other.. it will be prudent to demolish Esplanade Mansion\\", a decision immediately decried by heritage advocates. Whether or not to restore the buildings, how it would be funded and the rights of the tenants have, were then subject of various court cases through 2020; an expert panel appointed by the court had determined by Jan 2020 that the building could and should be restored.

Three years later, in 2019, the company announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Atlanta.  History  = Newell Company = First Newell logo The Newell Manufacturing Company was founded by Edgar Newell in Ogdensburg, New York, in 1903 as a manufacturer of metal curtain rods. In 1908, the company boosted profits by investing in machines that produced curtain rods better and faster than other manufacturers. The F. W. Woolworth retail chain became the first customer for Newell's bronze-plated curtain rods in 1916, making them the first Newell products to be distributed nationally. This marked the beginning of Newell's mass merchandising strategy. As the business grew, the company built a new 15,000-square-foot facility in Ogdensburg, New York. The company purchased Barnwell Mfg. Co. of Freeport, Illinois in 1921, renaming it Western Newell Manufacturing Company. Freeport's access to railroad lines facilitated shipping products west. Kresge, the department store chain (later Kmart) was one of Western Newell's larger accounts. During WWII, Western Newell converted factories to aid the war effort, earning the Army/Navy \\"E\\" award for excellence in wartime production. Daniel C. Ferguson was named president in 1965, and developed a growth-by-acquisition strategy, intending to build a strong, multi-product company. The Newell Company went public in 1972, opening on the NASDAQ at $28 per share. In 1974, they acquired EZ Paintr Corporation, then the world's largest maker of paint applicators. Newell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NWL in 1979. In 1979, Newell moved into its first corporate headquarters in a historic former bank building in Freeport, Illinois. In 1983, the company entered the cookware market with the purchase of Mirro. In 1987, the company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation, a specialty manufacturer of glassware, flatware, cookware and other products. The deal included the purchase of Amerock, a maker of cabinet hardware and window components. In 1992, they acquired Sanford, a manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments, including the Sharpie and Expo brands. A year later, they acquired Levolor, a manufacturer and marketer of window treatments. They also entered the beauty and style category by acquiring Goody hair care accessories, including Ace men's grooming accessories. In 1997, the company acquired Kirsch, a company involved with drapery hardware and custom window coverings. In 1998, the company expanded in cookware with the purchase of Calphalon Corporation, a manufacturer of cookware marketed primarily to upscale retailers and department stores. The company also purchased Panex, a cookware maker in South America. In 2016, Newell moved its corporate headquarters to Hoboken, New Jersey.This N.J.-based company just got named most reputable in U.S. Criticism Newell Rubbermaid has been criticized in the UK for closing British factories, including those of Parker Pen (relocating them to Nantes, France, and China) as well as toolmakers Berol, Record and Marples. Newell Sistema products has been criticized for requiring workers in their Auckland, New Zealand factory to work in unsafe conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak and lock down without adequate distances between workers and proper personal protective equipment. After a WorkSafe NZ visit workers were told they would not have to go to work and would be on full pay for the 4 week lock down. Mergers = Rubbermaid = Newell Rubbermaid logo used from 1999 to 2016 In 1999, Newell Company acquired the Rubbermaid and Graco brand names in a megamerger deal worth $5.8 billion, and later renamed the combined firm Newell Rubbermaid. This was an acquisition ten times larger than the last biggest acquisition Newell had made. This nearly doubled the company's size, and significantly increased Newell's portfolio of brands. According to the November 10, 2004 Frontline documentary series' \\"Is Wal-Mart Good for America?\\" episode, Newell's chance to buy the Rubbermaid brand resulted from the original Rubbermaid corporation's bankruptcy and fire sale- style liquidation of its remaining assets. The original Rubbermaid had risen to enormous market share and profits by making Wal-Mart the near-sole distributor of its products, shifting away from a previous, years-long policy of diversifying its product distribution by using multiple retailers. After it had become dependent upon Wal-Mart for almost all of its sales, Rubbermaid claimed that it needed to raise the retail price of its products by a small, single-digit percentage. Rubbermaid said that this price increase was needed to keep pace with operational costs and inflation, without sacrificing its legendary product quality. Despite Rubbermaid's insistence that it couldn't afford to stay in business without it, Wal-Mart, citing its strict commitment to its \\"everyday low price\\" (EDLP) policy, and language in their contract with Rubbermaid allowing it to control pricing, refused Rubbermaid's request. Rubbermaid's business collapsed shortly thereafter. Most of its physical assets had to be sold off at discount prices to satisfy its creditors. Its biggest remaining asset was the Rubbermaid brand name. The merger in 1999 was dubbed \\"merger from hell\\" by Businessweek magazine. Newell shareholders lost 50% of their value in the two years following the closing and Rubbermaid shareholders lost 35%. In 2002, Newell wrote off $500 million in goodwill. =Other mergers= In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Gillette's stationery products business, including the Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman and Liquid Paper brands. In 2002, they acquired American Tool Companies, adding the Irwin, Vise-Grip, and Marathon brands to their portfolio. In 2003, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American Saw and Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of linear-edge power tool accessories, hand tools, and band saw blades marketed under the Lenox brand. In 2005, the company acquired DYMO, designing, manufacturing, and marketing on-demand labeling solutions. The company expanded its presence in this market with the 2006 purchases of CardScan business card scanners and Mimio interactive whiteboard products along with the 2007 acquisition of postage company Endicia and its Picture-it-Postage brand. In 2005, Mark Ketchum was named president and CEO. The company added the slogan of \\"Brands That Matter\\" to their logo to emphasize the change. In February 2008, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Aprica Kassai, a Japanese maker of strollers, car seats, and other children's products and Technical Concepts, in the away-from-home restroom market. The company created a global headquarters in the Atlanta metropolitan area to consolidate numerous brands and functions under one roof. In July 2011, Michael B. Polk joined the company as president and CEO. On July 21, 2014, Newell Rubbermaid announced a $308 million acquisition of Ignite Holdings, a Chicago-based maker of reusable water bottles and thermal mugs. Ignite sold its products under two brand names: Avex and Contigo, also acquiring Ignite's proprietary closing mechanism, Autoseal. On October 5, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Elmer's Products, the makers of Elmer's glue, Krazy Glue, and X-Acto, among other brands, for $600 million. The company also announced plans to divest its window covering brands Levolor and Kirsch. On December 14, 2015, Newell Rubbermaid announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock. The combined company will be known as Newell Brands, and 55% will be owned by Newell's shareholders. The combined company will have an estimated annual sales of $16 billion. =Divestitures= In 2014 Newell Rubbermaid sold Ashland Hardware Systems, Bulldog and Shurline. In 2017, Newell sold K2 Sports, V√∂lkl, Diamond Match Company, Levolor and Kirsch. In January 2018, Newell announced that it would sell off several businesses, mostly former Jarden units, in a refocusing effort. In May 2018, Newell sold Waddington to Novolex. In June 2018, Newell sold Rawlings to Seidler Equity Partners. In August 2018, Newell sold Goody to ACON Investments. In November 2018, Newell sold its Pure Fishing line of business to Sycamore Partners for $1.3 billion and Jostens to Platinum Equity for $1.3 billion.

Biography  Born around 1843 to the family of the small-time merchant and craftsman Gruyo Hlatev, Benkovski was a native of the bustling sub-Balkan town of Koprivshtitsa and had two sisters, Kuna and Vasilya. Due to his difficult childhood, Benkovski had to drop out of school after finishing third grade in order to be trained as a tailor by his mother and make a living. Discontent with his job, he became a frieze dealer and left for Asia Minor together with a friend to sell their products, with little success. For some ten years Benkovski lived in various cities of the Orient, including Istanbul (Tsarigrad), ƒ∞zmir (Smyrna) and Alexandria, engaging in various professions. His later stories describe his work as a bodyguard of the Persian consul, claiming his uniform was so beautiful people thought he was the consul himself. During his travels, Benkovski learned seven foreign languages to the level of basic competency: Arabic, Ottoman Turkish, Greek, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Persian. Benkovski became involved in the revolutionary activities of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee after meeting Stoyan Zaimov in Bucharest, Romania; he was also introduced to Vasil Levski and Hristo Botev's revolutionary and democratic ideas. In the summer of 1875, he joined a group of revolutionaries intending to set Constantinople on fire and assassinate sultan Abd√ºlaziz. He was given the French passport of a Polish √©migr√©, Anton Benkowski, whose family name he adopted as a pseudonym; he later changed his first name to Georgi. The Pole was an anti-Russian revolutionary who had attempted to assassinate the Russian governor of Warsaw and had to serve a life sentence on Sakhalin. Anton Benkowski managed to flee to Japan, where he acquired a passport and from where he fled to the Ottoman Empire. In Diyarbakƒ±r, the Pole met Zaimov and traded his French passport for five Turkish liras and the assistance to acquire an Ottoman passport. Benkovski was initially selected as Panayot Volov's assistant in the organization of the 4th Revolutionary District of the April Uprising, but due to his fervour and leadership qualities Volov conceded the position of head apostle to Benkovski voluntarily. Thanks to Benkovski's work, the insurrectional preparations developed best in this district. When the April Uprising broke out prematurely in Koprivshtitsa on , Benkovski was in nearby Panagyurishte along with most other apostles. Upon hearing that fighting has broken out in Koprivshtitsa, Benkovski formed an over-200-strong detachment and went to assist the insurrectionists. His detachment was known as \\"The Flying Band\\" (–•–≤—ä—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞—Ç–∞ —á–µ—Ç–∞, Hvarkovata cheta) because it toured the entire region tirelessly, mobilizing many insurgents and playing an important part in the fighting. The band was even joined by six Croats from Dalmatia and the German Albrecht, all workers at the Belovo railway station. One of the Croats, Stephen the Dalmatian, went to become the band's final standard- bearer. One woman also joined the band: Maria Ivanova-Sutiƒá, the Bulgarian wife of a Croatian railway worker. In the wake of the uprising's suppression, Benkovski and the surviving members of the band (Stephen the Dalmatian, Zahari Stoyanov and Father Kiril) headed to the Teteven Balkan Mountains. On , the band's location was betrayed by a local shepherd and the revolutionaries were ambushed by an Ottoman search party. Benkovski was shot dead in the Kostina area near Ribaritsa while crossing a river bridge. He was subsequently beheaded; his head was sent to Botevgrad and then to Sofia. The events were documented by Zahari Stoyanov and published in his Memoirs of the Bulgarian Uprisings; the author was the only one of the four who managed to escape.

Like the station's other broadcasters, Ruggiu incited violence against Tutsi and moderate Hutu over the air. Ruggiu eventually pleaded guilty to charges of incitement to commit genocide and in 2000 was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. An Italian-Belgian who became involved in Rwandan politics two years before the genocide, Ruggiu was the only non-Rwandan charged with involvement in the genocide. Life in Belgium Ruggiu's mother was a Belgian teacher, his father an Italian fireman. Until the age of 35 he lived at home and worked in Verviers, first as \\"a counsellor for young drug addicts and then as a teacher for mentally handicapped children\\". In 1992 he moved to the city of Li√®ge, commuting to Brussels to work in a social security office. In Li√®ge he \\"befriended a Rwandan Hutu, was drawn into the Rwandan expatriate community and was soon seen in the company of Rwandan diplomats and officials of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana's party, the MRND\\". He began visiting Rwanda and moved there in 1993. Participation in genocide From January to July 1994, prior to and during the genocide, Ruggiu worked in Kigali, Rwanda, as a journalist and producer for Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). Ruggiu had no experience in journalism and did not speak Kinyarwanda. RTLM was one of the chief sources of extremist Hutu propaganda, broadcasting twenty- four hours a day and openly exhorting its audience to kill Tutsis and \\"disloyal\\" Hutus. Ruggiu personally wrote and broadcast much content of this nature, relentlessly egging on his listeners that the \\"graves were waiting to be filled\\". Ruggiu personally broadcast programs inciting Hutus to commit murder or serious attacks against Tutsi rebels, whom he called \\"cockroaches\\". He also encouraged persecution of these Tutsi, and moderate Hutu and Belgian citizens in the area. Airtime filled by Ruggiu accounted for approximately 8% of RTLM's broadcasts. Although some of his defenders have suggested that Ruggiu did not know exactly what was going on around him in Rwanda, this opinion is sharply disputed by Rwandan Genocide scholar Alison Des Forges: \\"It is beyond belief that Ruggiu did not know [what was going on] ... The tone of Mille Collines became more and more violent and witnesses say Ruggiu was living at the army barracks in Kigali and eating in the mess. He was hanging out with those that did the killing.\\" Capture, trial, and sentencing After the genocide Ruggiu fled to refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania and then to Kenya, where he converted to Islam and adopted the name Omar. He \\"joined a Somali community in Mombasa\\" and was \\"on the verge of fleeing to Iraq\\" when he was arrested by Kenyan police in 1997. On July 23, 1997, Ruggiu was arrested in Mombasa at the request of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and moved to the site of the tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania. Ruggiu was charged with \\"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\\" and \\"crimes against humanity (persecution)\\". During his three-year- long trial, Ruggiu expressed regret for his part in events, saying, \\"I admit that it was indeed a genocide and that unfortunately I took part in it.\\" Ruggiu acknowledged his role in the genocide, admitting that he: He accepted responsibility for his actions, stating \\"certain people were killed in Rwanda in 1994 and that I was responsible and culpable\\". Ruggiu detailed the inner workings of Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines, stating the radio station was used to convey \\"the ideology and plans of Hutu extremists in Rwanda\\". On May 15, 2000, Ruggiu pleaded guilty to both charges of indictment, and was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for incitement to commit genocide. He received a relatively short sentence, after agreeing to testify against three suspects who allegedly used the media, most notably RTLM, to fuel the genocide in Rwanda. Rwanda protested the sentence as inadequate. In February 2008, Ruggiu was flown to Italy to serve out the rest of his 12-year sentence in his country of citizenship. On 21 April 2009, Ruggiu was granted early release by the Italian authorities,TRIAL International: Georges Ruggiu a violation of the ICTR Statute.

The F2G was intended as a low-altitude interceptor and was equipped with a 28-cylinder, four-row Pratt & Whitney R-4360 air-cooled radial engine. Such a fighter was first conceived in 1939, when Pratt & Whitney first proposed the immense, 3,000 hp (2,200 kW) R-4360,Pautigny 2003, p. 76. and design work began in early 1944, despite an oft-cited anecdote that the F2G was intended to intercept kamikazes (a tactic that was not widely used until late 1944). Design and development A U.S. Navy F2G-1 in 1945. Using experience gained building the F4U-1 under license ‚Äì a variant known as the FG-1 ‚Äì in early 1944, Goodyear modified a standard Corsair airframe to take advantage of the 50% increase in take-off power provided by the R-4360 engine. Known as the XF2G-1, the aircraft also featured a new all-round vision bubble- type canopy. A land-based variant, with manually-folding wings, was to be known as the F2G-1, while a carrier version with hydraulically-folding wings and arrestor hook was to be called the F2G-2.Dorr 1991, p.68. In March 1944, Goodyear was awarded a contract to deliver 418 F2G-1 and 10 F2G-2 aircraft. Armament was to include four or six wing-mounted 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and eight 5-inch (127 mm) rockets or two 1,000 or 1,600 lb (450 or 725 kg) bombs. The internal fuel capacity of the F2G was increased greatly over that of the F4U, and provisions were also made for two droptanks. However, post-production testing revealed deficiencies in lateral control and insufficient speed, which were bars to further development of the design. In addition, Grumman F8F Bearcat ‚Äì a rival design that had also entered production ‚Äì had performance comparable to the F2G, even though it was powered with the same engine as the original F4U. By the end of the war in August 1945, when only 10 aircraft (five examples of each variant) had been completed, further production of the F2G was canceled. Variants XF2G-1: prototype. One converted from a standard FG-1 Corsair. F2G-1: land-based variant, 418 ordered, five built, order cancelled. F2G-2: carrier-based variant, 10 ordered, five built, order cancelled.

Sybil then became the founder and first National Coordinator of the National League of Families, a nonprofit organization that worked on behalf of American Vietnam-era Missing in Action and Prisoner of War Families. In her capacity as national coordinator for the League, she also served as its liaison to the White House and the Department of Defense. Stockdale is credited with helping to better publicize the mistreatment of US prisoners by North Vietnam and for helping to improve American policies concerning the treatment and handling of POW families. Stockdale is the recipient of the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the highest award given by the Department of the Navy to a citizen not employed by the Department.\\"An Indomitable Spirit\\", James Stockdale Biography, Museum of Living History, Academy of Achievement, Washington D.C., She is the only wife of an active-duty officer ever to have been so honored. Stockdale was also the co-author, along with her husband, of the book In Love and War: the Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War. Her husband, James Bond Stockdale, was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for bravery in war, and after his release at the end of the war, was eventually promoted to vice admiral and by the time of his death in 2005 was one of the United States' most honored and decorated military veterans in the post-World War II era. He was present at the August 4, 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident, spent 7 years under torture as a POW in North Vietnam, later became President of The Citadel, and eventually ran for Vice-President of the United States with Ross Perot heading the ticket. The Vietnam War years =Husband's Capture in Vietnam / Pentagon \\"Keep quiet\\" Policy= When Sybil Stockdale's husband James was shot down in 1965 over North Vietnam, the US government had a \\"keep-quiet\\" policy, asking relatives of POWs to not raise a fuss about mistreatment of prisoners. The official reason was not that the prisoners were not being tortured, but bad publicity might result in worse treatment. =Founding of the National League of Families= After a year of abiding by the government \\"keep-quiet\\" policy, Sybil found herself more and more disenchanted with the pretense that prisoners like her husband were treated fairly; James had been tortured, had inflicted serious wounds on himself to convince his captors they could not break or use him, and had spent years in solitary confinement. In the summer of 1966, Sybil along with other members of a San Diego POW / MIA support group decided to go national, and formed the National League of Families of American Prisoners Missing in Southeast Asia. Sybil was the first national coordinator. Other support groups from east coast military communities later became part of the National League. Within a year she was sitting in the office of the Secretary Of Defense Melvin Laird discussing policy. The Nixon Administration had ended the \\"keep quiet\\" policy and allegations of torture of US prisoners became fully public, with Sybil a forceful spokeswoman. In 1970, Mrs. Stockdale, along with her husband's 1992 running mate, H. Ross Perot, testified before the U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Foreign Affairs. Memoir co-authored with husband James Sybil Stockdale co-wrote a memoir with her husband James (who also wrote a number of books on his own). In Love and War: the Story of a Family's Ordeal and Sacrifice During the Vietnam War was the most popular book written by either of the Stockdales. In the book James and Sybil Stockdale wrote alternating chapters describing their experiences of the Vietnam war. James wrote of his experiences as a POW, and Sybil wrote of her experiences as the wife of a POW, dealing with the stress and waiting at home and her journey cutting through Washington red tape and publicizing the plight of American POWs in Vietnam. NBC adapted the book into a made-for-television movie that had 45 million viewers. Christening of USS Stockdale (DDG 106) On May 10, 2008, Sybil Stockdale attended a christening ceremony at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine for , the 30th , and the 56th ship of the class.

In it, a judge who lacks compassion is repeatedly approached by a poor widow, seeking justice. Initially rejecting her demands, he eventually honors her request so he will not be worn out by her persistence. One interpretation of this parable is that it demonstrates the importance of persistence in prayer, never giving up. It is found immediately prior to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (also on prayer) and is similar to the Parable of the Friend at Night. Other scholars note that the content of the parable makes no reference to prayer and that the introduction of prayer as a theme is generally inspired by the Lucan construction in verses 6‚Äì8 and by the fact that Luke placed the parable of the Pharisee and Publican influentially after this one. Whatever approach is taken, it is noteworthy that the judge in the parable does not act on the basis of justice.  Narrative  Parable of the Unjust Judge by John Everett Millais (1863) Luke reports the parable as follows: Interpretation The framing material of the parable demonstrates the need to always pray like that persistent widow, for if even an unjust judge will eventually listen, God is much quicker to do so.Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 636-643. The parable of the Friend at Night has a similar meaning.Craig L. Blomberg, Interpreting the Parables, InterVarsity Press, 1990, , p. 275. Joel B. Green sees in this parable an injunction not to lose heart, in the light of the eschatological tone of , and also an echo of Sirach 35: \\"For he is a God of justice, who knows no favorites. ... The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds; it does not rest till it reaches its goal, nor will it withdraw till the Most High responds, judges justly and affirms the right.\\"Sirach 35:12-18, New American Bible. William Barclay says that the point of the parable is less about persistent prayer, but rather the contrast between God and men in the phrase \\"how much more.\\" In prayer one is speaking to a Father ready to give.Barclay, William. The Parables of Jesus, Westminster John Knox Press, 1999 Donald Parry and Jay A. Parry suggests that \\"this parable applies to each of us who has adversaries that are harmful to our spiritual life, whether the adversaries are other mortals, evil beings, or particular sins that continue to plague us. We, like the importunate widow, must pray always for help against these adversaries. As we do, our Heavenly Father will hear our prayers and bring us deliverance.\\" (Parry, Parry, Understanding the Parables of Jesus Christ, 2006) As Christ suggested in this parable the deliverance that is sought for may not be offered until after \\"the Son of man cometh.\\" () Christ will avenge his elect, those in whom have kept the faith until his return at the second coming ().

It is a subsidiary of Newell Brands. It is best known for producing food storage containers and trash cans. Additionally it produces sheds, step stools, closets and shelving, and laundry baskets, but also air fresheners and other household items. History Rubbermaid glass food storage containers. Rubbermaid was founded in 1920 in Wooster, Ohio as the Wooster Rubber Company by nine businessmen. Originally, Wooster Rubber Company manufactured toy balloons. In 1933, James R. Caldwell and his wife received a patent for their blue rubber dustpan. They called their line of rubber kitchen products Rubbermaid. In 1934 Horatio Ebert saw Rubbermaid products at a New England department store, and believed such products could help his struggling Wooster Rubber. He engineered a merger of the two enterprises in July 1934. Still named the Wooster Company, the new group began to produce rubber household products under the Rubbermaid brand name. In 1984, Rubbermaid acquired Little Tikes, a toy maker. In 1985, Rubbermaid acquired competitor Gott Corporation. In 1996, Rubbermaid acquired Graco baby products. In 1999, Rubbermaid was purchased by Newell for $6 billion. Then Newell changed its name to Newell Rubbermaid. Newell Rubbermaid changed its name again to the present-day Newell Brands in 2016 as part of a takeover of Jarden in another merger. In 2003, the company announced its move out of Wooster to Atlanta, Georgia; 850 manufacturing and warehouse jobs would be eliminated, and 409 office jobs would move to other locations. A Rubbermaid distribution center remained at the former headquarters for some time, until it was recently purchased by GOJO Industries, Inc.

She is a spy for Cardinal Richelieu and is one of the dominant antagonists of the story. Her role in the first part of the book is to seduce the English prime minister, the duke of Buckingham, who is also the secret lover of Queen Anne of France. Hoping to blackmail the queen, Richelieu orders Milady to steal two diamonds from a set of matched studs given to Buckingham by the queen, which were a gift to her from her husband, King Louis XIII. Thwarted by d'Artagnan and the other musketeers, Milady's conflict with d'Artagnan carries much of the second half of the novel. Character overview Described as being 22, tall, fair-haired and uncommonly beautiful, with brilliant blue eyes and black lashes and brows, Milady possesses a voice that can seduce and bewitch. A capable and intelligent French spy who effortlessly can pass as a native Englishwoman, Milady's beautiful exterior hides a diabolically cunning, manipulative, ruthless and cruel interior; she is remorseless and unrepentant for her countless \\"misdeeds\\" and often described as appearing demonic and frighteningly ugly in the instant when she is thwarted in her aims. She is a classic example of a femme fatale. Milady later is revealed to be the wife of Athos, originally the Comte de la F√®re, one of the three musketeers of the novel's title. Background Like Athos, who sheds his true identity as the Comte de la F√®re when he joins the musketeers, Milady goes by numerous aliases, so that her identity is concealed for a good part of the novel. Athos first knows her as an adolescent Anne de Breuil, but because she already was concealing a scandalous and criminal past at that time, it was probably not her real name. As a young Benedictine nun of 16, she seduced the convent's trusting priest. Urging him to steal the church's sacred vessels to finance a new life in another part of the country, they fled together and quickly were apprehended. Milady then seduced the jailer's son and escaped, leaving behind her first lover to be branded for theft. The executioner who had to brand the priest happened to be his brother, and blaming Milady for leading his brother astray, tracked her down on his own and branded her on the shoulder with the same fleur-de-lis symbol, marking her as a convicted criminal. The priest in turn escaped, and the lovers fled to a small town, where they posed as a country curate and his sister. The village where they lived was part of Athos's lands, and he became captivated both by her beauty and her intellect. As seigneur of the county, he could have seduced her or taken her by force, but despite the opposition of his family and her obscure origins, he married her, giving her his wealth and title, and raising her to the nobility. While the pair were hunting in the forest one day, Milady fell from her horse and fainted. Cutting away her clothes so she could breathe, Athos discovered the convict brand on her shoulder. Dishonored, and having the right to dispense justice on his estates, Athos immediately hanged her from a tree. His wife's \\"brother\\", who had married the pair, fled before any retribution could be taken; Athos believes he only pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married in a secure position. For most of the novel, Athos assumes his deceitful wife is dead by his own hand, not knowing she survived the hanging and that she and Milady are the same person. Because the Comte de la F√®re effectively ceases to exist when he becomes Athos, Milady makes the same mistake in presuming her first husband is dead. Active role in the novel When d'Artagnan first spies Milady in Paris, she has married into English nobility some time previously by wedding Baron Sheffield, the younger brother of Lord de Winter. After she was made her husband's heir, he died violently and mysteriously within a matter of hours, leaving her a widow with a young child, who is Lord de Winter's only heir. Discovering that Milady is infatuated with Comte des Wardes, an equally infatuated d'Artagnan forges the count's reply to a love letter from Milady and arranges a nighttime rendezvous, where he impersonates des Wardes. During the assignation, Milady gives him, as des Wardes, a sapphire and diamond ring and swears to have d'Artagnan killed because he wounded the real des Wardes in a duel. She also reveals that she detests d'Artagnan for having spared her brother-in-law's life in another duel which lost her the income from her son's potential inheritance. When d'Artagnan later reveals to Milady that the tryst has been with him, not des Wardes, she attempts to kill him. In the struggle, her nightgown is torn, revealing the fleur-de-lis brand. Knowing that her terrible secret has been revealed to her enemy, Milady becomes resolved that d'Artagnan must die. Her attempts to secure his assassination lead to her eventual downfall. D'Artagnan escapes and immediately reports to Athos that Milady has a brand on her shoulder identical to one he discovered on his wife's body. When Athos hears this and identifies the ring Milady gave to d'Artagnan as his mother's, the former Comte de la F√®re realizes that his wife is not dead after all. Milady tries many methods to murder d'Artagnan; while eavesdropping on a meeting between Richelieu and Milady, the musketeers hear that, in exchange for her assassination of Buckingham, Richelieu will undertake the task. Milady bargains with the cardinal and obtains a pardon that absolves her of future (unnamed) actions. It is not until Athos confronts her and forces her at pistol to relinquish the pardon that a horrified Milady realizes that the musketeer Athos is her first husband, the Comte de la F√®re. Athos refrains from killing her, instead leaving her with no choice but to be escorted to England on her murderous mission, but without the cardinal's pardon. The musketeers then warn Lord de Winter that not only has his sister- in-law made previous attempts on his life, but that her first husband is still alive, invalidating her marriage to his late brother. They also attempt to foil Milady's plot against Buckingham by having de Winter warn him. Upon arriving in England, Milady is arrested and imprisoned in a house by de Winter, who has suspected that she poisoned his younger brother. He chooses for her jailer a man he thinks will be impervious to her charms, the straitlaced Puritan John Felton. However, Milady manipulates Felton that she is actually a Puritan as well, and that Buckingham is persecuting her because she refused his advances. Felton has his own grievances against Buckingham, whom he blames for his lack of promotion in the army, and succumbs to her manipulation. He then proceeds to murder the duke (an actual historical event), but then is aghast to see Milady's ship sailing away without him. He later is hanged for the crime. Returning to France, Milady murders d'Artagnan's lover, then flees. The musketeers and Lord de Winter hunt Milady and track her to Lille, where they try her among themselves for her numerous crimes, including the poisoning of de Winter's brother. Athos finally charges her with deceiving him, hiding the fact that she was a convicted criminal when he married her. Milady defies anyone to produce any proof that she ever was sentenced for a crime. To her horror, the executioner of Lille steps forward to reveal himself as the man who branded her. When his priest brother escaped from jail to follow Milady, the executioner was condemned to serve his brother's sentence for him. On learning this later, the disgraced priest returned and surrendered himself, only to hang himself in his cell that same night. The executioner reveals that, rather than having schemed to marry her to a count, his brother was abandoned when Milady left him to marry Athos. (This seems to be at odds with Athos' earlier assertion that her \\"brother\\" married the pair.) This final evidence condemns Milady to death, and she is beheaded by the executioner. Aliases As the true identity of the Comte de la F√®re is concealed by the name Athos, Milady's true identity is hidden by various names throughout the novel: *Anne de Breuil (the name by which Athos knew Milady when he met her) *Comtesse de la F√®re (the title Milady assumed when she married the Comte de la F√®re, later known as Athos) *Milady de Winter, Baroness Sheffield (the general name Milady is referred to throughout the story) *Lady Clarik/Clarick (a variation on the previous name; in some English translations, this is translated as Clarisse or Clarice) *Charlotte Backson (the fictional name Milady's brother-in-law, Lord de Winter, attempts to bestow upon her in his plan to banish her to the colonies) Her son in the sequel In the 1845 sequel Twenty Years After, Milady's son Mordaunt, now 23, takes her role as one of the chief antagonists. As twisted and as deceitful as his mother, he sets about avenging her death, posing as a monk and murdering the executioner of Lille while taking his confession. He also murders Lord de Winter, Milady's brother-in-law, who raised him after the death of his mother. Mordaunt later becomes involved in the English Civil War and commits regicide, executing King Charles I, in spite of the efforts of d'Artagnan and the three former musketeers to prevent it. D'Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell's London residence, but in the course of a duel, he escapes through a secret passage. The musketeers and their menservants leave England by ship, but Mordaunt sneaks aboard and blows it up. As the survivors escape in a rowboat, Mordaunt pleads for them to help him aboard, accusing them of killing him as they killed his mother. With the exception of Athos, they contemptuously reject his appeals. Athos insists on saving him, but as he helps him into the boat, Mordaunt deliberately drags him back into the water where they struggle, and Mordaunt is killed. Origin of the character Margot Grahame as Milady de Winter in the 1935 film version The character of Milady previously appeared in the M√©moires de M. d'Artagnan (1700), a historical novel by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras, which Dumas discovered during his research for his history of Louis XIV. In Courtilz's novel (one of the literary sources for the more famous novel by Dumas), Milady is one of the exiled English Queen Henrietta Maria's ladies-in-waiting. Dumas changed Milady's background significantly; from another Courtilz novel (M√©moires de M. le Comte de Rochforte, 1687) Dumas partly derived the idea of the branded woman, which he applied to his version of Milady. There appears to be a possible historical precedent for the character of Milady: The memoirs of Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld and Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans as well as Volume I of Chroniques de l'≈íil de B≈ìuf by Touchard-Lafosse describe Milady's antagonistic role in the diamond studs plot which Dumas reworked in The Three Musketeers. In La Rochefoucauld's volume, Milady is the Countess of Carlisle, in de Brienne's version she is Lady Clarick de Winter, and in Touchard-Lafosse's history she is Lady de Clarick. Milady - or rather, her historical/literary precursors - play relatively minor roles in Courtilz's novel and the other memoirs and pseudo-memoirs. While her theft of the diamond studs and other activities in the first half of The Three Musketeers are accounted for in the earlier works that Dumas borrowed, her machinations in the second half of the book are largely Dumas' invention.Introduction by Lord Sudley to The Three Musketeers by Alexandr√© Dumas, translated by Lord Sudley. (1982, Penguin Books), p.11-15 Others think that the character of Milady de Winter may be based on Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle (n√©e Percy; 1599 ‚Äì 5 November 1660). Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld mentioned in his Memoirs an anecdote he was told by Marie de Rohan, in which Lucy Hay stole some diamond studs (a present of the king of France to Anne of Austria) the queen had given to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham from the duke as revenge because he had loved her before he loved the queen of France. The king of France then wanted to see the studs and somehow the queen was able to recover them. Alexandre Dumas later used this entire story, and therefore he probably based Milady de Winter on Lucy Carlisle in his 1844 novel The Three Musketeers. Transgender theory In the introduction to his 1952 English translation of The Three Musketeers, Lord Sudley posits the following: Sudley goes on to suggest that Dumas might have found inspiration for Milady from the Chevalier d'√âon, a transgender spy who acted as Louis XV's secret envoy to Russia and England. D'√âon spent half of his life as a man and half as a woman, and was accused of actual physical hermaphroditism during their lifetime. One of Dumas' collaborators, F. Gaillardet, wrote the M√©moires sur la Chevali√©re d'√âon, of which Dumas is known to have owned a copy. However, Sudley concedes that the idea of d'√âon being an inspiration for Milady de Winter \\"is, of course, pure conjecture, impossible to prove or disprove.\\"Introduction by Lord Sudley to The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, translated by Lord Sudley. (1982, Penguin Books), p.23 Additionally, Dumas describes her in terms that may indicate a variance from the binary genders. Dumas attributes to her ‚Äústrength apparently above that of a woman.‚Äù Film and television Actresses who have played Milady on screen include: * Barbara La Marr in The Three Musketeers (1921) * Dorothy Revier in The Iron Mask (1929) * Margot Grahame in The Three Musketeers (1935) * Binnie Barnes in The Three Musketeers (1939) * Lana Turner in The Three Musketeers (1948) * Myl√®ne Demongeot in Les trois mousquetaires: Premiere √©poque-Les ferrets de la reine and Les trois mousquetaires: La vengeance de Milady (aka ‚ÄúThe Fighting Musketeers‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Vengeance of the Musketeers‚Äù) (both 1961) * Faye Dunaway in The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974) * Karin Petersen in The Four Charlots Musketeers 1 and 2 (1974) * Margarita Terekhova in D'Artagnan and Three Musketeers (1978 miniseries) * Rebecca De Mornay in The Three Musketeers (1993) * Pia Douwes in 3 Musketiers (2003 musical) * Emmanuelle B√©art in D'Artagnan et les trois mousquetaires (2005) * Milla Jovovich in The Three Musketeers (2011) * Maimie McCoy in The Musketeers (2014) In the cartoon version Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, Milady is a female cat while most of the characters are dogs. With the exception of her real name (Countess de Winter), her origins never were revealed. It was hinted that 'only one man' knows of her past. In the movie The Return of the Musketeers, Kim Cattrall plays Milady's daughter Justine de Winter as a female version of Mordaunt.

Irwin (May 14, 1952 ‚Äì September 5, 1987) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his tag team with his brother Barney \\"Bill\\" Irwin. Professional wrestling career =Debut and the World Wide Wrestling Federation= After training under Verne Gagne in 1975, Irwin debuted for the AWA on March 13, 1976 in Davenport, Iowa, going to a time limit draw with another rookie, Dick Blood (in one of his first matches), later to become famous as Ricky Steamboat. He mainly wrestled preliminary matches until June 1976 when he left for Georgia Championship Wrestling where he stayed until the spring of 1977. From there he went on to Jim Crockett's Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling. After wrestling in Mid-Atlantic throughout the rest of 1977 and in early 1978, Irwin debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation on March 14, 1978 as one half of The Yukon Lumberjacks, where he was given the ring name \\"Lumberjack Eric\\" and his tag team partner, Zarinoff Lebeouf, was given the ring name \\"Lumberjack Pierre\\". Soon after debuting, The Lumberjacks wrestled against Dino Bravo and Dominic DeNucci for the WWF Tag Team Championship on June 2, but the match ended in a double disqualification. The Lumberjacks continued their feud with Bravo and DeNucci, and after several unsuccessful title rematches, the Lumberjacks finally defeated them for the title on June 26. The Lumberjacks continued their success by retaining their title in several matches over the next several months against the likes of Bravo and DeNucci, Gorilla Monsoon and S.D. Jones and Haystacks Calhoun and Tony Garea. On November 21, The Lumberjacks lost their title Garea and Larry Zbyszko. After the title loss, Pierre retired from wrestling and Eric left the WWWF. =Championship Wrestling from Florida= After leaving the WWWF, Irwin debuted in Championship Wrestling from Florida in December 1978 as \\"Thor the Viking\\", with Oliver Humperdink as his manager. While in FCW, Irwin found championship success and wrestled his final match as Thor on October 14, 1979, with a victory over Steve Keirn. The following month, Irwin returned to the CWF as the masked \\"Super Destroyer\\", and went on to win a tag team match with Stan Lane against Keirn and Mike Graham. =Mid-South Wrestling= Irwin continued to use the Super Destroyer character in the CWF throughout the rest of 1979 before debuting in Mid-South Wrestling on November 27, 1980, in a losing effort to Ted DiBiase. Irwin, as the Super Destroyer, returned to Mid- South on April 18, 1981, and won the tag team championship with the Grappler after defeating Dick Murdoch and the Junkyard Dog in the finals of a tournament to claim the vacant title. However, the Destroyer and the Grappler lost the tag team title days later to Murdoch and JYD, on April 27. Soon after the title loss, Destroyer rebounded by winning the Louisiana Heavyweight Championship on May 1. He held the title for over two months before losing it to Bob Roop on July 22. Irwin continued to perform as the Super Destroyer upon joining the Continental Wrestling Association, and soon formed a successful tag team with the Masked Superstar. =The Super Destroyers= The team soon jumped ship to Georgia Championship Wrestling, and continued their success by winning the NWA National Tag Team Championship on January 22, 1982 from The Armstrongs (Bob and Brad). Beginning in March, the Superstar gave his half of the title to Big John Studd. On July 2, Super Destroyer and Studd lost the title to The Fabulous Freebirds. After the title loss, Super Destroyer returned to singles competition before he formed The Super Destroyers tag team with his real-life brother Bill Irwin. Bill became Super Destroyer No. 1 while Scott became Super Destroyer No. 2, and the brothers won their first NWA American Tag Team Championship from Bulldog Brower and Roddy Piper in October 1983. Soon after debuting, they acquired Skandor Akbar as a manager. The Destroyers lost the title to Brian Adias and Iceman King Parsons on December 25 before regaining it on January 30, 1984. The Destroyers held the title for four months before losing it to Rock 'n' Soul (Parsons and Buck Zomhofe). The Destroyers quickly rebounded and won the title back thirteen days later, but after the match, Rock 'n' Soul unmasked them. =The Long Riders= After being unmasked, the brothers dropped the Destroyers aspect of their team and instead began wrestling under their real names while their tag team was renamed to the \\"Long Riders\\". The Riders continued their feud with Rock 'n' Soul and lost the title to them again, on August 4, after Parsons defeated Bill in a singles match. The Riders won the American Tag Team Title for the fourth and final time on September 28 after defeating Rock 'n' Soul. The brothers soon lost the title to the Fantastics (Tommy Rogers and Bobby Fulton) on October 22. On November 18, Irwin returned to Georgia Championship Wrestling and, with his brother, defeated Brad Armstrong and Jacques Rougeau in the finals of a one-night tournament to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship. The next night, the Long Riders retained their newly won title against Armstrong and Tommy Rich. On January 11, 1985, the Riders lost the title to Ole Anderson and Thunderbolt Patterson. After the Riders lost a rematch for the title the following night, Scott faced Anderson and Patterson in two subsequent rematches with Kareem Muhammad and then Doug Somers as his partners, due to Bill leaving GCW, but was unable to win either rematch. Irwin wrestled a few more matches in GCW before leaving the promotion. The Long Riders soon sprang up in the American Wrestling Association later in mid-1985, where they lost their debut match to the Road Warriors for the Warriors' tag team championship on July 14. On September 28, the Riders and Harley Race lost to Genichiro Tenryu, Giant Baba and Jumbo Tsuruta in a six-man tag team match at SuperClash. The Riders continued in the AWA until April 20, 1986, where they lost a tag team title match to Curt Hennig and Scott Hall at WrestleRock. Death On September 5, 1987, Irwin died from a brain tumor. He was 35 years old.

The centre provides lodges, chalets and campsites covering 17 hectares of land. It is open to Scouts year round, as well as to non-Scouts for most of the year. More than 11,000 young people from over 50 different countries visit the centre every year.. KISC is the World Organization of the Scout Movement's (WOSM) World Scout Centre. History Picture of the campsite in the 1920s In 1921 the Chief Scout of Switzerland, Walther von Bonstetten, visited Kandersteg on holiday and found an old empty chalet. It was built in 1908 to house the construction workers for the L√∂tschberg Tunnel. In 1913, when the tunnel was finished, the chalet was left unused by the railway company. Von Bonstetten felt that this location could be the permanent international meeting place that Robert Baden-Powell had in mind where Scouts from all over the world could meet. Von Bonstetten wrote to him to let him know what he had found. The response was positive and on 12 February 1923 the Scouts International Home Association was set up; on 12 April 1923 the chalet and adjacent land were bought for CHF 15,100, and the International Scout Centre came into existence. In 1930 Baden-Powell visited the site himself. Flyer and map of Kandersteg distributed to the participants of the 4th International Scout Conference 1926.Up to current times, the site has continuously been augmented, with the first national room, 'the Dutch room' in 1927, and the purchase of additional land in 1929. During World War II, the centre was used to house French soldiers interned for the war. In the 1950s more property was purchased, including the woods by the river Kander, and the centre began to open also in the wintertime. The centre was renamed Kandersteg International Scout Centre in 1977. In the 1980s, new campsites were created, together with extra toilet facilities, although the centre went through a difficult time financially. In 1994, the International Scout Centre Foundation, Kandersteg was established, and work started on the chalet extension project which opened on 1 June 1996. On December 2002, the top floor of the New Chalet was finished, completing the chalet extension, followed by new bathroom renovations two years later. In 2009, the centre opened a new accommodation building named Kander-Lodge, purchased the neighbouring building, Sunneblick, and fully renovated the ground floor of the Old Chalet. Location Map to KISC The small, traditional Swiss village of Kandersteg (inhabitants approximately 1,200) is situated at 1,200 metres above sea level, 65 kilometres south of Bern, in the canton of Bern, near the L√∂tschenpass and the Gemmipass. The village is known for sightseeing and exploring the Swiss Alps. Kandersteg can be reached by road and rail: it is situated on the main railway line from the north to Italy, and the station is served by fast trains. The Scout Centre is at the southern end of the village. During high season, a regular bus runs from the local railway station. Facilities =Chalet= Kandersteg International Scout Centre The central part of the centre is the chalet, which consists of two parts, the Old Chalet and the New Chalet. This building houses the centre reception and offices, as well as facilities for guests. The completion of the extension in 1996 greatly increased its size, and it has full central heating, modern sanitary facilities with constant hot water, a souvenir shop, meeting rooms, postal service, public telephones, a coffee bar, a laundry, a first aid room and internet facilities. There are five fully equipped electric kitchens available for use. The Chalet is open all year round and is run along much the same lines as most Youth Hostels, with an emphasis on community life and cooperation. Guests help to look after and clean the building. The Chalet is decorated with scarves and plaques from guests, as well as photos, posters and badges showing the worldwide family of Scouting. The Old Chalet provides accommodation for 172 people in 23 rooms, each with between 3 and 22 beds. Most rooms have tables and chairs, providing a living area. The rooms are named after National Scout Organizations or Scout Regions that have helped with renovating and decorating the room. The New Chalet provides new staff accommodation, meeting rooms and upgraded accommodation for 27 people in nine triple -bedded bedrooms available outside the summer season. =Campsite= Campsite entrance The campsite can accommodate up to 1,400 persons on more than 60 different sites. On average during the summer, the site has around 750 guests at a time. While close to other groups, each group can be sure of their own campsite, ensuring both an international atmosphere and privacy. The sites have running water nearby and there are toilets and showers with hot water close at hand, which the visiting groups help to look after during their stay. There is a shop open on the campsite during the summer and a campsite office that is open most of the time. There is also a drying room and multiple picnic and barbecue facilities. The campsite was originally wasteland from the construction of the tunnel, so several sites are rocky. The railway runs close to some of the sites, so it can be noisy at times. =Four buildings= View from the Ueschinen hut The Tower was originally the power station when the railway was built and now has two parts: the tower itself and the L√∂tschberghaus (sleeping building). In total there is accommodation for 57 people - four rooms with 12 beds in the L√∂tschberghaus and a newly renovated room with nine beds in the tower. Facilities include full toilet and shower facilities for boys and girls, a fully equipped electric kitchen and a big living room with an open fireplace and balcony. On the other side of the river Kander is the Kander Lodge, facing the Chalet. It has eighteen simple 2-bed rooms with shared bathrooms. The building has a kitchen, dining room, living room and meeting room. The building was originally erected in the nearby village of Mitholz, and in recent decades used as office and exhibition space for the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel. In 2008, after the tunnel was opened, the lodge was moved from Mitholz to its current site in Kandersteg. Purchased in 2009, the Sunneblick is an old chalet with the same history as the Old Chalet and the Kander-Lodge. Originally it was an accommodation building for workers on the train tunnel in Frutigen. In the first quarter of the 20th century, it was moved from Frutigen to Kandersteg, to be the direct neighbour of the Old Chalet. The Sunneblick has 47 beds, a dining/play/meeting room, a fully equipped kitchen and a sitting room. It is available for use by a single group or can be rented as individual rooms. The Ueschinen Hut is situated in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890 metres, and about two to three hours' walk away from the centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, so sometimes it is a bit noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with wood stove, a general living and eating room and a special toilet ‚Äì there is no electricity and no shower. Camps and activities The site has a history of camps, starting with the 50th Gilwell Scout course, organized in 1926, and the 1st World Scout Moot with 2,500 Rover Scouts from 23 countries in 1931. After the war, in 1953, the 5th World Scout Moot was back in Kandersteg with 4,000 Rovers from 22 countries, and in 1992 again the 9th World Scout Moot saw nearly 2,500 people from over 50 countries. In 1979, the site hosted Camp Kristall, with 1,700 Scouts from 42 countries. The camp was one of those that replaced the cancelled 15th World Scout Jamboree that year. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Transatlantic Council of the Boy Scouts of America used Kandersteg for annual and even more frequent camps. In 2007, the centre played host to KanderJam, 'The Alpine Link to the 21st World Scout Jamboree', which brought over 2,000 people from all over the world in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Scouting. The year after that, in 2008, the centre ran the first ever World Scout Winter Games. The activity programme offered by the Centre is based on three themes of International Friendship, High Adventure and Eco Adventure, designed to help guests learn, develop and have much fun. In the summer they offer, within the three themes, a fixed weekly in-camp programme including International Campfire, Pioneering Competition and BBQ, as well as a wide range of daily activities such as trails, nature workshops, hiking, rock climbing, crafts, mountain biking, paragliding, river rafting and trips to various parts of Switzerland. In the winter, the programme offers a range of alpine snow activities such as downhill or cross country skiing and snowboarding. There are also a variety of other activities in and around Kandersteg, like sledding, curling, ice skating, ice climbing and snow shoeing. Throughout the year, Kandersteg offers programme activities for groups. Options vary with season and exact time of the visit. By participating in the programme, guests can work towards the award that exists for each of the themes. These are designed to bring together guests of all ages, nationalities and cultures, while encouraging them to experience, learn about and appreciate the alpine environment. Staff Kandersteg Staff In 1973, Kurt Metz was appointed as the first full-time director, thanks to the support of Kenneth Macintosh and the US Foundation for International Scouting. Since then the staff team has grown and operates throughout the year with the directors being assisted by deputy directors and an international team of volunteer staff staying from three months to several years. Volunteer staff are recruited in various numbers according to the time of year to assist with the running of the centre's facilities and the programme offered. The following is a list of KISC Directors (their country) and the year they took up the role. * 1973: Kurt Metz (CH) * 1978: Michael M√ºrwald (AT) * 1982: Robert Agg (GB) * 1984: Marc Lombard (CH) * 1992: Aidan Jones (GB) * 1996: John Moffat (GB) * 2002: Miriam Hertzberg (NL) * 2005: Mark Knippenberg (NL) * 2011: Myriam Heidelberger (CH) * 2015: Felipe Marqueis (BR) * 2019: Jack Higgins (UK) Staff uniform colour used to change each year but from 1989 red became pink and never changed again. From then on the staff members were known as pinkies. As well as their pink T-shirts and sweatshirt, they also wear a neckerchief to represent their Scouting background.

The publication consists primarily of skateboard and music- related articles, photography, interviews and skatepark reviews. The magazine also maintains a website, which includes segments with names such as \\"Firing Line\\" and \\"Hall of Meat\\", an online store, a video collection, a radio show, and a forum for registered users. The company also owns and operates the Double Rock indoor skateboarding facility, and the San Francisco skateshop, 66 6th. History Thrasher was founded in 1981 by Fausto Vitello and Eric Swenson, primarily as a way to promote Independent Truck Company, their skateboard truck company. The magazine's first editor was Kevin Thatcher. In 1993, Jake Phelps was named editor of the magazine. Mofo became the second staff member, joining Thatcher in mid-1981. With him, he brought the punk- skater ethic to the world thru his photojournalism, changing the essence of Thrasher, and in turn changing the sub-culture of skateboarding forever. In 1999, the magazine sponsored a PlayStation game called Thrasher Presents Skate and Destroy. Vitello's son, Tony, took over as owner of the magazine after his father died of a heart attack in 2006 and Swenson committed suicide in 2011. On March 14, 2019 long time editor Jake Phelps died.

King of the Road  In 2003, Thrasher started the King of the Road (KOTR) skateboarding competition. In the KOTR contest, a group of pre-invited teams of professional skaters are each given a booklet containing a series of challenges. Points are awarded at the completion of each challenge. The teams compete at the same time over a two-week period, in which they travel across the U.S. to complete as many challenges as possible. KOTR has been held annually since its inception, with the exceptions of 2008 and 2009. In 2011, Thrasher and Converse hosted the competition in China, with the participation of the four biggest Chinese skateboard deck companies. Skate Rock Thrasher released a music compilation series titled \\"Skate Rock\\" under the High Speed Productions label. Skate Rock was conceptualized by Mofo. The first release was in 1983, with Volume One, and continued until Volume Eight in 1990. The series focused primarily on punk rock and thrash bands, and most of the bands were made up of skateboarders, including well known professionals and community stars such as Steve Caballero, Tony Alva, Bob Denike, Brian Brannon, Mofo, Pushead, Chuck Treece, and Claus Grabke. Of the seven volumes of Skate Rock, all volumes were produced as a cassette available through Thrasher Magazine. Some volumes were also available as vinyl records. =Volume 1= Label: High Speed Productions Released: 1983 Format: Cassette Genre: Rock Style: Punk * Los Olvidados - \\"Listen To You\\" * The Big Boys - \\"Red/Green\\" * Riot .303 - \\"Murder The Prime Minister\\" * Minus One - \\"Bored Of It\\" * The Faction - \\"A.U.K.\\" * Skoundrelz - \\"Exterminator\\" * Drunk Injuns - \\"Program\\" * J.F.A. - \\"Great Equalizer\\" * Riot .303 - \\"Skate Punx\\" * Minus One - \\"I Remember John\\" * Los Olvidados - \\"Don't Cry\\" * Minus One - \\"The Kids Don't Skate Here\\" * Skoundrelz - \\"Jimmy Closet\\" * Riot .303 - \\"Depression Session\\" * Drunk Injuns - \\"Your Mama\\" * Black Athletes - \\"Die Laughing\\" * The Faction - \\"Boredom Awaits\\" * Los Olvidados - \\"You're Dull\\" * Minus One - \\"Nick of Time\\" * Riot .303 - \\"Nightmares of Another Kind\\" * Drunk Injuns - \\"Pumpshank\\" =Volume Two: Blazing Wheels And Barking Trucks= Label: High Speed Productions Released: 1984 Format: LP Genre: Rock Style: Punk * McRad - Prevent This Tragedy * T.S.O.L. - Other Side * Big Boys - Lesson * Anvil Chorus - Blue Flames * The Faction - Friends And Enemies * Kingpins - Ready To Rip * Los Olvidados - Something New * Borscht - Bye-Bye * Free Beer - Pigs In Space * J.F.A. - Beach Blanket Bongout * J.F.A. - Johnny D * T.S.O.L. - In Time * Free Beer - Start the Ark * Tales of Terror - Gods from Outer Space * Ancestors: Gods Of Sound - Treasures of Mankind * Big Boys - Assault * McRad - Tomorrow's Headlines * Borscht - Enemy * Drunk Injuns - She Gots a Gun =Volume Three: Wild Riders Of Boards= Label: High Speed Productions Released: 1985 Format: Cassette/LP Genre: Rock Style: Punk, Thrasher, Hardcore * Slam - Wild Riders of Boards * Boneless Ones - The Keg Kept A Flowin * Christ on Parade - Don't Draft Me * Septic Death - Thaw (Cold War) * Slam - Jorden Den Ar Var * No Rules - The Fall * Christ on Parade - My Life * Beyond Possession - Skater's Life * Septic Death - Burial * Corrosion of Conformity - What?

This period in the South's history was marked by the economic growth of the region, largely due to its heavy reliance on slavery, and of its political influence on the U.S. federal government. It was also characterized by the rise of abolition and the gradual polarization of the country between abolitionists and supporters of slavery.  History  Slavery was introduced to the South early in its history during the colonial period due to the demand for free labor for the harvesting of crops. It would persist through the 17th and 18th centuries but it was not until the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in the 1790s that slavery grew very profitable and that the large plantation system developed. In the decade and half between the invention of the Gin and the passage of the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, an enormous increase in the slave trade occurred, furthering the slave system in the United States.  Economic structure  The antebellum South saw large expansions in agriculture while manufacturing growth remained relatively slow. The southern economy was characterized by a low level of capital accumulation (largely labor-based) and a shortage of liquid capital, which, when aggravated by the need to concentrate on a few staples, the pervasive anti-industrial and anti-urban ideology, and the reduction of southern banking, led to a South dependent on export trade. In contrast to the economies of the North and West, which relied primarily on their own domestic markets, because the southern domestic market consisted primarily of plantations, southern states imported sustenance commodities from the West and manufactured goods from the North. The plantation system can be seen as the factory system applied to agriculture, with a concentration of labor under skilled management. But while the industrial manufacturing-based labor economy of the North was driven by growing demand, maintenance of the plantation economic system depended upon usage of slave labor that was both abundant and cheap. The five major commodities of the southern agricultural economy were cotton, grain, tobacco, sugar, and rice, with the production of the leading cash crop, cotton, concentrated in the Deep South (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana). = Inefficiency of slave agriculture = The leading historian of the era was Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, who studied slavery not so much as a political issue between North and South but as a social and economic system. He focused on the large plantations that dominated the South. Phillips addressed the unprofitability of slave labor and slavery's ill effects on the southern economy. An example of pioneering comparative work was \\"A Jamaica Slave Plantation\\" (1914). His methods inspired the \\"Phillips school\\" of slavery studies between 1900 and 1950. Phillips argued that large-scale plantation slavery was inefficient and not progressive. It had reached its geographical limits by 1860 or so, and therefore eventually had to fade away (as happened in Brazil). In 1910, he argued in \\"The Decadence of the Plantation System\\" that slavery was an unprofitable relic that persisted because it produced social status, honor, and political power. \\"Most farmers in the South had small- to medium-sized farms with few slaves, but the large plantation owner's wealth, often reflected in the number of slaves they owned, afforded them considerable prestige and political power.\\" Phillips contended that masters treated slaves relatively well; his views on that issue were later sharply rejected by Kenneth M. Stampp. His conclusions about the economic decline of slavery were challenged in 1958 by Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer in a landmark study published in the Journal of Political Economy. Their arguments were further developed by Robert Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman, who argued in their 1974 book, Time on the Cross, that slavery was both efficient and profitable, as long as the price of cotton was high enough. In turn, Fogel and Engerman came under attack from other historians of slavery. = Effects of economy on social structure = As slavery began to displace indentured servitude as the principal supply of labor in the plantation systems of the South, the economic nature of the institution of slavery aided in the increased inequality of wealth seen in the antebellum South. The demand for slave labor and the U.S. ban on importing more slaves from Africa drove up prices for slaves, making it profitable for smaller farmers in older settled areas such as Virginia to sell their slaves further south and west. The actuarial risk, or the potential loss in investment of owning slaves from death, disability, etc. was much greater for small plantation owners. Accentuated by the rise in price of slaves seen just prior to the Civil War, the overall costs associated with owning slaves to the individual plantation owner led to the concentration of slave ownership seen at the eve of the Civil War.  Social structure  Much of the antebellum South was rural and, in line with the plantation system, largely agricultural. With the exception of New Orleans and Baltimore, the slave states had no large cities, and the urban population of the South could not compare to that of the Northeast or even that of the agrarian West. This led to a sharp division in class in the southern states between the landowning, \\"master\\" class, poor whites, and slaves, while in the northern and western states, much of the social spectrum was dominated by a wide range of different laboring classes. = Wealth inequality = The conclusion that, while both the North and the South were characterized by a high degree of inequality during the plantation era, the wealth distribution was much more unequal in the South than in the North arises from studies concerned with the equality of land, slave, and wealth distribution. For example, in certain states and counties, due to the concentration of landholding and slave holding, which were highly correlated, six percent of landowners ended up commanding one-third of the gross income and an even higher portion of the net income. The majority of landowners, who had smaller scale plantations, saw a disproportionately small portion in revenues generated by the slavery-driven plantation system. = Effects of social structure on economy = While the two largest classes in the South included land- and slave-owners and slaves, various strata of social classes existed within and between the two. In examining class relations and the banking system in the South, the economic exploitation of slave labor can be seen to arise from a need to maintain certain conditions for the existence of slavery and from a need for each of the remaining social strata to remain in status quo. In order to meet conditions where slavery may continue to exist, members of the master class (e.g. white, landowning, slave-owning) had to compete with other members of the master class to maximize the surplus labor extracted from slaves. Likewise, in order to remain within the same class, members of the master class (and each subsumed class below) must expand their claim on revenues derived from the slave labor surplus. Mercantilist underpinnings Mercantilist ideologies largely explain the rise of the plantation system in the United States. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under mercantilism, rulers of nations believed that the accumulation of wealth through a favorable balance of trade was the best way to ensure power. As a result, Several European nations began to colonize territories across the Atlantic to take advantage of their favorable eco and encourage exports. One example of England utilizing the American colonies for economic gain was tobacco. When tobacco was first discovered as a recreational substance, there was a widespread social backlash in England, spearheaded by King James himself. By the middle of the 17th century, however, Parliament had realized the revenue potential of tobacco and quickly changed its official moral stance towards its use. As a result, tobacco plantations sprung up across the American South in large numbers to support European demand. By 1670, more than half of all tobacco shipped to England was being re-exported to other countries throughout Europe at a premium. In similar ways Britain was able to profit from other American staple crops, such as cotton, rice, and indigo. As Russell Menard puts it, Britain's capitalizing on increased European demand for these crops \\"fueled the expansion of the American plantation colonies, transformed the Atlantic into an English inland sea, and led to the creation of the first British Empire.\\" Many claim that being a part of the British mercantilist system was in the best economic interest of the American colonies as well, as they would not have been able to survive as independent economic entities. Robert Haywood, in his article \\"Mercantilism and South Carolina Agriculture, 1700-1763\\", argues that \\"it was unthinkable that any trade could prosper in the straight-jacket of regimented and restricted international trade, without the guiding hand of a powerful protecting government.\\"Haywood, C. Robert. ‚ÄúMercantilism and South Carolina Agriculture, 1700-1763.‚Äù The South Carolina Historical Magazine, vol. 60, no. 1, 1959, pp. 15‚Äì27. https://www.jstor.org/stable/27566205. Adverse economic effects The plantation era, while it was in large part the source of the South's initial economic prosperity, was also the reason why the South lagged in productivity starting in the early-to-mid-19th century. Because the plantation system mainly required a large volume of unskilled labor, the South did not have the human capital to succeed when the plantation era was over. Ulrich Bonnell Phillips contends that the plantation \\"sadly restricted the opportunity of such men as were of better industrial quality than was required for the field gangs.\\" Essentially, men who would have been otherwise capable of performing other skilled jobs were nonetheless relegated to field work because of the nature of the system. According to the Goldin‚ÄìSokoloff hypothesis, in the South, the relative productivity of women and children was higher than in the North, since the relative abilities of a man, woman, or child to pick cotton or harvest tobacco are nearly the same. In the North, however, since the relative productivity of women and children was much lower, factory jobs became attractive, and there arose an abundant supply of labor to fuel the industrial boom. As a result of the misallocation of labor in the South, the system \\"hindered all diversification in southern industry, and kept the whole community in a state of commercial dependence upon the North.\\" See also * Reconstruction era * Deep South * New South, the post-Reconstruction Era economy and society in the Southern U.S. * Old South, the pre-Civil War economy and society in the Southern U.S. * Confederate States of America References Category:Economic history of the American Civil War Category:Eras of United States history Category:Historical regions in the United States Category:History of the United States (1849‚Äì1865) Category:History of the United States (1789‚Äì1849) Category:Plantations in the United States Category:History of the Southern United States ","title":"Antebellum South"},{"id":"2180374","text":"The .30 Kiraly-Crist√≥bal Carbine, also known as the San Crist√≥bal or Crist√≥bal Automatic Rifle was manufactured by the Dominican Republic‚Äôs Armer√≠a San Crist√≥bal Weapon Factory. Although called a carbine, the gun may be termed a submachine gun since it is identical to the Hungarian Danuvia 43M submachine gun. Both weapons were designed by Hungarian engineer P√°l Kir√°ly, who came to the Dominican Republic as an expatriate in 1948. The gun's name is a reference to the San Crist√≥bal Province, which is the birthplace of the late Dominican dictator, Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo. The Dominican Republic's military was the main user of this weapon although it was also exported to Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution. The Crist√≥bal had a wooden stock, 30-round bottom- mounted box magazine, and tubular receiver with a fixed cocking handle on the right-hand side. It used lever-delayed blowback for its operation. The original version was produced in 9√ó19mm Parabellum. The most typical version of the Crist√≥bal was made in .30 Carbine. Over 200,000 Crist√≥bals were made by the Armeria San Crist√≥bal from 1950 to 1966. After Trujillo‚Äôs assassination on May 31, 1961, the Dominican government decided not to maintain a local military industry and production was slowly wound down. By 1990, the Crist√≥bal was no longer a standard Dominican firearm, but continues to be used for basic training in the Dominican Republic's military schools. This carbine was used by Che Guevara during the Cuban Revolution.

It is named for Ferdinand Oechsle (1774‚Äì1852) and it is widely used in the German, Swiss and Luxembourgish wine-making industries. On the Oechsle scale, one degree Oechsle (¬∞ Oe) corresponds to one gram of the difference between the mass of one litre of must at 20 ¬∞C and 1 kg (the mass of 1 litre of water). For example, must with a specific mass of 1084 grams per litre has 84¬∞ Oe. Overview The mass difference between equivalent volumes of must and water is almost entirely due to the dissolved sugar in the must. Since the alcohol in wine is produced by fermentation of the sugar, the Oechsle scale is used to predict the maximal possible alcohol content of the finished wine. This measure is commonly used to select when to harvest grapes. In the vineyard, the must density is usually measured by using a refractometer by crushing a few grapes between the fingers and letting the must drip onto the glass prism of the refractometer. In countries using the Oechsle scale, the refractometer will be calibrated in Oechsle degrees, but this is an indirect reading, as the refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, and translates it into Oechsle or different wine must scales, based on their correlation to refractive index. Wine classification The Oechsle scale forms the basis of most of the German wine classification. In the highest quality category, Pr√§dikatswein (formerly known as Qualit√§tswein mit Pr√§dikat, QmP), the wine is assigned a Pr√§dikat based on the Oechsle reading of the must. The regulations set out minimum Oechsle readings for each Pr√§dikat, which depend on wine-growing regions and grape variety:Deutsches Weininstitut: Must weights , accessed on March 26, 2009 :Kabinett ‚Äì 67-82 ¬∞Oe :Sp√§tlese ‚Äì 76-90 ¬∞Oe :Auslese ‚Äì 83-100 ¬∞Oe :Beerenauslese and Eiswein ‚Äì 110‚Äì128¬∞ Oe (Eiswein is made by late harvesting grapes after they have frozen on the vine and not necessarily affected by noble rot, botrytis, which is the case with Beerenauslese) :Trockenbeerenauslese ‚Äì 150‚Äì154 ¬∞Oe (affected by botrytis) The sugar content indicated by the Oechsle scale only refers to the unfermented grape must, never to the finished wine. Other scales In Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (KMW) scale is used. The scale is divided into Klosterneuburger Zuckergrade (¬∞KMW), and very similar to the Oechsle scale (1¬∞ KMW =~ 5¬∞ Oe). However, the KMW measures the exact sugar content of the must. The Baum√© scale is occasionally used in FranceSince the exclusion of degree Baum√© from legal units in France by Decree No. 61-501 of 3 May 1961 relating to units of measurement and control of measuring instruments, the French regulation refers to sugars content expressed in grams per litre. and by U.S. brewers, and in the New World the Brix scale is used to describe the readings of a refractometer when measuring the sugar content of a given sample. Since a refractometer actually measures the refractive index of the grape must, it can be translated to many different scales (both related and unrelated to wine) based on their correlation to refractive index. Thus, all of these methods are similar and the differences are more cultural than significant, but all are equally valid ways to measure the density of grape must and other sugar-based liquids. The Normalizovan√Ω Mo≈°tomer (¬∞NM) measures kg of sugar in 100 l of must and is used in Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Part of the War of Jenkins' Ear, the battle was for the British fortifications of Fort Frederica and Fort St. Simons, with the strategic goal the sea routes and inland waters they controlled. With the victory, the Province of Georgia established undisputed claim to the island. It is now part of the U.S. state of Georgia. The British also won the Battle of Gully Hole Creek, which took place on the island the same day. Background James Oglethorpe led the colonization of Georgia for Great Britain and had chosen Savannah as the principal port for the new colony. In the 1730s, Spain and Great Britain were disputing control of the border between Georgia and La Florida, where the Spanish had several settlements and forts. Given a heightened threat of Spanish invasion, Oglethorpe sought to increase his southern defenses. Accompanied by rangers and two Native American guides, Oglethorpe picked St. Simons Island as the site for a new town and fort. In 1734, Oglethorpe convinced the Parliament and the colonial trustees to pay for a military garrison at the fort. The trustees also recruited a large group of colonists to settle St. Simons Island. The ships bearing the settlers and supplies arrived at Tybee Island early in 1736. From there, some went to the mainland while others traveled via periaguas (also known as pirogues) to St. Simons Island to found Frederica. The town and its fort were built on the elbow of the Frederica River to control approaches from both directions. In 1737, Oglethorpe returned to England to acquire more funding and permission to raise a regiment of soldiers; he gained Parliamentary approval for both. He was appointed commander-in-chief of all British forces (limited as they were) in the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia. Oglethorpe subsequently recruited a company of Scots from Inverness, to migrate with their families to settle at Darien (briefly named \\"New Inverness\\") on the mainland, at the mouth of the Altamaha River. The men formed a military unit known locally as the Highland Independent Company. Official British records list it as Oglethorpe's Regiment of Foot. It was ranked as 42nd Regiment of Foot (old) in 1747 and disbanded 29 May 1749.Swinson (1972), p.137 Two forts had been constructed about five miles apart on St. Simons Island. Between the two ran a road the width of one wagon, named Military Road. This served to supply the garrison at Fort Frederica and settlers in the nearby village from Fort St. Simons. The battles took place after a Spanish invasion of the island. They were part of the larger conflict known as the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739 to 1748). It derived its name from an incident in 1731. A Spanish boarding party had gone aboard a British brig Rebecca, off the Florida coast, and found that its captain Robert Jenkins was smuggling. The Spanish officer cut off one of Jenkins' ears for piracy. Parliament used the nearly forgotten incident to rally public opinion to their side in 1739, but the war was over trade and territorial competition between Britain and Spain. On October 30, 1739, Great Britain declared war on Spain. Invasion, battle, and aftermath Castillo de San Marcos - St. Augustine. Stronghold of Manuel de Montiano Spanish governor Don Manuel de Montiano commanded the invasion force, which by some estimates totaled between 4,500 and 5,000 men. Of that number, roughly 1,900 to 2,000 were ground assault troops. Oglethorpe's forces, consisting of regulars, militia, and native Indians, numbered fewer than 1,000. The garrison at Fort St. Simons resisted the invasion with cannonade but could not prevent the landing. On the 5 July 1742, Montiano landed nearly 1,900 men from 36 ships near Gascoigne Bluff, close to the Frederica River. Faced with a superior force, Oglethorpe decided to withdraw from Fort St. Simons before the Spanish could mount an assault. He ordered the small garrison to spike the guns and slight the fort (doing what damage they could), to deny the Spanish full use of the military asset. The Spanish took over the remains of the fort the following day, establishing it as their base on the island. =Battle of Gully Hole Creek= After landing troops and supplies, and consolidating their position at Fort St. Simons, the Spanish began to reconnoiter beyond their perimeter. They found the road between Fort St. Simons and Fort Frederica but assumed the narrow track was just a farm road. On 7 July the Spanish undertook a reconnaissance in force along the road with approximately 115 men under the command of Captain Sebastian Sanchez. Near Fort Frederica, Sanchez' column made contact with Oglethorpe's soldiers, under command of Noble Jones. The British routed the Spanish, killing or capturing nearly a third of their soldiers. Oglethorpe's forces advanced along Military Road toward Fort St. Simons in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. When Spanish prisoners revealed that a larger Spanish force was advancing from the opposite direction toward Frederica, Oglethorpe left to gather reinforcements. =Battle of Bloody Marsh= Glynn County, GA The British advance party, in pursuit of the defeated Spanish force, engaged in a skirmish, then fell back in face of advancing Spanish reinforcements. When the British reached a bend in the road, Lieutenants Southerland and Macoy ordered the column to stop. They took cover in a semi-circle shaped area around a clearing behind trees and palmettos, waiting for the advancing Spanish having taken cover in the dense forest. They watched as the Spanish broke rank, stacked arms and, taking out their kettles, prepared to cook dinner. The Spanish thought they were protected because they had the marsh on one side of them and the forest on the other. The British forces opened fire from behind the cover of trees and bushes, catching the Spanish off guard. They fired multiple volleys from behind the protection of dense forest. The attack killed roughly 200 Spaniards.Colonial America by Bonnie L. Lukes (Cengage Gale, Jan 4, 1999) page 105Colonial America, 1607-1763 by Harry M. Ward (Prentice Hall, 1991)The American Colonial Wars: a concise history, 1607-1775 Nathaniel Claiborne Hale, General Society of Colonial Wars (U.S.) Hale House, 1967 page 54 The ferocity of the fighting at Bloody Marsh was dramatic, and the battle took its name from the tradition that the marsh ran red with the blood of dead Spanish soldiers. The floor of the forest was strewn with the bodies of the dead and dying. A few Spanish officers attempted in vain to reform their ranks, but the Spanish soldiers and their allies fled, panic stricken, in multiple directions as they were hit with volley after volley of musket fire from behind the foliage. Barba was captured after being mortally wounded. The battle blunted the Spanish advance and ultimately proved decisive. Oglethorpe was credited with the victory, though he arrived at the scene after the fighting had ceased.A history of Georgia: from its first discovery by Europeans to the adoption of the present constitution by William Bacon Stevens page 189 Oglethorpe continued to press the Spanish, trying to dislodge them from the island. A few days later, approaching a Spanish settlement on the south side, he learned of a French man who had deserted the British and gone to the Spanish. Worried that the deserter might report how small the British force was, Oglethorpe spread out his drummers, to make them sound as if they were accompanying a larger force. He wrote to the deserter, addressing him as if he were a spy for the British, saying that the man just needed to continue his stories until Britain could send more men. The prisoner who was carrying the letter took it to the Spanish officers, as Oglethorpe had hoped, and the Spanish promptly executed the Frenchman. The timely arrival of British ships reinforced a misconception among the Spanish that British reinforcements were arriving. The Spanish left St. Simons on 25 July, ending their last invasion of colonial Georgia.1943\\\\.

New York, NY: Ambrose Video Pub. =Aftermath= In the ensuing months, Oglethorpe considered counter-attacks against Florida, but circumstances were not favourable. The focus of the war had shifted from the Americas to Europe; arms, supplies and troops were not readily available. The region settled into an uneasy peace, occasionally punctuated by minor skirmishes. Oglethorpe was later appointed brigadier general. About 1744 he left Georgia for Britain, where he married an heiress; he lived in Britain the rest of his life. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war in 1748 and recognised the status of Georgia as a British colony, formally ratified by Spain in the subsequent Treaty of Madrid. Its position was further secured in 1763 when Spain ceded Florida to Britain in an exchange of territory under the Treaty of Paris ending the Seven Years' War.

Early life and career Huston was born in Kentucky. He was a slave trader, planter, Whig politician, and attorney in Natchez, Mississippi. Receiving news of the Texas Revolution, he raised and equipped troops (often at his own expense) and money throughout Mississippi and Kentucky. Move to Texas He left Natchez on May 5, 1836, with 500 to 700 volunteers to join the Texian army, but arrived well after the Battle of San Jacinto in which Mexican President General Santa Anna ceded defeat and, in effect, granted Texas her independence. =Militia commander= On June 25, Texas President David G. Burnet appointed Major General Mirabeau B. Lamar as secretary of war, to succeed the resigning Thomas J. Rusk. Texas received word that Mexico had rejected the Treaty of Velasco and had sent General Jos√© de Urrea to attack Goliad, Rusk immediately rescinded his resignation. Huston and Thomas Jefferson Green teamed up to get the army to oppose Lamar, and Rusk resumed command. However, the Mexican attack failed to materialize, and Rusk retired. The Texan army picked Huston to replace him. Discontent continued and army officers openly defied the government and threatened to impose a military dictatorship.Joseph Milton Nance, \\"REPUBLIC OF TEXAS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzr02), accessed May 15, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. =Army commander= On December 20, 1836, Sam Houston commissioned Huston as a brigadier general in the 2,000-man army and temporary commander-in-chief. His men referred to him as \\"Old Long Shanks\\" or \\"Old Leather Breeches\\", and Huston attracted adventurers and men of little discipline to his \\"Camp Independence\\" in Jackson County. He feared San Antonio could not be defended in the event of another Mexican invasion, and ordered the town and the nearby Alamo to be burned.Thomas W. Cutrer, \\"HUSTON, FELIX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhu46), accessed May 15, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. However, Juan Segu√≠n intervened, and the town and historic mission were spared from destruction. Later in the year, Sam Houston appointed Albert Sidney Johnston as the senior brigadier general and permanent commander of the Texan army. Huston felt slighted, and challenged Johnston to a duel on February 5, 1837, wounding him in the right hip. In November 1839, Huston was elected as major general of the militia, defeating James C. Neill and other candidates. He developed an aggressive scheme to capture Matamoros, Tamaulipas, in 1840, believing that Texas should expand its borders southward beyond the Rio Grande. However, his desires were thwarted by moderates. =Indian wars= In August, war chief Little Buffalo Hump and 500 Comanche Indians attacked Victoria, Texas, and other nearby towns, stealing horses and livestock and killing dozens of white settlers. Huston led 200 Texans and Chief Placido and his Tonkawa scouts against the raiders at Plum Creek near Lockhart on the evening of August 11, killing 80 Comanches while only losing one man.Thomas F. Schilz, \\"PLACIDO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpl01), accessed May 15, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. =Decommission= In May 1837, President Sam Houston furloughed much of the Texas army, leaving Huston a general without troops to command. Shortly after the Battle of Plum Creek, Huston left Texas and co-founded a law firm in New Orleans. In 1844, he supported a movement to annex the republic to the United States. However, by the late 1850s, Huston had become an ardent secessionist. In 1851, he spoke at a rally in New Orleans supporting Cuban independence from Spain.

He hypothesized in 1994 about a superpowerful type of hurricane which could be formed if average sea surface temperature increased another 15C more than it's ever been (see \\"hypercane\\"). In a March 2008 paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, he put forward the conclusion that global warming is likely to increase the intensity but decrease the frequency of hurricane and cyclone activity. Gabriel Vecchi, of NOAA said of Emanuel's announcement, \\"While his results don't rule out the possibility that global warming has contributed to the recent increase in activity in the Atlantic, they suggest that other factors‚Äîpossibly in addition to global warming‚Äîare likely to have been substantial contributors to the observed increase in activity.\\" Along with Daniel H.

In addition to working as a journalist in 1978, Ngeze allegedly also earned money as a bus driver. By 1990, he was without training or experience in journalism. =Kangura, the \\"Hutu Ten Commandments\\" and RTLM= Ngeze was the Editor-in- Chief of the bimonthly Kangura magazine, which was initially intended as a counterweight to the popular anti-government newspaper Kanguka, and was financed by high-level members in the ruling MRND party of Hutu dictator Juv√©nal Habyarimana. Ngeze and his magazine had extensive links to the Akazu, the network of officials surrounding the President and his wife; this group included supporters of Hutu Power and the architects of the Rwandan genocide. In December 1990, Ngeze published the Hutu Ten Commandments (sometimes called the Ten Commandments of the Bahutu) in Kangura, which made disparaging remarks about Tutsis in general and Tutsi women in particular.Hutu Ten Commandments With the Hutu Ten Commandments, Ngeze revived, revised, and reconciled the Hamitic myth (Tutsis were considered by the Europeans to be a \\"Hamitic race\\" superior to the \\"Negroid\\" populations of Sub-Saharan Africa based on their having more Caucasoid facial features; that is, the idea that the Tutsis were foreign invaders and thus should not be part of the Hutu-majority country) and the rhetoric of the Hutu revolution to promote a doctrine of militant Hutu purity. The \\"Hutu Ten Commandments\\" were essential in creating and spreading the anti-Tutsi feeling among Rwandan Hutus that led to the Rwandan genocide. In 1993, Ngeze became a shareholder and correspondent for the newly founded Radio T√©l√©vision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), which was largely a radio equivalent of Kangura. He was interviewed approximately eight times on RTLM. = Genocide = During the Rwandan genocide, Ngeze provided RTLM with names of people to be killed in his prefecture,International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Summary of Judgment which were broadcast on air. He was interviewed by RTLM and Radio Rwanda several times between April and June 1994, and in these broadcasts called for the extermination of the Tutsis and Hutus in opposition to the government. At the same time, Kangura published lists of people to be eliminated by the military and the Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militias during the genocide. Ngeze is alleged to have personally supervised and taken part in torture, mass rape, and killings in his native Gisenyi Prefecture. He was also an organizer of the Impuzamugambi militia. =Trial and imprisonment= Ngeze fled Rwanda in June 1994 as the country fell to the RPF. He was arrested in Mombasa, Kenya on July 18, 1997, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2003, by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In 2007, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR reversed some of his convictions, but confirmed others. It also changed his life sentence to one of 35 years' imprisonment. The charges of \\"aiding and abetting the commission of genocide in Gisenyi prefecture; direct and public incitement to commit genocide through the publication of articles in his Kangura newspaper in 1994; aiding and abetting extermination as a crime against humanity in Gisenyi prefecture\\" were upheld. On 3 December 2008 he was sent to Mali to serve his sentence of imprisonment.

The band started in 2001 as a trio, composed of Marco Visconti, Marko Resurreccion, and singer Paul Toohill. History The group self-released an album, Forgive on MP3.com. When they signed to the Polish label Black Flames Records, their album was released as Forgive[n] in May 2004. An EP of new material, RE_Productions, was released five months later. In 2005, the band released their second album, Hrs:Min:Sec, on the German label Infacted Recordings. Toohill left the band in 2007, to work on his solo project, Generator. He is also the main singer for a Nitzer Ebb tribute band called \\"Muscle And Hate\\". Their third album, The Art of Revenge, was released in January 2008 on Infacted. It was also licensed to Sigsaly Transmissions for North America and Gravitator Records for Russia the same year. A music video, the band's first, was produced for the album's title track. Over the years, the band played all over Europe, from their native Italy to Russia, as well as performing at festivals like Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. In 2008, XP8 also reached US shores for the first time with their live show, supporting System Syn on a one-month promotional tour. The following year they played at the Kinetik Festival in Canada, and begun working on their fourth studio album Drop The Mask, which was released in early 2010 once again by Infacted Recordings, with the digital-only Want It coming up just a few months before. Straying away from a pure dancefloor sound, the band experimented also with different approaches to electronica, and the album immediately received good praises by the press, consecrating it as the most mature XP8 release to date. Soon afterwards the album was licensed to Metropolis Records for a North American released and peaked at number 1 on the label's mailorder a week before its street date, while a limited digipack edition with a bonus CD was released in Japan by Deathwatch Asia. XP8 is also well known for their remixes, having reworked tracks of several other bands, including Steve Aoki, Attrition, Mortiis, and Icon of Coil, and countless others. In 2013, XP8 released the crowd-funded concept album Adrenochrome, which they described as their best effort to date, without any record label support. Everything came to a grinding halt in 2014 when the band decided to disband, quoting various reasons for this decision, among them the dwindling interest in alternative/industrial dance music, a trend that had a long run for almost two decades but that eventually ran dry. In an interview, Visconti also stated that ‚Äú[...] no one wants to be the old guy in a room full of kids looking at you like a dinosaur: I remember vividly making fun of those old goths that simply didn‚Äôt want to get the fuck out of MY clubs a decade ago, and the last thing I wanted to become was one of them.‚Äù \\\\- clearly pointing out the necessity to make space for a younger generation to make things vital and vibrant once again. Before disbanding, XP8 released a series of 3 EPs over a period of 9 months, each released tied to one of the phases of the Alchemical process: the three releases went on to be praised as the band's best material by critics and fans alike, proving how the Italian duo left a mark on the industrial scene for years and years to come. Steven Gullotta at Brutal Resonance stated that \\"XP8 may be dead, but their music will forever hold a place within my soul\\", giving the band a good send off.

Although his novels are more studied by academics now than by general readers, Jones occupies an honourable place in the history of left- wing politics in Britain, and in the ranks of socialist writers. Like many young activists of his generation he attended the Central Labour College in London from 1923‚Äì25, where he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the 1926 General Strike he was imprisoned for three months in Swansea Prison for his trade union activities in the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Once back at the pits, he became chairman and then checkweighman of the Cambrian Lodge of the South Wales Miners Federation. Although often seen as a lesser post to that of Lodge Chairman, in a time of industrial unrest the checkweighman was a vital part of the miners' protection against employers using piece work rules to drive down wages, and it was a role in which Jones was likely to routinely come into conflict with management. In 1929, he resigned, refusing to work with 'scab' (non-unionised) labour. He remained unemployed for the rest of his life, although, he was likely to be permanently busy on political business. He was extremely popular amongst the rank-and-file Party members, but his association with \\"Hornerism\\" (Communists working within established trades unions), his turbulent private life and his distrust of the cult of personality (he was sent home from the Soviet Union for ignoring a standing ovation to Joseph Stalin) meant that he was repeatedly suspended and disciplined by the Party. As the Welsh organiser for the National Unemployed Workers Movement, widely regarded as a Communist front, he led the 1932, 1934 and 1936 hunger marches to London. Also in 1936, he was elected as one of the two Communist members on to the Glamorgan County Council. In South Wales at this time his attachment to the Communist Party would not have harmed his reputation as a political activist and leader. Lewis Jones died on 27 January 1939 at the end of a day in which he addressed over 30 meetings in support of the republican side of the Spanish Civil War.Hopkins (1975), pg70. He is buried at Trealaw Cemetery in Trealaw. His books provide a description of life in a Welsh mining community of their time; there is an awareness of the crisis of masculinity that mass unemployment brought home to those communities, and the description of workers in struggle with their employers is unflinching in its acknowledgement of defeat as well as victory.

He was a founding member of the Cos Cob Art Colony and the Greenwich Society of Artists.  Biography and career  He was born in Zonnemaire, Netherlands as the son of a decorative painter. His family moved to Albany, New York in 1866. Starting at a young age, Ochtman worked as a draftsman at a wood-working firm in Albany. In 1879, Ochtman moved from Albany to New York City where he roomed with fellow painter, Charles Warren Eaton. In New York City, Ochtman worked with a group of artists who were important in the development of the impressionist movement in the United States. Although he took classes at the Art Students League of New York in 1879, he was primarily self-taught. For several years Ochtman's studio in New York City was located in the same building as that of George Inness, the dean of the Tonalism movement, and the two painters admired each other's work. In 1882 he began to exhibit landscapes at the National Academy of Design. He traveled to Europe in 1886, where he was influenced by the Dutch Hague School painters Jacob Maris and Anton Mauve. He returned to New York in 1887. He became a National Academician in 1904. His most characteristic pictures are scenes on Long Island Sound and the Connecticut countryside. Ochtman and his wife, the accomplished American Impressionist painter Mina Fonda Ochtman (1862‚Äì1924), moved to Mianus, Connecticut in 1891, where they became founding members of the Cos Cob Art Colony. Other members of the colony included John Henry Twachtman, Childe Hassam, Julian Alden Weir, Elmer Livingston MacRae, and Theodore Robinson. From Grayledge, the house that he built overlooking the Mianus River, Ochtman instructed younger artists boarding at the nearby Bush- Holley House. In 1910 and 1911, Ochtman held classes for the New York Summer School at Grayledge. Ochtman's students included Clark Voorhees and Harriet Randall Lumis. In 1912, Ochtman and his friend, the sculptor Edward Clark Potter, formed the Greenwich Society of Artists and the Bruce Museum. Ochtman served as the first vice president of the society in 1912, and President of the society from 1916‚Äì1932, and as first art curator of the Bruce Museum. Ochtman's daughter, Dorothy Ochtman (1892‚Äì1971), studied under her two artist parents and became an accomplished painter of still lifes.

Many of these channels share common programs. Rogers TV broadcasts in the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario. Rogers TV is available only in communities served by Rogers' cable and telecom division, and is not carried by other television service providers. Its French counterpart is TV Rogers. Rogers TV serves over 2.3 million cable subscribers. Programming on the channels is produced with the assistance of volunteers and community partners and associations, who assist, with the production and content of these programs. History Logo used from 2001-2008 Logo used from 2008-2016 Historically Rogers TV channels have been run as local public-access television channels; whereas some stations are still run as community access, most stations are run as community stations where production is done in-house with community involvement, or produced by local production studios that provide their shows to be aired by Rogers TV. In April 2008, the company re- branded itself from Rogers Television to the simpler Rogers TV (TV Rogers for the French-language stations). As with most re-branding initiatives, it included a new logo (seen to the side), a revamped website, on-air graphics elements and new paint schemes for the network's large fleet of production vehicles. Some media critics speculated that the name change was done to bring the cable channels into line with the rest of Rogers Communications' media properties, notably Omni Television and the Citytv network.Rob Salem, Hot Box: TV worth talking about. Toronto Star, April 11, 2008. In 2017 Rogers TV stations in the Greater Toronto Area closed as part of budget reallocations; this came in response to new CRTC regulations, allowing companies that co-own broadcast stations and cable providers in a metropolitan market to divert the mandatory funding for community channels to support local news operations for their broadcast stations. Programming This programming was created in response to older Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations which previouslyRequirement removed following Public Notice CRTC 1997-25 required that cable companies produce content reflecting the local community. Rogers TV annually receives applications from the community for new shows, and are reviewed by individual station managers and producers to access which programs can be produced with given production capabilities, likelihood of sponsorship, willingness of community involvement, and uniqueness of programming as major considerations.June 2006 presentation to Moncton, NB City Council And because of CRTC requirements, the majority of the programs are produced in the local region of the station, while others are produced in neighbouring studios. Some programs feature local journalists from radio, print and TV media. The programs are occasionally derivative of mainstream commercial fare with emphasis on the communities the stations are in. =New Brunswick= In New Brunswick, Rogers TV operates nine distinct community channels. Rogers offers French-language community channels (TV Rogers) in Edmundston, Bathurst, the Acadian Peninsula and Moncton, as well as English-language community channels in Fredericton, Saint John, Moncton, Miramichi and Bathurst. The programming shown on Rogers TV channels is a mix of access programming produced by the general public, and licensee programming originating from Rogers staff. Topics include political programming, sports coverage, live bingo shows, entertainment series, election coverage, telethons, municipal council coverage, documentaries and specials. Notable examples of past successes include Acadieman ‚Äì the world‚Äôs first animated Acadian superhero; the Afternoon News with Tom Young ‚Äì a simulcast of the popular Rogers Radio show; 2 Bon‚ÄôHeures ‚Äì the region‚Äôs only early-morning French-language studio talk show; and First Local ‚Äì a live, daily 15 minute news show with stories from around the province. Cable companies have been offering community channels in New Brunswick for 40 years. Fundy Cable started setting up community channels in Saint John and Edmundston in the early 1970s. Shaw Cable acquired the New Brunswick cable licenses from Fundy Cable in 1998. Rogers TV in New Brunswick was formerly known as TVNB, a group of local community programming stations that became in 1998 the first provincial programming network in Canada not owned by a provincial government. Rogers and Shaw exchanged assets in the year 2000, and the stations were re-branded to Rogers Television shortly thereafter. =Newfoundland and Labrador= * Originally cable systems in St. John's (Avalon Cablevision), Gander (Omni Cablevision), Grand Falls-Windsor (Central Cable) & Corner Brook (Shellbird Cable) became part of the new Cable Atlantic cable system in 1990, which was sold to Rogers Cable in 2000. * Local talk shows focused on community events air in St. John's (Out of the Fog), Gander (Skyways) and Grand Falls-Windsor (Exploits Central) and Corner Brook (Corner Brook Cafe). * Jason Peircey, Mellissa Royal and Don-E-Coady host the show (Out OF The Fog) in St. John's. * Kathryn Musseau hosts the show (Exploits Central) in Grand Falls-Windsor. * Wendy Woodland is the host of (Corner Brook Cafe) in Corner Brook. * Gina Brown is currently the host for Gander's local program, (Skyways). * Programming in Channel-Port aux Basques is limited to Community Billboard. * There is also some programming seen on all Newfoundland systems, such as One Chef One Critic (produced in St. John's), hosted by Central Dairies chef Steve Watson and The Telegram food critic (and former CBNT weather personality) Karl Wells.

Wessem is a part of the municipality of Maasgouw. As of 2002, Wessem had a population of 1,750. History of Wessem Historical Wessem is more than a thousand years old. Little is known about the early history. The name sounds Frankish and excavation show that it was inhabited in pre-Roman times. It was inhabited in that time by the Eburones, a Belgic tribe based on north- eastern Gaul in the 1st century BC. Julius Caesar described them as being of Germanic origin. They are believed to have lived between the Meuse and Rhine rivers. Ambiorix, an Eburonian chief, is known for having led a rebellion against the Romans in 54 BC. Because of this rebellion the Eburones were all but exterminated by the Romans and their land was destroyed. They were replaced by the Tungri, a Germanic tribe that was Celticised but in villages on the other side of the river Meuse the Eburones continued to exist what would explain the fact that the Limburgs language spoken on the west bank of the river Meuse still has some traces of the old Celtic language spoken by the Eburones. The first written proof of Wessem's existence found, according to Baron Louis de Crassier in his DictionnaireCrassier, Louis de, Baron (1930-38) Dictionnaire historique du Limbourg n√©erlandais, de la p√©riode f√©odale √† nos jours is in a Charter of 946, when Emperor Otto I confirmed to the abbey of Gembloux, the possession in Wessem of a mill and a brewery. There was also a relationship with the abbey of St. Pantaleon in Cologne since bishop Bruno left all his assets, rights and possessions in the \\"hof Wessem\\" to the abbey in his last will and testament in 946. In 946 Wessem acquired the right to make their own coins, collect taxes and to choose a guardian and a mayor. In the 12th century BC, Wessem received full city rights and from then on suffered the same fate as so many small communities in Limburg. Through marriages, agreements, war and inheritancies and legacies, Wessem was owned by one noble family after another. For example, in 1219 Willem I van Horn acquired Wessem as a guardian. The reign of the van Horne's lasted until 1568 when Philips van Montmorency together with Lamoraal van Egmond were decapitated in Brussel by Spanish noblemen. In style with local customs at the time the executors received the victims' possessions and Wessem became Gelders. The Lords of Gelre en Gulick received all possessions of the Lords of Horne. Horn in contemporary Dutch and H√∂r in Limburgs, is still a small town very near to Wessem on the banks of the river Meusenad even the castle still exists and descendants of the noble family still live there. In this period Wessem was a small town with fortifications. It had its own courtroom and jurisdiction, and being the main town in the Land van Horne (The land of the Lords of Horne), it had jurisdiction over most of the other towns in the Land van Horne. In 1609 the confiscations granted to the lords of Gelre en Gulick expired. The princes of Chimay took possession of Wessem in 1620, a reign that would until the French Revolutionary Army arrived in 1790. Situated strategically on the banks of the busy river Meuse and on most main roads in Limburg, Wessem's economy boomed in the 17th century. It was an important centre for trade and shipping. Relics from that time can still be seen in the form of big warehouses and storage-barns. The old city centre is well preserved and show Wessem's riches in those days. The arrival of the French in 1790 preluded a harsh time for Wessem. The government and jurisdiction were changed at the will of the new rulers. The community had a love-hate relationship with the French Empire and flourished until in the years after the downfall of Emperor Napoleon I, Wessem became a part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, a status it still has nowadays with a short interval in the years 1830‚Äì1839, when it chose the side of the Belgians in their independence struggle against the deceitful Dutch. The Dutch occupied Wessem because of its strategic importance and Wessem became a part of the Netherlands. Wessem was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged with Heel.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\\", KNAW, 2006. All in all, Wessem had a very quiet history, which can be seen by walking through the old centre with a unique network of little streets paved with maaskeitjes (small square stones found in the river Meuse). A must-see in Wessem is the former city hall with Wessems main square. A mosaic of maaskeitjes shows the city-crest. The Roman church, built in 964, was destroyed by the Germans in 1914, but has been restored to its former glory. Wessem still has one of the best sjutterie (schutterij in Dutch, Sch√ºtzenverein in German), a club of riflemen, in the world and participate in the OLS (Old Limburgs rifleshooting-fair), a big, annual cultural event for Limburgian-people from every country where every Limburgian village sends a delegation, every year. In 2004 they won the OLS, and in 2005 they organised it. The table tennis club (Westa), the soccer club (R.K.S.V.W.) and the volleyball team (VC Maasdal) belong to the top in the Netherlands.
