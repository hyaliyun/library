In 1978 she obtained her certificate as an independent lawyer, also in Wuppertal. She moved to Cologne in 1979, and opened her lawyers office there.  Notable trials  She defended , a former editor of the feminist magazine EMMA, who was accused of having bought the clock which was used during the bombing of the Lufthansa office in Cologne by the Revolutionary Cells in 1986. During the trial, Lunnebach argued that the court could not prove that Strobl knew that the clock was going to be used in the bombing. Strobl was sentenced to five years imprisonment and released from prison in 1990. She was a lawyer in the so called Kurdish Trial in Düsseldorf, a large trial against members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which lasted from 1989 to 7 March 1994, costed about 70 Mio. DM. and almost 200 witnesses were called to testify. It was an exceptional trial for which the main hall was amplified in order to provide enough room for the expected seventy participants amongst prosecutors and lawyers of the defense and also for the translators needed for the trial. During the trial in Düsseldorf she was prosecuted for offending the presiding Judge Jörg Winfried Belker, but acquitted by a court in Cologne. She was again prosecuted and also fined for allegedly saying in court \\"And you are our Stasi\\". She appealed against the fine and was acquitted due to the invalidity of the courts protocol as evidence. It was the first time that a lawyer of the defense was prosecuted for an event happening in court, which was seen as an attempt to intimidate the lawyers of the defense by the prosecution. In 1991 she quit the defense at the Kurdish Trial in Düsseldorf as her client disappeared. She was also the lawyer of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) victims of the arson attack in Cologne in 2001 during the NSU Trial. During the trial, she criticized the state prosecution for obstructing the investigation of the NSU network and that it only viewed the NSU as a cell of three people.

Biography Hardi was born in Pati Regency, today in Central Java, on 23 May 1918. He received a bachelor's in law from Gadjah Mada University. He worked as a civil servant in Pati during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, and also for a period of time at the traditional law office. =Sukarno period= After the independence of Indonesia, Hardi began working at the economic department, and then the interior department until 1953. He worked around his hometown in Pati, assigned to Central Java and Yogyakarta. He also briefly studied in the United Kingdom under a government scholarship. He had joined the Indonesian National Party (PNI) in 1946, and for a year between 1953 and 1954 he served in the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council. He ran as a legislative candidate for the 1955 Indonesian legislative election and won a seat to represent PNI. Hardi was considered a rising star in politics after his election into the DPR. He was appointed as chairman of the PNI's faction within it. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the Djuanda Cabinet, being sworn in on 9 April 1957. During this term as Deputy Prime Minister, Hardi was responsible for negotiations (leading a delegation dubbed as the \\"Hardi Mission\\") with Darul Islam militias in Aceh, which resulted in the recognition of Aceh as a special region by the central government in May 1959. He stopped being a legislator in 1968. =New Order= Hardi remained a member of the People's Consultative Assembly until his resignation in 1970. Around this time, he was also removed from the PNI's leadership following a party congress in Semarang, and he later became a member of the Indonesian Democratic Party. Prior to his ousting, he was the party leadership committee's first chairman. He also became a member of the Supreme Advisory Council, and served as Ambassador to Vietnam between 1976 and 1979, for which he resigned from his advisory position. While during the 1970s it was common practice for the Suharto government to place military officers in ambassadorial posts, Vietnam was an exception, and Suharto apparently noted to Hardi that \\"he was not yet able to put a military or a career diplomat as an ambassador to Hanoi\\". His ambassadorship was during a period where the Indonesian government wanted Vietnam to both curb the flow of refugees from the country and withdraw troops from Cambodia, and during his tenure Vietnam agreed to the former request. Additionally, in 1976, when the Communist Party of Vietnam was about to hold a party congress, a diplomatic move by Hardi dissuaded the Vietnamese from inviting representatives from the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), who were then in exile in Beijing. The Vietnamese then took a dual-track policy regarding the PKI, i.e. that the Vietnamese Communist Party would recognize the PKI, but the Vietnamese state would not. The Vietnamese also wished to distance themselves from Beijing, and saw not inviting PKI as an opportunity to improve relations with Indonesia. Personal life Hardi was married to Lasmidjah Hardi. Hardi died on 23 April 1998 in Jakarta, shortly after his wife's death on 10 March that same year.

Turner also served in the Metropolitan Police at the Southall, Ealing and Acton Police Stations before transferring to the Territorial Support Group then emigrating to Australia. He joined the Western Australia Police who had been heavily recruiting officers from the United Kingdom and after serving in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia he moved across the border joining the Northern Territory Police. Mark served in the township of Katherine and several locations around Arnhem Land before being transferred to Darwin after an injury on duty for surgery to reconstruct a tendon in his left hand. In September 2019, Police Negotiators Mark Turner and Linda Farrand were awarded the National Police Bravery Award by the Police Federation of Australia for preventing a suicide on Darwin Esplanade. Later that month, Turner was preselected by the Labor Party to contest the electoral division of Blain at the 2020 Northern Territory general election in August. In November 2019, it was reported that there was an ongoing workers compensation process progressing with the Police, Fire & Emergency Services for worker's compensation of medical costs incurred from the aforementioned tendon ruptured in the line of duty resulting in Turner losing the use of his hand for a number of years whilst undergoing repeated surgery. At the 2020 election, Turner was elected as the member for Blain, which had previously been held by Territory Alliance leader and former Country Liberal Chief Minister Terry Mills. Turner led the field on the first count, and defeated the CLP candidate collecting about 38% of Mills' preferences despite both Mills and the CLP candidate putting him last on their how to vote cards. Turner made history becoming the first Labor member to hold the seat which had traditionally been regarded as a CLP stronghold winning the suburbs of Bellamack and Rosebery (in which he resides) along with the early voting centre and narrowly losing the suburb of Woodroffe.

Danielson, an American supporter of the far-right group Patriot Prayer, was shot dead after participating in \\"Trump 2020 Cruise Rally\\", a caravan of more than 100 cars and trucks that drove through Portland, Oregon, displaying banners and signs supporting President Donald Trump and clashing with participants in the local George Floyd protests. On September 3, 2020, Danielson's suspected killer, Michael Forest Reinoehl, an anti-fascist activist and antifa supporter, was shot and killed by U.S. Marshals and FBI agents near Lacey, Washington. Danielson's killing marked the first time in recent United States history that an antifa supporter was charged with homicide. Reinoehl's killing remains under investigation, with witnesses stating that officers opened fire without warning. President Donald Trump commended the U.S. Marshals for shooting Reinoehl and described his death as \\"retribution\\".  Background  In the weeks and months prior to the two killings, Portland was the site of significant protests against police brutality and racism in the United States, with confrontations between protesters and right-wing counter-protesters. Activists clashing in Portland have used paint balls, bear spray, fireworks and other objects. The Portland protests are part of the American and international protests that followed the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. On August 29, 2020, hundreds of Trump supporters took part in the \\"Trump 2020 Cruise Rally\\", a caravan of more than 100 cars and trucks displaying pro-Trump flags and signs which drove through downtown Portland. In some cases, the participants fired paintball guns and pepper spray at protesters, who responded by throwing things at the caravan. The rally was set up by Belarusian and Ukrainian immigrants residing in Idaho who used an assumed name to organize the activities on Facebook and other social media.  Aaron J. Danielson  Aaron Joseph Danielson (born September 4, 1980) was a resident of Portland. Danielson was born and raised in Spokane, Washington. He attended local schools including Shadle Park High School, dropping out during his senior year and then briefly working as a mover in Spokane. Danielson moved to Portland soon after and together with a friend established a successful small moving company that specialized in transporting heavy items such as safes, hot tubs, stoves and statues. He never married and did not have children. Danielson was a Christian, although his friends reported that he did not talk much about his religious beliefs. According to Portland Tribune articles published after his death, Danielson spent much of his free time with a racially mixed group of people in his neighborhood, and black friends spoke up for him. Danielson was characterized by those who knew him as neither a radical, nor a racist or fascist, although he could on occasion be politically provocative and was said to have had a long-standing penchant for conspiracy theories. Like Reinoehl, Danielson was drawn to the protests, heading into downtown Portland on his mountain board and posting videos of them almost every night. According to The Spokesman-Review, there were no reports or publicly-released videos of Danielson having been involved in any physical conflicts during the protests, apart from his killing. Danielson's parents said he blamed antifa for destruction in Portland and was convinced that the group was funded by someone who wanted America destroyed by civil war. Danielson's parents said he had always been a staunch Republican, but that more recently, especially since the start of the protests, they had noticed that his views had shifted, stating: \\"He started to get more and more concerned about government taking over, the U.N. coming in, China controlling everything. I mean, we started hearing about it. We hadn’t heard about it before that.\\" Danielson frequently texted them and sent them videos to watch. Danielson had also become a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, which his parents said they were unaware of. According to Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson, Danielson had been attending the group's rallies for about three years. Chandler Pappas, a fellow Patriot Prayer supporter who was with Danielson on the night he was killed, reportedly told Danielson's parents that their son's involvement had been limited and begun more recently, around nine months prior. Danielson was known within the group by the alias \\"Jay\\" and took part in the \\"Trump 2020 Cruise Rally\\", wearing a Patriot Prayer hat. He had volunteered to provide security for the rally. = Shooting of Danielson = Danielson was shot and killed at about 8:45 pm on August 29, near the intersection of Southwest 3rd Avenue and Alder Street in Portland. Reinoehl was identified as the shooter on social media within hours. A police affidavit requesting a warrant for Reinoehl's arrest, released after his death, included surveillance camera evidence showing that Reinoehl had spotted Danielson and Pappas and had hidden in a parking garage to let them pass, \\"reaching toward the pocket or pouch on his waistband.\\" When Danielson and Pappas crossed the road, Reinoehl, joined by an associate, followed them, with the shooting occurring moments later. Immediately prior to the shooting, someone was heard to shout \\"We've got a couple right here\\", followed first by a warning that Danielson was preparing to use a can of mace and then two gunshots. The actual shooting was not recorded by the surveillance camera, but it was captured on videos recorded by bystanders that circulated online. According to the police affidavit, Danielson had a loaded Glock pistol in a holster and was holding a can of bear spray and an expandable metal baton. Danielson's can of bear spray is believed to have been struck by the first bullet due to damage to the can and a gaseous cloud that erupted after the first shot was fired.Bernstein, Maxine (September 4, 2020). \\"Michael Reinoehl appeared to target right-wing demonstrator before fatal shooting in Portland, police say\\". The Oregonian. Retrieved September 23, 2020. The second bullet hit Danielson's upper right chest, killing him. In an interview with a freelance journalist that was aired by Vice, Reinoehl said he acted in self-defense as Danielson was about to stab another protester with a knife. However, no knife was found on Danielson. At a memorial held in a park in Vancouver, Washington, Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson urged mourners not to seek vengeance, saying: \\"I know that Jay would not want that. Jay wants us to stand up for what we believe in, and he does not want any more violence, guys.\\" Danielson's father, speaking to a reporter at home in Spokane County, expressed a wish for Democrats to \\"get together with the Republican side and put a stop to this violence. If I can lose the life of my son, they can sit down at a table and be civil to each other and start to work something out. I deserve that as a citizen.\\"  Michael Forest Reinoehl  Reinoehl, 48, lived in Clackamas, Oregon, a suburb of Portland, Oregon and had two children. Reinoehl had described himself as an anti-fascist activist and antifa supporter as well as a professional snowboarder and an Army veteran, although an Army spokesperson said there were no records indicating Reinoehl had served in the Army. When his snowboarding career waned, Reinoehl had worked as a construction contractor. Reinoehl had been estranged from his family in recent years and was reported to have been supporting himself through odd jobs carried out for friends. According to his sister, Reinoehl was deeply in debt, often giving relatives' addresses to evade responsibility. A snowboarding friend said that Reinoehl had been known for daredevil snowboard stunts in his youth, but that he had been struggling in recent years and had gone through a difficult divorce. Reinoehl's sister described him as \\"not very stable\\" to The New York Times and said that his involvement in the Portland protests \\"made him feel like his existence meant something again.\\" Reinoehl's social media accounts showed that he had been heavily involved in the protests for three months, helping to provide security. A protest leader said Reinoehl had been trained in de-escalation and was \\"excellent at that\\". Another local organizer described Reinoehl as a \\"guardian angel\\" for protesters. A protester who had become friends with Reinoehl said: \\"Nightly, he would break up fights.\\" Reinoehl's social media posts, which had previously been about scenes of snowboarding, nature and his children, focused almost exclusively on the protests in Portland from May 30 onward. Reinoehl was wanted for failing to appear in court for a June 2020 speed racing case. He had raced his 17-year-old son on Interstate 84 at up to 111 mph, with his 11-year-old daughter as a passenger in his car. The car also contained marijuana, pills, a kitten, a large dog and a loaded Glock pistol, for which Reinoehl did not have a license. Reinoehl was arrested for driving under the influence, reckless endangerment of a person and unlawful possession of a firearm. Reinoehl was arrested again in Portland on July 5 for having a loaded gun in public. According to NPR, citing information given by the district attorney's office and Portland Police, that case was still an ongoing investigation at the time of his death. Reinoehl was shot and wounded in Portland in July after he intervened in an altercation where one of the participants was armed. On August 7, according to police investigators, Reinoehl sent a text message to his teenage son saying, \\"Sell me the gun for a quarter pound of weed and $100 I'm getting tired of this shit I need a piece now.\\" In a June 2020 Instagram post that was characterized by The New York Times as \\"laced with violent messages\\", Reinoehl wrote that he was \\"100% ANTIFA all the way!\\"Baker, Mike; Golden, Hallie; Goldman, Adam (September 3, 2020). \\"Suspect in Fatal Portland Shooting Is Killed by Officers During Arrest\\". The New York Times. Retrieved September 23, 2020. In the same Instagram post, Reinoehl also wrote: \\"We truly have an opportunity right now to fix everything. But it will be a fight like no other! It will be a war and like all wars there will be casualties.\\" Reinoehl said he was prepared to fight \\"to change the course of humanity\\". In an interview aired by Vice Media, Reinoehl stated: \\"I felt that my life and other people around me's lives were in danger, and I felt like I had no choice but to do what I did. [...] They want to paint a picture of antifa having major involvement. A lot of people don't understand what antifa represents. And if you just look at the basic definition of it, it's just anti-fascist. And I am 100% anti-fascist. I'm not a member of antifa. I'm not a member of anything. Honestly, I hate to say it, but I see a civil war right around the corner. That shot felt like the beginning of a war.\\"Sailor, Craig. \\"Who was Michael Forest Reinoehl, Portland shooting suspect?\\" The News Tribune. Retrieved September 23, 2020. Reinoehl told Vice that he had not turned himself in after the shooting of Danielson because he feared that police were collaborating with right-wing protesters and that he might be killed in custody. Reinoehl told Vice that his home had been shot at and that he was being hunted. = Shooting of Reinoehl = Reinoehl was charged with second-degree murder and unlawful use of a weapon on Thursday September 3, 2020. He was shot and killed later that day by members of a federal law enforcement task force near Lacey, Washington, a suburb of Olympia, Washington, between 6:45 and 7:30 p.m. Members of the task force approached Reinoehl outside an apartment on a residential street as he attempted to enter his car. Lieutenant Ray Brady of the Sheriff's Department in Thurston County stated that four officers fired at Reinoehl outside an apartment after he drew a gun. Brady said he did not believe the involved officers used bodycams or vehicle dashboard cameras during the incident. According to a senior member of the United States Department of Justice, one member of the FBI and Marshals Service task force shot and killed Reinoehl after he drew a handgun during his arrest. No officers were hurt during the incident.  Initial witness reports  There were conflicting witness reports immediately after the event:Owen, Tess (September 4, 2020). \\"Police Don't Have Their Story Straight About the Killing of Michael Reinoehl\\". Vice News. Vice. Retrieved September 23, 2020. * One witness was reported as saying she saw Reinoehl fire first. However, according to another account, the same witness said she was not present when the shooting began. * Another witness told The New York Times that he saw two SUVs approach the area quickly around 6:45 p.m. and then heard gunshots over a period of one and a half minutes. He said that he saw a man next to a white pickup, walking backwards and appearing to hold a gun while officers fired at him. * Two witnesses working nearby were reported to have said that Reinoehl was in a car outside an apartment complex when two unmarked SUVs converged on Reinoehl's car. Reinoehl then got out of the car and fired 40 to 50 rounds from what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle at the SUVs before officers returned fire. One of the witnesses later said he and his coworker were misquoted and he was unsure whether Reinoehl had a weapon. * Another witness said he heard 30–40 gunshots and yet another witness said he heard 8–10. * On September 9, a resident of the apartment complex where Reinoehl had been staying who witnessed the shooting issued a statement through his attorney, saying that Reinoehl was walking towards his car, holding only a cellphone and eating a candy when officers arrived at the scene, and that officers opened fire without any verbal warning. He said that after officers began firing, Reinoehl tried to duck for cover behind his car, which was blocked in by police vehicles. The witness said Reinoehl never got into the car, nor did he ever see Reinoehl hold a weapon or reach for anything while he was being fired at.  Statements by officials  Law enforcement officials did not state that Reinoehl fired at them before they opened fire but only that he drew a weapon. On September 17, authorities said that Reinoehl was found to have been armed with a .380-caliber handgun. They further said that a spent shell casing of that caliber was found in Reinoehl's vehicle and that a .22-caliber AR-15-style rifle, with its serial number removed, was located in a bag on the vehicle's front seat. According to the official investigators, Reinoehl was first fired on as he was leaving the apartment building. Reinoehl then ran to his station wagon, but he was unable to drive off as the vehicle was boxed in. Reinoehl then attempted to run off and was fired on by officers again. A spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office investigating the shooting said that notwithstanding witness reports saying that Reinoehl had appeared to be holding a rifle, he did not believe Reinoehl had in fact brandished his rifle. Ballistics reports on the handgun would become available in two or three months' time. Witness video shows officers attempting to perform CPR on Reinoehl. The aftermath of the shooting was recorded on video and posted on the internet.  New York Times witness interviews  According to a report in The New York Times published on October 13, 2020, of 22 people who were near Reinoehl when he was shot, 21 told the Times they did not hear officers issue any commands or identify themselves prior to shooting. Five eyewitnesses said the officers began shooting immediately after arriving on the scene. None of the eyewitnesses interviewed by the Times stated that Reinoehl was holding a weapon. One eyewitness described protecting his eight-year-old child from the gunfire, which he assumed was the work of criminals until he saw the officers' clothing. Overall, four officers fired 37 times on Reinoehl, from rifles and handguns. One of the officers involved said he thought he saw Reinoehl raise a gun inside his vehicle before the first shots were fired, but two others stated they did not. Officers also gave differing statements on whether Reinoehl had pointed a weapon at them later in the street, with one saying he did, and others saying he had only appeared to be trying to \\"retrieve\\" a gun from his trouser pocket. An updated statement by the investigators said that officers found a gun in Reinoehl's pocket when they searched his body, and that his hand had been on it when he fell. As of October 2020, the Thurston County sheriff's department is conducting a criminal homicide investigation into Reinoehl's death.  Reactions  = Danielson's killing = Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's 2020 presidential candidate, released a statement on August 30, the day after the shooting, saying: \\"The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn this violence unequivocally. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same.\\" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, commented to Voice of America in an article published on September 1, when investigations were still ongoing, that if Reinoehl was implicated it would mark the first case in recent history of an antifa supporter being charged with homicide. Commenting in The Orange County Register on September 7, Levin said the incident was the \\"first known killing by an antifa supporter\\", describing it as \\"an outlier but also a bellwether. [...] You have a perfect storm in this country with a polarized population, a presidential election, a global pandemic that is frustrating and devastating people, and disinformation and conspiracy theories spreading on social media. The biggest threat is still, far-right white supremacist groups. But you also see that Facebook has become fertile soil for the mushrooming of small groups and lone actors.\\" Voice of America reported that Gary LaFree, chairman of the criminology department at the University of Maryland, said \\"the case could potentially be included in the university's Global Terrorism Database as the first act of terror linked to antifa\\", and Danielson's killing is referenced on the Anti-Defamation League's page on antifa, stating that it was \\"one suspected antifa-related murder\\". Shortly before Reinoehl's death was announced on September 3, President Donald Trump tweeted asking why Portland police had not arrested Danielson's \\"cold blooded killer\\", adding that \\"[e]verybody knows who this thug is. No wonder Portland is going to hell!\\" In a Facebook Live video broadcast on September 13, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Public Affairs Michael Caputo described the killing of Danielson as \\"a drill\\" for future political violence by the left. In the same broadcast, Caputo espoused several other baseless conspiracy theories about the left's \\"armed revolt\\" and left-wing \\"hit squads\\", saying he was experiencing a mental breakdown. = Reinoehl's killing = After Reinoehl's killing, hundreds of people protested outside a police station in Portland. A protest organizer who knew Reinoehl said: \\"If the cops want this to stop, how is coming out here and killing us helping? That's literally why we are out here. They aren't giving us a day in court and are shooting us before asking questions.\\" Attorney General William Barr described Reinoehl as a \\"violent agitator\\" and said \\"the tracking down of Reinoehl – a dangerous fugitive, admitted Antifa member, and suspected murderer – is a significant accomplishment in the ongoing effort to restore law and order to Portland and other cities.\\" Trump commended Marshals for \\"strength\\" and \\"bravery\\". On September 12, President Trump said that Reinoehl was \\"a violent criminal, and the U.S. Marshals killed him. And I will tell you something, that’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.\\" News sources described the statement as appearing to endorse extrajudicial killing. Trump referred to the matter again at a rally on October 15. He criticized Portland Police for letting days pass by without arresting Reinoehl, even though he had been quickly identified on social media, and then stated: \\"We sent in the U.S. Marshals. It took 15 minutes it was over. Fifteen minutes, it was over. We got him. They knew who he was. They didn't want to arrest him. Fifteen minutes, that ended.\\" Reinoehl's estranged sister told NPR she was both angry with her brother and sad at his death: \\"It's awful. This whole thing is awful. There's a lot of people out there who feel like violence is the only solution to fixing things now, people on both sides.\\"  See also  * George Floyd protests * Violence and controversies during the George Floyd protests  References   External links  * Affidavit submitted by Portland Police to the Oregon Circuit Court for Multnomah County, requesting an arrest warrant for Reinoehl and summarising the evidence against him (PDF format).

The new Nizari Imam was already engaged in negotiations with Hülegü as he was advancing toward his stronghold. The Mongols demanded the dismantling of all Nizari fortresses and submission of the Nizari Imam in person, but the Imam was trying to reach a compromise. After several days of fighting, the Imam and his family capitulated and were received well by Hülegü. Maymun-Diz was dismantled, and the Imam ordered his subordinates to surrender and dismantle their fortresses likewise. The capitulation of the symbolic stronghold of Alamut in particular marks the end of the Nizari state in Persia. Sources The siege has been described in details in Tarikh-i Jahangushay written by Ata-Malik Juvayni, a Persian historian and official who was a participant in the siege. It is also narrated in Rashid al-Din Hamadani's Jami' al-Tawarikh. The Chinese work History of Yuan has conflated the siege of Maymun-Diz with that of Girdkuh. Background Marching against Rudbar Hulegu and his army marching against the Nizari castles in 1256. Persian miniature from a manuscript of Jami al-Tawarikh Khurshah announced his willingness to submit to the Mongol rule to the nearest Mongol commander, noyan Yasur in Qazvin. Yasur replied that he should visit Hülegü's camp personally. Yasur later engaged in fighting against the Nizaris of Rudbar: on June 12, he was defeated in a battle on Mount Siyalan near Alamut, where the Nizari forces had been mustered. He then began a campaign of harassment against the Nizaris of Rudbar.Jami' al-Tawarikh As Hülegü reached Bistam, his army had enlarged into five tümens, and new commanders were added. Many of them were the relatives of Batu Khan. From the ulus of Jochi representing the Golden Horde came Quli (son of Orda), Balagha, and Tutar. Chagatai Khanate forces were under the prince Tegüder. A contingent of Oirat tribesmen also joined under Buqa Temür. No member of Ögedei's family is mentioned. Hülegü had with him a thousand squads of siege engineers (probably north Chinese, Khitan and Muslim) skilled in the use of mangonels and naphtha. The Nizari heartland: the regions Alamut and Rudbar The Mongols campaigned against the Nizari heartland of Alamut and Rudbar from three directions. The right wing, under Buqa Temür and Köke Ilgei, marched via Tabaristan. The left wing, under Tegüder and Kitbuqa, marched via Khuwar and Semnan. The center was under Hülegü himself. Meanwhile, Hülegü sent another warning to Khurshah. Khurshah was in the Maymun-Diz fortress and was apparently playing for time, because by resisting longer, the arrival of winter could have stopped the Mongols whose military was depended on available fodder for their horses. Khurshah sent his vizier Kayqubad who met the Mongols in Firuzkuh and offered the surrender of all strongholds except Alamut and Lambsar, and again asked for a year's delay for Khurshah to visit Hülegü in person. Meanwhile, as a show of good faith, Khurshah ordered Gerdkuh and fortresses of Quhistan to surrender, which their chiefs did, but the garrison of Gerdkuh continued to resist. The Mongols continued to advance and reached Lar, Damavand, and Shahdiz. Khurshah sent his 7- or 8-years-old son as a show of good faith, but he was sent back due to his young age. Khurshah then sent his second brother Shahanshah (Shahin Shah) who met Hülegü in Ray. However, Hülegü demanded Khurshah the dismantling of all of the Nizari fortresses to show his goodwill. Apparently, the Nizari Imam sought to at least keep the main Nizari strongholds, while the Mongols insisted on full submission. =The siege= On 8 November 1256, Hülegü set his camp on a hilltop facing Maymun- Diz and encircled the fortress with his forces by marching over the Alamut mountains via Taleqan valley and appearing at the foot of Maymun-Diz. Teams of hand-picked Mongol fighters were distributed at around intervals from the hilltop down to the valley. Maymun-Diz could have been attacked by mangonels; that was not the case with Alamut, Nevisar Shah, Lambsar and Gerdkuh, all of which were on top of high peaks. Nevertheless, the strength of the fortification impressed the Mongols, who surveyed them from various angles to find a weak point. The majority of the Mongol officers advised Hülegü to postpone the siege, but he decided to proceed. Preliminary bombardments were performed for three days by mangonels from a nearby hilltop with casualties on both sides. A direct Mongol assault on the fourth day was repulsed. The Mongols then used heavier siege engines hurling javelins dipped in burning pitch and set up additional mangonels all around the fortifications. Later that month, Kuhrshah sent a message offering his surrender on the condition of the immunity of him and his family. It was sent by Ata-Malik Juvayni personally brought Hülegü's jarlig (royal decree) to Khurshah to receive his signature, but Khurshah was hesitant. After several days, Hülegü began another bombardment and on November 19, Khurshah and his entourage descended from the fortress and capitulated. The full evacuation of the fortress continued until the next day. A small part of the garrison refused to leave the stronghold and fought in a last stand in the \\"qubba\\" (literally \\"domed structure\\"), supposedly a high domed building in the fortress; they were defeated and killed after three days. According to the History of Yuan, the Chinese general Guo Kan attacked the fortress by \\"catapults on mounts\\" (jiapao). \\"General Khwaja Nasir\\" (the scholar Nasir al-Din al-Tusi) then opened the gate and surrendered. The Nizaris' leadership decision to surrender was apparently influenced by al-Tusi and other outside scholars. He later entered Hulegu's entourage. An inexplicable aspect of the events for historians is that why the forces at Alamut made no effort to assist their besieged comrades in Maymun- Diz.

Career A member of the clan of Tujib, Hassan was a descendant of another Hassan ibn Atahiyah who had participated in the Islamic conquest of Egypt and been a companion of the Rashidun caliph Umar. His grandfather, Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan, had served as chief of police (sahib al-shurtah) of Egypt during the governorship of Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan (). In 745 Hassan was appointed governor of Egypt by the caliph Marwan ibn Muhammad as replacement for Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami. Arriving in the province in March, he initially attempted to disband the army units that had been raised by Hafs, but this measure was violently rejected by the soldiers and a mutiny quickly broke out. The soldiers declared that they would refuse to recognize any governor other than Hafs and placed Hassan under siege in his house, while others proceeded to the Mosque of Fustat and called for Marwan to be deposed from the caliphate. In the end, both Hassan and the local tax officer were forced to depart from the province and Hafs was restored to power, with Hassan having held the governorship for just sixteen days.; ; ; ; . This last author (ibid.) also claims that Hassan was governor during the reign of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, and furthermore () makes a (possibly corrupted) reference to his presence at the Battle of Bagdoura in 741. Following his expulsion from Egypt, Hassan made his way to Syria and reported to Marwan what had happened.; . According to al-Kindi, he later returned to Egypt and was appointed as sahib al-shurtah after Hafs and his supporters were purged by Hawtharah ibn Suhayl;. He may also have been appointed as interim governor after Hawtharah's departure from Egypt in 749; . Ibn Taghribirdi on the other hand claims that he remained at the Umayyad court until the time of the Abbasid Revolution. In any case, he fell victim to the revolution following the fall of the Umayyad house in 750; brought before the new governor Salih ibn Ali, he was flogged and subsequently turned over for execution.; ; ; .

She was lured to a 12th floor apartment in Kruševac by a group of young men who then tried to persuade her to have sex with them. To avoid shame, she jumped from the window of the apartment and fell onto the street. She died from the injures two days later, but gave the police full description of the incident before death. This event sparked an outrage across Yugoslavia and demonstrations against perpetrators were held in Kruševac. Media outlets gave large publicity to the case and public was unanimous in condemnation. Most commentators praised Kostić's bravery and heroic death. Five perpetrators (one of whom was a minor) were sentenced to prison. It is not known for sure how much time each of them spent in prison. It was reported that one of them, Tomislav Ž. Nikolić, was sentenced to 13 years and was released after 9½. Early life Milica Kostić was born on 24 April 1956 in Strojinci near Brus, Serbia (then part of SFR Yugoslavia) as the fourth child in the family of Milen and Slavka Kostić. After finishing elementary school, she enrolled in the Medical High School in Kruševac in 1971. While attending the high school, she was living in Kruševac with a roommate. Suicide On Monday, 2 September 1974 (first day of school), Kostić left her village and arrived in Kruševac around 7:15 AM. Since it was too early for school, she decided to take a walk. A group of five men (Miroslav Mađarac, Tomislav Ž. Nikolić, Zvonko Ivanović, Slavoljub Trifunović and a minor S.V.) assembled that day and decided to lure a girl into an apartment and force her to have sex with them. On the Main street, they saw Kostić walking and decided to approach her. Nikolić then approached her and asked her for help. He told Kostić that he wants to call his girlfriend to come out from her apartment with him, but that her parents are very rigid and would not let her go with him. So, he asked Kostić if she would come with him to his girlfriend's apartment pretending to be his girlfriend's colleague and ask her parents if she can come out. This was just a bait to lure her to the apartment. Nikolić took the girl to the apartment belonging to S.V. on the 12th floor of the nearby \\"Rubin\\" building. Other perpetrators waited nearby, and when they saw Nikolić coming with a girl, they rushed to the apartment before the two came in. One of the perpetrators disabled the doorbell and turned on loud music so that the neighbors would not here anything. When Nikolić and Kostić appeared on the door, one of the perpetrators opened the door and let her in. As soon as she stepped into the apartment, Nikolić locked the door behind her. They took her to the bedroom by force while she was screaming and resisting. Inside the bedroom, the five men told Kostić that they want to have sex with her and asked her to consent to their demands. When she refused, they tried, one by one, to persuade her. On of the men began to hesitate when he suspected she was still a virgin. Still, they continued to pressure her, but she continued refusing. At one moment, she was left alone in the room. She took the moment and jumped out from an open window. After falling for about 40m, she landed on an awning of a cafe, The awning then broke, and she fell onto a chair. The cafe guests took her to the hospital. She was admitted to the city hospital unconscious. In the hospital, she briefly regained consciousness and was questioned by the police inspector. She told him all the details of the incident and said that she jumped because she thought it was the only way for her to keep her honor. Soon she fell into a coma and died on Thursday, 4 September 1974. Aftermath Milica Nikolić was buried on 5 September in Strojinci. Thousands of people, including 400 of her fellow students, came to the funeral. All major newspapers in Yugoslavia including Politika and Večernje Novosti reported widely on this incident. The public was outraged. On Wednesday, 4 September, the police had to protect the five perpetrators from a lynching attempt. The public interest about the event was enormous. On 5 September, the high school students silently demonstrated in Kruševac against violence, wearing a large photo of Kostić at the head of the column. As the public unanimously condemned the violence, the death of Milica Kostić had a lasting impact on the both public and police reaction to violence. Police began to intensify preventive measures against youth violence. All five men were sentenced to prison, although it is not known for sure what were their sentences and how much time each of them spent in prison. According to some reports, Tomislav Ž. Nikolić was sentenced to 13 years and was released after 9½. The act of Milica Kostić was praised by many as brave and heroic. Glas Koncila, a Roman Catholic journal from Zagreb called her \\"Maria Goretti of Šumadija\\". An initiative was made in the Serbian Orthodox Church to canonize Kostić as a martyr. Although she has not been canonized yet, she appears on a fresco in the parish church in Ub as \\"Saint Milica of Kruševac\\". According to some reports, famous singer Zdravko Čolić dedicated his song \\"Ona spava\\" (\\"She's Asleep\\") to Kostić. In 2013, a controversy erupted when Nikolić, the main perpetrator of crime was elected member of the \\"Lazarica\\" local council in Kruševac. He is an activist of the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). When asked about the eligibility of Nikolić, then Minister of Defense and high ranking member of SNS, Bratislav Gašić told the press that Nikolić \\"has served his sentence and has all the rights to be elected as any other citizen\\".

The documents were signed by the Prime Minister of Kosovo Avdullah Hoti and the President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić on September 4, 2020 at the White House, in the presence of US President Donald Trump. Background Ministry of Economy of Serbia (sitting left), Richard Grenell, Special US Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations (standing right), Eset Berisha, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Kosovo (sitting right) On October 4, 2019, Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell as Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations. After months of diplomatic talks, on January 20, 2020, Grenell facilitated negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo where the two nations agreed to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades. A June 27, 2020 peace summit between the two sides was arranged to take place in Washington D.C., but was canceled due to the potential indictment of Hashim Thaçi on war crimes. A new summit, located at the White House, was organized by Grenell and scheduled for September 3 and 4, 2020. Grenell, along with Robert C. O'Brien, cohosted the talks. On September 4, the agreements were signed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Kosovo Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti. The signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office at the White House in the presence of US President Donald Trump on September 4, 2020. Two separate documents were signed, one by Vučić and the other by Hoti. The only difference between the two was the final clause regarding relations with Israel. Both documents were prefaced with a congratulatory note from Donald Trump. While participating in negotiations with the United States over economic issues, Kosovo and Serbia have continued to participate in a parallel dialogue led by the European Union that has focused on the political disagreements between the two sides. Agreements Under the terms of the agreements signed, for a period of one year, Serbia will suspend its efforts, both official and unofficial, encouraging other states to either not recognize Kosovo or to revoke existing recognition. In return, Kosovo will not apply for new membership in international organizations for the same time period. There are also commitments to find and identify remains of missing persons from the 1998–99 Kosovo conflict and to rehabilitate refugees from that conflict and from after the end of the war. Kosovo and Serbia agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study examining different options for connecting the Belgrade- Pristina rail network with a deep seaport on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Both sides agreed to work with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and Export–Import Bank of the United States on memorandums of understanding to operationalise the Peace Highway, the rail link between Pristina and Merdare, the rail link between Niš and Pristina, financing to small- and medium-sized enterprises and other projects. They will also operationalize the Merdare administrative crossing point on the border between the two nations. The United States promised both sides loans guaranteed by the U.S. government to fund the strategic infrastructure developments and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation will have full-time presence in Belgrade. Both sides will increase airline passenger screening, information sharing between each other within the framework of broader U.S. cooperation in the Balkans and commit to technology upgrades to combat illicit activities. They will also conduct a feasibility study with the U.S. Department of Energy concerning the sharing of the Gazivoda Lake/Ujmani Lake, as a reliable water and energy supply. As part of the agreements, Serbia and Kosovo both agreed to join the Mini Schengen Zone. Each side will recognize the diplomas and professional certificates from the other. Serbia agreed to move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in July 2021, and Israel and Kosovo agreed to a mutual recognition of each other and establishment of diplomatic relations. Kosovo also announced that they would locate their embassy in Jerusalem. In doing so, Serbia will become the first European, and Kosovo the first Muslim majority nation, to have embassies in Jerusalem. Each side will remove 5G equipment from their mobile networks provided by what was termed \\"untrusted vendors\\" from their mobile networks, and to prohibit such vendors from bidding in the future. Officials from Serbia and Kosovo said this was a reference to Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies. Both sides pledged to protect and promote freedom of religion, including renewed interfaith communication, protection of religious sites and implementation of court decisions regarding the Serbian Orthodox Church, continued restitution of Holocaust-era heirless and unclaimed Jewish property. The agreements also contain provisions where both Serbia and Kosovo designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and support the decriminalization of homosexuality around the world. Implementation On September 15, 2020, letters of interest were signed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and the Export–Import Bank of the United States with the governments of Kosovo and Serbia for financing the construction of a \\"Peace Highway\\" between Nis and Pristina.https://www.dfc.gov/media/press-releases/dfc-and-exim-sign-lois- serbia-and-kosovo-invest-peace-highway On September 21, 2020, Richard Grenell and Adam S.

The center-right block retained a reduced majority of seats, allowing the coalition of the largest right-wing parties, the Conservative Party (45 members) and the Progress Party (27 members) to continue under Erna Solberg. The Liberal Party (8 members) joined the coalition in January 2018 and the Christian Democratic Party (8 members) in 2019. The opposition consisted of the Labour Party (49 members), the Centre Party (19 members), the Socialist Left Party (11 members), the Green Party (1 member) and the Red Party (1 member). Members of the Parliament of Norway are elected based on party-list proportional representation in plural member constituencies. The representatives from different political parties were elected from 19 constituencies, which are identical to the 19 counties. The electorate did not vote for individuals but rather for party lists, with a ranked list of candidates nominated by the party. This means that the person on top of the list would get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot. Parties could nominate candidates from outside their own constituency, and even Norwegian citizens currently living abroad. The Sainte-Laguë method was used for allocating parliamentary seats to parties. As a result, the percentage of representatives was roughly equal to the nationwide percentage of votes. Conversely, if a party's initial representation in Parliament was proportionally less than its share of votes, the party might seat more representatives through leveling seats, provided that the nationwide percentage is above the election threshold, at 4 percent. Since 2005, nineteen seats in each parliament have been allocated via the leveling system. If a representative is unable to participate for whatever reason, his or her seat is filled by a candidate from the same party-list — in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during their term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (cabinet member) or state secretary, are replaced by a deputy until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also step in during short-term absences, like when a representative travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.

Plot summary The Runners are hired to break into a lab via a city sewer to steal data from Aztechnology. However, the Runners discover that the lab is over-run by mutagenic experiments, and a terrorist cell also wants the data. When the break-in goes awry, the Runners take shelter in the sewers underneath Tacoma, where they must negotiate with the Orks who live there.

Reception In the April-May 1990 edition of White Wolf (Issue #20), Stephan Wieck believed that the adventure, with its extended time in sewers, was more like a D&D; dungeon crawl than a modern cyberpunk data theft. He did admit that for players more used to AD&D; \\"The adventure's dungeon atmosphere will make the characters feel more at home while still introducing them to some aspects of Shadowrun.\\" He concluded by giving it a below-average rating of only 2 out of 5 overall.

She is remembered principally for fostering cultural exchanges between Sweden and Italy. Her novel I blindo (1908) about Swedes living in Italy is partly autobiographical. Biography Born on 31 March 1876 in Stockholm, Astrid Ahnfelt was the daughter of the journal editor Arvid Ahnfelt (1846–1890) and Hilda Runnerström (1844–1927), a businesswoman. Her grandfather, the cleric Paul Gabriel Ahnfelt (1803–1863), had also been active as a writer. Raised in literary circles, Ahnfelt associated with the writer Ellen Key who arranged for her to become a nanny for a Swedish family in Tuscany in 1897. A year later, she moved to Rome where she earned a living working as a cultural correspondent for Swedish newspapers and magazines, commenting on Italian authors including the Nobel prize-winning poet Giosue Carducci. Fluent in both Swedish and Italian, Ahnfelt began publishing books in 1902 with two short stories in Italian in La lacrima nel mare del dolore e La sposa della morte followed by Sagor och legender, a collection of short stories in Swedish in 1905. Her first novel, Nutidsungdom providing insights into Italy's young people, was published in Sweden the same year. Her novel I blindo (1908), also published in Sweden, received a mixed reception. Based on the lives of Swedes living in Italy, it is partly autobiographical. Contributing to the Swedish journal Idun, Ahnfelt provided accounts of the 1908 earthquake in Messina where she served as a nurse and helped the victims. In 1910, they were published in Italian as the book Foglie al vento. Around 1910, Ahnfelt gave birth to a son, Silvano Attico, but never revealed the name of his father. After a period in Florence during World War I, she moved to Naples where she worked in a library and at the Swedish consulate while publishing translations into Swedish. From the early 1930s, as a supporter of Mussolini, Ahnfelt experienced difficulty in having her works published in Sweden. She made a living as a proofreader for Il Giornale d'Italia. Ahnfelt died in Italy, probably in Rome, in 1962. Her son had previously died in a motorcycle accident.

Women's rights issues in Ohio were put into the public eye in the early 1850s. Women inspired by the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention created newspapers and then set up their own conventions, including the 1950 Ohio Women's Rights Convention which was the first women's right's convention outside of New York and the first that was planned and run solely by women. These early efforts towards women's suffrage affected people in other states and helped energize the women's suffrage movement in Ohio. Women's rights groups formed throughout the state, with the Ohio Women's Rights Association (OWRA) founded in 1853. Other local women's suffrage groups are formed in the late 1860s. In 1894, women won the right to vote in school board elections in Ohio. The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was headquartered for a time in Warren, Ohio. Two efforts to vote on a constitutional amendment, one in 1912 and the other 1914 were unsuccessful, but drew national attention to women's suffrage. In 1916, women in East Cleveland gained the right to vote in municipal elections. A year later, women in Lakewood, Ohio and Columbus were given the right to vote in municipal elections. Also in 1917, the Reynolds Bill, which would allow women to vote in the next presidential election was passed, and then quickly repealed by a voter referendum sponsored by special-interest groups. On June 16, 1919, Ohio became the fifth state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment.  Early efforts  Sojourner Truth postcard The Declaration of Rights and Sentiments created at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention inspired many women in Ohio to work towards women's rights. Elizabeth Bisbee of Columbus decided to create a women's suffrage newspaper, the Alliance after reading the Declaration. Heading into the early 1850s, there began to be considerable support for women's suffrage in Ohio. The first Ohio Women's Rights Convention took place in Salem, Ohio in April 1850. President of the convention was Betsey Mix Cowles. This convention, attended by around 500 people, was the first women's right's convention held outside of New York. It was also the first convention completely organized and run by women. Only women were allowed to speak or vote during the convention. Women said of the men attending the convention, \\"They then learned for the first time in the world's history how it felt to sit in silence when questions in which they were interested were being discussed.\\" Women at this convention published Address to the Women of Ohio. The effects of the convention were later felt as far west as Wyoming, where John Allen Campbell in 1869 signed the first bill granting equal women's suffrage in the United States. Campbell had attended the Salem conference as a young man. In 1851, a second Ohio Women's Rights Convention took place in Akron, Ohio with Frances Gage as president. Sojourner Truth was one of the speakers at the Akron convention, presenting a speech, \\"Ain't I A Woman?\\". Truth's words had a profound effect on the audience. One of the women who was inspired by Truth was Cleveland suffragist, Caroline Severance. At these conferences and at other women's rights meetings, Gage collected signatures to influence delegates to the 1850 Ohio Constitutional Convention to include women's suffrage. Many people also submitted petitions to the convention to allow voting \\"regardless of color or sex.\\" Thousands of signatures were collected and the debates at the Constitutional Convention were so heated, that the exact words were not kept in the official records of the proceedings. The delegates to the convention decided to only extend voting rights to white men and by a large majority voted against both women's suffrage and suffrage for African-American people. Only delegates from the Western Reserve area of Ohio favored giving the vote to African-Americans in the state. On May 27, 1852, a third Women's Rights Convention was held in Massillon, Ohio. The convention drew women from all over Ohio and from different social classes. Attendees of the convention decided to create the Ohio Woman's Rights Association (OWRA). OWRA met for the first time in Ravenna on May 25, 1853 with members from around the state. The group extended membership to any interested person and the first president was Severance. The group immediately began working on a petition to present to the Ohio Legislature requesting women's suffrage. On April 1, 1854, Severance brought the petition to the Ohio Senate. Cleveland held the fourth National Women's Rights Convention on October 6, 1853. Well-known suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Bloomer, Antoinette Brown, Lucretia Mott and Lucy Stone all came to participate in the convention that drew women from around the country. At the convention, women discussed various women's rights. One of the rights they outlined was \\"That women be exempted from taxation until their right of suffrage is practically acknowledged.\\" In 1855 on October 17 the sixth National Women's Rights Convention was held in Cincinnati. A national suffrage organization, the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) was established in Cleveland in 1869 on November 24 and 25 at a convention held at Case Hall. AWSA was meant to be a \\"less radical\\" group compared to the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). Early on, Toledo and Dayton also created women's suffrage organizations. The Toledo Woman's Suffrage Association (TWSA) and the Dayton Woman's Suffrage Association were both formed around 1869. Some women in South Newbury, Ohio voted in elections between 1871 and 1876, though the women's votes were never counted. In 1873, women brought a petition for women's suffrage to another Ohio constitutional convention. The petitions had almost 8,000 signatures and represented thirty-three Ohio counties. At the Convention, delegates formed a women's suffrage committee to report on the issue and submitted an equal suffrage proposal to the convention. The proposal was debated for two days and some delegates used \\"the Bible to prove that man's position was and should be superior to that of woman.\\" Others argued that women's suffrage would help women be better wives, mothers and Christians. The proposal never came before the electors of the convention and failed by 4 votes. Invitation to 1898 National Woman Suffrage Conference in Cincinnati In May of 1885, the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association (OWSA) was founded in Painesville. OWSA focused on changing local and state laws to provide suffrage to women. After the creation of the WCTU, there was an influence on women's suffrage around the state. In Shelby, a small town with a disproportionate number of saloons, women became involved in political organizing over prohibition and creating alternative places for men to visit, such as reading rooms. The Shelby Equal Franchise Association was also created as an offshoot of the WCTU. To counter the idea that women did not really want to vote, Louise Southworth in Cleveland became the national superintendent of enrollment. Starting in 1888, she created a list of people in Ohio who endorsed women's suffrage. Women gained the right to vote in school board elections in 1894t{SfnUpton1910p=188}} but the right did not extend to allowing women to vote on bonds involving school infrastructure. The National Woman Suffrage Conference was held in Cincinnati in April 1898. In 1899, Harriet Taylor Upton was elected president of OWSA. Upton also served as the treasurer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1894 to 1910. Starting in the Spring of 1900, Upton visited fifteen important Ohio towns and helped organize local suffrage efforts there. By the end of 1900, she had doubled participation in organized suffrage efforts. In 1900, the Ohio General Assembly considered a suffrage bill in January. The Dayton Herald pointed out that it was significant that the Ohio Federation of Women's Clubs (OFWC) had not yet endorsed women's suffrage. In 1903, NAWSA moved their national headquarters to Warren, Ohio. NAWSA used Upton's house as a temporary center before moving to the Trumbull County Courthouse in 1905.  School board suffrage  In the Ohio House of Representatives, E. W. Doty introduced a bill for both women's suffrage on school board elections and to allow them to serve on these boards. Doty's bill lost by seven votes and he brought it forward again in the House in 1893, where it lost by six votes. In January of 1894, Representative Gustavus A. Wood introduced another bill, that was again narrowly defeated. Caroline McCullough Everhard, who helped form the Equal Rights Association of Massillon and Canton, was a wealthy woman who was taxed, but unable to vote. In 1894, Everhard and Governor William McKinley worked together to lobby Ohio lawmakers on the issue of women voting in school board elections. Everhard convinced Senator William T. Clark to bring up a school board suffrage bill in the Ohio Senate. The Senate bill, which also would provide the right for women to run for the school board, passed on April 10 in the Senate and the House on April 24. In 1895, women voted for the first time in school board elections. Everhard also worked to promote Elizabeth Folger in her successful run for the school board in Massillon, Ohio in 1895. In Xenia, Ohio, Mary Moore and Eliza Carruthers also won positions on their local school boards.  State amendments  1912 Ohio Woman Suffrage Association Headquarters in Cleveland When California gave women the right to vote in 1911, many women in Ohio were equally encouraged in their work on women's suffrage. In 1911, Elizabeth Hauser of Cleveland questioned each of the six candidates running for mayor on whether they supported women's suffrage and only one publicly did not. Florence Ellinwood Allen traveled to 66 counties in Ohio in 1911 speaking to farmers' groups and unions about women's suffrage. Upton was heavily involved as a leader in the campaign to add women's suffrage to the Ohio Constitution during the 1912 constitutional convention. There was a campaign to collect signatures for a referendum to change the words in the constitution from describing voters as \\"white male\\" to \\"every citizen.\\" Only issues relating to women's suffrage at the convention were limited in time by the committees. Unlike other issues, like bond issues for roads which had a two week discussion, only three minutes were allowed for debate on women's suffrage and only over the course of two days. A proposal for a voter referendum created by the Committee on the Elective Franchise at the convention passed by a vote of 76 to 34. Now the referendum would go out for a state-wide vote. Women in Dayton distributed around 20,000 leaflets and letters in support of women's suffrage leading up to the 1912 referendum election. From Cleveland, Hauser brought petitions to the Ohio State Legislature and then started working as a lobbyist for suffrage there. Suffragists in Cincinnati reached out to German-American voters, who were normally anti-suffrage. OWSA organized a parade in support of women's suffrage in Columbus on August 27. Ohio received national attention for the possibility of passing the amendment.leftAnti-suffragists were also campaigning against the amendment during this time. A campaign using anonymous handbills tied the issue of women's suffrage to prohibition, making it unpopular. OWSA offered a $100 reward for information about who was passing out these anti-suffrage handbills, but the authors were never discovered. The 1912 women's suffrage amendment failed with 88 counties opposing and 24 supporting. Nearly 100,000 people voted against the measure. The vote may not have passed for several reasons. There were worries that women's suffrage would lead to prohibition and anti-prohibitionist, Percy Andreae, claimed that the vote had become a \\"wet and dry issue\\" rather than one on suffrage. Suffragists had also aligned themselves with Theodore Roosevelt who was running as a third-party candidate which was seen as a negative by the press. After the women's suffrage measure failed, women regrouped and reorganized. In Franklin County, women founded the Franklin County Women's Suffrage Association (FCWSA) which was an umbrella group that included the Woman's Taxpayers' League (WTL), the College Equal Suffrage League, the Columbus Equal Suffrage League, the First Voter's League, the Men's League for Equal Suffrage and the Sojourner Truth Women's Suffrage Association (STWSA). The new Ohio constitution now allowed voter referendums to be placed on the ballot for constitutional amendments. The suffragists in Ohio decided to take advantage of this, putting a woman's suffrage issue before Ohio voters. Between March and July 1914, activists were able to gather more than 130,000 signatures for a women's suffrage referendum. A broadside promoting the referendum on the Ohio ballot from the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association (OWSA) in 1914 OWSA also worked to lobby the major political parties in Ohio in 1914 in support of suffrage efforts. By January 1914, both the Socialist and Progressive parties in Ohio said they would support women's suffrage. The Republican party in Ohio also began to support suffrage in tentative ways, but never fully committed themselves that year. On May 9, Mother's Day, preachers who were part of the Ministerial Association of Columbus gave sermons on how women's suffrage was a way for women to better exercise their duties as mothers. Jews in Columbus, including those at the B'Nai Israel Synagogue were also supportive of women's suffrage. Rosalie G. Jones and Elizabeth Freeman took out \\"The Little Yellow Wagon\\" in July 1912 from Cleveland and traveled to Medina, promoting the women's vote. Leading up to the 1914 amendment vote, the Wright family, including Katharine Wright and Orville Wright helped campaign for women's suffrage. Katharine organized a suffrage parade on October 24, 1914 in Dayton where Orville and her father, Bishop Milton Wright, also marched. In Lima, Bessie Crayton organized an October suffrage parade that drew around 1,500 people, including a 96-year old man who marched for women's suffrage. On the same ballot, the Anti-Saloon League introduced a referendum on prohibition. The suffragists worried that the prohibition initiative would be negatively tied to their cause and women's suffrage would lose support. The suffrage referendum failed.  Targeted suffrage efforts  Many suffragists in Ohio began to focus on more narrow suffrage goals after the 1914 amendment defeat. In East Cleveland, women won the right to vote in municipal elections on June 6, 1916. The victory in East Cleveland was the first women won for municipal voting east of the Mississippi. With 936 for suffrage and 508 against, the success was written into the new city charter. In 1917, women in Lakewood, Ohio and Columbus also won the right to vote in municipal elections. The driving force behind suffrage efforts in Lakewood came from a group of 123 women who created a Political Study Club. Attempts were made to pass municipal suffrage in Sandusky, Ohio, but the effort failed. James A. Reynolds, a state representative from Cuyahoga County introduced the so-called Reynolds Bill, in the Ohio Legislature. It would allow women to vote in presidential elections. Harriet Taylor Upton, acting as president of the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association (OWSA), along with Florence Allen, Grace Drake and Elizabeth Hauser all testified in January 1917 before the Ohio legislature on the subject of women voting in presidential elections. Upton said that there were no good arguments against giving women the vote and pointed out that women had turned out in Ohio in good numbers for the elections they were eligible to vote in. Governor James M. Cox was supportive of the bill. The bill to allow women to vote in presidential elections passed in 1917. The Reynolds Bill was signed into law in February. The passage of the bill gave hope to suffragists in other states. Immediately after the bill passed, anti-suffragists vowed to start a referendum to repeal the actions of the Reynolds Bill. Anti- suffragists were able to includet a referendum on the ballot to repeal the Reynolds Bill. This was despite allegations of fraud in connection to the signatures filed on the petitions. The OWSA found that in four counties, Scioto, Trumbull, Mahoning and Cuyahoga, out of 9,964 names on the petition, 8,661 were fraudulent. However, other counties were not examined and the referendum was allowed to stand. The Woman Citizen pointed out that the petitions did not represent a grassroots movement and were instead the result of special interests against women's suffrage. The referendum narrowly passed, removing the right of women to vote in presidential elections.  Ratification  Women practice voting in Dayton, Ohio Oct. 27, 1920 Ohio ratified the Nineteenth Amendment on June 16, 1919, becoming the fifth state to ratify. An effort to put a voter referendum on the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment was ended by Ohio Secretary of State, Harvey C. Smith. In 1923 a referendum vote succeeded in removing the phrase \\"white male\\" from the description of a voter in the Ohio Constitution.  African-American women and suffrage in Ohio  Some parts of Ohio were inclusive and worked with African- American women towards women's suffrage. In the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio in 1851, Sojourner Truth gave her famous Ain't I a Woman? speech. Mary Church Terrell, an influential clubwoman, attended Oberlin College. Hallie Quinn Brown, who was involved with women's clubs and the Republican Party, was an important suffrage leader in Ohio. Dayton was fairly inclusive in its suffrage activities. In Cincinnati, suffragists like Dr. Louise Southgate promoted the inclusion of African-American women in the suffrage movement. In Franklin County, the larger umbrella group for women's suffrage, the Franklin County Women's Suffrage Association (FCWSA), was formed in 1912 and worked with the Black women's group, the Sojourner Truth Women's Suffrage Association (STWSA). The Ministerial Association of Colored Preachers in Cincinnati was also supportive of women's suffrage. When an equal rights bill was defeated by the Republican-majority legislature in Ohio in 1919, Black women demonstrated their displeasure. They changed the name of the Colored Women's Republican Club to the Colored Women's Independent Political League, signalling a \\"public repudiation\\" of the Republican Party.  Male allies  Men worked towards women's suffrage early in Ohio history. Timothy Walker, who founded the law school at the University of Cincinnati, helped create a foundation for understanding women's legal's rights. Much later, when the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) was formed during an 1869 convention, Henry Ward Beecher was elected president of the group and William Lloyd Garrison as vice president. When famous suffragists including Susan B. Anthony campaigned in Ohio in 1867, they brought George Francis Train with them on the tour. In Cleveland, a Men's Equal Suffrage League was established in 1911 to support women's suffrage. The next year, in Columbus, an Ohio State University (OSU) professor, J. V. Denney, helped found a chapter of the league in February. By 1912, there were men's leagues in Cincinnati, Salem, Springfield and Youngstown. Men's groups helped bridge communications between the women in the suffrage organizations and \\"formal politics,\\" which was dominated by men.  Anti-suffragists  \\"Start Hearings on Suffrage\\" headline from The Tribune of Hicksville, Ohio, February 1, 1917 Companies involved with the liquor industry in Ohio were generally opposed to women voting. Women's suffrage in Ohio was closely tied to the issue of prohibition. There were certainly ties between many suffragists and temperance advocates in Ohio, even if suffragists attempted to maintain distance between their activism. Suffragist leader, Harriet Taylor Upton, made this explicit during one campaign, saying \\"There will be no union of forces with the drys this fall to secure our equal rights amendment to the constitution.\\" Liquor interests continued to fight against women's suffrage, even resorting to fraud, to try to stop women from voting in Ohio. Women who were opposed to suffrage in Ohio, including Maria Longworth Storer, did not feel that women needed to vote. Women who were part of the privileged and wealthy class did not face many of the problems experienced by working class women. In a novel by Longworth Storer, The Villa (1918), she described suffragists as \\"unsexed\\" criminals. Other women believed that women's influence was more powerful through working in civic organizations or women's clubs. A petition circulating in Columbus in 1912 expressed the idea that women already had \\"their full share of influence and responsibility for the public welfare\\" without the need to vote. The German immigrant periodicals in Franklin County expressed opinions against women's suffrage. Both local papers, Wöchentliche Columbus Express and the Express Und Westbote described suffragists as unladylike and uplifted the idea of women as the hausfrau. English language periodicals in Columbus also sensationalized the more militant aspects of suffrage activism, publishing stories on the escalating tactics of suffragettes in London. Both the articles published and the imagery used in political cartoons about suffragists \\"contributed to the stereotype of suffragists as militant or at least as potentially threatening the established sex roles.\\" The German American Alliance in Ohio also opposed women's suffrage. Some Progressive Party candidates in Ohio did not endorse women's suffrage privately, though publicly they signaled support.

She is a member of the Spanish Congress of Deputies for the People's Party of Spain, representing The Constituency of Madrid. Life and career Uriarte was born in Fruiz, a small town in Biscay. She attended the Frúniz public school, at the Compasión de Munguía school, and at the Munguía Public Institute, where she focused on the study of music theory and especially the piano. When she was young she became engaged in the anti- Francoist movement. In 1977, Uriarte became a journalism student at the University of the Basque Country. Four years later, she attended the Complutense University of Madrid, where she studied Sociology and Political Science. In 1987 she began teaching at the University of the Basque Country, and in 1992 she graduated from the Complutense University with a doctorate in Sociology and Political Science. Her thesis was a study of Basque intellectuals. In 1995, she became a tenured professor at the University of the Basque Country. In the 1990s, Uriarte was a member of the executive of the Partido Socialista de Euskadi (es). In 1998, Uriarte was a co-founder of the civic association Foro Ermua, and she became involved in the grassroots activist organisation ¡Basta Ya! Uriarte won the 2001 Chair of Political Science at the University of the Basque Country (es). In 2002 she became the president of the Fundación para la Libertad, and distanced herself from her previous affiliation with the PSE. This shift was partly prompted by her experiences opposing Basque separatist terrorism, which included dangerous encounters with the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna. Uriarte was listed in the third position on the party list of the People's Party of Spain in the April 2019 Spanish general election for the constituency of Madrid, and she won the seat, which she continued to hold through the November 2019 Spanish general election. Uriarte has published a number of books, including Cobardes y rebeldes (Cowards and rebels, 2003), and Feminista y de Derechos (Feminist and right, 2019). She was a 2004 winner of the Spanish Order of Constitutional Merit.

Plot summary The adventure is set in Seattle in 2050. The Runners are hired to protect the rock star Maria Mercurial from her former manager, who apparently wants to harm her after she broke their contract. Soon it becomes clear that this is not a simple bodyguarding gig, as first a Yakuza gang and then a second group appears, and details of Maria's unhappy past begin to surface.

Biography Hermann Güntert was born in Worms, Germany on 5 November 1886. His father was a Roman Catholic merchant, and his mother was a Huguenot. Güntert became fluent in Sanskrit and Hebrew as a high school student, graduating at the top of his class in 1905. Güntert subsequently studied classical philology and German philology at the University of Heidelberg. He also studied comparative linguistics under Hermann Osthoff and Indo-Iranian languages under Christian Bartholomae. He received his PhD with the dissertion Zur Geschichte der griechischen Gradationsbildungen, which was about the Greek language. It was published in Indogermanische Forschungen in 1909. Güntert subsequently studied for one semester at the University of Leipzig. In 1909, Güntert passed the staatsexamen in German, Greek and Latin, and subsequently worked as a gymnasium teacher in Heidelberg from 1909 to 1921. He completed his habilitation in 1912/1913 in Indo-European linguistics and classics with the thesis Reimwortbildung im Arischen und Altgriechischen, which examined rhymes in Indo-Iranian and Ancient Greek. He was appointed Associate Professor at the University of Heidelberg in 1918. In 1921, Güntert succeeded Gustav Herbig as Professor of Comparative Linguistics at the University of Rostock. In 1926, he succeeded Bartholomae as Professor at the University of Heidelberg. He was elected Member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1931. From 1933, Güntert was also a lecturer in Germanic studies. Since 1938, he was the editor of Wörter und Sachen. Since the spring of 1938, Güntert suffered from declining health, which forced him to reduce his activity at the University. He retired in December 1945, and died in Heidelberg on 23 April 1948. Research Güntert's research centered on Indo-Iranian, Ancient Greek and Germanic. He was critical of the North European hypothesis of Gustav Kossinna. Instead he supported the steppe hypothesis of Otto Schrader and Guntërt's Heidelberg colleague Ernst Wahle. In his Der Ursprung der Germanen (1934), Güntert suggested that the Germanic peoples emerged through the conquest of the Funnelbeaker culture by Indo-European invaders of the Corded Ware culture. Personal life Güntert married Gisela Wachenfeld in 1923.

Cossack Naumenko was born in Petrovskaya, Kuban Oblast near the Black Sea in the territory of the Kuban Host. Pursuing a military career, he graduated from the Voronezh Mikhailovsky Cadet Corps in 1900, the Nicholas Calvary School in 1903, and from the Military Academy of the General Staff in 1914. He entered the First World War with the rank of voiskovi starshina (lieutenant colonel), serving as chief of staff of the 1st Kuban Cossack Calvary Division. He subsequently served as chief of staff of the 4th Kuban Division from August 1914 to January 1917 and as chief of staff of the Cossack field forces from January 1917 – January 1918. On 30 August 1914, he was wounded in action while fighting against the Austrians in the city of Stryi in Galicia (which belonged to the Austrian empire at the time) and he was awarded the 4th class Order of Saint Anna on 15 December 1914 for heroism under fire. On 7 February 1915, he was awarded the 3rd class Order of Saint Anna for an action in the Carpathians on 25 September 1914 against the Austrians. On 6 March 1915, he was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir for the same action at Stryi where as he continued to fight on despite being wounded. On 6 April 1915, he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus for heroism under fire while fighting the Austrians on 16–17 September 1914. Like almost all Russian officers, Naumenko accepted the February Revolution of 1917 and the downfall of the ancient House of Romanov. The Cossack Hosts, who enjoyed a privileged position under the empire, tended to see themselves as bound by personal loyalty to the emperor rather than serving Russia, and with the end of the monarchy, many Cossacks took the viewpoint that their loyalty to Russia had ended. Naumenko served the Provisional government and on 14 August 1917 he was appointed a senior adjunct to the quartermaster of the Special Army. Like many officers, Naumenko was worried about the increasing signs of social breakdown over the course of 1917 and by the end of the year had grown close to General Lavr Kornilov, an Eurasian Siberian Cossack (Kornilov's mother was a Buryat). Kornilov who was well known for being described as having \\"the heart of a lion but the brain of a sheep\\" was a right-wing officer who was the first to raise his banner against the Bolsheviks following the October Revolution. Civil War In the Russian Civil War, Naumenko fought on the White side. The British journalist Christopher Booker called Naumenko \\"a White Russian hero during the Civil War\\". Naumenko took part in the Ice March of the Volunteer Army under Kornilov in February=March 1918. On 18 February 1918, he was promoted to the rank of full colonel. By early March 1918, Naumenko was leading the Cossacks of the Kuban People's Republic into sporadic, but bitter clashes against the Red Army. Later in March 1918, Naumenko led the first joint operation between the Whites and the Kuban Host to take the stanitsa Novo-Dmitrievakain from the Bolsheviks. From April–June 1918, he served as chief of staff to a cavalry brigade commanded by General Viktor Pokrovsky active in southern Russia. On 27 June 1918, he took command of the 1st Kuban Mounted Regiment, and on 14 August 1918 he was promoted to take command of the 1st Mounted Brigade. On 19 November 1918, he assumed command of the 1st Mounted Division. On 8 December 1918, he was promoted to major general. On 15 December 1918, he was elected a field ataman of the Kuban Host, serving as their \\"minister of war\\". On 14 February 1919, the Kuban ataman Alexander Filimonov issued a degree putting all of the Cossacks of the Kuban Host under the command of Naumenko. The same order also declared the Kuban Host was not to take orders from the White generals. However, Naumenko was against Cossack separatism, and favored having the Kuban Host accept the authority of the White leaders instead of operating alone as the separatists favored. Relations between the rada (council) and Naumenko were strained and he was forced to resign on 14 September 1919. Naumenko served in the reserves of the Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) from 14 September 1919 to 11 October 1919, when he took command of the 2nd Kuban Corps, which he held until March 1920. In March 1920, following the defeat of the AFSR, Naumenko fled down the Black Sea coast into Georgia. In April 1920, he and what was left of his forces sailed across the Black Sea to join the main White Army in the Crimea under the command of General Baron Pyotr Wrangel, known to the Soviets as the \\"Black Baron\\". The Crimea was connected to the mainland via the very narrow Isthmus of Perekop, which proved to be both a blessing and a curse for Wrangel; the narrowness of the isthmus limited the path of any army trying to break in or out of the Crimea, making it hard for both the Red Army to break into the Crimea and for the White Army to break out. In July 1920, as part of Wrangel's attempt to break out of the Crimea, Naumenko was landed on the coast of the Kuban with the aim of disattracting the Red Army, but by August 1920 Naumenko had been defeated and was forced to evaluate to the Crimea. From 9 September 1920 to 3 October 1920, Naumenko commanded the 1st Cavalry Division. At the same time, he was promoted to lieutenant general. On 3 October 1920, Naumenko was badly wounded in action and therefore was confided to a hospital to recover from his wounds. Between 7-17 November 1920, the Battle of Perekop saw the Red Army finally break through the White lines on the Isthmus of Perekop. Following the final defeat of the Whites in the Crimea, Naumenko was evaluated together with what was left of the White Army on 18 November 1918. A British ship picked up Naumenko and took him and his men to Constantinople, and from there to on the isle of Lemnos. First Exile He went into exile in 1920 following the final defeat of the White Army in the Crimea and was elected ataman of the Kuban Host on the Greek island of Lemnos in the Aegean Sea. Naumenko was still serving as the ataman of the Kuban Host at the time of his death in 1979, setting a record for longevity as no other ataman ever held office for so long. The responsibility of the refugees on Lemnos rested with the French government, which had extended a limited diplomatic recognition to the White movement as the British government refused to pay for any of the costs of housing and feeding them. The British prime minister David Lloyd George never lost the hope of reaching a settlement with Vladimir Lenin and saw Wrangel as an obstructionist. The refugee camp on Lemnos was created as there was insufficient space for the refugees in Constantinople, a city that was under Allied occupation in the years 1918-1923, and there were fears of an epidemic breaking out owning to poor sanitation in the refugee camps around Constantinople. Wrangel wanted to keep the his defeated army together to resume the civil war at the first opportune moment while the French General Broussaud in charge of the camp wanted to see the refugees settled as soon as possible in order to end the burden on the French treasury, making for difficult relations. The Soviet government indicated a willingness to offer an amnesty and to allow the Kuban Cossacks to return, an offer that Brossaud was in favor of accepting while Wrangel and the rest of Cossack leaders were opposed to. Brossaud often quarreled with Naumenko and in his reports to Paris portrayed him as a trouble-maker. In April 1921, Broussaud forbade Naumenko to return to Lemnos after he went on a trip to Constantinople. At a meeting in Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey) in 1921, Naumenko met with the atamans of the Don and Terek Hosts which led to the establishment of the United Council of the Don, Kuban and Terek Hosts to manage the affairs of the Cossacks in exile. Subsequently, he settled in Belgrade, Yugoslavia where the Russophile King Alexander was very welcoming to Russian emigres. In October 1921, the Lemonos refugee camp was shut down with some of the Kuban Host choosing to return to Soviet Russia where an amnesty was promised for them while those who wished to stay in exile went to either Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. Naumenko was active in trying to preserve the Russian heritage of the emigres, setting up schools to discourage assimilation and encourage the children of the emigres to speak Russian instead of Serbo-Croatian. In Belgrade, Naumenko founded the Museum of the Cossacks to encourage the children of the Cossack emigres to remember their heritage. In exile, Naumenko published several books in Russian about the Civil War. World War Two After Operation Barbarossa started on 22 June 1941, Naumenko declared his willingness to serve Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. As the ataman of the Kuban Host, Naumenko was active in using his prestige to recruit Cossacks to fight for Germany. In March 1942, German policy towards Soviet POWs changed as the previous policy of letting the POWs stave to death was ended and henceforward it was German policy to encourage the POWs to fight for Germany. Starting in the spring of 1942, Naumenko toured the POW camps urging Cossack POWs to enlist in the Wehrmacht. By the time of the Second World War, Naumenko had changed his opinion about Cossack separatism due to the influence of Alfred Rosenberg, and in 1942 publicly praised the plans unveiled in Berlin for a Nazi puppet state to be called Cossackia. In December 1942, Naumenko raised a regiment for the Russian Protective Corps serving in Serbia. Starting in April 1943, all of the Cossacks formations in the Wehrmacht were concentrated in Mielau (modern Mława, Poland) to form the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division of the Wehrmacht. When the men of the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division learned in September 1943 that they would not be going to the Eastern Front as expected and were instead being sent to the Balkans largely because Adolf Hitler distrusted their loyalty to the Reich, the divisions's commander General Helmuth von Pannwitz had Naumenko together with the former Don Host ataman Pyotr Krasnov give speeches before the Cossacks at their Mielau base. Both Krasnov and Naumenko told the assembled Cossacks that they would still be fighting the \\"international Communist conspiracy\\" in the Balkans and promised that they would ultimately go to fight on the Eastern Front. In January 1944, Naumenko left his home in Belgrade and reviewed while wearing the traditional black uniform of the Kuban Host the 1st Cossack Cavalry Division serving in Bosnia and Croatia, which he then praised in a speech. During this period, Naumenko together with Pyotr Krasnov and Andrei Shkuro was one of the leaders of the Cossack \\"government-in-exile\\" created by Alfred Rosenberg. The Cossack \\"government-in-exile\\" was created in Berlin on 31 March 1944 headed by Krasnov who appointed Naumenko his \\"minister of war\\". When Krasnov was out of Berlin, Naumenko served as the acting director of the Main Directorate of Cossack Forces. Naumenko lived in Berlin from March 1944 onward, but in February 1945 left the threatened German capital as the Red Army had advanced to within 60 miles of Berlin. In 1945 Naumenko surrendered to the Americans rather than the British, which almost certainly saved his life as the Americans were less strict about repatriating Cossacks to the Soviet Union. Together with his son- in-law, the Don Cossack Nikolai Nazarenko, Naumenko surrendered to the Americans in Munich in April 1945. Krasnov and Shkuro surrendered to the British who repatriated them to the Soviets in May 1945. In 1947 both Krasnov and Shkuro were hanged in Moscow following their convictions on charges of war crimes. Second Exile Naumenko settled in New York, where he published a two-volume book in 1962 and 1970 about the Repatriation of Cossacks entitled Velikoe Predatelstvo (The Great Betrayal). He was greatly embittered against Britain for the 1945 repatriation, and the matter was something of an obsession for him. Naumenko spent much time during his second exile visiting Australia, which took in a substantial number of Cossack refugees after 1945. The Austrian-born American author Julius Epstein described Naumenko in the early 1970s as living in a modest house in New York together with his daughter and son-in-law Nazarenko. He assisted the historian Count Nikolai Tolstoy with his books Victims of Yalta and his controversial book The Minister and the Massacres. Naumenko spent his last days in a nursing home run by the Tolstoy Foundation in New York city, where he suffered from senility. The two volumes of Velikoe Predatelstvo were translated into English by the American novelist William Dritschilo under the title The Great Betrayal in 2015 and 2018.

The Hasbrouck family were French Huguenots who fled persecution in France by moving to Germany, and then the United States. Two brothers, Jean II and Abraham, are the ancestors of almost all individuals in the United States with the last name \\"Hasbrouck,\\" or some variation. History The Hasbrouck brothers Jean and Abraham were the sons of Jean Hasbrouck I and his wife Esther, both born in France. When Louis XIV gained the French throne in 1643, he aggressively forced Huguenots to covert to Roman Catholicism, an ongoing effort by French monarchs to perform this action. Louis imposed penalties, closed schools, and implemented Dragonnades, which were meant to intimidate the Huguenot families. Huguenot homes would be occupied or looted by French troops as part of this policy. =Move to Germany and the Colonies= Many of the Huguenots became religious refugees, fleeing France to other parts of Europe. The Hasbrouck family ended up in Mannheim, Germany, among many other families. It wasn't long before these families continued their journey and sailed to the colonies in North America. One of the earliest French Huguenots to move to the colonies was Matthys Blanchan and his family, which included his son-in-law Louis DuBois. Jean Hasbrouck II and his wife, Anne Deyo, and two of their children, Maria and Hester, along with Anne's parents Christian and Jeanne Verbeau Deyo, and Anne's siblings Pierre, Maria and Elizabeth, would move to present-day New York, settling first in Hurley, New York. In 1675, Jean's brother Abraham would join with the group in Hurley, which had now grown to a very large number. On November 17, 1675, he would marry Maria Deyo, his brother's wife's sister. =Founding of New Paltz= After garnering enough support and continuing to grow their families, the Huguenots set out to find a desirable land that they could call their own. They found an area 15 miles south of Kingston, New York, where they had resided for a short time but found that the constant squabbles with local Native Americans made it difficult to function. The owners of the land they coveted were the Esopus Indians, who lived on a considerable amount of land up and down the Hudson River where present-day Esopus, New York runs, through Ulster Park, New York and into where New Paltz stands. The Huguenots initiated peaceful negotiations with the Esopus tribe, agreeing to a land contract with five of their chiefs and 21 of their natives. This was followed by the royal, or patent, grant, given to the Huguenots by Governor Edmund Andros on September 29, 1677. In 1678, the families proceeded to their new home, building simple wood houses near the Wallkill River. They would name their new settlement New Paltz, which was meant to honor the Germany state in which Mannheim exists, Pfalz-am-Rhein. As part of the patent they had received, twelve of the new settlers signed the document and were considered the founders, or patentees, of New Paltz. Jean and Abraham Hasbrouck were two of these signers, along with their father-in-law, Christian Deyo; their brother- in-law, Pierre \\"Peter\\" Deyo; brother-in-law, Simon LeFevre (who married Elizabeth Deyo); brother-in-law, Abraham DuBois (who married Margaret Deyo); Jean's son-in-law Isaac DuBois (married Maria Hasbrouck); Abraham and Isaac's father Louis; Simon's brother, Andries LeFevre; Hugo Freer; Louis Bevier; and Antoine Crispell, who married Maria Blanchan, daughter of Matthys and sister of Catherine (married Louis DuBois). One of the first structures in New Paltz was a fort-like stockade, a requirement of Governor Andros for protection. =Huguenot Street= (see Huguenot Street Historic District) The families settled on a stretch of land, now known as Historic Huguenot Street, where many of their early homes were built. The wood-like homes were soon replaced by stone structures, that have stood until present day. The first patentee to pass away was Christian Deyo, and a cemetery was established on Huguenot Street not far from where the homes were. Many of the patentees would be buried in this cemetery, and Christian was the first. Anne Deyo Hasbrouck would pass away in 1694, and not see many of the structures built with stone; her husband, Jean, passed away in 1714, having built a small, simple stone house. His brother Abraham would pass away in 1717, also having built a small house, and his wife Maria Deyo Hasbrouck in 1741. They would all be buried in the Huguenot Cemetery. Abraham and Maria's son, Daniel, would add on to his father's residence, making it much larger and committing to upgrades for his family. While it was originally thought that the \\"Abraham Hasbrouck House\\" was built solely by Abraham, dating of the trees and remnants of the earliest parts of the house show that it was completed after Abraham's death, around 1720. This makes Daniel the likely contributor to most of what the home looks like today, and he resided there until around 1740. Early Hasbrouck Family Jean and Anna Deyo Hasbrouck had at least six children: # Maria Hasbrouck (1664-1719); married Isaac DuBois (1659-1690) on June 1, 1683 # Hester Hasbrouck (1668-1721); married Pierre \\"Peter\\" Gumaer (1666-1729) on April 18, 1692 # Abraham Hasbrouck (b.1678) # Isaac Hasbrouck (b.1681) # Elizabeth Hasbrouck (1685-1760); married Louis Bevier Jr. (1684-1735) on June 2, 1713 # Jacob Hasbrouck (1688-1761); married Esther Bevier (1687-1741) on December 7, 1714 Abraham and Maria Deyo Hasbrouck had at least five children: # Rachel Hasbrouck (1680-bef 1717); married Louis DuBois Jr. (1677-1749) on January 19, 1701 # Joseph Hasbrouck (1683-1724); married Elsie Schoonmaker (1685-1764) on October 27, 1705 # Solomon Hasbrouck (1686-1752); married Sarah Van Wagenen (1701-1753) # Daniel Hasbrouck (1692-1759); married Wyntje Deyo (1706-1787); great-granddaughter of Christian Deyo and Daniel's 1st cousin once removed # Benjamin Hasbrouck (1696-1763); married Jannetje DeLong (1712-1787) on February 13, 1737 Many of the Hasbrouck descendants would marry into the other patentee families, as well as other early settler families from the Netherlands such as the Elting, Van Wagenen, Louw and Schoonmaker families. Notable Members =Abraham Bruyn Hasbrouck= Abraham Bruyn Hasbrouck was born November 29, 1791 in Kingston, New York, the son of Jonathan Hasbrouck, who served as the Ulster County Judge from 1798-1799, and his wife, Catharina Wynkoop Hasbrouck. He graduated from Yale University in 1810 and returned to Kingston, where he studied law and opened his practice. In 1824, he was elected to the 19th United States Congress, serving from 1825-1827. He was named President of the National Ulster County Bank in Kingston, holding this position until 1840, when he was appointed the 6th President of Rutgers University. He remained in this role until 1850. He died February 23, 1879 in Kingston, and was buried in Houghtaling Cemetery in that city. The cemetery is now defunct. Abruyn Street in Kingston is named after Abraham Bruyn Hasbrouck; because he was prominent at in Kingston at the same time as his first cousin, Abraham J. Hasbrouck, he would sign his name \\"Abruyn,\\" thus resulting in the street name. Hasbrouck also founded the village of St. Remy, within the limits of Kingston and Esopus. *Jean Hasbrouck m.

Ezra was only 15 days old when his mother died on October 6, 1865, likely due to complications of his birth. His parents had married on December 21, 1864 in Stone Ridge, New York. On July 17, 1873, Roswell married Helen Eldridge Carswell (1847-1950), and they had two daughters: Helen Margaret Fitch Cobb (1874-1978) and Eloise Maddren Fitch (1880-1902). Ezra's paternal aunt, Harriet Fitch (1840-1932), married his maternal uncle, John Cornelius Hasbrouck (1840-1901), and they had seven children, making them double first cousins of Ezra. Ezra grew up on the Hudson River in Coxsackie on an estate built by his paternal great-grandfather, Roswell Reed. His father would move the family to Brooklyn, and would die there on January 11, 1888. By this time, Ezra had been out on his own, having graduated from New York University in 1894 and engaging in different business pursuits and becoming a significant customer of David Abercrombie's store, Abercrombie Co., starting in 1892. On March 2, 1897, in Brooklyn, Ezra married Sara Huntington Sturges (1874-1960), daughter of banker Stephen Buckingham Sturges. They moved to California for a brief period before moving back east. They had a daughter, Edith Sturges Fitch, born in 1901 in New York City. The Fitch's would move to Kingston, New York, where Ezra opened a law practice. He would still frequently travel to New York and visit David Abercrombie's store, and by 1900, he had purchased a large share of the business. By 1904, they would become known as \\"Abercrombie and Fitch Co.\\" Ezra wished for the company to become increasingly more public, while David did not wish for this to happen, instead wanting to keep it for the elite. Abercrombie sold out to Fitch in 1907, and with that, Ezra Fitch expanded the company with large success. He would remain in charge until 1928, when he sold his assets in the company, which is still known today as Abercrombie & Fitch. Ezra Fitch was attributed to bringing Mahjong to the United States from China. Ezra H. Fitch died on June 16, 1930, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, on his yacht. He had only owned and slept on the yacht for a few days leading up to his death. He was buried in Washington on the Green Cemetery in Washington, Connecticut. His daughter, Edith, married Paul Fessenden Cruikshank and they had four children: Paul Fessenden, Jr., Elaine, Sally and Janet. His half-sister Helen's son, Roswell Fitch Truman, would remain a part of Abercrombie and Fitch for quite some time after Ezra's death. Fitch street in Kingston, New York, is named for Ezra and his paternal grandfather, Ezra Fitch (1805-1870). *Jean Hasbrouck m. Esther ? **Jean Hasbrouck (1640-1714) m.

He entered private law practice in New York City, engaging from 1848-1851, and then moving to Kingston and practicing law there from 1854-1861. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Sharpe had been captain of the 20th New York Militia, but had submitted his resignation. However, at word of the attack on Fort Sumter, Sharpe withdrew his resignation and had recruited 248 men through one day. In 1862, he was commissioned a colonel and over a span of 22 days recruited 1041 men, going to battle on the 23rd day. He was brevetted to brigadier general in 1864 and major general in 1865. Following the Civil War, Major General Sharpe was sent to Europe to identify United States citizens that may have been involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, making him the \\"first CIA agent\\" in U.S. history. This assignment followed a stint as Chief of the Bureau of Military Information from 1863-1865. Sharpe was elected in 1878 to the New York State Assembly, serving from 1879-1882, serving as its speaker from 1880-1881.

His mansion stood until the 1960s, when it was demolished. General Sharpe entertained many guests at this mansion, including United States Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Chester A. Arthur. Not far from where his mansion once stood, there is a now-defunct cemetery, called Sharp's Burying Ground, at 148 Albany Avenue. This burial ground was likely named for General Sharpe's father as well as himself. General Sharpe married his cousin, Caroline Hone Hasbrouck (1830-1898), on December 20, 1855.

The facility currently produces the Toyota Tacoma for the North American market. The plant has the capacity to produce 100,000 vehicles per year and employs 1,000 people. History Toyota announced a plan in April 2015 to open a new factory in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. The Guanajuato plant would be the automaker's second plant in Mexico, after Toyota Motor Manufacturing de Baja California (TMMBC), and its 15th in North America. The plant will be the first to be built from the ground up to be able to take advantage of efficiencies enabled by the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), a company-wide effort to simplify the vehicles being produced by Toyota. At the time, Toyota announced that the plant would produce the Corolla compact sedan. Construction on the $1 billion (USD) plant began with a groundbreaking in November 2016. The plant became the target of an international trade dispute in January 2017 when then US President-elect Donald Trump tweeted out anger towards Toyota for building a new plant in Mexico instead of the United States and threatened additional trade barriers, in the form of a border tax if the plant was built. Toyota defended the plant and pointed out that the current TMMBC plant in Mexico supports production at the much larger Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas (TMMTX) plant in San Antonio which produces 230,000 vehicles per year and employs 3,300 US workers.5 January 2017 The Trump administration never imposed additional tariffs on Toyota and the new United States–Mexico–Canada (USMCA) trade agreement that went into effect on 1 July 2020 allows for free trade of automobiles between the three countries as long as certain conditions are met. Toyota announced in August 2017 that it would shift the production of the plant from the Corolla, to the Tacoma pickup truck. The plant began production of the Tacoma on 19 December 2019 and the first truck rolled off the production line on 6 February 2020. The plant has the capacity to produce 100,000 vehicles per year and employs 1,000 people. Between 2020 and 2021, Toyota plans to wind down production of the Tacoma at its San Antonio plant as production increases in Guanajuato.

Contents Street Samurai Catalog is a supplement that presents new weapons, vehicles, cyberware, and other accessories, using the conceit that this is the equipment catalog of a fictional company called Ares. The book is divided into two parts: items for the general public, and items for security and quasi-military forces. As well as a variety of firearms and personal weaponry, several cybernetic implants are also described. Each item takes up one page and is accompanied by an illustration. The book also includes new rules for some of the items, new street samurai archetypes and a blank street samurai character sheet. Publication history Street Samurai Catalog was written by Tom Dowd, and was published by FASA in 1990 as a 116-page softcover book, with illustrations by Timothy Bradstreet, Jeff Laubenstein, and Karl Martin, and cover art by Steve Venters. In 1999, the material from this book was updated to the new rules for Shadowrun 3, with its contents divided between Man & Machine (1999), and Cannon Companion (2000). Reception Stephan Wieck reviewed Street Samurai Catalog for White Wolf #20, rating it 3 out of 5 overall, and stated that \\"If you've got [the money] to spare I'd say buy it because you will enjoy it and the Catalog will enrich your Shadowrun campaign, but you can get by without it.\\" In the November 1992 edition of Dragon (#187), Allen Varney said that this book \\"belong[s] in any Shadowrun game player's library.\\" Varney noted the items listed in the book already \\"figure prominently in many of the published adventures.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"its extensive illustrations, samurai archetypes, and cyberware rules enhance every campaign.\\" Several months later, in the April 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #192), Rick Swan was less impressed. Although he liked some of the items in the book, especially cyberguns and shock gloves, he found that \\"too many mundane items (such as precision arrows and — yawn — survival knives) result in a less-than-memorable volume.\\" He concluded that the book wasn't worth the money, pointing out that \\"each entry fills an entire page, much of it empty space, which hardly makes this a bargain.\\" References Category:Shadowrun supplements ","title":"Street Samurai Catalog"},{"id":"65225527","text":"Alfrēds Plade (11 June 1905 - 29 March 1944) was a Latvian footballer.

It was first conceived as a series of sermons, delivered at the Phillips Exeter Academy throughout 1959. It was subsequently published by Seabury Press, NY, in 1966. The Magnificent Defeat is Buechner’s first non-fiction publication.  Composition  Buechner delivered the sermons included in The Magnificent Defeat as the ‘new school minister’ at the Phillips Exeter Academy, a role he took in 1958 following his graduation from Union Theological Seminary, New York. In his autobiographical work, Now and Then (1983), Buechner reflects on the difficulties of writing and delivering sermons for a young and unreceptive audience, ‘most if not all of [whom] were there so much against both their wills and their principles’.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 67. He continues: ‘My job, as I saw it, was to defend the Christian faith against its “cultured despisers”, to use Schleiermacher’s phrase. To put it more positively, it was to present the faith as appealingly, honestly, relevantly, and skilfully as I could.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 47. Elsewhere, in another anthology of sermons titled Secrets in the Dark (2006), Buechner writes that ‘in keeping with the spirit of the time’, the majority of his students were ‘against almost everything – the Vietnam war, the government, anybody over thirty including their parents, the school, and especially religion’. In Now and Then, the author describes the ‘sheer terror’ of preaching to this congregation, in addition to his fellow faculty members, whom he describes as ‘often jaded, skeptical, sometimes even quite openly negative about the whole religious enterprise’.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 67. Marjorie Casebier McCoy writes that the effect of being faced with such a hostile audience on a weekly basis ‘compelled [Buechner] to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith.’McCoy, Marjorie Casebier (1988). Frederick Buechner: Novelist and Theologian of the Lost and Found. New York: Harper & Row. Now and Then also details the setting, the Phillips Exeter Academy Library, in which Buechner composed his sermons; the author describes himself, ‘sat in the library in a deep leather armchair with my feet on the radiator’.Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 68. In Secrets in the Dark the author also reveals that several of the sermons featured in The Magnificent Defeat became ‘the germ of a novel’, which was later written and published as The Son of Laughter (1993).Buechner, Frederick (2006). Secrets in the Dark: a life in sermons. New York: HarperOne. pp. xiii. A number of the sermons preached at Exeter and not published in The Magnificent Defeat were later anthologised in The Hungering Dark (1968).Buechner, Frederick (2006). Secrets in the Dark: a life in sermons. New York: HarperOne. pp. xiii.  Major themes  The topics of Buechner’s sermons vary, and they meditate on a selection of texts from the Old and New Testament. As with many of his other works, the addresses included in The Magnificent Defeat meditate upon the possibility of faith and of God’s action in the world, especially in the mundane. As the author acknowledges in Now and Then, the sermons are also often offer an apologetic for Christianity and for faith. In the ‘Introductory Note’ to The Magnificent Defeat, Buechner names James Muilenburg, George Buttrick, John Knox, Paul Scherer, and Robert Russell Wicks as influences for both the style and substance of his preaching.Buechner, Frederick (1966). The Magnificent Defeat. New York: The Seabury Press. pp. 7. The author reflects at length in Now and Then on the influence of Karl Bath, particularly his essay ‘The Need for Christian Preaching’, upon the sermons included in the anthology: ‘These words of Barth’s were extremely powerful words to me, seemed extremely honest and, as far as I could tell, extremely true; and in all my preaching at Exeter and ever since I have been guided by them.’Buechner, Frederick (1983). Now and Then: a memoir of vocation. San Francisco: HarperCollins. p. 70.

During his Penguin years he played a crucial role in postwar British typography, and has been described as one of the most influential typographers of the last century. Early life and family His father, Hans, was a paediatrician and his mother Marie owned a small business making and selling folded paper lampshades. He excelled in athletics as a child and in 1933 attempted to study art history at university, but was prohibited owing to his Jewish descent. Instead he applied to become a student of Rudolf Koch but Koch insisted on Hans receiving prior craft training. In 1933 Schmoller began a four year apprenticeship as a compositor in the Jewish book-printing firm of Siegfried Scholem. He studied fine typography during the day at the Staatliche Kunstbibliothek and in evenings with Johannes Boehland at the Höhere Graphische Fachschule. As the situation in Germany worsened for Jews, Schmoller made efforts to move abroad. He received a letter from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society in Basutoland (now Lesotho) to take a temporary job as manager of the missionary press. In December he returned to Berlin where he saw his parents for the last time, who were transported in October 1942. His father died at Terecin and his mother died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Schmoller was interned in South Africa as an enemy alien from July 1940 to April 1942 and became a British citizen in 1946. He married Tanya Schmoller in 1950.

In the Gothic period, the nave was extended westwards. The lower part of the extension is constructed in stone from the original church while the upper part is built of brick. The crow-stepped west gable has arched niches. A porch was at the same time added on the west side of the church. The tower was built on top of the chancel in 1859 and heightened in 1906. Interior Font The original flat ceiling of the chancel and nave was in the Gothic period replaced with a cross-vaulted ceiling. The altarpiece is a painting by J. L. G.Lund from the middle of the 19th century. The Baroque style pulpit was created by Hans Snedker in 1631. The altar and chancel was refurbished by Mogens Koch in 1952.

She is best known in the 21st century as the inspiration for the \\"Olson mask,\\" variants of which are one of the most popular for cloth masks worn during the COVID-19 novel coronavirus outbreak. Early life Born May 12, 1895 in Pope County, Minnesota, Lyla Mae Olson was the second of nine children. Her parents, Axel Hagebert Olson (March 11, 1864 – December 15, 1924) and Ragnhild \\"Rosie\\" (Hoverud) Olson (November 25, 1869 – July 1, 1923) each immigrated with their families from Norway. Axel's family was living in Rolling Forks, Minnesota at the time of the 1885 Minnesota State Census. Ragnhild came with her family from Valdres, Norway, and by 1885, was living in Langhei, Minnesota. Axel and Ragnhild Olson were living in Benson, MN in 1900 with four children: Myrtle, Leila (Lyla), Leonora, and Hazel. Axel's occupation is listed as \\"machinery salesman.\\" By 1905, the Olson family had grown by three more children — Helen, Esther, and Clifford — and Axel's father, Ole S. Olson, had also moved in with them. By 1910, the Olsons had moved to White Bear Lake, MN and had another son, Arthur. By 1920 the Olsons had moved to their final home in Glenwood, MN where their ninth child, Licele, was born, and Axel was working as a policeman. Both of Lyla's parents are buried in Glenwood, MN at the Glenwood Lutheran Cemetery. Even though her family moved around quite a bit, it is clear Lyla had regular access to education considering her career in nursing and copious writing career. Nursing career Olson attended nursing school at the Ancker Hospital School of Nursing in St. Paul, MN. By 1923, Olson was the Superintendent of Nurses at the Kahler Hospital in the Mayo Clinic system and was also involved in running the Methodist-Kahler School of Nursing (1917–1970), which was one of the schools that fed nurses into the Mayo Clinic. She is credited with designing their pin and cap and was responsible for the hiring of several of the school's directors, including Irene English Countryman. By 1926, Olson was Superintendent of Nurses at the Worrall Hospital, a major part of the Mayo Medical Center. Olson published several articles and books in the 1930s-1940s about the practice of nursing, many detailing methods to make equipment such as preparation baskets for surgical procedures and medicine cabinets containing reference information for nurses about new drugs. In her 1947 book Improvised Equipment in the Home Care of the Sick, Olson compiled more than 400 nursing innovations she had tested that could all be made using materials commonly found in patients' homes – a practice known at the time as \\"improvising,\\" now often called \\"making.\\" Publications =Articles=  * =Books= * Taffy and Tuff (1942) - Olson co-authored this children's book with her companion, Mildred Seybert, about their two King Charles Spaniels that were known and loved by Mayo Clinic patients.

Having studied at Vienna under Otto Höfler, Birkhan specializes in Celtic, Germanic, and Indo-European studies, particularly the study of Celtic- Germanic contacts, Germanic linguistics and Medieval German literature from an interdisciplinary perspective, on which he has published numerous influential works. He has taught generations of students at Vienna, as is well known as a popularizer of scholarship for the broader Austrian public, particularly young people. Birkhan has tutored many influential scholars, including Hermann Reichert, Rudolf Simek, Manfred Kern, , Melitta Adamson, and , and continues to teach, write and research. Early life and education Helmut Birkhan was born in Vienna, Austria on 1 February 1938, the son of Josef Birkhan, a civil engineer, and Maria Müller. After graduating from gymnasium in Vienna, Birkhan studied philosophy, psychology, classical philology and Germanistics at the University of Vienna, and eventually specialized in Germanicstics, particularly Ancient Germanistics. Birkhan received his PhD in 1962 under the supervision of Otto Höfler, with the dissertion Die Verwandlung in der Volkserzählung. Along with Otto Gschwantler, Peter Wiesinger and Erika Kartschoke and other future prominent scholars, Birkhan belonged to a circle of Höfler's favourite students who called themselves the Drachenrunde. Birkhan lectured at the University of Wales from 1961 to 1962. At Wales, his teacher was the prominent Celtologist Proinsias Mac Cana. Since 1963 he lectured at the Institute for Germanic Studies at the University of Vienna as an assistant of Höfler. In Birkhan, Höfler saw the same capabilities for interdiciplinary learning which was characteristic of his own teacher, the famed Rudolf Much. In 1968 Birkhan received the prestigious two-year Humboldt Research Fellowship to pursue further studies at the University of Göttingen, and subsequently studied archaeology with Herbert Jankuhn, Indo-European studies with Oswald Szemerényi, Celtic studies with Josef Weisweiler, and Scandinavistics with Heinrich Beck. In January 1970, Birkhan habilitated in Ancient Germanistics with a thesis on the relationship between Celts and Germanic peoples in classical antiquity. Career Birkhan was appointed Professor of Ancient German Language and Literature at the University of Vienna in 1972. He was subsequently appointed Managing Director of the Institute for Germanic Studies at the University of Vienna. In 1988, Birkhan established as a distinct course at Vienna, and subsequently secured the appointment of Herbert van Uffelen to teach this subject. In 1997, Birkhan completed an additional habilitation in Celtic studies with the thesis Kelten. Versuch einer Gesamtdarstellung ihrer Kultur. Together with David Stifter, he subsequently established Celtology as a distinct course at Vienna. After Birkhan's retirement, the teaching of Celtology was suspended at Vienna, despite great opposition from students. For almost half a century, Birkhan has taught generations of students at Vienna, where he has become well known for his breath of knowledge and friendly personality. He has also dedicated himself toowards making scholarship available to the broader public, notably appearing as a druid on the children's television program on the Österreichischer Rundfunk. Many scholars of prominence have gained their degrees under the supervision of Birkhan, including Hermann Reichert, Rudolf Simek, Manfred Kern, , Melitta Adamson, Sang Bea Pack, and . Helmut Birkhan (in sunglasses) with Peter Wiesinger (on Birkhan's right) and other friends from the University of Vienna during an excursion to the Danube in 1960. The circle of friends pictured were students of Otto Höfler, and affectionaly called themselve the Drachenrunde. Birkhan has been a visiting professor at several universities, including the universities of Picardy Jules Verne (1980), Amsterdam (1993-1994) and Antwerp (1994-1995). Birkhan has received many awards for his scholarship, and was in 1990 made an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau (1990). He his a member of several distinguished learned societies, including the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (1991), Austrian Academy of Sciences (1994), the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (2002) and the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2005).

The event was narrated by survivor Gaspar Arredondo y Pichardo in his book _Memoria de mi salida de la isla de Santo Domingo el 28 de abril de 1805 (Memory of my departure from the island of Santo Domingo on April 28, 1805)_ , which was written shortly after the massacre. This massacre is part of a series of Haitian invasions to Santo Domingo and is part of Siege of Santo Domingo (1805). Haitian historian Jean Price-Mars wrote that the troops killed white, black and mixed inhabitants of Santo Domingo. This event has been presented in Haiti as a fight against slavery. The raids, carried out by 40,000 Haitian soldiers, were headed by Henri Christophe and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who were present during the action. Municipalities of Santo Domingo (Monte Plata, Cotuí, La Vega, Santiago and Moca) were reduced to ashes and troops killed Dominicans, including 40 children who were beheaded in a church, during a failed attempt to overthrow Jean-Louis Ferrand. Ferrand was later overthrown on November 7, 1808 after the defeat in the Battle of Palo Hincado, that definitively put an end to the presence of any French rule on the island. The inhabitants of the Spanish-speaking side of the island inherit the Dominican national name, which is derived from the country Santo Domingo, since the early 17th century.  Events  Jean-Jacques Dessalines printed on a stamp These events were narrated in the accounts of witness Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo, a young law student living in Santiago, Santo Domingo, who later fled to Cuba after surviving the genocide. Dessalines's intended targets were Ferrand and his French soldiers, but he had also warned the Dominican inhabitants in a letter to cooperate with him or risk death. Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo details his account of the events in the book _Recuerdo de mi salida de la isla de Santo Domingo el 28 de abril de 1805 (Memory of my departure from the island of Santo Domingo on April 28, 1805)_ , which was discovered in Cuba and then handed over to the Dominican government for historical record. Haitian troops entered the cities and killed everyone they encountered, whether they were white, mixed or black. Some of the stories: Henri Christophe on a coin :: The Haitian (troops) entered the city like a fury of hell, cutting their throats sword in hand, trampling everything they found, and making blood run everywhere. Imagine what would be the consternation, terror and fright that that neighborhood, so neglected, fell silent for a moment, in view of similar events, when almost everyone was gathered in the main church, with their pastor imploring divine help, while it represented on the altar the sacrifice of our Redemption, and in readiness to receive communion, as one of the days of the year in which, by custom, even those in the country came to fulfill the annual precept. The throng of women fleeing without knowing where. The screams of children and the elderly who came out of their houses in terror. The ecclesiastical confused in the midst of those who asked him for comfort. – de Arredondo y Pichardo. A well-known mestizo tailor named Fernando Pimentel is mentioned in (44): :: A man (44), who had not yet swallowed the sacramental species, was passed with a bayonet and was left lying at the door of the same sanctuary. From there, whoever was able to escape later fell into the hands of the army (Christophe's army) who roamed the city and did not spare any life they encountered. All obeyed, believing that some pardon or grace was going to be proclaimed in their favor, but the pardon was to slaughter them all after the meeting like cornered sheep. The Haitian (troops) after consummating the frightful, sacrilegious and barbarous sacrifice, left the town: that of all the women who were in the church, only two girls were left alive who were under the corpse of the mother, the aunt or the person who accompanied them, they pretended dead because they were covered with the blood that had spilled the corpse they had on top that in the presbytery. There were at least 40 children with their throats slit and on top of the altar a lady from Santiago, Mrs. Manuela Polanco, a woman from Don Francisco Campos, a member of the Departmental Council, who was sacrificed on the day of the invasion and hung on the arches of the Town Hall, with two or three mortal wounds from which he was dying. – de Arredondo y Pichardo. The Haitian troops returned to Haiti after noticing French ships they thought were heading towards the western part of the island, which they believed were being sent to attack their country. Gaspar de Arredondo y Pichardo also relates that, in the retreat to Haiti, all the cities crossed and the population were reduced to ashes, even altars. The Otsego Herald newspaper, based in Cooperstown, New York, published details of the massacre on the same month: :: Haytian army had gone against Santo Domingo. They were said to amount to 40,000 men. Dessalines, the Emperor, had marched at the head of these until they reached Santiago, an inland town of considerable strength. A council of war was then held, when it was determined to storm the city. The Emperor, however, was requested not to risk his life in the attempt. The direction of the siege was given to General Brave, who, after a desperate and bloody conflict, succeeded in carrying the city; not, however, without considerable loss – It was rumored that General Brave was mortally wounded and had lost 1,000 of his best troops. The French and Spaniards found in the city, it was supposed, were all put to the sword. – Otsego Herald newspaper, April 25, 1805  Effect  Population of Dominican Republic 1789 - 1897 This massacre has been linked to the 1937 massacre in the Dominican Republic, and is seen as a contributor to the events that culminated during the regime of the future president Rafael Leónidas Trujillo to order that massacre. The slaughter of the innocent and the burning of municipalities left a negative impression from the Dominican Republic about the intentions of Haiti, which later invaded Republic of Spanish Haiti during the Ephemeral Independence in 1822 after an unresisted invasion with the force of an estimated 10,000 of Haitian troops commanded by Jean-Pierre Boyer to unify the country with Haiti. Veteran Haitian history writer Jan Rogoziński quantified the population of Santo Domingo declining to 63,000, in 1819, due to attacks like Beheading of Moca. The Dominican population numbered 125,000 in 1789. The history of Haiti presents these massacres as necessary events to ensure the independence of its country for fear of the reestablishment of slavery throughout the island at that time, due to the intentions of Jean-Louis Ferrand. They praise the attacks made against French troops whose intentions were to restore slavery that was abolished in Haiti years earlier.

Sherman received his country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for actions taken on July 3, 1863 during the Battle of Gettysburg. Personal life Sherman was born in Burlington, Vermont in 1832, and in 1849 moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, the Union's newest state, in search of work as a painter. At the outset of the Civil War, at the age of 37, Sherman mustered into the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Regiment. Civil War service The 1st Minnesota was the very first group of volunteers the Union Army received at the beginning of the Civil War. Fabled for taking part in almost every major engagement in the eastern theater of the war, Sherman was therefore involved in many battles during his 3 year enlistment. During the Battle of Gettysburg Sherman and the rest of Company C joined the rest of their regiment at the East Cavalry Field. The days before saw the regiment lose roughly 80% of their total troop counts after a deadly action at Plum Run. On July 3, while engaging with the 28th Virginia Infantry, Sherman captured the enemy flag, though stories of how he came to attain it differ. According to Sherman's own reports following the war, he ran down the enemy flag bearer and forced him to hand over the flag on threat of death. Sherman then took the flag and the enemy as prisoner. However, fellow private Daniel Bond remembered seeing the flag leaning against a tree, but lost a footrace to it after Sherman, who was closer, spotted it as well. Following Gettysburg, Sherman remained in the army for another year. He lost his leg in 1864 in a skirmish near Petersburg and was mustered out of the army. Medal of Honor citation Personal life Sherman had no apparent descendants, and very little of his life is known. He died in 1896, and the banner that he captured was displayed at his funeral. It eventually was added to the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society. Sherman is interred at Oakland Cemetery in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

Location The lower part of the Congo River below Stanley Pool first descends through the Livingstone Falls and rapids, then has a navigable section from Manyanga to Isangile, and then has further rapids and cataracts down to Matadi, from where it is navigable to the Atlantic Ocean. Isangila is on the right bank of the Congo River, about north and upstream from Vivi. From there the river is navigable for small steamers and whaleboats for about upstream to Manyanga. It was an important post for portage operations to Léopoldville before the construction of the Matadi-Léopoldville Railway. History In 1880 Henry Morton Stanley established stations for the International African Association at Vivi, Isanghila, Lukungo, Manyanga South and Leopoldville below Stanley Pool. Stanley returned to Vivi on 4 July 1882 and began organizing an expedition up the Congo River to the Stanley Falls, which would take control of the country along the route. When Louis Valcke and Alphonse van Gèle arrived in Vivi with a contingent of Zanzibari troops soon after, Stanley at once instructed them to work on construction of the road from Vivi to Isangila, bypassing the rapids and leading to the navigable section up to Manyanga, then to connect Manyanga to Léopoldville. The work had to be done quickly so the dismantled Association internationale Africaine steamer and goods could be carried to Léopoldville for the planned expedition. The road to Isangila is mentioned by William Holman Bentley in his account of the Baptist Missionary Society, which came to the lower Congo in 1878. The African traders refused to let them travel up to Stanley Pool, for fear that they would bypass them and destroy the trade. Eventually they heard of Stanley's new steamer-road, which they found to extend about from Vivi along the north bank up to Isangila. From there they managed to travel quickly and unobtrusively up to the Pool. The Baptist missionary George Grenfell established a chain of missions at Musuko, Isangila and Manyanga.

He might wear an iron skull cap under his tricorne. Armour in the 18th century was minimalist and restricted almost entirely to cavalry, in particular cuirassiers and, to a lesser degree, dragoons. Armour had been in rapid decline since the Thirty Years War, although some archaisms had lingered on into the early years of the 18th century, like Austrian cuirassiers with buff coats and lobster-tailed helmets or Hungarian warriors with mail armour and shields. With the exception of Poland-Lithuania, which still made use of hussars wearing suits of plate armour, armour in Europe was primarily restricted to a (sometimes blackened) front- and backplate, the cuirass, and a simple iron skull cap worn under the hat. By the later 18th century, there were two contradicting developments. Many cuirassier regiments were discarding their cuirasses, while helmets in the form of so-called dragoon helmets, made of brass or leather, made a comeback among the cavalry and infantry. Body armour after 1700 In the 18th century, the only troop type to wear body armour was the cuirassier, named after their cuirass. Described as \\"big men on big horses\\" those main task was to defeat the enemy cavalry, they were the closest thing to the heavily armoured knights of old. Usually painted black, their cuirass was rather uncomfortable to wear and quite heavy, as it was expected to withstand a musket shot before being accepted to service. Head protection was neglected throughout much of the 18th century. After the lobster-tailed helmets had been abandoned by most European armies by the second half of the 17th century, there were no proper helmets that replaced them. Instead of helmets, both infantry and cavalry resorted to hats made of linen or cloth and fur caps. If at all, simple iron skull caps were worn under these hats. Alternatively, the hats might be reinforced by an iron framework. An 18th-century commander known to have worn a skull cap was August the Strong, whose specimen weighted almost 10 kilogram. In any case, they offered no protection against bullets and were only meant to protect the wearer from sword slashes. Hence, they were primarily restricted to cavalry. Dragoons, mounted infantry, also often wore iron skull caps, although their battlefield purpose had become indistinguishable from that of other cavalry by around 1750. In Sweden, Charles XII (r. 1697–1718) abandoned all defensive armour for his cavalry as he favoured aggressive charges at high speed. The English had no horsemen with cuirasses at the beginning of the 18th century, although they were reintroduced in 1707 to be worn under the coats. A type of leg protection were massive leather boots for cuirassiers, protecting the wearer already during the charge, which happened knee-to-knee. However, they were so cumbersome that the soldier had trouble to mount his horse and, even more problematic, making it nearly impossible for him to walk after dismounting. Hence, a cuirassier fighting on foot \\"was as much use as a dead man.\\" One piece of armour which continued to be worn was the gorget, although its size was rapidly decreasing. It was not intended to offer protection, but rather to display the high rank of its wearer. In Poland, some gorgets had applications bearing scenes of Christian iconography, like Virgin Mary or saints. They \\"functioned symbolically as a 'spiritual buckler'.\\" File:HGM Kürass Prinz Eugen.jpgThe cuirass of Prince Eugene of Savoy File:Cuirassier hat and casquet.pngPrussian cuirassier tricorne hat and skull cap from the time of Frederick the Great File:Iron framework for tricorne.pngIron framework for tricorne File:Peter the Great close up.jpgPeter the Great wearing a large gorget File:Louis XV by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour.jpgPainting of Louis XV dating from 1748. Although such suits of armour had long fallen out of use it remained fashionable for the nobility to be painted while wearing them. Early archaisms and exceptions to the rule Commanders still would occasionally wear body armour during the early decades of the 18th century. Hungarian general János Bottyán, for example, wore a breastplate during a siege in 1705, which saved his life after being hit by a bullet. Another archaism during the early years of the 18th century were Hungarian horsemen known as Panzerstecher (\\"armour piercer\\"), equipped with an armour piercing sword, mail armour, an iron skull cap with mail aventail and a small shield. Initially, the Hungarian aristocracy did not normally wear mail armour on its own but under a cuirass, but this had changed by the second half of the 17th century, while their old lobbster-tailed helmet had made place to the new, simple skull cap with aventail around 1630. Contributing many thousand fighters, the Panzerstecher successfully fought in the Great Turkish War, but after the defeat of the Hungarian uprising of Francis II Rákóczi in 1711, mail armour was restriced to a few hussar captains. It finally disappeared for good after the war of the Austrian succession. A unique Polish development is a form of scale armour, the karacena, that developed in the last quarter of the 17th century and remained is use until the middle of the 18th century. Being a product of Polish Sarmatism, it was inspired by ancient Sarmatian, Scythian, Dacian and late ancient Roman armour. Karacena helmets were either based on the lobster- tailed helmet or the Muslim turban. It was a display of ideology rather than a practical armour, being extremely heavy and expensive. Therefore, it was limited to the upper stratum of the Polish aristocracy and high-ranking cavalry officers. In eastern Europe, Russia maintained close ties with the Kalmyk Khanate at the shores of the Caspian Sea and enlisted its horsemen for various campaigns like the Russo-Persian war of 1722-1723, although they proved to be more useful against other steppe armies. Most of them fought as light cavalry, but the nobility wore various kinds of armour, like heavy wool kaftans with metal plates sewn on or Persian-style armour. Greatly appreciated by the Kalmyks, armour remained an important status symbols even though its practical use was declining. In the later 18th century, a fine piece of armour would still be worth over 50 horses.

Pope Clement XI cuirassiers.jpegPapal cuirassiers with body armour and helmets, 1721 Knötel IV, 05 (cropped).jpgSaxon cuirassier wearing parade armour, 1730 Developments during the second half of the 18th century By the French Revolutionary Wars at the end of the 18th century, the use of body armour had declined to virtual extinction. Of all principal European armies, it was only the Austrian one that continued to employ armoured cuirassiers en masse. However, except when confronting the Ottomans like during the war of 1788-1791, only a breastplate was worn. The Austrian reform of 1798 even increased the number of cuirassier regiments by three, although the state of the cuirass itself was not altered, not abandoning it, but also not readding the backplate of old. This would eventually proof fatal during the battle of Eckmühl in 1809, when the French cuirassiers with their full cuirasses decisively defeated the Austrian cuirassiers. Indeed, Napoleonic France would eventually put much emphasis on armoured cavalry, although the former Cuirassiers du Roi regiment, known after the revolution as Cavalerie- Cuirassiers, would continue to be the sole French regiment using body armour until the reforms of 1802/1803. By the order of king Frederick William II, Prussian cuirassiers were discarding their armour. This was the case first for a few regiments participating in the Prussian invasion of Holland in 1787 and then completely in 1790. They were not reintroduced until 1814/1815. Meanwhile, most German minor states had no cuirassiers regiments at all, and those of the Electorate of Hanover did not make use of armour. The last decades of the 18th century saw the introduction of helmets made of leather. The French introduced a dragoon regiment wearing Pseudo-Phryrian brass helmets with horse hair crests in 1743. Two decades later this helmet type was adopted by all dragoons. The British followed the French example and raised light dragoon regiments wearing brass helmets with green (later scarlet) turbans and crests with red horse hair in 1759. The helmet came soon to be associated with Emsdorf due to the outstanding service of the 15th Light Dragoons regiment at the Battle of Emsdorf in 1760, just a year after their raising. From around 1780 it fell out of use in favour of the so-called \\"Tarleton helmets\\". Made out of leather, it had \\"a peak over the eyes, a turban round the heapiece, and a black fur crest over the top from front to rear.\\" The 15th dragoon regiment, however, kept the old \\"Emsdorf helmets\\" until at least 1789. Over the course of the Napoleonic wars in the early 19th century, this generation of helmets fell out of use in most European armies in favour of shako hats. Exceptions were the heavy French cavalry or the Bavarians with their unique raupenhelm, which they retained until the second half of the 19th century.

It first flew in 1934. Design and development Many Laird aircraft were designated as LC (Laird Commercial). In most cases this was followed by an airframe code, here E and an engine code, here W for Wasp. The LC-EW was designed to an order from the industrialist George Horton, who had previously owned the sole Laird LC-AA, first flown in 1928. left It was a true sesquiplane, with a lower wingspan slightly less than half that of the upper. Both wings were essentially rectangular in plan out to rounded tips. The upper wing was built around spruce spars with plywood ribs and fabric covered. Upper and lower wings were braced together with parallel pairs of wide spread, transverse, streamlined V-struts on each side. Their apices on the lower wing were immediately above the landing legs. Between the fuselage and the legs the lower wing was constructed of Cr/Mo steel tubing and aluminium alloy-skinned; beyond, its structure was the same as that of the upper wing. Aluminium alloy ailerons were hinged only on the upper wings, filling about half the span. The inner lower wing carried flaps of similar construction. Both upper and lower wings contained fuel tanks. The LC-EW was powered by a , nine cylinder Pratt & Whitney Wasp C radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller and tightly enclosed under a long chord, NACA cowling, though bumped out over the rocker boxes to reduce its diameter. Aft, the fuselage was an all-metal aluminium alloy structure with multiple frames, stiffeners and metal skin. The pilots, or pilot and fifth passenger, sat side by side at the front of the cabin and had dual controls, including a central Y-type control column. Radio was fitted, with an external aerial. The ventilated, heated cabin had three windows on each side and was entered by a starboard-side door; its four passenger seats had safety belts. There was a baggage compartment and toilet at the rear. At the rear the tail was conventional with its cantilever tailplane at mid-fuselage. The tail surfaces were all metal constructions, similar to the fuselage. The tailplane had a blunted triangular profile and carried blunted rectangular elevators. Fin and unbalanced rudder had similar profiles to the horizontal tail plans. Its fixed, conventional landing gear, with a track of , had short, vertical oleo legs encased in fairings at the ends of the inner section of the lower wings. Each had a pneumatically-tyred wheel, also under a fairing. The castoring tail wheel was also on an oleo strut. Operational history Little is known about its short history in Horton's ownership. He died in 1935 and the LC-EW was bequeathed to the aeronautical department of the Rensselaer Institute.

Born and raised in Michigan, Arendsen pitched for the Holland Christian High School, where she won the state championship, before embarking on a successful collegiate and professional career. During her college years, Arendsen pitched for Texas Woman's University and California State University, Chico, where she led both teams to national championships. In recognition of her efforts, she received the 1978 Broderick Award as the nation's outstanding female athlete in softball. She was also selected to pitch for Team USA at the 1979 and 1983 Pan American Games, winning a gold and silver medal respectively. Upon concluding her collegiate career, Arendsen played professional softball with the Raybestos Brakettes for 15 years. During this time, she earned All-American honors 13 times, won nine national championships, and three world championships. As a result of her college play, she was named the national Broderick Award winner in softball for three consecutive years. In an exhibition game, during the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, she drew the attention of Major League Baseball player Reggie Jackson, whom she struck out three times. She was also ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the 50 greatest sports figures from Michigan in 1999. As she concluded her professional career, Arendsen was hired to coach at Mississippi State University and the University of Oregon, the former at which she became the winningest coach in program history. Between 2003 and 2009, Arendsen led the Oregon Ducks softball team to their best start in school history and their first playoff run since the 2000 season.  Early life  Arendsen was born on October 10, 1958, in Zeeland, Michigan. As a child, she idolized Joan Joyce, a softball player and pitcher for the Raybestos Brakettes, after witnessing her play at the age of 12. She began playing competitive softball at the same time and later shifted her focus to pitching at the behest of her high school coach. She originally played first base and the outfield in an adult league only under duress. By seventh grade, Arendsen stood at tall and was encouraged to play basketball by her junior high and high school coaches although she preferred softball. She played softball in junior high at Zeeland Christian and at Holland Christian High School, where she pitched them to the state championship while suffering from chickenpox. Due to the lack of opportunity for female athletes at the time, her team played in blue jeans and old basketball jerseys. Playing career =Collegiate= Arendsen completed her high school career earning all-state honors and enrolling at Grand Valley State University for one year. She had wished to attend Michigan State, whose women's softball team had just won the College World Series, but they lacked interest in recruiting her. Following the academic year, she enrolled at Texas Woman's University (TWU). She had been recruited by coach Donna Terry of the Texas Woman's Pioneers, who had met her at a softball clinic two years prior. In her first year at TWU, Arendsen pitched 55 wins and 15 losses, including 10 no-hitters and an average of 12 and 13 strikeouts per game, leading TWU to a fourth-place finish in the 1978 Women's College World Series. She tacked on a 14–1 fall season that year and received the 1978 Broderick Award as the nation's outstanding female athlete in softball. In 1979 and 1980, she again received the Broderick Award for softball. In 1979, Arendsen was recruited by the United States National team to compete with them at the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, where she helped them win a gold medal. Upon pitching the Pioneers to a national championship, she transferred to California State University, Chico (CSUC) where she won another national title with the Chico State Wildcats. =Post- collegiate= After graduating in 1980, Arendsen met Joyce at a softball clinic in Meriden where she impressed Joyce with her pitching skills. Joyce then encouraged her to try out for the Raybestos Brakettes, the top amateur team in the country. She earned a spot on the team and won 95 games in her first four years. She also competed at the national level during the 1981 World Games in Santa Clara, California, where she helped the United States win another first place finish. Arendsen pitched four shutouts, culminating in a perfect game in the championship final. She returned to the Pan American Games in 1983, where she led the team to a silver medal. While continuing to play amateur softball, she accepted various assistant coaching positions at Temple University, the University of Connecticut, Northwestern University, and Yale University. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Arendsen caught the attention of Major League Baseball player Reggie Jackson. He interviewed her for a close piece on athletes during a softball camp and she later faced him in an exhibition game following her championship win at the U.S. Olympic Festival. Due to rain, she pitched to Jackson inside the Carrier Dome with limited attendance, including national television press. She struck out Jackson three times in a row, with him foul-tipping one out of the 15 pitches she threw at him. That year, her often-used windmill fastball pitch was timed with a radar gun at , though she and her coach were unsure of the figure's accuracy. She explained that she changes her pitch throughout the season but throws the four basic pitches: curve, rise, dropball, and change up. Arendsen also said that she felt she could pitch this way forever as it was \\"a natural motion.\\" Arendsen played with the Brakettes for 15 years, earning All-American honors 13 times and winning nine national championships and three world championships. She set numerous records with the team, including six pitching records and tied the record for strikeouts. As a result of her play, she was named the national player of the year in two consecutive years; 1980 and 1981. She was also the first softball player ever to be a finalist for the James E. Sullivan Award, given to the top amateur athlete in the country, and the youngest person to be inducted into the Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame. Joan Moser, manager of the Allentown Patriots women's team, called Arendsen \\"one of the great women's softball pitchers of all time.\\" As an amateur athlete, she worked part time as a painter and landscaper during the summer. Coaching career Upon her retirement in 1992, Arendsen finished her career with a 338–26 record which included 79 no-hitters, 42 perfect games, 265 shutouts and a 0.15 ERA. She was later ranked by Sports Illustrated as one of the 50 greatest sports figures from Michigan. She joined the coaching staff at Mississippi State University for six years, where she rebuilt their softball program and held a 381-279 overall record. After spending six years at Mississippi State, she joined the coaching staff at the University of Oregon following their worst season in history; having won two games out of 21. During her first year as a coach at Oregon, she led them to their best start in school history and was one of seven inductees to be added into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. The Oregon Ducks softball team ended their season qualifying for the NCAA Division I Softball Tournament and were one win away from winning the national title. This marked their first playoff run since the 2000 season. The following year, she was the only American out of 19 inductees to join the International Softball Federation Hall of Fame. She continued her success with the Ducks and became the winningest coach in program history in 2008 with a 193–120 record, exceeding Tami Brown's record of 192–172. Her seven-year tenure with the team was cut short in 2009 after experiencing their worst season since 2003.

She currently holds the position of Additional Secretary (Indo-Pacific) at the Ministry of External Affairs. In September 2020, it was announced she was appointed Indian Ambassador to Italy. Career In early 2020, Malhotra was shuffled from Joint Secretary (Eastern and Southern Africa) to Additional Secretary (Indo- Pacific). In September 2020 it was announced Malhotra would be Indian Ambassador to Italy. Maid abuse lawsuit Neena Malhotra served as press counselor at the Consulate General in New York from 2006 to 2009. Malhotra and her husband Jogesh Malhotra were sued in 2010 for slavery in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by their former maid Shanti Gurung. The lawsuit alleged the Malhotras made Gurung sleep on the floor despite unoccupied bedrooms and regularly work arduous 16-hour days doing house work. Her duties included giving a daily massage for Neena Malhotra, a task that made Gurung \\"extremely uncomfortable\\". Gurung had her passport taken away and the Malhotras threatened US government agencies would find, beat and rape her if she ran away and did not return. The living conditions according to Gurung were abusive. She often went hungry, lost considerable weight, did not have adequate clothing while running errands during the winter, and suffered physical ailments. According to the lawsuit Neena Malhotra also committed misrepresentation to the US government to obtain an A-3 visa for Gurung. Neena Malhotra presented a contract with Gurung that promised $7/hour to the Embassy of the United States, New Delhi for the visa but instead the Malhotras had actually promised Gurung a wage of 5,000 Indian rupees (approximately $108 around the time) per month for three years to do \\"light cooking, light cleaning, and staffing the occasional house parties\\". In either case, Gurung alleged she did not receive the promised wages. The United States District Judge and former United States Ambassador to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations Victor Marrero presided over the case. Marrero entered a judgment in favor of Shanti Gurung and awarded in 2012 a judgment of US$1,458,335 against the Malhotras based on the finding of United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas. As of 2016, the judgment remains unpaid. Gurung was represented by Mitchell Alan Karlin of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Visa denial for homosexuality In 2013, while serving as the joint secretary of the passport and visa division, Malhotra denied a visa for a US diplomatic spouse on the basis of homosexuality. Another Indian diplomatic official quoted by the Indian Express said it had been common practice in the past to give visas to a gay couple as a family member. Malhotra was transferred by the MEA to the archives and record management division.

Löffel first played for Grenchen from 1955 to 1960. In 1959 he was part of the Grenchen team that won the Swiss Cup against Servette 1–0 in the final. A year later they reached the final again, but this time they lost against Luzern. For the 1962–63 season Löffel moved on to play for FC Moutier in the second highest tier of Swiss football. Löffel joined FC Basel's first team at the end of their 1962–63 season under manager Jiří Sobotka. In this season he played in only one game. This was the Cup of the Alps match on 19 June 1963 as Basel drew 1–1 with Grasshopper Club. In the 1963–64 season Löffel played in five test games and his first competition match for his new club was the away match on 9 October in the Celtic Park in Glasgow in the 1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup. Basel lost the match 5–0. Löffel played his domestic league debut for the club in the away game on 13 October 1963 as Basel lost 1–2 against Cantonal Neuchatel. A well-documented curiosity was the fact that during the winter break of the 1963–64 season the team travelled on a world tour. This saw them visit British Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, Mexico and the United States. First team manager Jiří Sobotka together with 16 players and 15 members of staff, supporters and journalists participated in this world tour from 10 January to 10 February 1964. Team captain Bruno Michaud filmed the events with his super-8 camara. The voyage around the world included 19 flights and numerous bus and train journeys. Club chairman, Lucien Schmidlin, led the group, but as they arrived in the hotel in Bangkok, he realised that 250,000 Swiss Francs were missing. The suitcase that he had filled with the various currencies was not with them. He had left it at home, but fortunately Swiss Air were able to deliver this to him within just a few days. During the tour a total of ten friendly/test games were played, these are listed in their 1963–64 season. Five wins, three draws, two defeats, but also three major injuries resulted from these test matches. A broken leg for Peter Füri, an eye injury for Walter Baumann and a knee injury for Bruno Michaud soon reduced the number of players to just 13. Löffel was a member of this tour. He played in eight of these games and scored one goal. Löffel scored his first domestic league goal for his club on 26 April 1965 in the home game at the Landhof as Basel won 3–2 against Cantonal Neuchatel. In his some what more than one season with the club, Löffel played a total of 24 games for Basel scoring a total of three goals. Five of these games were in the Nationalliga A, one in the 1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup, one in the Cup of the Alps and 17were friendly games. He scored one goal in the domestic league, the other two were scored during the test games. Following his time in Basel, Löffel moved on to play for FC Solothurn, who at that time played in the second tier of Swiss football. References Sources * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.

She received a master's degree in literary studies, specializing in Hispanic studies and gender studies, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and a second master's degree in Italian studies and film studies from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). She completed her PhD at UCLA with a thesis on the representation of gender-based violence in Spain and Italy. More recently she studied screenwriting at the Escuela de Guion in Madrid with Alicia Luna, and video- graphic criticism at Middlebury College with Jason Mittell and Chris Keathley. = Career = Zecchi is Professor of Film Studies in the area of Visual and Performance Studies and Director of the Film Studies Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She specializes in feminist film theory, adaptation theory, gender studies and cultural gerontology, video-graphic criticism, and digital humanities. From to 2011 to 2015, she served as graduate program director and Head of the Spanish and Portuguese Unit of the Dept. of Languages, Literatures and Cultures. From 2014 to 2016 she directed the UMass Translation Center. She taught at various European and American universities, including Saint Mary's College of California, California State University, Johns Hopkins University, Universidad Carlos III in Madrid, and in the Master programs of the Universitat de Valencia and the Universitat de Girona. She has lectured and presented her video-graphic essays in Italy, Spain, Portugal, England, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Canada and the United States. In 2016 she was elected associate member of the Spanish Film Academy (Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España).  Publications  In her publications, Zecchi develops an analysis of women film production. In Desenfocadas/Out of focus she follows the struggle of different generations of women filmmakers trying to find a space in the male-dominated world of cinema vis-à-vis the evolution of their historical context and of the feminist movement. The ultimate goal of this study is to demonstrate that despite the obvious changes, women are still subjected to traditional values without any real alternative to patriarchal stereotypes in dominant cinema, but at the same time, these stereotypes are deconstructed by each generation of women directors, in each historical period. For Esther Gimeno Ugalde, La pantalla sexuada/The Gendered Screen focuses on five topics that are central to feminist film theory (i.e., space, authorship, pleasure, body and violence) in an attempt to reveal the gendered dynamics that have been used in movies to expropriate the feminine and with the goal of studying the gradual process of re-appropriation of a space, a gaze and an agency. She is the founder and director of the Gynocine Project, a Digital Humanities open source project launched with a seed grant of the University of Massachusetts in 2011, with the aim of increasing the visibility of women's cinema.. The term of her coinage \\"gynocine\\" is an alternative to the limiting labels that have dominated the discussions on women-directed cinema. According to Pérez Villanueva, Zecchi understands \\"gynocine\\" as a \\"theoretical and practical tool that allows for a feminist reading of any film regardless of the gender of the author\\". Zecchi is vice-director of the international multidisciplinary network cinemAGEgender based in Birmingham, England, which studies the intersection of cultural gerontology with gender studies and film studies. In 2020 her book Desenfocadas (Out of focus) was selected by the Spanish daily national newspaper El Diario as one of the “13 books that have defined the decade\\". = Selected publications = * Sexualidad y escritura (1850-2000) (co-edited with Raquel Medina).

By 2011, the page had attracted a significant following among young people, Parliament of Australia: Aust. Australian science followers top half a million reaching 1 million followers by 2012. As of 2020, the page has slightly over 9 million followers. In 2012, ScienceAlert received a grant from Inspiring Australia, a government initiative aimed at engaging “people who may not have had previous access to or interest in science- communication activities.” Although the website began as a project to aggregate research findings and outcomes from Australian universities, by 2019, the website’s focus had shifted towards presenting popular science to a wider audience. The shift toward mass appeal news on social media has met with some criticism. (See Controversy section). In July 2019, reinforcing the site’s commitment to fact-checking, ScienceAlert announced a joint partnership with Metafact.

Later, ScienceAlert noted that this decision led to an increase in negative comments on their Facebook page, saying that when they post articles about climate news, “with astonishing speed and ferocity the comment section becomes a hot- pot of climate denialism”. The site has also come under criticism for other issues. In a post from 2014, feminist STEM blogger Zuleyka Zevallos takes issue with a post on ScienceAlert which she identifies as “sexist”, describing ScienceAlert as “broscience” and “click bait”, both terms for low-content social media posts designed to attract attention.

Twin Metals is a subsidiary of the Chilean conglomerate Antofagasta, which is controlled by billionaire Andrónico Luksic. There has been significant opposition to the proposed mine, most notably because of its proximity to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, location within a watershed that drains into the BWCA, and the air, water, light and noise pollution and traffic effects of converting a forested area bordering the BWCA into a substantial industrial facility. The original lease is a 1966 lease to the International Nickel Corporation. The leases were terminated under the Obama administration but renewed under the Trump administration. Critics have objected to and filed lawsuits against various aspects of the lease renewal and regulatory processes. The facility would have an underground mining area accessed by two sloping tunnels, an above-ground processing factory, and a tailings dumping area that would use the dry-storage method. Twin Metals has estimated that the mine would provide 700 jobs and create 1,400 jobs in related industries and that it would operate for 25 years, producing 20,000 tons of ore per day retrieved from depths of between 400 and 4,500 feet. Iron mining was a significant part of Ely's history but there have been no active mines nearby for 50 years and Ely's primary industry is now recreational business related to the BWCA and Superior National Forest. Proponents cite the economic benefits from projected jobs from the mine; opponents assert that those might not be as expected and would last only for 25 years, and that the mine could prove to be a net economic loss for the region because of its effects on other aspects of its economy. Early history  Superior National Forest was created in 1909. The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which is within it, is highly protected as wilderness and was created in stages, primarily between the 1930s and 1978. In the 1960s, during the Johnson administration, the International Nickel Company negotiated with federal officials to begin copper-nickel mining near Ely in St. Louis County, Minnesota. The proposed mine would be on land within the Superior National Forest, in Minnesota's Arrowhead Region, between the Canada–U.S. border and Lake Superior's north shore. It is part of the greater Boundary Waters region along the Minnesota–Ontario border, a historic and important thoroughfare in the fur trading and exploring days of New France and British North America. The BWCA is popular for canoeing, fishing, and hiking, and is one of country's most visited wilderness areas. The proposed mine site is just outside of the BWCA, within the Rainy River watershed, which drains into the lakes, leading some to object that a mining accident could lead to contamination of the lakes within the Wilderness Area. Twin Metals obtained the leases and applied for reauthorization in 2013. http://timberjay.com/stories/old-memos-shed-new- light-on-leases,14638 Old memos shed new light on Twin Metals leases;Suggest Trump administration ignored record in reversing Obama-era cancellation of mineral leases By Marshall Helmberger December 5, 2018 The Timberjay, serving northern St. Louis County, MN Retrieved 9/13/20https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2019/05/08/469509/boundary- waters-risk/ Boundary Waters at Risk By Carlos Rivero Lopez and Jenny Rowland- Shea Published by Center for American Progress May 8, 2019, Retrieved 9/9/20 In 2014, the leases expired and were up for renewal. On March 8, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Interior Solicitor determined and advised the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that there was no obligation to renew the leases.https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/m-37036.pdf In June 2016 the U.S. Forest Service announced that it was considering withholding its consent for the leases' renewal. The announcement shocked many Iron Rangers; the first leases had been granted 50 years earlier and been renewed twice since. On July 14, the Forest Service held a \\"listening session\\" in Duluth to discuss Twin Metals's proposal. Nearly 500 people attended. A Regional Forester told those in attendance that the Forest Service was concerned about building a mine in the BWCA watershed. \\"We're concerned about water quality. And we're concerned about ... the ability within a wilderness area to be able to do adequate mitigation [should anything happen with a mine].\\" St. Louis County Commissioner Tom Rukavina said it seemed that the Forest Service had already made up its mind. \\"When you put out a press release that says you're deeply concerned about sulfide mining, you bias your own opinion.\\" Lifelong Ely resident Becky Rom, who works with the organization Save the Boundary Waters, said, \\"This is the time for us to consider whether the watershed of the Boundary Waters is the right location for an industrial mining district. That decision must occur at the time leases are issued, because these issues grant the right to build a mine and extract minerals.\\" National Public Radio reported that Daryl Spencer of Duluth summed up the views of the majority of speakers at the event when he told the Forest Service that he did not oppose mining but could not support building a mine in the BWCA watershed, and that while he wants jobs for Iron Rangers, \\"This is just a bad place for this type of mine, and it's not worth the risk.\\" On July 20, 2016, the last day for public comment on whether the mining leases should be renewed, the Forest Service held a meeting in Ely. Nearly 900 people attended. Speakers split about 50-50, with a narrow majority against the mine proposal. The meeting showed the deep divide between those who grew up in Ely with a long history as mine workers and those who settled in Ely because of the wilderness or connections to businesses that serve the BWCA-related tourist trade. Mike Syresvud, president of Iron Range Building Trades, supports the proposal and urged the Forest Service to allow the leases and evaluate the environmental impact once Twin Metals had submitted a mine plan. But opponents said this was the appropriate time for the government to decide whether copper-nickel mining should be allowed. Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters spokesperson Jeremy Drucker said,\\"If you look at the leases themselves, they explicitly grant the right to mine, and the right to build mining facilities, and so I think the question is 'Is this the right location to build a mine?' We don't think it is.\\" Citing the environmental risks that a sulfide-based copper-nickel mine posed to BWCA water quality, in December 2016 the Obama administration decided not to renew the leases. Copper-nickel mining can create acidic runoff known as acid mine drainage that can leach heavy metals into water. Thomas Tidwell, Forest Service Chief at the time, wrote that acid mine drainage could cause “serious and irreplaceable harm” to the BWCA by allowing drainage into Birch Lake and the Kawishiwi River. According to Tidwell, \\"acid drainage can be created in all phases of mining, from construction to storing waste rock and tailings.\\" Since the federal leases were integral to its success, the decision all but ended the Twin Metals project.https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/obama- administration-takes-steps-protect-watershed-boundary-waters-canoe-area Trump Administration renews leases In May 2018, in an unprecedented action, the Interior Department ordered the Twin Metals leases to be reinstated. The administration claimed that the Obama administration had committed a \\"legal error\\" by determining that the government had discretion over whether to renew the leases. It based its argument on a 2017 opinion by Daniel Jorjani, a former legal counsel for the Charles Koch Foundation now working for the Interior Department. Jorjani argued that the original lease's terms guaranteed Twin Metals one more 10-year renewal.https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/m-37049.pdf December 22, 2017 By Daniel H.

The St. Louis County Timberjay has obtained documents the government released to the plaintiffs as part of discovery, most of which are memoranda Minnesota officials wrote to the Interior Department in 1965 and 1966, when INCO still owned the leases. The memoranda show that by summer 1966 the lease had been finalized and the Interior Department had issued a press release announcing them. The press release says that the leases \\"grant mining rights to the company for 20 years, renewable for 30 years at 10-year intervals if the property is brought into production within the initial 20-year term.\\" The Timberjay reported: > The discussions and agreements described in the memoranda suggest that the > Trump administration may have a difficult time defending the validity of the > legal opinion under which Interior officials made their decision. Nearly 53 > years later, no copper-nickel has been produced from the leases, although > the BLM and U.S. Forest Service did allow INCO and its successors to renew > the leases in 1989 and 2004 despite the lack of production. Related legal opinions by Reagan's and Obama's Interior Departments \\"concluded that renewal of the leases was discretionary on the part of the government, due in part to the company’s failure to begin production within the initial 20-year term.\\" The Timberjay concluded: > Nothing in any of the memoranda produced by the government supports > Jorjani’s novel claim. Instead, Jorjani’s argument runs directly counter to > the discussions detailed in government memoranda as well as the 1966 > government press release which clearly linked the company’s rights to future > lease renewals to the beginning of production within the initial 20-year > term. The Forest Service initially said that the USDA would study the proposal for two years and then the Secretary of the Interior would make a decision based on its findings. But on September 6, 2018, the Forest Service canceled the deeper mineral withdrawal study the Obama administration had ordered. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the 15 months of review that had already been completed revealed no new scientific information. He added, \\"[The USDA can both] protect the integrity of the watershed and contribute to economic growth and stronger communities.\\" Executive Director of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters Alex Falconer said, \\"The Trump administration broke its word to us, to Congress, and to the American people when it said it would finish the environmental assessment and base decisions on facts and science.\\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/09/06/boundary-waters-mining By Dan Kraker MPR News September 6, 2018 Retrieved 9/16/20 In November 2018 U.S. House members requested information on the withdrawal study's cancellation. On December 21, 2018, the BLM announced a ten-year extension of the leases' renewal for $1 per acre per year plus royalties.https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/nepa/98730/172784/209929/EA_LeaseRenewal_MNES01352-01353_FINAL.pdf Environmental assessment Twin Metals issued a 34-page environmental assessment of its proposal and the public was given until January 22 to comment on it. A Center For American Progress review of the environmental assessment said: > In December 2018, the BLM released a separate 34-page EA recommending that > Twin Metals’ mineral leases be renewed. However, the lack of proper > scientific assessment in the EA was clear. Analysis of all potential > environmental effects—including those on water resources, cultural > resources, recreation, wildlife, vegetation, and soil—were described in just > seven pages.

Moreover, > that study was authored by Golder Associates Inc., a company hired by Twin > Metals in 2014 to write a technical report on the proposed mining project. The day after the release of Twin Metals' assessment, a partial government shutdown began, resulting in the shutdown of many government agencies. Several environmental groups that opposed Twin Metals' proposals asked for an extension until March 25 because they had been unable to assess information they needed to conduct a review. They also asked for public hearings to be held in Duluth, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Washington, D.C. In a letter to the BLM, the groups wrote, \\"A rushed process is insufficient to understand the impacts of lease renewal on one of our nation's most cherished public lands\\", and they urged the government to \\"proceed cautiously and take adequate time to fully engage the public, the Forest Service, the scientific community, Native American tribes and others who will be impacted by the decision.\\" Minnesota's U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith and U.S. Representatives Betty McCollum, Ilhan Omar, and Dean Phillips also asked the BLM to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement about the mine's effects on the Boundary Waters' \\"sensitive ecosystem\\" and to agree to a 60-day extension. In April 2019 the House deadline passed for supply of documents related to the withdrawal study. On November 22, 2019, Minnesota regulators announced that they would conduct their own review of the proposed mine.

In December 2019 Twin Metals submitted its formal plans to state and federal officials. The documents lay out a detailed plan of the mining operation and an outline of how the company proposes to manage environmental impact. A Minnesota Public Radio report describes the operation as presented in the Twin Metals documents: > The mine would be accessed by two tunnels, 20 feet by 20 feet and 1.25 miles > long, sloping downward to the ore body.

The BLM notice initiates the scoping and environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act. Multiple federal agencies and tribal governments will take part in the process, and the public will have several opportunities to comment. The BLM, the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Natural Resources will prepare a detailed EIS to thoroughly analyze the proposal's environmental impact. Regional Native American tribes, including the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Grand Portage Band of Chippewa will also take part in the review. The results of the review will be compiled into the EIS, which can be expected to be thousands of pages long and take several years to complete. In November 2019, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced it would conduct its own environmental review rather than collaborate with the federal government on a review. Upon completion of the independent reviews, the state will evaluate them both, but it will rely most heavily on the state review. Noting new regulations Trump has issued that have weakened the requirements for granting environmental approval status, the DNR concluded, \\"To ensure that transparent and predictable and credible state process, Minnesotans will be better served by doing our own independent process.\\" DNR deputy commissioner Barb Naramore said, \\"[The] environmental review is really that process where we identify and evaluate and disclose to the public the potential environmental effects of a proposed project. We look not just at the project as proposed but at potential alternatives and the mitigations to those potential environmental impacts.\\" The regulators will also analyze other impacts, such as effects on the regional economy, cultural resources and endangered species. Naramore will help lead the review. During a scoping period the regulators will determine exactly which topics will be studied. The public can weigh in at scheduled public meetings. Former regulator Peder Larson said that the review period is a time to learn and study before a final decision is made. \\"There is the time to learn, and there's the time to study. And that takes place before there's a time to decide.\\" At the completion of the independent reviews the state will evaluate them both but ultimately they will rely most heavily on the one done by the state.https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/12/17/the-twin-metals-mine-is-about- to-begin-its-public-review-process The Twin Metals mine is about to begin its public review process. Here's why it’s so important By Dan Kraker Minnesota Public Radio MPRNews December 17th, 2019 Retrieved 9/11/20 Throughout the review process state and federal agencies, along with Twin Metals, will work closely together. Naramore has said, \\"There's a lot of really important back- and-forth that takes place throughout the environmental review process, around potential refinements to the project, and to the mitigation approaches.\\" When the review is completed, Minnesota state regulators will decide whether to grant a permit using the EIS. MPR News wrote, \\"But they’re not deciding on the merits of the project. It’s not up to regulators to determine whether the benefits of the Twin Metals mine—the jobs and economic impact and importance of the metals—outweigh the risks, like the potential for severe water pollution or whether a spot just outside the Boundary Waters is the right place for that kind of mine.\\" David Zoll, a Minneapolis-based environmental attorney, said, \\"When you get to the ultimate decision on whether you issue a permit it's largely based on numbers. That is, the decision to issue a permit is based on things like the amount of specific pollutants a mine will discharge, and whether that level is allowable under the law. It’s about meeting state standards, following state guidelines, but not about making a value judgment about the mine.\\" =Environmental concerns= The BWCAW showing Ely within the Superior National Forest The proposed mine and processing facility is controversial because it is to be on the shores of Birch Lake and the South Kawishiwi River, which lie in the Rainy River watershed and flow into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, about five miles to the northeast. In 2016 the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, refused to extend two federal mineral leases to the Twin Metals mine plan and the Forest Service proposed a 20-year mineral withdrawal and launched a 24-month environmental review of the proposal. But the Trump administration reversed that decision and ended the environmental review, allowing the plans for the mine to proceed. Tom Landwehr, who served five terms as the executive director of the Department of Natural Resources, does not oppose copper mining in Minnesota; in 2018 he worked to approve a proposed open-pit copper-nickel mine near Babbitt. But he believes that there are places where \\"we can't even consider mining\\" and when he looked at the plans for a mine so close to the Boundary Waters he said he was \\"just absolutely stunned.\\" Landwehr noted that the Babbitt mine is in an existing mining area while the Ely site is not only within the BWCA watershed but is covered by forests, lakes and rivers. \\"It is just such a fragile site from the potential for human damages right on the edge of the Boundary Waters. They are two completely different sites, and this is one of those places where you have to say, 'Not this mine, not this site, not now, not ever.'\\" =Controversy over toxic waste storage= Historically, mining waste has been stored in tailings ponds, resulting the release of toxic waste into nearby waters. In July 2019, saying \\"we heeded the evidence that is out there and we listened to the community concerns\\", Twin Metals put out a press release saying it would abandon the plan to use a storage pond, which was to be outside the BWCA watershed near Babbitt, and would instead use the dry stacking method of toxic waste storage. While generally more expensive than a conventional tailings dam, dry storage would not require the expensive construction and operation of a pipeline to ship tailings out of the BWCA watershed. Twin Metals’ chief regulatory officer Julie Padilla said, \\"The key is, it removes that tailings dam. It removes any potential for failure of a dam and spillage in that sense, which is obviously one of the big concerns about this project and others.\\" The state Department of Natural Resources has questioned whether the method can work in Minnesota’s climate. MinnPost wrote that documents show that when the DNR approved dam safety permits for the tailings pond to be used in the Babbitt PolyMet mine it had noted, \\"If dry stack material becomes wet—but isn’t fully submerged in a tailings pond—it can leach heavy metals that can wash into nearby soil and water. The agency also said dry stack tailings can create a toxic dust that also poses environmental risks.\\" Padilla said that Twin Metals can deal with cold and wet weather by using the dry stack method only when weather allows and putting the tailings back into the underground mine, as has already been planned for about 50% of the tailings, during bad weather. A spokesman for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy said that dry stacking is generally better than a tailings basin and dam but the department needed to see more specifics on the plan. Save the Boundary Waters called the decision to store waste at the project site \\"going from bad to worse\\". Of the four mines that Twin Metals has pointed to as successfully using the dry staking system, it said, \\"All are still in operation. This is important because it sometimes takes a decade or two after mining has ended for the full scale of water pollution to become evident. Nonetheless, all mines have polluted and may continue to pollute surrounding surface water, groundwater, or both.\\" Political actions and legal challenges In December 2019, Landwehr and a group of environmentalists asked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to stop the Twin Metals mine, saying, \\"Minnesota shouldn’t even be considering a project that the Obama administration scuttled in 2016 as an unacceptable risk to the country’s most popular wilderness,\\" A spokesperson for Walz responded, \\"The governor believes that no mining project should move forward unless it passes a strict environmental review process that includes meaningful opportunities for public comment.\\" Landwehr also asked that state regulators find the Twin Metals application incomplete because it will not include the findings of the cancelled U.S. Forest Service study under the Obama administration that the Trump administration never released despite numerous requests from members of Congress and others. Landwehr has concluded that the review found that the Twin Metals project should not be allowed to proceed: \\"They wouldn't be withheld if they said the project should be approved.\\" In February 2020, Representative Betty McCollum introduced a bill that would ban new copper- nickel mining in about 365 square miles of the Superior National Forest within in the BWCA watershed (H.R. 5598). She said she believes the BWCA is designated as a federal wilderness that belongs to everyone, not just people who live nearby. She called the proposed type of mining new and untested and said she believed it is not worth what she sees as short-term economic gains. The Minnesota Chippewa (Ojibwe) strongly support McCollum's bill. In a letter to Congress, the tribe wrote, \\"It is unacceptable to trade this precious landscape and our way of life to enrich foreign mining companies that will leave a legacy of degradation that will last forever.\\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2020/0702/Conservation- vs.-copper-Minnesota-town-debates-its-future-with-a-mine Conservation vs. copper: Minnesota town debates its future with a mine By Jack Brook Correspondent The Christian Science Monitor July 2, 2020 Retrieved 9/11/20 =Legal actions= After the reinstatement of Twin Metals' lease, in June 2018 two lawsuits were filed against the Interior Department, one by the Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness and one by the Center for Biological Diversity, the Wilderness Society, and the Izaak Walton League of America and Wilderness. They contend the proposed mine poses risks to the Boundary Waters and that the department did not have the authority to reinstate Twin Metals' leases. Also in June 2018, nine northern Minnesota businesses filed a lawsuit against the Interior Department over its decision to reinstate Twin Metals' leases. The businesses, mostly canoe outfitters, contend that the proposed mine would hurt their business by polluting the Boundary Waters. In May 2020, a large group of environmentalists and others filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington, D.C. The suit alleges the Bureau of Land Management conducted only a limited review rather than an in-depth environmental impact statement as required by law. In August 2020 they filed an amended complaint alleging that there was improper interference to remove the stipulation that lease renewals be subject to Forest Service approval. https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and- mining/6635463-Environmental-groups-allege-Stauber-Emmer-interfered-illegally- in-Twin-Metals-environmental-review Environmental groups allege Stauber, Emmer interfered illegally in Twin Metals environmental reviewBy : Jimmy Lovrien 8/28/20 Duluth News Tribune Retrieved 9/11/20 Opinions and concerns With the beginning of the closing of the Minnesota Iron Range mines in the 1960s, northern Minnesota fell into a decline from which it has never recovered. One worker laid off in 1981 said, \\"We lost our future, we lost our enthusiasm for living. We lost that vibrant group of young people that participated in the economy, [and] we’ve never really recovered, not in population and not in economy.\\" As the principal gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, summers see an influx of tourists that supports numerous outdoor equipment outlets, canoe outfitters, and other establishments, but most of the tourist trade dries up in the winter. Hoping to return to economic prosperity, many Ely residents support the proposed mine and support Trump's reelection because he supports the proposal. Ely mayor Chuck Novak supports the mine and has said, \\"The hope rested with Trump; that’s where the people went … it’s hope. People want hope for a better future. This is the old method of politics: you take care of your economy and your people.\\" https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/minnesota-political- transformation-137289 Minnesota on the edge: ‘I’ve voted Democrat my whole life. It’s getting tougher.’ By Adam Behsudi Politico 3/22/20 Retrieved 9/7/20 Ely resident Sue Schurke, who has established a small manufacturing business designing and marketing winter jackets, disagrees with those who say the tourism economy cannot sustain Ely, but has said, \\"The work ethic in this town is pretty amazing. And these are good people. So, you know, the issue is delicate, because I do have a lot of respect for the people in this community whose families are miners.\\" =Local approval= Local residents are deeply divided over the mine. Some see it as economic salvation and believe it can operate safely and provide hundreds of well-paying jobs. When the Minnesota Chippewa objected to the mine because it could pollute the Boundary Waters, Novak called on residents to stop hosting events at a nearby Native American casino, and the city council unanimously defended his action. One Ely resident said, \\"I do not want the city council kowtowing to these environmental bullies.\\" Many Ely residents still harbor anger over losing \\"their lake\\" when the area became protected from development by the 1964 Wilderness Act, followed by a federal law that officially designated it the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in 1978. At that time the lakes were lined with hundreds of cottages and locally owned resorts. Power boats brought residents to distant lakes with ease. Longtime Ely resident Bill Erzar has said that Ely residents feel they didn’t receive fair compensation from the government: \\"It was devastating to this community. Lots of my friends’ families lost everything fighting the government to keep their property.\\" Only one home and business were allowed to remain, that of Dorothy Molter, the \\"Root Beer Lady\\". Former Ely Mayor Roger Skraba still resents the establishment of the BWCA and has said, \\"Is there a bad taste in my mouth? Absolutely. Will it go away? When I’m dead.\\" He sees those opposing the mine as liberal environmentalists trying to impose their values on others. Skraba has said he met with Jean Paul Luksic, the Chilean billionaire whose family owns Antofagasta, and that Luksic made a good impression on him, leading him to believe the company will respect the Boundary Waters. Former Twin Metals special projects manager David Oliver moved to Ely in 2007 to work on the project. Twin Metals claims its site contains 99% of U.S. nickel reserves, 88% of its cobalt reserves, and a third of the nation’s copper reserves. Oliver has said, \\"these materials are used by everyone, including critics of the mine, and are going to have to come from somewhere.\\" Oliver, who was the chairman of the Ely area Republican caucus, has said of liberals, \\"They hate the country. They hate the flag. They hate the military. They hate God. They hate anything that has to do with resource extraction.\\" =Local opposition= Environmentalists oppose the proposal. Longtime Ely resident Paul Schurke, who along with Will Steger made the first unsupported dogsled trip to the North Pole, has said that local mine supporters are being “hoodwinked...if they score the permits, they'll sit on them until the market improves and until expensive mining manpower has been replaced by robotics.” https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/minnesota- political-transformation-137289 Minnesota on the edge: ‘I’ve voted Democrat my whole life. It’s getting tougher.’ By Adam Behsudi Politico 3/22/20 Retrieved 9/7/20 Ely resident Becky Rom has been leading wilderness trips and speaking out for the preservation of the Boundary Waters since she was a girl. She adamantly opposes the mining proposal, making her \\"the most reviled person in the room\\" when she attended a recent city council meeting. Rom and Landwehr believe that environmental reviews are inadequate to maintain the BWCA's integrity because existing regulations do not address the specific risks of Twin Metals' proposal and permit some degradation. Ely resident Kris Hallberg, a retired World Bank economist, says there is a national trend of recreation replacing mining in driving economic growth and that Ely has hundreds of operating businesses, a renowned wolf center, art galleries, a museum, and a range of festivals held every year. Speaking to a small group of Ely residents, she reported the results of a Harvard University economics professor's analysis of Ely's projected future with and without the mine: \\"Twin Metals estimates it will bring at least 700 direct jobs and 1,400 spin- off ones, and the analysis found this would undeniably benefit the region. But the gains would be short-lived once the mine shut down after its projected 25-year lifespan and would undercut the outdoors-based economy that, along with tourists, has drawn entrepreneurs and professionals to live and work near the Boundary Waters.\\" =State and national opinions= In February 2020 a Star Tribune/MPR News poll found that 60% of Minnesotans oppose new mining near the BWCA and 22% support it. When asked whether providing jobs or protecting the environment was more important when it comes to mining, 66% said the environment was a higher priority and 19% said jobs were. The poll found slightly different results in northern Minnesota. There, 60% said the environment was more important, while 23% said jobs were. The poll did not name the mine specifically. https://www.startribune.com/minnesotans-opposed- to-new-mining-near-boundary-waters-poll-shows/568158962/Minnesotans opposed to new mining near Boundary Waters, poll shows By Jennifer Bjorhus The Star Tribune Feb 25, 2020 The Center for American Progress has listed numerous concerns about Twin Metals' plans: * The conglomerate that Twin Metals is a subsidiary of has been involved in a number of corruption, bribery, and other scandals in its home country. * \\"The Boundary Waters case is emblematic of the Trump administration’s modus operandi: bypass the regulatory process by shortcutting scientific assessment, ignoring local opposition, and bending the law. * A 2012 study found that every copper mining operation had experienced a spill or accidental release. * Sulfide-ore mining is a well-documented cause of catastrophic pollution and could cause catastrophic pollution to a wilderness area. The BWCA is especially vulnerable due to its shallow groundwater and numerous lakes and streams. The Star Tribune editorial board opposes copper mining so close to the Boundary Waters. It wrote that Congress recently decided that metal mining is too risky to be allowed on public lands near Yellowstone National Park and that a similar buffer zone should be established around the BWCA: \\"Minnesotans often think of the BWCA as a regional attraction. The reality is that it’s a world-class preserve offering an experience that the nation’s marquee parks in the arid American West cannot rival. Visitors come from across the nation and around the globe.\\" Tom Tidwell, who was chief of the U.S. Forest Service from 2009 to 2017, opposes the project and the cancellation of the more in-depth study, saying, \\"The vast network of waterways in the Boundary Waters region makes it particularly vulnerable to acid mine drainage. The increased acidity and heavy metal pollution could be catastrophic. It would be impossible to contain pollution given the interconnectedness of the waters. Compounding the problem is the absence of natural calcium carbonates, which means the water has virtually no capacity to buffer acid mine drainage.\\" https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/opinion/columns/4524156-local-view- industrial-mining-must-be-kept-away-boundary-waters Local View: Industrial mining must be kept away from the Boundary Waters By: Tom Tidwell The Duluth News Tribune Nov 3rd 2018 Retrieved 9/17/20 Betty McCollum filed an objection with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to the mine and the process, detailing risks, impacts and criticism of process issues.https://mccollum.house.gov/sites/mccollum.house.gov/files/documents/18.1105%20USDA%20DOI%20letter%20on%20SNF%20Mineral%20Withdrawal%20cancellation.pdf Novermer 5th, 2018 Retrieved 9/17/20 Other environmental concerns Surface water pollution is the most often cited pollution concern.

Although the university mascot has since evolved into the Bulls, the fight song name preserves the history of this USF icon. In 2011, the university athletics department launched a campaign to encourage students, faculty, staff, and fans to memorize the song.  Lyrics  USF Bulls are we, We hold our standard upright and free. For Green and Gold we stand united. Our beacon lighted and noble to see. USF Bulls are we, For USF we'll always be. With all our might we fight the battle Here and now, and we will win the victory! (shout) S-O-U-T-H F-L-O-R-I-D-A South Florida, South Florida Go Bulls Go!

In it, the author argues against La Convivencia, the hypothesis that the Spanish Islamic realms (Al- Andalus) were religiously tolerant. Background and contents Fernández- Morera is a Cuban-born associate professor at Northwestern University in the United States, specialising in the literature of Miguel Cervantes. ICI Books is the publishing arm of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, an American conservative think tank. The author believes that left-wing academics, journalists and politicians misrepresent the tolerance in Al-Andalus to promote their own agendas in modern times. He argues that the Umayyad conquest of Hispania destroyed Visigothic Spain when it was flourishing culturally. He mentions the important role of slavery in the economy of Al-Andalus, as well as the jizya tax taken from Christians and Jews as part of their dhimmi minority status that was higher than the equivalent zakat tax for Muslims. He details the persecution of religious minorities under the later Almohad and Almoravid dynasties, such as the Almohad emir Abu Yusuf who is said to have boasted that he had destroyed every church and synagogue in his realm. Reception Trevor J. Dadson called the book \\"a definite must-read for anyone interested in medieval Spain\\".Review in The Modern Language Review 113.2 (2018): 421–423. Alberto Ferreiro also gave the work a positive review, expressing a desire for a Spanish translation.Review in Anuario de Historia de la Iglesia 26 (2017): 574–576. Maribel Fierro finds that Fernández-Morera often \\"lacks first-hand knowledge of his subject matter and has misinterpreted his readings\\" and his book is \\"will not lead to a better understanding of al- Andalus\\" but is \\"useful in understanding how al-Andalus is employed to fight the battles of the present\\".Review in al-Qantara 39.1 (2018): 248–253. David F. Forte, a professor of law at Cleveland State University, wrote that the level of research for the book was \\"prodigious\\", but its organisation was poor and it \\"veers between genuine scholarship, pedantry, and advocacy\\". He noted some double standards in Fernández-Morera's argument: the Visigoths were praised for borrowing from their Roman predecessors, while the Muslims are chastised for doing the same; the book similarly mentions the Muslims' roles in the slave trade in Iberia and Africa, but not how the Christian Spaniards were involved in the same practices. Forte writes that the best research in the book is on how Iberian Christians and Jews dealt with internal rifts in the same era; the Jews against the Karaite sect and the Christians against Arianism. S. J. Pearce, an associate professor of Spanish and Portuguese at New York University and specialist on medieval Spain, wrote a scathing review of the book. She wrote that \\"The Myths myth is a myth\\", accusing Fernández- Morera of constructing a straw man argument of medieval Islamic tolerance that is not the modern academic consensus, as well as \\"It would be a book-length corrective that would address and properly contextualize and source all of the errors that occur at every level in The Myth\\". She repeated her criticism in a 44-page chapter in The Extreme Right and the Revision of History.

The 33 beds were completely excavated for construction of Douglas Dam by the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1942, but yielded articulated arthropod fossils including Chasmataspis and Douglasocaris. Fossil plant compressions from this unit reveal the variety of non-vascular plants which lived on land before Silurian evolution of vascular land plants .  Biota  The Douglas Dam Lagerstatte has long been known for its articulated xiphosuran or eurypterid Chasmataspis laurenci and phyllocarid Douglasocaris collinsi. Also found were compression fossils of a variety of non-vascular land plants, including hornwort Casterlorum crispum, liverwort Cestites mirabilis, balloonwort Janegraya sibylla, peat moss Dollyphyton boucotii. and harsh moss Edwardsiphyton ovatum. Also found were remains of the mycorrhizal fungus Palaeoglomus strotheri and the likely lichen Prototaxites honeggeri.  Depositional setting  The fossils are in shaley fill of a paleokarst depression deep into the paleoplateau of the Mascot Dolomite, and this fill grades up into the marine Lenoir Limestone. This is a geological setting like modern cenote depressions in Yucatan.  Preservation  The fossils are compressions of original carapaces of the arthropods and the organic carbon of the plant fossils.  Location and stratigraphy  The fossils are in shaley fill of a paleokarst depression into the Mascot Dolomite, so younger than Floian.

Early life She was born Florence A. Faxon in 1859, the daughter of George H. Faxon (1824-1886) and Eliza Otis Pope (1824-1869), a musically gifted and prosperous family with connections. She grew up in an environment that played a big emphasis on musical composition. Her father was a member of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, and was an accomplished tenor singer. Some sources refer to him as being the director of this society in Boston. By profession, he was a dealer in the supplies of piano manufacture. Since her father was a key member of the Handel and Haydn Society, she would have witnessed the preparations for the celebrations marking the effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, followed by the societies golden jubilee in 1865, which consisted of a five-day festival of nine concerts, employing a chorus of 700. Two years later the New England Conservatory of Music was established. At the age of nine her mother passed away. She focused her effort into writing music. At the age of thirteen, in 1872, the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival was taking place in Boston. Career By 1881, at the age of twenty, she had been published by Oliver Ditson, founder of Oliver Ditson and Company, one of the major music publishing houses of the late 19th century. Under the name F. Atherton, she published some of her earliest compositions, such as “St. Botolph March”. She was now a prominent music teacher in Boston and an acclaimed composer and chose a professional name, which wasn’t her birth name. She continued to publish her works under the name of Florence Atherton. Atherton was her middle name, a legacy inherited from her maternal ancestors. During her formative years, Samuel Atherton (1815-1895) was highly involved in the Stoughton Musical Society, the oldest in the country, which had been set up by a number of male singers in honor of her great grandfather William Billings. Samuel Atherton, like many of her family had moved from Stoughton, Massachusetts to Boston. He was instrumental in building up Boston reputation in the arts during this period, particularly once elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1867. After Ditson’s death in 1888, she was published by another Boston house, Allan & Co., immediately followed in 1901 by C. W. Thompson & Co, a relationship which lasted the rest of her professional career. “The Reverie”, for the piano, became a lasting success. It was arranged for orchestra and for the organ. She later, upon marriage at the age of twenty six , published under the name of Florence Atherton Spalding . Less than 12 months later her father died. As Mrs Spalding, she would have followed the inauguration of the Peabody Mason Concerts in 1891. Her composition “Liebestraum” was submitted, allegedly without her knowledge to the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, which was referred to at the time as the Chicago World‘s Fair. Her composition was well received and she was awarded a medal and a diploma. By 1901 she was widely known across the country, with the widening availability of parlor sheet music. She composed the music for a New York operetta called “Lady Nancy”, which ran during the 1904 season. Spalding continued to write and publish new compositions up to 1916. =Artists that have played her compositions have included= * Roland Hayes: During his 1916 performance at Boston’s Jordan Hall he played “Lieberatraum” (Dream of Love), supported by violinist Wesley Howard and Lawrence Benjamin Brown on the keyboard. He continued to play her songs during his long career. * Gustav Strube: During the 1901 summer season at the Boston Pops Orchestra in the newly inaugurated Symphony Hall, Boston, he delivered one of her waltz compositions called “Traumwelt: Dream-World”. =List of Compositions= * “St Botolphs March” (1881) * “Reverie” (1890) * “The song “O Liebestraum“ or “Dream of love” * “Bewildering eyes“ * “Challenge of the rose” * “The way to sleepy town“ * “Tipperary in the spring” * “Traumwelt: Dream-World” (1901) * “March on! over there” (1918) * “Norwegian Romance” (1916) (*) not a complete list of her works Personal She married George Frederick Spalding (1859-1946) of Newton, Massachusetts at the age of twenty- six, in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 18, 1885. Her husband was a Harvard graduate of 1883, who commenced a shoe manufacturing business immediately after completing his studies and became a successful Boston merchant. =Children of Florence Atherton Faxon and George Frederick Spalding= They had five children. The first was born in Connecticut, where she resided for a time. The others were born upon their return to Massachusetts. Her eldest was Atherton Spaulding (1887-1955); in keeping with her love for the old family name. Her youngest son, John Varnum Spalding (1897-1979), was an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1944 to 1971. Her daughter Margaret “Peggy” Spalding (1898-1917) early life experiences are covered a book titled, “The girl in the Text”, which relates a same sex relationship amongst two females in Cape Cod and their subsequent double suicide. Her two other youngest children were Rosamond Spalding (1891-1976) and Robert E. Spalding (1893-1966). Death She died in 1933 and is buried at Pine Grove Cemetery, Lynn, Massachusetts. Ancestry Her paternal grandfather was Oren J. Faxon. He ran a piano manufacturing company called O. J. Faxon & Co. Her father and uncle, Edwin Faxon, took over the family business and are mentioned in the Boston Directory (1889) as “Manufacturers of Rolled and Sheet Brass and German Silver, Brass, Copper, German Silver and Insulated Wire, Seamless Brass and Copper Tubes“. They describe themselves as an old established house in the city of Boston extensively engaged in the manufacture of pianos. Her maternal ancestors, the Pope family were pioneer emigrants to Dorchester, Massachusetts in the 1600s, who intermarried with the Billings and Athertons. Musical family heritage had flowed down both the maternal and paternal lines. Her great-grandfather, William Billings, is regarded as the first American choral composer, and was leading member of the First New England School. During her lifetime her cousin was the renowned Boston composer, Percy Lee Atherton, a descendant of Major General Humphrey Atherton. Both had compositions at the turn of the 1900s featured in the Boston Pops Orchestra. Notes Many of Spalding’s compositions were initially published as “F. Atherton”, prior to being copyrighted by her as Florence Atherton Spalding. Her use of the Atherton name had caused some confusion for biographical researchers of the Philadelphia composer, Frank Peabody Atherton. There is no connection to Faxon Atherton. He had a daughter called Florence Atherton. No association.

However, no fatalities had been reported. Meteorological history An area of persistent convection formed within the proximity of a through that would spawn Tropical Storm Jangmi on August 7, west of Luzon. As Jangmi became the dominant system in the area, this low-pressure area remained disorganized. However, on the next day, as Jangmi moved away from the area, the system began to organize, and on August 9, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a Tropical Depression. Soon after, at 8:00 p.m. PST, the PAGASA followed and upgraded the storm and gave it the name Ferdie. By the next day, the JTWC upgraded Ferdie into a tropical storm. PAGASA then issued its last warning as Ferdie exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility. Then soon, the JMA followed suit and upgraded Ferdie to a tropical storm, giving it the international name Mekkhala. At 07:30 CST on August 11 (23:30 UTC on August 10), Mekkhala made landfall at Zhangpu County in Fujian, China shortly after peak intensity. Preparations and impact =Philippines and Taiwan= Mekkhala forced a Signal No. 1 warning to be placed for the Ilocos region in the Philippines as it brought monsoonal conditions to portions of Luzon, shortly after its formation. Although, Mekkhala remain well to the west of Taiwan, the storm still brought rounds of heavy rainfall to the island. =China= In preparation for Mekkhala, officials in China suspended ferry services and forced ships back to port. The China Meteorological Administration issued a Level III emergency response, while flood control workers were sent to areas hit by Mekkhala. Train services and hundreds of flights were cancelled as Mekkhala neared. The Xiamen Flood Control reported that 3,200 people evacuated ahead of the storm. Mekkhala caused heavy precipitation amounts over China up to 7.847 inches (200 mm) in some areas. In Zhangpu County, Fujian, roofs of wooden homes were torn off at a tourism site where 30 people were sheltering. In Zhangzhou, damage from Mekkhala totaled to 1.1 billion yuan (US$159 million), where vehicles were forced to shelter along highways due to strong winds.

Murrow School (now College) of Communication at Washington State University, sued four administrators in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights. action when they allegedly retaliated against him after he circulated a 7-Step Plan calling for a restructuring of the academic units and urging administrators to seek accreditation for the program. In 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington granted summary judgment for the Defendant administrators, holding the plan was written as part of Demers's official duties and, therefore, was unprotected under Garcetti. The district court also held that the plan did not address a matter of public concern. Writing for a three-judge panel in Seattle, lead judge William A. Fletcher declared that Demers's Plan was protected speech and dealt with matters of public concern. The appeals court reinstated the lawsuit. Fletcher wrote: \\"[T]eaching and academic writing are at the core of the official duties of teachers and professors. Such teaching and writing are 'a special concern of the First Amendment.' ... We conclude that if applied to teaching and academic writing, Garcetti would directly conflict with the important First Amendment values previously articulated by the Supreme Court. ... (which) has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting academic freedom under the First Amendment. ... \\" The university declined to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and eventually paid Demers $120,000 to drop the lawsuit.The suit was settled in October 2014. Source: David Demers The Demers decision is precedent in only nine states in the West. There is no on-the-job free-speech protection for professors in the other 41 states, who can be punished for criticizing administrators' policies and decisions even when they deal with issues of teaching or scholarship. Matthew Jay Hertzog, director of Educational Technology at Methodist College, writes that Demers v. Austin and other cases are establishing Constitutional protection for academic freedom. \\"With the decisions of the lower courts in these cases being reversed by various U.S. Courts of Appeals ... , the constitutionally protected rights of academics for their academic speech and writing is being recognized as a First Amendment protection. As social and political events within higher education over the past several years have led university administrators to question the parameters of Constitutional protections and challenge the academic’s right to freedom of speech, the U.S. legal system has remained firm in its interpretation of the law by protecting a professor’s civil rights as well as those rights awarded to their academic speech and writings.Matthew Jay Hertzog, “The Misapplication of Garcetti in Higher Education,” Brigham Young University Education and Law Journal, 2015(1): 203-225 (Spring 2015), pp. 223-224. Demers himself has argued that the \\"single most important consequence of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Demers v. Austin is the constitutional protection that it offers for shared governance in nine western states. The assumption underlying the Appeals Court ruling is that teaching and scholarship are impacted by the structure of the organization and its resources. And if those who do the teaching and scholarship have no say in how academic units are structured and how resources are distributed, then the academic search for truth, knowledge and understanding of the world will be compromised.\\"David Demers, The Lonely Activist: An American Odyssey (Spokane, WA: Marquette Books, 2015), p. 432. “Had the Ninth Circuit ruled the other way,\\" legal scholar Kenneth White, a former prosecutor, writes, \\"then the state could fire professors at will if it didn’t like, for instance, the stance that a history professor took about a historical event, or a political science professor took about a political dispute, or any professor took about an issue of academic governance on a committee.”Ken White, “Ninth Circuit Clarifies First Amendment Rights of Public University Professors,” Popehat (September 5, 2013), retrieved September 5, 2020 from .

Dorn was one of the lands mentioned in King Edgar's Charter to the church at Worcester in 972. It was apparently included in the manor of Blockley in 1086, and became part of the parish of Blockley and therefore part of Worcestershire until 1931, when Blockley was transferred to Gloucestershire. In 1935 Dorn was transferred from the civil parish of Blockley to the civil parish of Batsford.

This myth, in its Christianized form, survived until the nineteenth and twentieth century in various parts of the Slavdom in chronicles or folklore. In the Slavic mythology there are three versions of this myth: the first version is the so-called earth-diver myth, which intertwines two main motifs: the dualistic motif – the cooperation of God and the Devil (that is, the \\"good god\\" and the \\"bad god\\") is required to create the world, and the oceanic motif – the pre-existence water, where the seed of the Earth comes from; the second version speaks about the origin of the universe and the world from the Cosmic Egg and the World Tree; the third one about creation from a dismemberment of a primordial being.  Creation of the world  = Creation by diving = The myth that has been preserved from Poland comes from the Sieradz Land and was written down in 1898: In the Russian and Ukrainian variants, the devil retains some of the sand created under the tongue, and when the Earth begins to grow, the sand bursts out his mouth. This myth was written by the Russian slavist Alexander Afanasyev, who was one of the first researchers to study Russian folklore in 1859: Creation of the Earth, Maxim Sukharev. The dualistic creation myth by \\"evil god\\" diving has 24 credentials in Balto-Slavic areas and 12 credentials in Finno-Ugric areas. The Bulgarian myth does not mention the Devil's catastrophe, but it develops the theme of creation by the formula \\"by God's and my power\\", and the Devil, who twice reversed the order of the formula, could not reach the bottom until the third time he pronounced the formula correctly, reached the bottom. The Moldavian variant also ends with the expansion of the Earth and the Transylvanian Romani extended the dualistic motif by punishing the devil by the bull and the Tree of Life, from which the people were formed. Only in a myth from Slovenia God goes to the bottom of the waters on His own. In another version of the myth, the Devil tries to push God into the sea to become the only creator – first he pushes him east, then west, south and north, but the land always expands. Annoyed by this fact, the Devil awakens God and tells him that it is time to bless the Earth, since it has grown so big. God suits him: \\"Once you carried me four ways to the water to throw me into it, you drew a cross with me, and this is how I blessed the earth myself.\\" Then God goes to the Heavens and Devil, who attacked him, was thrown down into the abyss by lightning. Seemingly, the consecration of the earth seems to be a Christian motif, but this motif is used in myths to set directions and exists in other mythologies: according to the Maidu, the Earth Maker descended into the cosmic center of the world and there he met a Coyote (a trickster figure), who after the creation of the world went to sleep. The Earth Maker stretched the earth from the south, through the west, to the north, and when the Coyote woke up, he stretched the earth to the east. When the Earth Maker was left alone, he went around the earth, staggering a full circle, fixing (in one version of the myth) the Earth to cardinal directions with stone hooks. For some Indian tribes, therefore, determining the directions of the world is a religious activity and for this reason, the Mexican Huicholas interpret Christian sign of the cross as an imitation of the Indian myth. For the Slavs, therefore, \\"consecration to the Earth\\" is the structuring of the universe and the designation of the directions of the Earth, and the extension of the point state \\"to infinity\\". Yet another myth says that the earth grows all the time and God, who is left alone, does not know how to stop it. So God sends a bee to overhear the Devil. The Devil, laughing at God, says to himself: a stupid God does not know that you have to take some stick, draw the sign of the cross and say \\"Enough of this Earth!\\" When the Devil saw a bee running away on his shoulder, he tried to catch it, but it ran away from him, so he cursed her master: \\"May he who sent you here eat your dung,\\" and God, who heard this, ordered the bee to produce honey from now on. A myth from Dobrzyń Land says that the Devil tells the duck to steal some earth from God, and when she was returning with the earth in her beak, she was captured by a hawk, who started choking her, and from the earth that fell out of her beak, mountains were created. For the creation of the world or of a being, the cooperation of God and the Devil is always required, who are endowed with equal power. Researchers also identify Slavic gods who hide under the Christian terms God and Devil. The Slavic word for God Bog or Boh was used by Christian missionaries as an equivalent of the Latin Deus and the Greek Theos because it corresponded meaningfully to the notion of a supernatural being, but in the Slavic religion, Bog always appears in compound names, i.e. Daž-bog, Stri-bog, Cherno-bog, or in names i.e. Boži-dar, Bohu-mil, Bogu-slav, etc., so most probably God was not a proper name for the figure mentioned in the myths of creation. When interpreting the figure of God, the text of Procopius on the religion of the Slavs may be helpful: , analyzing the folk image of the Christian God, indicates that God sits in heaven, sends rains in anger, shoots lightning at evil spirits, rules predatory animals and fate. These features indicate a god-thunderer, and therefore most likely Perun was replaced by God. Perun is one of the oldest Indo-European gods and is descended from the Proto-Indo-European storm god *perkʷunos. His name probably means literally the \\"Striking One\\" (compare Proto-Slavic *pьrati - \\"to beat, to hit\\"). The core *perkʷ means oak (cf. Latin querqus - \\"oak\\") - a sacred tree dedicated to Perun. In Ruthenian chronicles, he is presented as gray- haired, which would distinguish him from the Celtic Taranis, Germanic Thor or Hindu Indra as war gods, and made him resemble Roman Jupiter and Greek Zeus as rulers. However, according to some researchers, such as Henryk Łowmiański, the description of God rather points to Svarog. The Devil is interpreted as Veles, the god of the underworld. In Primary Chronicle, the Ruthenians, when making an alliance with the Greeks, swear on Perun and Veles, which may suggest that Veles' power was comparable to that of Perun. In Polish language (and in some other Slavic languages too), just as Perun (Piorun) was devalued to the piorun \\"lightning\\", so Veles was devalued to the veles \\"devil, demon\\" in Czech language. In South Slavic folklore, St. Elijah, the Christianized Perun, is often opposed to St. Nicholas, the Christianized Veles. The creation myth also fits Chernobog (lit. \\"Black God\\") and Belobog (lit. \\"White God\\"), who were to be worshiped by the Polabian Slavs: This myth may come from some ancient substrate, perhaps pre-European, assimilated by the Slavs and subjected to further transformations. This myth could also be perpetuated under the influence of the Persian antithetical couple Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, who left their mark in various syncretic religions. Bogomil's influence was also suggested: the followers of this religion claimed that the main drama of creation was the conflict between two brothers: the older Satanael (the suffix -el adds the divine element to Devil) and the younger Jesus (Savaof – the Word = Logos-Christ) – Satanael created the world and man, and God sent him the Word in the form of Jesus to save them. In the 16th century Legend of the Tiberian Sea, God, when he hovered over the water, saw Satanael as a water bird and ordered him to dive into the sea. According to the critics of this theory, it has serious shortcomings: the full text of this myth does not appear in any Bogomil texts, and this myth does not exist in areas dominated by Bogomilism, also in Western Europe, where the Cathars influenced the local folklore. This myth, however, existed in the territories of Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, where the Bogomil faith never reached. = Creation from the Cosmic Egg = alt= The myth in which the creation of the world from the Cosmic Egg or World Egg can be found in the Carpathian carol also written down by Afanasayev: {  :It used to be at the beginning of the world – :Then there was no sky or earth, :No sky nor earth but the blue sea, :And in the middle of the sea on oak :Two pigeons were sitting. :Two pigeons on an oak tree :They held such a council, :Happy debated and cooed: :How can we create the world? :We will fall to the bottom of the sea, :We'll bring out the fine sand :Fine sand, blue stone. :We will sow fine sand, :We will pick up the blue pebble. :From fine sand - black earth, :- icey water, green grass. :From the blue stone - the blue sky, :Blue sky, bright sun, :Bright sun, bright moon, :bright moon and all the stars } Russian ornament, 19th century. This carol contains three elements: the first one is two pigeons sitting on an oak tree, the second one is the catching of sand and stones by birds, the third is the creation of the world. Two pigeons, birds, hens or bees sitting in the crown of the tree is a popular motif among the Slavs – it represents the World Tree. In folklore, the World Tree stands in the \\"navel of the world\\", it is supposed to be heavy, tall and with a wide leaf. In a similar preserved myth, God throws his staff into the water, which then changes into a tree. On its branch, God and the Devil sit down to take the world out of the water. The relationship of this prayer with the World Egg is indicated by the \\"fine sand\\" from which the \\"black earth\\" and the \\"blue stones\\" from which the heaven and the celestial objects are made. This corresponds to the widespread myths of the Cosmic Egg, which is broken down in the creative act, and from whose lower shell the Earth is formed, and from whose upper shell the Heavens are formed. Vladimir Toporov also points to the existence of this myth in Russian fairy tales. In these fairy tales, the hero, looking for a princess, travels through three kingdoms, and after defeating three vipers, the kingdoms are reduced to three eggs. Fairy-tale eggs are generally submerged in water and their extraction and breaking up creates a \\"kingdom\\" – a world in fairy tongue. Also, the triple of egg-kingdoms is not accidental – it corresponds to the tripartite division of the world in Indo-European mythologies into Heaven (Vyraj), Earth and the Underworld (Nav). In Dobrzyń Land, it was directly believed that the world was created from an egg lying on a giant tree and the story of the princess from the egg, which the prince was to marry, was preserved: she was tricked by a witch into a duck that was killed, whose blood then grew into an apple tree. From Slovenia the myth has survived, where God sends a rooster to earth, who lays an egg from which seven rivers are poured: There were also riddles in Poland that pointed to the egg: \\"There is a world. And in this world there is a yellow flower\\" or \\"There is a white world. And in this world a yellow flower\\". = Creation from dismemberment = Another kind of creation myth has survived: the creation of the world from a dismembered first human or another being. Polish scholar Stanislaw Schayer recalled the text from the Dove Book, which was a collection of oral stories of the clergy, the following story: a great book fell from heaven, in which the history of being was written; kings ask tsar David to read it, but the book is too big, but David, inspired by the Holy Spirit, will answer three questions; the first one concerns the creation of the world: {  :Our white world has come from the Lord :The red sun from God's face :The young light of the moon from His chest :White auroras from God's eyes :The dense stars of His robes :Lush winds of the Holy Spirit :People of God from Adam :Clotted bones taken from stone :Our bodies from moist soil } In four variants, the last three lines replace the text: {  :Hence the tsars here on earth :From the holy head of Adam. :Hence the knyaz and boyars were born: :From the holy powers of Adam. :Hence the Orthodox peasants: :From the holy knee of Adam } This myth is most likely not a Christian influence, but Slavic phraseology has been Christianized, probably under the influence of the apocryphal Book of Enoch, in which the same was done with the Iranian myth, which in turn could have been the source of the Russian myth. A similar motif is present in other Indo-European myths: in Hindu mythology a society was formed from the body of Purusha – the first man: brahmins from the mouth, warriors from the shoulders, peasants from the hips, shudras from the feet; in Scandinavia this being was Ymir and in Iran Gayōmart.  Functioning of the world  The world is sustained by animals or fish. In the myth described by Afanasayev, the world is sustained by whales: at first there were seven of them, but three are gone and four are left. Then one died and three are left and therefore the world is crooked. A similar myth, where the fall of one of the \\"pillars of the world\\" causes a catastrophe, occurs, for example, in China. Such a decomposition of the original seven: 3 + 1 + 3 can testify to the multiplicity of worlds - three were before ours and three will be after ours. A similar motif exists among Hopi Indians or in the doctrine of the five worlds of Bambara. The world, in order not to break, is wrapped around it is the Zmiy or Zmiya (Viper). This can mean a constant threat from one of the creators. A similar theme exists in Nordic mythology (Jörmungandr). The dome of the world was made of stone, sometimes of silicon, which explained the formation of lightning, or of blue gemstone, which is a symbol of the stated time. The dome, especially in the Western Slavs, was based on a \\"pillar\\". (a kind of Axis Mundi – Cosmic Tree) running from the Pole Star, which rotates the whole vault. The location of the contact between the pillar and the vault and the ground had specific characteristics: these places were called the zabka (frog) or sierdzeń (gudgeon pin), which is connected to the constellation of the Great and Little Wagon. In the Slavs, the souls of the dead travelled to the Undergrounds via a bridge - at night it was the Milky Way and during the day it was a rainbow. In the materials collected by such a Milky Way is called the Way of the Soul, the Way of the [blue] Army and it was spilled with stardust. The other Axis Mundi connecting the worlds was the Tree of the Family, connected to the dziady – the deceased's name is also his identity, and it lasts until someone mentions his name, until his name is forgotten and he joins the nameless group of souls. The souls already in the afterlife return to Earth in the rays of the sun. For the Slavs, Cosmic Trees could function as Cosmic Mountains. Mountains were often treated as magical places, temples were built on them or rituals were performed there. The mountains such as Ślęża, Kyiv Hill or Bald Mountain were especially popular, the Montenegrins called Durmitor mountain \\"the Blue Column\\", and the Slovaks considered Kriváň as a sacred mountain. In Kievan Rus' it was believed that \\"the high mountain of Triglav appeared first from the water\\".

In 1969, the Commission found serious violations, including torture; the junta reacted by withdrawing from the Council of Europe. The case received significant press coverage and was \\"one of the most famous cases in the Convention’s history\\". On 21 April 1967, right-wing army officers staged a military coup and used mass arrests, purges and censorship to suppress their opposition. Such tactics soon became the target of criticism in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, but Greece justified them as a response to alleged Communist subversion and allowable under Article 15 of the ECHR. In September 1967, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands filed identical cases against Greece alleging violations of most of the articles in the ECHR, which protect individual rights. The case was declared admissible in early 1968; similarly, a second case filed by Denmark, Norway and Sweden for Article 3 violations, after the junta was reported to practice torture, was declared admissible. In 1968 and early 1969, a Subcommission held in camera hearings concerning the case, during which it questioned witnesses and embarked on a fact-finding mission to Greece, cut short due to obstruction by the authorities. Evidence at the trial ran to over 20,000 pages, but was condensed into a 1,200-page report, most of which was devoted to proving systematic torture by the Greek authorities. The Subcommission submitted its report to the Commission in October 1969. It was soon leaked to the press and widely reported, turning European public opinion against Greece. The Commission found violations of Article 3 and most of the other articles. On 12 December 1969, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe considered a resolution on Greece. When it became apparent that Greece would lose the vote, foreign minister Panagiotis Pipinelis denounced the ECHR and walked out. To date, Greece is the only state to leave the Council of Europe; it returned to the body after the Greek democratic transition in 1974. Although the case revealed the limits of the Convention system to curb the behavior of a non-cooperative dictatorship, it also strengthened the legitimacy of the system by isolating and stigmatizing a state responsible for systematic human rights violations. The Commission's report on the case also set a precedent for what it considered torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, and other aspects of the Convention. Background In the aftermath of World War II, European democratic states created the Council of Europe, a European organization dedicated to promoting human rights and preventing a relapse into totalitarianism. The Statute of the Council of Europe (1949) required its members to adhere to a basic standard of democracy and human rights. The Council of Europe approved the draft European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1950, which came into force three years later. The European Commission of Human Rights (1954) and European Court of Human Rights (1959) were set up to adjudicate alleged violations of the Convention. Greece was a founding member of the Council of Europe, and in 1953 the Hellenic Parliament unanimously ratified both the ECHR and its first protocol. Greece did not allow individual petitions to the Commission, so the only way to hold it accountable for violations was through an interstate case. Greece was not a party of the Court and had not ratified Protocol 4 to the Convention. Although the Council of Europe had considerable investigatory abilities, it had hardly any power of sanction; its highest sanction is expulsion from the body. In 1956, Greece filed the first interstate application with the Commission, Greece v United Kingdom, alleging human rights violations in British Cyprus. Anti-junta protest in Stuttgart, West Germany, 1 May 1967 On 21 April 1967, right-wing army officers staged a military coup shortly before the 1967 Greek legislative election was scheduled to occur. Alleging the coup was necessary to save Greece from Communist subversion, the new Greek junta governed the country as a military dictatorship. Its first edict was to issue Royal Decree no. 280, which cancelled the provisions in the 1952 Constitution of Greece that guaranteed democracy and human rights, because of an indefinite official emergency. More than six thousand regime opponents were arrested immediately and imprisoned; purges, martial law, and censorship also targeted the junta's opponents. Throughout the summer, there were public demonstrations outside Greece opposing the junta. The suggestion of referring Greece to the European Commission of Human Rights was first raised by Politiken, a Danish newspaper, a week after the coup. 24 January 1967 meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe The junta became a target of vociferous criticism in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for its human rights violations. On 24 April, the Parliamentary Assembly debated the Greek issue. The Greek representatives were not present at this meeting because the junta dissolved parliament and canceled their credentials. On 26 April, the Assembly passed Directive 256, inquiring into the fate of the missing Greek deputies, calling for the restoration of parliamentary, constitutional democracy, and objecting to \\"all measures contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights\\". Although both the assembly and the Committee of Ministers showed a reluctance to alienate Greece, ignoring the coup entirely would have put the Council of Europe's legitimacy at stake. On 3 May 1967, the junta sent a letter to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, announcing Greece was in a state of emergency, which justified human rights violations under Article 15 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This implicit acknowledgement that the junta did not respect human rights was later seized upon by the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Denmark as the grounds for their complaint to the Commission. Greece did not provide any reason for this derogation until 19 September, which the Commission considered very late. The case =Resolution 346= On 22–24 May, the Legal Committee met and proposed another resolution against the junta. The Standing Committee of the Assembly adopted this as Resolution 346 on 23 June. The resolution stated Greece had violated Article 3 of the Statute of the Council of Europe: \\"Every member of the Council of Europe must accept the principles of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\" The resolution expressed \\"the wish that the Governments of the Contracting Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights refer the Greek case, either separately or jointly, to the European Commission of Human Rights in accordance with Article 248(a) of the Convention\\". On 10 September, the Parliamentary Assembly debated documents prepared by the Legal Committee which stated that, although only the Commission could make a legally binding determination, the Greek derogations of the Convention were not justified. =First application= Under Resolution 346, on 20 September 1967, three member-states of the Council of Europe (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark) filed identical applications against Greece before the Commission. They alleged violations of almost all the Articles in the ECHR which protect individual rights: 5 (right to liberty), 6 (right to a fair trial), 8 (right to privacy), 9 (freedom of conscience), 10 (freedom of expression), 11 (freedom of association), 13 (right to a legal remedy), and 14 (non-discrimination, including on the basis of political belief). In addition, the applicants stated Greece had not shown its invocation of Article 15 to be valid. The applications, based on public decrees which prima facie violated the ECHR, referred to previous discussions in the Parliamentary Assembly in which the Greek junta was criticized. The next day, Belgian politician Fernand Dehousse proposed that the European Community bring a similar case against Greece, with which the EC had an association agreement. Although his proposal did not receive support, the EC cut off all economic aid to Greece. On 27 September, the Netherlands joined the suit with an identical application; the Commission rolled all four cases rolled together on 2 October. Unlike in other interstate cases before the Commission, the Scandinavian countries did not have an ethnic affinity to the victims of human rights violations. Instead, they intervened because they felt it was their moral duty and because public opinion in their countries was opposed to the actions of the Greek junta. The Swedish Social Democratic Party strongly supported the move; MP and cabinet member Alva Myrdal stated, \\"Now today's (Greek) regime is being made to answer for its deeds before the open forum of Europe.\\" Max Sørensen, the president of the Commission, said that the case was \\"the first time that the machinery of the Convention ... had been set rolling by states with no national interest in lodging an application and apparently motivated by the desire to preserve our European heritage of freedom unharmed\\". Although the case was unprecedented in that it was brought without national self-interest, international promotion of human rights was characteristic of Scandinavian foreign policy at the time. Following attempts to boycott goods from the applicant countries in Greece, exporter industries pressured their governments to drop the case. For this reason, the Netherlands withdrew from active participation in the case. Lawyers working for the foreign ministries of Sweden, Norway and Denmark mostly pushed the case forward. Belgium, Luxembourg and Iceland later announced that they supported the actions of the Scandinavian and Dutch governments, with a declaration that was not cited by the Commission and most likely had no legal effect. Attempts to elicit a similar declaration from the United Kingdom were unsuccessful, despite the opposition of many British people to the junta. As one British official stated, the Wilson government \\"did not believe it would be helpful in present circumstances to arraign Greece under the Human Rights Convention\\". The Greeks claimed the case was inadmissible because the junta was a revolutionary government and \\"the original objects of the revolution could not be subject to the control of the Commission\\". It also argued that governments had a margin of appreciation to enact exceptional measures in a public emergency. The Commission found the emergency principle was not applicable because it was intended for governments which operated within a democratic and constitutional framework, and furthermore the junta created the \\"emergency\\" itself. Therefore, it declared the case admissible on 24 January 1968. =Second application= Following reports that Greek oppositionists were subject to torture, the three Scandinavian countries filed another application in March 1968 for breach of Articles 3 (no torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment), and 7 (no ex post facto law), as well as Articles 1 (right to property) and 3 (right to free elections) of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Greek government argued domestic remedies were available for these alleged violations, and therefore the application should be declared inadmissible under Article 26 of the ECHR. The applicants countered that such remedies were \\"in fact inadequate and ineffective\\". The Commission noted three circumstances that undermined the effectiveness of domestic remedies. First, people under administrative detention had no recourse to a court. Second, Decree no. 280 suspended many of the constitutional guarantees related to the judicial system. Third, on 30 May, the Greek junta regime fired 30 prominent judges and prosecutors, including the president of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece, for involvement in a decision that displeased the junta. The Commission noted in its report that this action showed the Greek judicial system lacked judicial independence. Therefore, according to the Commission, \\"in the particular situation prevailing in Greece, the domestic remedies indicated by the respondent government could [not] be considered effective and sufficient\\". The application was declared admissible on 31 May. The allegation of torture raised the public profile of the case in Europe and changed the Greek junta's defense strategy, since Article 15 explicitly forbade derogation of Article 3\\\\. From 1968, the Commission gave the case priority over all other business; as it was a part-time organization, the Greek case absorbed almost all of its time. On 3 April 1968, a Subcommission was formed to examine the Greek case, initially based on the first application. It held hearings at the end of September, deciding to hear witnesses at its subsequent meeting in November. Fact-finding, especially on-location, is rare in ECHR cases compared to other international courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. =Investigation= Panagiotis Pipinelis (right) at Schiphol Airport with representatives of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 16 April 1968 Greece outwardly cooperated with the investigation, but used delaying tactics by requesting a delay at each step of the process which was always granted. Foreign Minister Panagiotis Pipinelis tried to create the impression in the Committee of Ministers, which had all the decision-making power in the Council of Europe, that Greece was willing to change. He thought Western countries could be persuaded to overlook Greece's human rights violations, and that leaving the Council of Europe would only redouble the international pressure against the junta. Pipinelis, a conservative monarchist, tried to use the case as leverage against more hardline elements of the junta for his preferred political solution: the return of King Constantine and elections in 1971. The Greek government tried to hire international lawyers for its defense, but all refused to represent the country. Many Greek lawyers also refused, but Basil Vitsaksis agreed and for his performance was rewarded with an appointment as ambassador to the United States. Hearings with witnesses were held in the last week of November 1968. Although held in camera, journalists reported on them. The Greek government did not allow any hostile witnesses to leave the country, so the Scandinavians recruited Greek exiles to testify. During the hearings, two Greek witnesses brought by the junta escaped and fled to the Norwegian delegation, seeking asylum. They said they had been tortured, and their families in Greece were under threat. Although the junta struck them off the list of witnesses, they were allowed to testify as witnesses for the Commission. One of them did so, the other (Pantelis Marketakis) claimed to have been kidnapped by the head of the Norwegian delegation, Jens Evensen, and returned to Athens without testifying. The Subcommission announced that it would begin its investigation in Greece on 6 February 1969 (later postponed to 9 March at the request of the Greek government), using its power to investigate alleged violations in member countries. Article 28 of the ECHR requires member states \\"furnish all necessary facilities\\" to carry out an investigation. Its interviews were held without either party present, after wanted posters were put out in Greece for Evensen's arrest and because of fears that the presence of Greek officials would intimidate witnesses. Although it allowed some witnesses to testify to the Subcommission, the Greek government obstructed the investigation and prevented it from accessing some witnesses who had physical injuries, allegedly from torture. Because of this obstruction (in particular, not being allowed to visit Leros or ) the Subcommission discontinued its visit. , a prison in Athens investigated by the Commission, pictured After the obstructed visit, the Subcommission refused all requests for delays and the Greek party retaliated by not filing the required paperwork. By this time, more torture victims had escaped from Greece and several testified at hearings in June and July, without the presence of either party. The Subcommission heard from 88 witnesses, collected many documents (some sent clandestinely from Greece) and amassed over 20,000 pages of proceedings. Among those who gave evidence to the Commission were prominent journalists, ministers from the last democratically elected government, including former Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, and military officers such as Konstantinos Engolfopoulos. Those who told the Commission they had suffered brutality in jail included Nikos Konstantopoulos, then a student, and Professors and . The junta also sent hand-picked witnesses to testify. =Friendly settlement attempt= As the investigation was concluding, the Subcommission requested closing remarks from both parties and tried to achieve a friendly settlement as required by Article 28(b); talks began to this effect in March 1969. The Scandinavian countries thought no friendly settlement was possible because torture was forbidden and must be stopped; it could not be negotiable. The Greek government proposed unannounced visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Scandinavian parties also wanted a deadline for free elections, but the Greek government was unwilling to fix a date for parliamentary elections. Because of these differences, a friendly settlement was impossible, and the matter was forwarded to the full Commission. =Findings= On 4 October, the Subcommittee adopted its final report and forwarded it to the full Commission, which adopted it on 5 November. Most of the report's more than 1,200 pages dealt with Articles 3 and 15\\\\. The report contained three sections: \\"History of the Proceedings and Points at Issue\\", \\"Establishment of the Facts and Opinion of the Commission\\" (the bulk of the report), and a shorter section explaining the failed attempt to come to a \\"Friendly Settlement\\". The report was widely praised for its objectivity and rigorous standard of evidence. Relying on direct evidence, the report did not cite the findings of third parties, such as the Red Cross or the reports of the rapporteurs for the Council of Europe's political branch. American lawyer James Becket stated that he found it \\"difficult to imagine how the Commission could have been more thorough in their investigation of the cases [of torture victims] they chose\\". He found the report to be \\"a signal achievement... judicial in tone, objective in its conclusions, [it dealt] systematically and completely with the issues before the Commission\\". Legal expert A. H. Robertson noted that \\"the Commission required corroboration of the allegations made, offered the government every opportunity to rebut the evidence produced and even examined the possibility that (as alleged) many of the accounts of torture were deliberately fabricated as part of a plot to discredit the government\\". The Commission also found that Greece had infringed Articles 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 as well as Article 3 of Protocol 1\\\\. For Article 7 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1, there was no violation. The report makes ten proposals for remedying the human rights violations in Greece; the first eight deal with conditions of detention, control of police and independence of the judiciary while the last two recommend allowing a free press and free elections. With these suggestions, Commissioner Sørensen later recalled, the Commission hoped to convince Greece to promise the Committee of Ministers to restore democracy—the original primary aim of the case, according to Sørensen. On 18 November 1969, the Commission transmitted its report to the Committee of Ministers. Article 3 The cell of Spyros Moustaklis in the Greek Military Police building. As a result of torture, Moustaklis was left mute and partially paralyzed. On the question of Article 3, to which over 300 pages of the report is devoted, it examines 30 alleged cases of torture to the standard of proof required in individual applications, based on the testimony of 58 witnesses. An annex to the report lists the names of 213 people alleged to have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated, and five who were said to have died from their injuries. Rigorous local fact-finding was key to the report's findings and authority regarding Article 3\\\\. Legal scholar Isabella Risini writes that, while the report has a dispassionate tone, \\"The horrific methods of torture and ill-treatment as well as the suffering of individuals at the hands of their tormentors emerge clearly.\\" Commissioner Philip O'Donoghue, later a judge on the European Court of Human Rights, stated in his dissent to Ireland v United Kingdom that, \\"The value of hearing evidence in a local venue cannot be overestimated... No written description, however colorful, could have been as informative as the visit to Bouboulinas Street in Athens.\\" Of the 30 cases, sixteen were fully investigated, and eleven of these could be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The remaining fourteen cases were blocked by Greek obstruction; of these cases, two had \\"indications\\" of torture, seven were \\"prima facie cases\\", and eight had \\"strong indications\\" of torture. The most common form of torture was falanga—the beating of the soles of the feet, which Greek police practiced in various ways, on chairs or benches, with or without shoes. Other forms of torture included generalized beatings, electric shocks, blows to the male genitalia, dripping water onto the head, mock executions, and threats to kill the victims. Besides overt, physical forms of torture, the Commission also considered psychological and mental torture, and poor conditions of imprisonment. According to the Commission, overcrowding, uncleanliness, lack of adequate sleeping arrangements, and the severance of contact with the outside world were also inhumane treatment. The purpose of torture, according to the report, was \\"the extraction of information including confessions concerning the political activities and association of the victims and other persons considered to be subversive\\". Despite numerous substantiated cases of torture reported to the authorities, the authorities had made no effort to investigate, stop the practice, or punish those responsible. Because the torture met both \\"repetition\\" and \\"official tolerance\\" criteria, the Commission determined that the Greek government systematically practiced torture. The Commission was the first international human rights body to find that a state practiced torture as government policy. Article 15 Andreas Papandreou (center) at a press conference in Amsterdam, 24 April 1968. The Subcommission heard 30 witnesses and also examined relevant documents, such as the manifestos of far-left parties related to the dispute over whether Article 15 was applicable. The Greek government claimed that the United Democratic Left (EDA), alleged to have Communist tendencies, was forming a popular front and infiltrating youth organizations to seize power. The respondent governments argued that if EDA was in fact a danger to democracy, its power could be circumscribed by constitutional means, and it had been losing support in previous elections and becoming increasingly politically isolated. After examining the evidence, the Subcommission concluded the Greek communists had given up in their attempt to seize power by force and lacked the means to do so, while the popular front scenario was implausible. In addition, the rapid and effective suppression of junta opponents after the coup was evidence the Communists were \\"incapable of any organised action in a crisis\\". The Greek government also alleged that a \\"crisis of institutions\\" due to political mismanagement made the coup necessary; the applicant countries stated that \\"disapproval of the programme of certain political parties, namely the Centre Union and the EDA, did not of itself entitle the respondent Government to derogate from the Convention under Article 15\\". The Subcommission found that, contrary to the claims of their opponents, the Center Union politicians Georgios and Andreas Papandreou were committed to democratic and constitutional government. The Subcommission also rejected the junta's argument that demonstrations and strikes justified the coup, as these disruptions to public order were not more severe in Greece than other European countries and did not rise to the level of danger to justify derogation. Although the Subcommission found that before the coup there had been an increase of \\"political instability and tension, of an expansion of the activities of the Communists and their allies, and of some public disorder\\", it believed that the elections scheduled for May 1967 would have stabilized the political situation. The Subcommission also investigated whether, even if an imminent danger justified the coup, the derogation could continue afterwards. The Greek government reported disorder that took place after the coup, including the formation of what it deemed to be illegal organizations and a series of bombings between September 1967 and March 1969. Some witnesses stated the repressive measures of the junta had exacerbated the disorder. Although it paid close attention to the bombings, the Subcommission found the authorities could control the situation using \\"normal measures\\". The Commission ruled 10–5 that Article 15 did not apply, either at the time of the coup or at a later date. It ruled the onus was on the Greek government to prove that the \\"emergency\\" could not have been combatted by ordinary, constitutional means, but this had not been proven. Furthermore, the majority judged that Greece's derogation did not meet legal requirements and that being a \\"revolutionary government\\" did not affect Greece's obligations under the Convention. The five dissenting opinions were lengthy, indicating that for their authors this matter represented the crux of the case. Some of these opinions indicated agreement with the Greek government's reasoning that the coup countered an actual \\"serious danger threatening the life of the nation\\", and even agreed with the coup itself. Others argued that a \\"revolutionary government\\" had greater freedom to derogate from the Convention. Legal scholars and argue some of the dissenting opinions are effectively abstentions, which are not allowed under the Commission's rules. , the Greek case is the only time in the history of the Commission or the Court that an invocation of Article 15 was deemed unjustified. Other articles Considering Article 5 in conjunction with Article 15, the Commission found that the Greek government had unjustly restrained liberty, by deporting some citizens from Greece, exiling others to remote islands where they were forbidden to speak with locals and required to report to police twice daily and subjecting others to police supervision. These measures violated the ECHR because they were excessive and disproportionate to the alleged emergency, and because they were not imposed by a court. Imposing martial law, arbitrary suspension of judges and convictions of people for \\"acts directed against the national security and public order\\", were judged to constitute a violation of Article 6 (right to a fair trial). The Commission found no violation of Article 7 over the constitutional amendment of 11 July 1967, alleged to be ex post facto law, because it was not enforced. For Article 11, which guarantees freedom of association, the Commission found that it had been violated as the restrictions were not \\"necessary in a democratic society\\". Instead, the restrictions indicated an attempt to create a \\"police state, which is the antithesis of a 'democratic society\\". The Commission found \\"a flagrant and persistent violation\\" of Article 3 of Protocol 1, which guaranteed the right to vote in elections, as \\"Article 3 of Protocol 1 implies the existence of a representative legislative body elected at reasonable intervals and constituting the basis of a democratic society\\". Because of the indefinite suspension of elections, \\"the Greek people are thus prevented from freely expressing their political opinion by choosing the legislative body in accordance with Article 3 of the said Protocol\\". =Political processes= As Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, Max van der Stoel holds a press conference after returning from Greece, 1 September 1974 The case revealed divisions within the Council of Europe between smaller states that emphasized human rights and larger ones (including the United Kingdom, West Germany, and France) which prioritized keeping Greece within NATO as a Cold War ally against the Eastern Bloc. A key consideration was that the United States did not oppose the Greek junta and, throughout the case, interfered in favor of keeping Greece inside the Council of Europe. However, Western European countries used the case to deflect domestic criticism of their relations with the junta and redirect calls for Greece to be ejected from NATO. Besides the judicial case, political processes against Greece in the Council of Europe had been ongoing in 1968 and 1969. Some Council of Europe politicians, such as Per Federspiel, believed that the human rights violations in Greece were a political problem that needed a political solution, while others, such as Kaj Björk, felt that the Council of Europe's democratic identity was under threat because of the presence of a non-democratic member state. In certain respects the process was similar to the Commission's procedure because a rapporteur, Max van der Stoel, was appointed to visit the country and investigate the facts of the situation. Unlike the Commission's findings, van der Stoel's were not bound by confidentiality. He visited the country three times in 1968, but the junta barred him from returning because it claimed he lacked objectivity and impartiality. He found that, similar to Francoist Spain and the Estado Novo dictatorship in Portugal, which had been refused membership, it was \\"undeniable that the present Greek régime does not fulfill the objective conditions for membership in the Council of Europe as set out in Article 3 of the Statute\\". This was due in part to the lack of rule of law and protection of fundamental freedoms in Greece, and the lack of a parliament prevented Greece's participation in the Parliamentary Assembly. Van der Stoel presented his report and recommendation of expulsion, under Article 8 of the Statue of the Council of Europe, to the Parliamentary Assembly on 30 January 1969. As van der Stoel emphasized, this was distinct from the Commission's work as he did not evaluate if the ECHR had been violated. Following debate, the Parliamentary Assembly passed Resolution 547 (92 for, 11 against, 20 abstentions) which recommended the expulsion of Greece from the Council of Europe. During its meeting on 6 May 1969, the Committee of Ministers resolved to bring Resolution 547 to the attention of the Greek government and scheduled a vote on the resolution for its next meeting on 12 December 1969. Late 1969 saw a scramble for votes on the expulsion of Greece; the junta publicly threatened an economic boycott of the countries that voted for the resolution. Out of eighteen countries, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Iceland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom had already signaled their intention to vote for Greece's expulsion before the 12 December meeting. The United Kingdom had had an ambiguous stance towards Greece, but on 7 December, Prime Minister Harold Wilson gave a speech in the House of Commons indicating that the government would vote against Greece. =Leak of the report = Shortly after the Commission received the report, it was leaked. Summaries and excerpts were published in The Sunday Times on 18 November and Le Monde on 30 November. Extensive newspaper coverage publicized the finding that Greece had violated the ECHR and torture was an official policy of the Greek government. The report echoed the findings of other investigations by Amnesty International and the US Committee for Democracy in Greece. The reports made a strong impact on public opinion; demonstrations against the junta were held across Europe. On 7 December, Greece issued a Note Verbale to the Secretary- General of the Council of Europe denouncing the leak and accusing the Commission of irregularities and bias, which made the report \\"null and void\\" in Greece's opinion. Greece also claimed that the Commission leaked the report to influence the 12 December meeting. The Commission’s Secretariat denied responsibility for the leak; Becket states that it \\"came from Greece itself and constituted an act of resistance by Greeks against the regime\\", according to \\"well-informed sources\\". After the leak, British ambassador to Greece Michael Stewart advised Pipinelis that, if the junta would not agree to a concrete timeline for democratization, it would be best to withdraw voluntarily from the Council of Europe. =Greek exit = On 12 December, the Committee of Ministers met in Paris. Because its rules forbade a vote on the report until it had been in the Committee's hands for three months, it was not discussed at their meeting. Pipinelis, the Greek Foreign Minister, gave a lengthy speech in which he discussed the causes of the 1967 coup, possible reforms in Greece, and the recommendations in the Commission's report. However, since his audience had copies of the Commission's report, and Pipinelis did not give a timeline for elections, his speech was not convincing. Eleven of the eighteen Council of Europe member states sponsored the resolution calling for Greece's expulsion; a resolution by Turkey, Cyprus, and France to delay the vote was unsuccessful. By this time, these states were the only ones to oppose Greece's expulsion, and it became obvious that Greece would lose the vote. Historian Effie Pedaliu suggests the United Kingdom's dropping its support for the junta in the Council process, rattled Pipinelis leading to his sudden reversal. After the president of the Committee, Italian foreign minister Aldo Moro suggested a break for lunch, Pipinelis demanded the floor. In a face-saving move, he announced that Greece was leaving the Council of Europe under Article 7 of the Statue, pursuant to the junta's instructions. This had the effect of denouncing three treaties of which Greece was a party: the Statute of the Council of Europe, the ECHR, and Protocol 1 of the ECHR. Pipinelis called the Commission \\"a conspiracy of homosexuals and communists against Hellenic values\\", declared, \\"We warn our friends in the West: 'Hands off Greece'\\", and walked out. He later told U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers that he regretted the withdrawal, as it furthered Greece's international isolation and led to more pressure against the junta at NATO. The Committee of Ministers passed a resolution stating that Greece had \\"seriously violated Article 3 of the Statute\\" and had withdrawn from the Council of Europe, rendering suspension unnecessary. On 17 December 1969, the Secretary-General released a Note Verbale rejecting Greece's allegations against the Commission. The Committee of Ministers adopted the report at its next meeting on 15 April. It stated the \\"Greek government is not prepared to comply with its continuing obligations under the Convention\\", noting ongoing violations. Therefore, the report would be made public and the \\"Government of Greece [was urged] to restore without delay, human rights and fundamental freedoms in Greece\\" and abolish torture immediately. As Moro stated at the 12 December meeting, in practice Greece immediately ceased to be a member of the Council of Europe. The country announced on 19 February 1970 that it would not participate in any Committee of Ministers meetings as it no longer considered itself a member. Pursuant to Article 65 of the ECHR, Greece ceased to be a party of the ECHR after six months, on 13 June 1970, and de jure left the Council of Europe on 31 December 1970. Second case On 10 April 1970, Denmark, Norway and Sweden filed another application against Greece via telex alleging violations of Articles 5 and 6 related to the ongoing trial of 34 regime opponents before the Extraordinary Military Tribunal of Athens, one of whom seemed likely to be executed. The applicant countries asked the Commission to intercede to prevent any executions from being carried out, a request that was granted. The Secretary-General of the Council of Europe submitted such a request at the behest of the Commission's president. Greece said the application was inadmissible because it had denounced the Convention, and domestic remedies had not been exhausted. The Commission ruled the application provisionally admissible on 26 May, a decision that became final on 16 July as Greece responded to queries. Greece's reasoning was rejected because its withdrawal from the ECHR did not take effect until 13 June and violations that occurred before that date remained justicable. In addition, exhaustion of domestic remedies did not apply because the violations related to \\"administrative practices\\". On 5 October, the Commission decided it could not decide the facts of the case because Greece's refusal to cooperate in the proceedings made it impossible for the Commission to carry out its usual functions. None of the defendants in the trial were executed, although it is unclear if the intervention affected the proceedings in Greece. Following the fall of the junta on 23 July 1974, Greece rejoined the Council of Europe on 28 November 1974. At the request of Greece and the three applicant countries, the case was struck in July 1976. Efficacy and results The report was hailed as a great achievement for exposing human rights violations in a document of substantial authority and credibility. Pedaliu argues that the case helped break down the concept of non-intervention over human rights violations and made it clear that without respecting human rights, a state could not be part of the West. The process triggered extensive press coverage for nearly two years, increasing awareness of the situation in Greece and the ECHR. Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg stated that, \\"The Greek case became a defining lesson for human rights policies in Europe.\\" He argued the expulsion of Greece from the Council of Europe had \\"an influence and a great moral significance for many Greeks\\". The case led to development in the forensics of torture and a focus on developing techniques that could prove that torture had occurred. The case enhanced the prestige and influence of Amnesty International and similar organizations, and caused the Red Cross to reexamine its policies regarding torture. The case revealed the weakness of the Convention system as it existed in the late 1960s, because \\"on its own the Convention system was ultimately unable to prevent the establishment of a totalitarian regime\\", the main purpose of those who had proposed it in 1950. Unlike other cases before the Commission at the time, but similar to Ireland v United Kingdom (the case of the so-called five techniques), it was an interstate case alleging systematic and deliberate human rights violations by a member state. The Commission, which had only moral power, dealt best with individual cases and when the responsible state cared about its reputation and was cooperative. Other cases involved minor deviations from a norm of protecting human rights; in contrast, the junta's premises were antithetical to the principles of the ECHR—something the Greek government did not deny. The lack of results led legal scholar Georgia Bechlivanou to conclude there was \\"a total lack of effectiveness of the Convention, whether direct or indirect\\". Changing a government responsible for systematic violations is outside the ECHR system's remit. The Greek case paradoxically increased the prestige of the Commission and strengthened the Convention system by isolating and stigmatizing a state responsible for serious human rights violations. Commissioner Sørensen believed the Committee of Ministers' actions had resulted in a \\"lost opportunity\\" by playing the threat of expulsion too soon and closed off the possibility of a solution under Article 32 and the Commission's recommendations. He argued that Greece's economic dependence on the EC and its military dependence on the United States could be leveraged to bring the regime around, which was impossible once Greece left the Council of Europe. Although conceding the report was a \\"pyrrhic victory\\", Pedaliu argued that Sørensen's view fails to appreciate the fact that the Greek regime was never willing to curtail its human rights violations. The case stripped the junta of international legitimacy and contributed to Greece's increasing international isolation. Such isolation may have contributed to the junta's difficulties in effective government; it was unable to respond to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which caused the junta's sudden collapse in 1974. Scott Leckie argued the international scrutiny of human rights in Greece helped the country to transition more rapidly to democracy. Greece's denunciation was the first time a regional convention on human rights was denounced by one of its members. No other country has denounced the ECHR or left the Council of Europe since. In other words, the Greek case \\"is the only example in a half century of a state being shamed by Strasbourg's fact-finding to a degree that it chose to leave the Council of Europe\\". American lawyer James Becket, who visited Greece during the junta regime, found that \\"[t]here is no doubt that the Convention System process was a significant restraint on the behaviour of the Greek authorities\\" and that because of international scrutiny, fewer people were tortured than would have been otherwise. On 5 November 1969, Greece signed an agreement with the Red Cross in an attempt to prove its intention for democratic reform, although the agreement was not renewed in 1971. The agreement was significant as no similar agreement had been signed by a sovereign country with the Red Cross outside of war; torture and mistreatment declined following the agreement. International pressure also prevented retaliation against witnesses in the case. Becket also considered that Greece had made an incompetent blunder to defend itself when it was clearly in the wrong, and could have quietly left the Council of Europe. Becket commented the junta was \\"totally unprepared for the rigors of a thorough investigation, especially in Greece, where police officers were accustomed to a system where, 'It is a Communist lie' was good and sufficient evidence for a court martial\\". The Greek case report had a significant impact on the United Nations Declaration against Torture (1975) and the definition of torture in the United Nations Convention against Torture (1984). It also led to another Council of Europe initiative against torture, the Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment (1987), which created the Committee for the Prevention of Torture. The Greek case also triggered the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which led to the Helsinki Accords. In 1998, Prime Minister George Papandreou thanked \\"all those, both within the Council [of Europe] and without, who supported the struggle for the return of democracy to the country of its origin\\". Effect on ECHR jurisprudence The Greek case was the first time the Commission formally found a violation of the ECHR, and its conclusions were influential precedents in later cases. In terms of admissibility under Article 26, the Commission decided that it did not just consider the formal existence of legal remedies but whether they were actually effective in practice, including consideration of whether the judiciary was actually independent and impartial. The case helped to define the circumstances that might qualify as \\"a public emergency threatening the life of the nation\\" under Article 15, although leaving open the question, unresolved , whether successful coup plotters can derogate rights based on an emergency resulting from their own actions. The case also illustrated the limits to the margin of appreciation doctrine; the suspension of all constitutional rule of law was manifestly outside the margin. During the 1950s and 1960s, there was no definition of what constituted torture or inhuman and degrading treatment under Article 3 of the ECHR. The Greek case was the first time the Commission had considered Article&nbsp3.; In the Greek case, the Commission stated that all torture was inhuman treatment, and all inhuman treatment was degrading. It found that torture was \\"an aggravated form of inhuman treatment\\" distinguished by the fact that torture \\"has a purpose, such as the obtaining of information or confessions, or the infliction of punishment\\", rather than the severity of the act. However, the purposeful aspect was marginalized in later cases, which considered that torture was objectively more severe than acts which amounted only to inhumane or degrading treatment. In the Greek case report, the Commission ruled that torture was non-derogable (i.e., there were no circumstances in which torture was acceptable). The Commission did not specify whether all of Article 3 was non-derogable, and seemed to imply they may not be, with the wording \\"in the particular situation is unjustifiable\\". However, in Ireland v United Kingdom the Commission found that inhuman and degrading treatment was also non-derogable. A threshold of severity distinguished \\"inhuman treatment\\" and \\"degrading treatment\\". The former was defined as \\"at least such treatment as deliberately causes severe suffering, mental or physical which, in the particular situation is unjustifiable\\" and the latter, that which \\"grossly humiliates the victim] before others, or drives him to an act against his will or conscience\\". Among the implications of the Greek Case report is that poor conditions are more likely to be found to be inhuman or degrading if they are applied to political prisoners. The definitions of the Greek case were reused during Ireland v United Kingdom. The case also clarified that the Commission's standard of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt, a decision which left an asymmetry between the victim and state authorities, who could prevent the victim from collecting the evidence necessary to prove they had suffered a violation. However, the Court ruled in later cases where Article 3 violations seemed likely, it was incumbent upon the state to conduct an effective investigation into alleged ill-treatment. It also helped to define the idea of \\"administrative practice\\" of systematic violations.

On September 2, 2020, a draft of a new Constitution was submitted to the National Assembly of Bulgaria. The proposal is of the ruling majority. The reasons for the project was the pressure from the 2020 Bulgarian protests . The proposal does not propose a change in the form of government, ie. the replacement of the parliamentary one with a presidential republic, however, President Rumen Radev claims for his draft Constitution. The reasons point to the distrust of the sovereign in the judiciary, but nevertheless do not propose the abolition of the Judicial Council, which did not exist since the liberation of Bulgaria until 1991 and its replacement with the election and mandate of judges and prosecutors. The judiciary in Bulgaria is defending its privileges in every possible way - in August 2020, a 23-year-old young man was prosecuted for indignantly hitting the court with red paint. Parliament is powerless under the Constitution to curtail the powers of the prosecution and the court. The draft Constitution does not reflect other criticisms of the current Constitution and historical facts, such as the restoration of the Bulgarian supreme state control body - the National Audit Office with judicial functions. On the other hand, the liquidation of the Grand National Assembly of Bulgaria and the introduction of a broader direct democracy are proposed. The draft Constitution on the website of the National Assembly of Bulgaria The project is met with serious criticism, but in general the prevailing opinion among Bulgarian society is that it is necessary to enter into force a new social contract, especially in order to preserve and promote national values and traditions and to protect the birth rate because Bulgaria is experiencing a demographic catastrophe. in 35 years its population has decreased from 9 million to 7 million under the current constitution. In the summer of 2020, protests against the actual status quo were organized in Sofia and some of the larger cities, but the organizers called for maintaining the status quo de jure. The protesters were accused of defending corporate, oligarchic and criminal interests. Prosecutors in Bulgaria have taken an extremely strong stance against any initiatives to change their status. After the initiative became a legal fact, Nora Ananieva stated in plain text that the current constitution was a huge mistake that determined the legal configuration of the transition and in particular the avoidance of the presidential republic; the introduction of a judicial council and reductions or no state control by the supreme audit institution. Nora Ananieva in a straightforward text summarizes in 2020 that the deputies, having adopted the constitution of Bulgaria, did not know what they were doing and where they were going.

It was launched on 4 September 2020 at 07:30 UTC on a Long March 2F from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, in the Gobi Desert of northwestern China. Xinhua News Agency said in a report, \\"After a period of in-orbit operation, the spacecraft will return to the scheduled landing site in China. It will test reusable technologies during its flight, providing technological support for the peaceful use of space\\". Unofficial reports indicate that the spacecraft is part of the Shenlong programme, which is claimed to be similar to the Boeing X-37B. On 6 September 2020, two days after the launch, CSSHQ successfully returned to an airbase. Marco Langbroek and Jonathan McDowell said the landing site was an airbase at Lop Nur. On September 7, 2020, commercial satellite reconnaissance company Planet Labs published a satellite photo of a runway at Lop Nur, taken shortly after the landing of the spaceplane. Jonathon McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, speculated that one of the dots visible on the runway is the Chinese spaceplane. On September 8, 2020, Space Flight Now reported American officials had detected the launch at 7:30 GMT, that the craft's orbit's axes were and , and its orbit was titled 50.2 degrees to the equator. Specifications Chen Hongbo, of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the main contractor for China's space agency, said during a 2017 interview that China's space plane would be able to be re-used up to 20 times. Chen said the vehicle's first stage would use a scramjet engine. On March 24, 2020, officials said the vehicle was designed to carry a crew of six. Its takeoff weight would be 21.6 tonnes, and it would be long.

Because the ecoregion covers only elevations above , it exists in seven discontinuous patches surrounded by lowland rainforest. Biodiversity is high, both because of the isolation of separate mountain ranges that have led to species variation within the island, and because of the altitude zonation. Because most of the surrounding lowland forest has been cleared for human use, the montane regions have become an important refuge for rare and endemic species.  Location and description  The largest sector of the ecoregion runs up the central cordillera of the island, the Pantaron Mountain Range. Together with the disconnected smaller mountain ranges on the island, the average elevation is , with a minimum of and a maximum of at Mount Apo, about 20 km southwest of Davao City. The ecoregion surrounding the montane forests, at elevations below 1,000 meters, is the Mindanao-Eastern Visayas rain forests ecoregion.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month.  Flora and fauna  The ecoregion has been spared much of the forest clearing of the lowlands. 65% of the region is broadleaf evergreen closed forest, 15% is other closed forest, 13% is open forest, and 6% is herbaceous cover. The types of forest depend on altitude, and the associated temperature, aspect, and precipitation profiles. At the lowest elevations the montane forest is an extension of the dipterocarp forests of the lowlands; individual members of the family Dipterocarpaceae may be found up to 1,500 meters. As elevations increase, the diversity of tree species increase, and there is an increase in tree ferns and lianas such as rattan. Above the montane forest level are elfin woodlands (mossy forests with stunted trees), and above that are summit grasslands. Animal species vary widely in the ecoregion, as unconnected mountain ranges developed different habitats. As an example, there are 31 species of birds in the ecoregion that are polytypic; of these 16 have differences that are due to the isolated mountain ranges. Mammals of conservation interest in the region include the Philippine warty pig Sus philippensis, the endemic Mindanao moonrat (Podogymnura truei), and the endangered Mindanao shrew (Crocidura grandis), and the endangered Giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus).

It was Gilbert's 17th novel and undoubtedly written during the last days of the American Watergate scandal. Although none of the events in the book directly parallel those of Watergate, it begins with a banal legal matter and then escalates into a government cover-up and national scandal. The American edition has an apparent subtitle shown only on its copyright page: \\"A Harper Novel of Law and Lawlessness\\". Like a number of other works by Gilbert and his near contemporaries Victor Canning and Ross Thomas, it is less a standard novel of suspense than a political thriller about the amorality and subsequent lethal reactions of those in the highest government positions when confronted by seemingly trivial events that blossom uncontrollably into perceived challenges to their positions. Plot Written with Gilbert's usual urbane and understated style, the events mostly take place in and around London, as is customary in most of his books: in sundry law offices, courts, government offices, and gentlemen's clubs. Gilbert himself was a most Establishment figure, frequently writing about other Establishment figures, and was usually firmly on the side of England's police forces and shadowy (though lethal) Intelligent departments. But perhaps because of his many years of legal practice, he was also equally at home in filling his narratives with other types of characters: sleazy strip-club owners, tough and semi-crooked policemen, hard-bitten union officials, factory workers, relentless and unscrupulous Intelligent agents, and a wide variety of hard-boiled villains and crooks from small-time burglars and con men to gangster chieftains. Flash Point begins with Jonas Killey, an obscure but obstinate and somewhat truculent solicitor with a small practice in Wimbledon, attempting to bring charges against Will Dylan, a rising young politician, for what he purports to be the embezzlement of funds during Dylan's handling of the merger of two small labor unions several years before. The facts are obscure, the documentation equally obscure, the matter of no interest to anyone except Killey; the various Law Societies and associated bodies to whom he appeals for help in pursuing his claims are reluctant to take up the matter. The story unfolds through the points of view of various legal and political personalities, and little by little Killey succeeds in bringing the matter to wider public attention—at the cost of drawing into the picture a number of unscrupulous characters, communist trades union men apparently acting on his behalf, and an even more unscrupulous intelligence department's chief acting to discredit Killey and suppress the entire matter. Much of the ensuing book takes place in lawyer's chambers, magistrates' courts, newspaper offices, and the occasional meeting between high government officials, including the Prime Minister himself. By the time the book ends, the cover-up has become a newspaper sensation comparable to the Watergate scandal of that time in the United States and in the ensuing election the Prime Minister and his party are turned out of office. Unlike most other Gilbert books, however, all of the violence is of the non-lethal kind: people are threatened, roughed up, and actually beaten, but the only two fatalities in the story are inadvertent. There is, nevertheless, a sharp edge to the entire story that is entirely in keeping with what one of Gilbert's American editors said about him after his death in 2006, many years after the publication of Flash Point: \\"He's not a hard-boiled writer in the classic sense, but there is a hard edge to him, a feeling within his work that not all of society is rational, that virtue is not always rewarded.\\".Douglas Greene of Crippen & Landrau, quoted in The New York Times, 15 February 2006 Such is the case in Flash Point, although Jonas Killey himself, the uncompromising instigator of so much national drama, ends up in surprisingly benign circumstances in totally different, non-legalist surroundings. Reception Newgate Callendar, the mystery critic of the New York Times, gave it a very favorable review, saying that: > Michael Gilbert's FLASH POINT (Harper & Row, $6.95) examines certain aspects > of the British Parliamentary system and does not like what it sees. Gilbert, > himself a lawyer, works up a situation where, in an effort to stop a legal > case, the British Government steps in and subverts the basic rights of > citizens. Gilbert poses big questions that carry the ethical problems > straight up to the Prime Minister. The analogy to certain doings in the > United States Government of recent vintage is not once mentioned, but > obviously Gilbert had it on his mind. The ending of “Flash Point,” however, > is a bit weak. It is as though Gilbert did not know exactly how to resolve > the plot, and there is the sudden, unconvincing reversal of character of > several key figures.

The vessel is paired with the cement barge Innovation, transporting cement products between Lafarge facilities across the Great Lakes. History In 1976, this vessel, now known as Samuel de Champlain, was originally built as Musketeer Fury by Mangone Shipbuilding of Houston, Texas for Bernhard Hansen and Company of Norway. Two years later in 1978, the tug was sold and renamed Tender Panther. The tug was sold again in 1979 and renamed Margarita. In 1983, the tug changed hands for the third time and was renamed Vortice. In 1993, after ten years sailing as Vortice, the vessel suffered a major fire near the islands of Azores. Having become a burnt-out hull, Vortice was laid up in Trieste, Italy. In 1996, the Canadian company McKeil Marine purchased the hull and towed it across the Atlantic to the company's yard in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1999, Vortice was sold to Seaforce Marine Incorporated of Norfolk, Virginia where the tug would be completely rebuilt and renamed Norfolk. In 2006, Norfolk was purchased by Lafarge North America and renamed Samuel de Champlain after the French explorer. The tug was modified with a Bludworth coupler system by Manitowoc Marine Group so it would be compatible with the 460 foot-long cement barge Innovation. The barge is capable of carrying up to 19,449 short tons of cement.

It was founded by JJ Koczan in January 2009 while living in Boonton, New Jersey. The Obelisk has covered an extensive range of heavy metal and hard rock music over the years, but generally focuses on doom metal, sludge metal and stoner metal. The webzine's header logo was illustrated by Belgian artist Christophe Szpajdel. Koczan has remained sole editor and principal writer at The Obelisk, but has, on occasion, invited established writers and musicians to contribute guest posts. Some of these guest writers include Mario Lalli (from Queens of the Stone Age, Yawning Man, Fatso Jetson and Ten East), Ben Ward (from Orange Goblin), Tommy Southard (from Godspeed, Solace and Prunella Scales), Tim Catz (from Roadsaw) and Ben Hogg (from Birds of Prey).  Background  Prior to founding The Obelisk, JJ Koczan was a disc jockey at Seton Hall University's radio station WSOU, where he hosted a specialty show titled Blurred Visions devoted to stoner, doom and sludge metal. He also wrote for and was managing editor at The Aquarian Weekly and associate editor at Metal Maniacs. Koczan's monthly column in Metal Maniacs magazine was titled Feast of the Obelisk and also focused on stoner, doom and sludge metal. When Metal Maniacs' parent organization, Zenbu Media, decided to shut the magazine down in early 2009, Koczan decided to start his own online magazine, The Obelisk, inspired by his admiration for metal webzine MetalSucks. At the time, Koczan resided in Boonton, New Jersey and was beginning a Master of Fine Arts degree in writing at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 2013 he relocated to East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, but ultimately returned to New Jersey in 2019 to settle in Morris Plains. During the webzine's early years, Koczan performed as vocalist in several stoner and doom metal bands, including Maegashira, Moth Eater and Ogima. Many of the early articles published on The Obelisk originated from submissions sent to Koczan while working at Metal Maniacs. In order to reach a wider fan-base, those early articles were often re-published on the (at the time) much larger webzine StonerRock.com, until its closure in 2010. Koczan also published a series of exclusive articles covering Roadburn Festival for BrooklynVegan in 2009, through which he befriended Invisible Oranges' later editor-in-chief Fred Pessaro. Koczan has maintained a close affiliation with Roadburn Festival through The Obelisk in the years since; he is one of the principal photographers at the festival and is editor and lead writer for Roadburn's daily fanzine Weirdo Canyon Dispatch. The Obelisk also has access to exclusive coverage each year and has written the liner notes and provided photographs for several live albums recorded at the festival, such as Edler's Live at Roadburn and Bongripper's Live at Roadburn. In 2017, The Obelisk was briefly sponsored by All That Is Heavy and MeteorCity.  audiObelisk, The Obelisk Radio and The Obelisk Show  On December 21, 2009, Koczan launched a series of podcasts titled audiObelisk. Each podcast is given an identifier titled Transmission, followed by a number, and are hosted on the Internet Archive for free streaming or download. The latest podcast, Transmission 065, was posted on February 26, 2018. Koczan has also used the audiObelisk series to categorize The Obelisk articles which feature exclusive streams, such as album or single premieres, or live concert broadcasting. On November 26, 2012, Koczan launched The Obelisk Radio, a 24-hour streaming radio station. The Obelisk Radio began with a back-catalog of over 7,500 songs, which were once the basis of StonerRock.com's own internet radio station K666 Radio; the later of which had shut down two years prior on November 29, 2010. The hard drive of music was donated to Koczan by Johnny Arzgarth, former editor at StonerRock.com. The first new release added to The Obelisk Radio was Sungrazer's album Mirador; Koczan has since then been adding new and archival releases regularly. In 2018, Koczan was approached by heavy metal internet radio Gimme Radio to host his own specialty show. The Obelisk Show debuted on Sunday, September 23, 2018 at 5 P.M. EST. The second program of The Obelisk Show aired a month later, on Sunday, October 21, 2018 at 5 P.M. EST. After two successful episodes, Koczan was given a permanent bi-weekly program: from November 4, 2018 to April 28, 2019, The Obelisk Show aired every other Sunday evening at 7 P.M. EST; re-runs altered between Monday, Tuesday or Thursday mornings between 6 A.M. and 9 A.M. EST. Starting on May 24, 2019, and lasting until August 30, 2019, The Obelisk Show aired every other Friday afternoon at 1 P.M. EST (with the exception of July 5, 2019, which was aired two weeks later due to Independence Day). Re-runs began airing steadily every Sunday evening at 7 P.M. EST, in the show's former time-slot. The Obelisk Show did not air in October 2019 due to several specials Gimme Radio was running. When it returned on the air, the show retained its Friday afternoon 1 P.M. EST time-slot, but was reduced to airing once a month. This schedule was maintained from November 8, 2019 to January 31, 2020 (with re-runs still on Sundays at 7 P.M. EST). Since February 14, 2020, The Obelisk Show has aired every Friday evening at 5 P.M. EST and every Sunday evening at 7 P.M. EST; new episodes air bi-weekly on Fridays while repeats air on alternate Fridays and on every Sunday.  The Obelisk All-Dayer and The Obelisk Presents  On August 20, 2016, The Obelisk hosted a one-day festival at the Saint Vitus Bar in Brooklyn, New York named The Obelisk All-Dayer. The main event featured Mars Red Sky, Death Alley, Snail, EYE, Kings Destroy, Funeral Horse, King Buffalo and Heavy Temple, followed by an after-party with DJ Adzo and Walter Hoeijmakers, co-founder of Roadburn Festival. This lead way to a long-running series of concerts and tours sponsored, booked or promoted by The Obelisk titled The Obelisk Presents. Some of the bands billed under The Obelisk Presents have included Bongzilla, Mars Red Sky, Black Cobra, Lo-Pan, Sheavy, Conan, Sasquatch, Buzzoven, Earthride, Sólstafir, The Skull, Jex Thoth, Sourvein, 1000mods, Monarch, The Hellacopters, Earthless, Dozer, Mondo Generator, Church of the Cosmic Skull, Årabrot, Turbowolf, Somali Yacht Club, Fasto Jetson and Greenleaf.

The eye's former shape was no longer present as it appeared ragged on satellite imagery, and Dvorak analysis indicated that Haishen was beginning to weaken steadily. On September 5, Haishen began to lose its eye as its inner eyewall began contracting, and it subsequently weakened to a category 3-equivalent typhoon.https://web.archive.org/web/20200905050426/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp1120web.txt On September 6, Haishen made landfall on Japan and South Korea as a strong category 2-equivalent typhoon.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54046150 Haishen was the third typhoon within a span of two weeks to make landfall in the Korean Peninsula, the others being Bavi and Maysak. Worldwide, Haishen is currently tied with Cyclone Amphan and Cyclone Harold.  Meteorological history  On August 29, the JTWC began tracking a very disorganised tropical disturbance situated a couple hundred miles northeast of Guam. By the next day, the disturbance had quickly organised, and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the low-pressure area,https://web.archive.org/web/20200904185059/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp9520web.txt and by the next day, it intensified into Tropical Depression 11W.https://web.archive.org/web/20200904185226/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp1120.gif Traversing generally south-westward, the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm.https://www.stripes.com/blogs/pacific-storm-tracker/super- typhoon-11w-haishen-18-1.641476 The JMA soon followed and upgraded the system into a tropical storm as well, and was given the international name Haishen. Later that day, Haishen became a severe tropical storm as it headed southwest into the Philippine Sea. Intensification on September 3 was significant - with Typhoon Haishen acquiring a pinhole eye early in the day, but it later underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. The cycle completed quickly, however, and strengthening resumed almost immediately. Then, the JTWC noted the possibility of Haishen becoming a Category 5 super typhoon in one of their advisories. Entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geological and Atmospheric Services Administration (PAGASA) named the system Kristine.https://web.archive.org/web/20200904184332/https://www.jma.go.jp/en/typh/2010.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20200904184617/http://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical- cyclone/severe-weather-bulletin/2 Early on September 4, the JTWC assessed that Haishen became a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon - with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 135 kt (155 mph; 250 km/h),https://web.archive.org/web/20200904094527/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp1120web.txt with a clear, symmetrical eye visible on satellite imagery.https://web.archive.org/web/20200904184145/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp1120fix.txt On September 5, as Haishen's latitude increased, the ocean heat content in the area decreased,https://web.archive.org/web/20200905050300/https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/ocean/ohc/images/ohc_npQG3_ddc.gif which disrupted the system's core and caused its eye to appear ragged on satellite imagery, subsequently indicating weakening, and dropping below super typhoon status.https://web.archive.org/web/20200905050426/https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp1120web.txt Later that day, the system left the PAR and PAGASA issued its last bulletin on the typhoon. As the system continued its northward track toward the Japanese archipelago, it continued to weaken and became a category 3 typhoon as Haishen made another eyewall replacement cycle, and not too long after it dropped to a category 2 typhoon as it neared the SouthernRyukyu Islands of Japan. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for western Japan as millions of people evacuated accordingly.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54046150 Haishen made landfall in Ulsan, South Korea at around 09:00 KST (00:00 UTC) on September 7, with 10-minute maxium sustained winds at 140 km/h (85 mph) and the central pressure at . Shortly after, Haishen entered the Sea of Japan as a high-end tropical storm; due to the low-sea surface temperatures, Haishen quickly weakened and made landfall in the South Hamgyong Province, North Korea with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) and a central pressure of 980 hPa (28.94 inHg). Soon afterwards, JTWC issued its final warning on Haishen, as it moved further inland into North Korea. At 18:50 UTC, JMA issued its last advisory on Haishen, and declared it an extratropical low as it moved near the China–North Korea border.  Preparations  = Japan = Officials ordered people to evacuate from dangerous areas near the coast and follow orders by local governments. Authorities urged evacuation for more than 100,000 households in the southern prefectures of Okinawa, Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Nagasaki before the storm, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. There is a potential danger of flooding in Kyushu; and more than 500 flights were cancelled to southern Kyushu and Okinawa due to the hazardous conditions. =South Korea= Over 340 flights and 114 shipping routes, in addition to several national train services, were cancelled. =North Korea= Residents in coastal Kangwon Province were evacuated and flood warnings were issued ahead of the storm.  Impact  At least four casualties were reported, with two in Japan and another two in South Korea. The storm caused notable flood and wind-related damage and major power outages. Around 10,000 houses were damaged, destroyed or flooded in storm- related incidents. Total combined economic losses are anticipated to surpass $100 million USD. =Japan= Typhoon Haishen bringing strong winds to Japan Haishen brought strong winds and high waves to parts of Japan. At least two people were killed and over 100 were injured. A mudslide in Miyazaki Prefecture left four people missing. =South Korea= Flooding rains and strong winds from Haishen displaced 3,100 people and left at least 75,000 households without power. Two people were killed and five were injured; two others went missing. Two nuclear power plants in Gyeongju automatically stopped during the typhoon for yet unknown reasons. =North Korea= Widespread flooding occurred in the country. Military personnel were dispatched to assist in rebuilding houses. Roughly 300,000 members of the Workers' Party of Korea involved themselves in reconstruction projects.

This species is found in Mount Kanga, a hill of the Nguru Mountains in the Mvomero district, Morogoro, Tanzania. They are situated on the southern ridge and south eastern slopes of Mt. Kanga at an altitude between 1,000m and 1,300m.  Etymology  The name \\"kanga\\" originates from the mountain in which the species is situated in, Mount Kanga. The word \\"kanga\\" means \\"jungle-fowl\\" in local languages.  Description  It is an arborescent species, with pachycaulous barrel-shaped trunks around 1.5m long, 50 cm in diameter and shiny, dark green leaves. They are also dioecious.  Status  The Encephalartos kanga is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. It is a rare species with small populations scattered around Mt. Kanga. It's total area of occupation is less than 10 km2 and the total number of mature individuals is estimated to be less than 50. = Threats = The mountain, being seen as sacred by the local inhabitants, and it's remoteness means that deforestation is not a current problem. The most serious threat to the species is the horticultural trade. There have been instances of foreign collectors entering the area and removing 100-200 seedlings at one time. = Conservation = They are currently under conservation in the Kanga Forest Reserve.  Uses  Like all cycads, the Encephalartos kanga is highly sought after by the horticultural trade, especially because it is a new species. However, this also poses a threat to the species.

The building was used as an orphanage for the maegdeckens, or maidens, from the mid-16th century to the end of the 19th century. The museum presents a collection of utensils used on a daily basis by the foundlings and the orphans; a collection of antique furniture, and a series of documents relating to the orphanage and the life in it from the 16th century to 19th century. Although one of the smallest museums in Antwerp, the Maagdenhuis houses a valuable and rich collection of paintings and sculptures. The collection includes works by artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Jacob Jordaens, Sir Anthony Van Dyck, Pieter Aertsen, Otto Van Veen, Simon De Vos, Maarten Pepijn, Hubert Van den Eynde, and Walter Pompe. Detail of museum's façade; Façade c.1634; Bas-reliefs, by Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, c. 1564  History  The museum is located in a historic building dating from the sixteenth century. It was formerly an orphanage for young girls. The building started to function as an orphanage for little girls in 1552. The Maagdenhuis (Maidens' house) was significantly expanded in 1634-1636. Today's white stone façade was built during the 1634-1636 renovation. The façade's bas-relief was probably designed by Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, and dates back to 1564. It portrays a group of orphaned girls (bottom left) and a teacher leading them into the orphanage (right). These two scenes are flanked by a pair of guarding Hermes figures, overhung by God, Christ as the Good Shepherd, and an allegorical dove. In 1882 the orphans moved to two new and larger buildings on Albert Grisarstraat Street, which replaced the Maidens’ House and the Boys’ Orphanage. The Maidens’ House finally closed and the building remained vacant. The larger buildings on Albert Grisarstraat Street were replaced by smaller institutions in the 20th century. Over the centuries, all these charitable institutions accumulated a bunch of artwork received as gifts and bequests from rich benefactors. The administrators of the two orphanages, the Board of Civilian Almshouses, moved 84 paintings to the former chapel of the Maidens’ House, which opened in 1884 as a museum. However, most of the collection was moved to the Museum of Fine Arts but a few years later. Finally, in 1925 the Commission of Civilian Almhouses, overseeing the orphanages, merged with the Office of Charity. The newfound organization (the Commissie van Openbare Onderstand, or COO) found itself with a huge art collection, and decided to turn the chapel of the Lange Gasthuisstraat's building into a museum, which was opened in 1930. The museum gradually expanded its collection in the following decades, with the Royal Museum of Fine Arts returning several masterpieces to the Maaggdenhuis over the years. In 1976, all Belgian COOs (Public Poverty Commissions) were turned into Public Centers for Social Welfare. As a result, today the Maagdenhuis Museum is overseen by Antwerp's Public Social Welfare Center.  Collection  Herreyns and Joannes de Maré In the orphanage's former chapel, which was the first room to be turned into a museum, there is a collection of utensils used by the orphans and the foundlings and objects that interest them, including porridge bowls, foundling dresses and identifiers, embroidered samplers, antique furniture; and a collection of documents regarding the Maagenhuis. In the same room are a few paintings, such as van Overbeke's Tryptich of the crucifixion, and van den Eynde's The Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus. In the Reception, where there stood the administration of the Maidens' House and the catalogue with all the names of the orphans living at Maagdenhuis, there is a first assortment of paintings, which includes opera by Peter Ykens, Cornelis Schut and Erasmus Quellinus the Younger. In the Chairman's Hall, where the regent and the almoners used to convene, there is a second group of paintings, by artists such as Frans Floris, Pieter van Avont, Maarten Pepyn and David Teniers the Younger. In the Side Corridor, which runs between the museum galleries, there hang paintings by artists like Frans Francken the Elder, Abraham Bloemaert, and Hendrick de Clerck. In what used to be the first of three kitchens, there is the Rubens Gallery, with paintings by Peter Paul Rubens, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and Otto van Veen, among others. In what used to be the large kitchen, or the groote ceucken, there is the Sixteenth-century Gallery, with artworks by painters such as Jacob de Backer and Michiel Coxie. At the end of the side corridor, to the right, there is the Van Der Meere Gallery, with a masterpiece by Jacob Jordaens and other paintings by artists such as Theodoor van Loon and Abraham de Vries. The Fifteenth-century Gallery is located in the smallest room of the Maagdenhuis Museum. Little is known about his rooms, except that three old women lived there in the 17th century, having donated funds to the almoners in exchange for a room and boarding at the Maagdenhuis. This gallery includes several paintings by unknown masters, including a 15th century Last Judgement, the Seven Acts of Mercy and the Seven Deadly Sins. In the Courtyard there stands the annex in which the orphans lived and worked. The courtyard accommodates several sculptures and inscriptions, among which a wooden, 17th-century statue by an unknown master, Wooden Clara; a copy of Van den Eynde's original sculpture The Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus in the chapel; and Sebastiaen van den Eynde's Portrait of Cornelis II Landschot, ca. 1656.

Early years (1857–1880)  Louis Pierre Alphonse Valcke was born in Bruges on 22 December 1857. His parents were Liévin-Pierre Valcke and Clémence d'Ongena. He studied at the Bruges Atheneum, then entered the Military School on 1 December 1874. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1877. On 27 February 1878 he was assigned to the engineers regiment in Antwerp. In 1880 Valcke was seconded by the Military Cartographic Institute and assigned to the Upper Congo Studies Committee. He was charged by the king to study how best to reach the center of Africa, and advised the king to abandon the idea of entering via the Indian Ocean. At the end of July 1880 the king authorized Valcke to entered the Congo Basin via the Atlantic. He asked Valcke to maintain complete secrecy about the proposed enterprise, and to be patient and flexible with Henry Morton Stanley, whom he described as being a brilliant explorer and energetic organizer, but with a difficult and ambititious character. First tour in the Congo (1880–1881) Banana in 1887 On 4 August 1880 Valcke embarked at Ostend to travel via Liverpool to Banana, which he reached on 2 October 1880, and on 6 October 1880 went up the river to Vivi to contact Stanley. On 15 November 1880 Stanley sent Valcke orders to join him at Ngoma, which Valcke reached on 25 November 1880. Stanley explained that his task was to build a road that would pass the foot of the Ngoma plateau and make it possible to transport equipment, provisions and personnel to establish stations in the Congo territory. Valcke used explosives to blast rocks from the mountain, which combined with tree trunks were used to build the \\"Valcke's causeway\\" from Ngoma to N'Konzo. Stanley wrote of Valcke's work, \\"Though our young friend is frequently suffering from dysentery, by the time he is through with his task, we have finished off our causeway, have levelled it with 24 inches of earth, and a fine compact broad wagon road is the result, along the base of which the baffled river lashes itself into fury. On 8 December they camped at a place named Khonzo. Stanley steamed the Royal upstream and was able to get within of Isangila. From Khonzo 100 men went overland making the road, while the steamers carried materials up by water. By 30 December the expedition had made camp from Isangila, and the steamers were in a cove from which a road could be made to haul them up to their launching place above the rapids. Stanley left Valcke in charge while he returned to Vivi to haul the new wagons and new steel lighter that had been left at the Bundi. The boats were on shore in the camp on 2 January 1881 to be repaired, scraped and painted in readiness for the journey to Manyanga. Map of the Congo from Stanley's Through the Dark Continent In February 1881 Stanley heard rumours that English missionaries were planning to build a post in the region, and asked Valcke to establish an International African Association (AIA) post at Isanghila before they did so. The post was complete within two months. While Valcke continued to develop the Isanghila post, Stanley took the steamers En Avant and Royal up the navigable stretch of the river to Manyanga, where Stanley started to build a post, which he entrusted to Victor Harou. He charged Charles-Marie de Braconnier with building a road from Manianga to the mouth of the Lufu River, bypassing the Ntombo-Mataka falls. Valcke entrusted Isanghila to Eugène Janssens and Frédéric Orban, and joined Stanley in Manianga on 14 July 1881. They left the next day with a contingent of native auxiliaries along the route marked out by Braconnier carrying the En Avant and two whalers they intended to launched at the Stanley Pool. They reached the Djoué River without difficulty. There they were informed that Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza had signed a treaty with Chief Makoka and claimed possession for France of the whole right shore of the Congo River north of the Pool. The Belgians established a camp on the right bank of the Djoué, and on 3 August 1881 Stanley asked Valcke to return to the coast and try to catch the boat due on 20 August 1881 from Banana to St-Paul de Loanda, He should bring back trade goods to win the chief Ngaliéma over to the AIA. Valcke made the journey to Banana in seven days. He was suffering from fever and hematuria when he reached Luanda, but managed to acquire the goods and take then to Banana, where he dispatched them to Stanley and then returned to Belgium, reaching Ostend on 23 December 1881. Second tour in the Congo (1882–1885) =Road to Léopoldville= Alphonse van Gèle In Brussels Valcke met King Léopold II, who agreed that it was necessary to move fast to occupy Central Africa. On 8 February 1882 Valcke left for Zanzibar to recruit auxiliaries and bring them to Banana via Cape Town, where he was joined by Alphonse van Gèle. In the meantime, Stanley had undertaken a tiring expedition to the Mfini and Lake Léopold II, where he came down with fever and abdominal pain and was ordered to return to Europe. He was in Vivi when Valcke and Van Gèle arrived in April. Stanley gave Valcke exclusive command of the 256 Zanzibaris, independent of the new administrator Eduard Pechuël-Loesche. Valcke left Lieven van de Velde in Vivi with the sick from the Zanzibari contingent and set out with Van Gèle carrying a new boiler for the Royal and 600 loads of goods. At the Loa height Van Gèle fell ill and had to return to Vivi, while Valcke continued on. He was joined by Van de Velde and the recovered Zanzibaris on 1 August. The road to Isanghila needed repair to meet the transport requirements. Valcke and his column reached Isanghila on 30 August and continued to Manyanga. Here Valcke intervened to pacify the Mowa region at the request of the station commander, Théodore Nilis. Valcke then began to build a road along the left bank for use in carrying the A.I.A. and goods to be stored at the Pool. The road was built without difficulty to the territory of the chiefs Lutete and Makito, who had to be convinced to allow passage of the Europeans. A state post was established at Lutete and entrusted to Van Gele. Early in October the propellor steamboat A.I.A. built by Chantiers et Forges de la Méditerranée arrived in Banana. Frédéric Orban and Charles Callewaert brought it in parts to Isanghila, then assembled it and brought it to Manyanga in October 1882. Orban fell ill and Valcke took over the job of carrying the steamer to the Pool, where it would be reassembled ready for Stanley's next expedition in May 1883. =Treaties = Valcke had to meet Makoko of Mbe to get him to cancel or at least loosen the treaty he had made with the French. He and Camille Coquilhat reached Léopoldville on 7 December and Msuata on 13 December with an escort of 50 Zanzibaris and the goods needed for the negotiations. Valcke found that after Brazza had left, Chief Makoko had taken most of the French goods for himself, which had led to him being deposed. The chiefs Mfumu Ntaba, Ngaliema and Gantschu accepted the authority of the AIA and consented to European posts being built in the interior and on the river between the mouths of the Lefini and the Djoué. On 13 January 1883 Valcke was at Mfoa where he heard from Braconnier that the French Chamber had ratified the treaty with Makoko. He was to abandon all activity on the right shore of the Congo and return to Manyanga to join Stanley, who had returned to Vivi on 20 December 1882. Valcke reached Léopoldville on 14 January 1883 and Manyanga on 16 January 1883 where he met Stanley and Edmond Hanssens, who would leave for the Niadi-Kwilu on 23 February 1883. =Transport and supply= The Congo leaving the Pool circa 1888 Stanley had decided to replace the Royal by whaling boats on the Isanghila-Manyanga reach, and transport the steamer to Léopoldville. Stanley took charge of taking the steamer on the right bank to the Inkisi between 7 and 27 February, where he had to cross the river and continue on the left bank. Valcke had to transport the two A.I.A. boilers on the left bank. He used two stretchers, each carried by eight porters. The caravan reached Léopoldville on 27 February 1883. He continued with transport and supply work until 3 April, when he became exhausted and asked to be relieved. Van Gèle took over the work, while Valcke returned to Léopoldville. Staney gave him command of the Stanley Pool district and Léopoldville station, and general responsibility for the Cataractes and Bas-Congo region. Léopoldville was developing fast when word came of troubles at Manyanga and Stanley sent Valcke there with an escort of 45 Zanzibaris to restore order. After his return, Valcke was entrusted with obtaining agreement from the chiefs of all the territories between the coast and the Pool to form a confederation and to place themselves under the protection of the AIA, recognizing AIA sovereignty. Valcke was joined at Vivi by the English General Sir Frederic John Goldsmid, who had been sent by the king to conclude the same treaty, and who confessed himself unqualified for the task. They divided up the work until Sir Frederic fell ill at Isanghila and Valcke had to complete the work. =Transport of the Stanley= In Léopoldville on 20 January 1884 Stanley charged Valcke with bringing the steamer Stanley from Banana to the Pool for use on the upper Congo. It arrived in parts on 9 January 1884. The Stanley was a huge sternwheeler long, wide and weighing 35 tons. Assembly began in Banana and was continued in Boma. On 20 April 1884 the Stanley left Boma fully loaded and reached Vivi on 31 April 1884, where dismantling began so it could be taken on by land. Valcke started to organize a caravan of 250 Zanzibaris to carry the equipment and 15,000 loads of food and goods weighing each. He fell sick with hematuria and was ordered to recover at the Boma sanitorium, where he remained until 16 May 1884. When he returned to Vivi he found that many of his men were being employed on widening the Vivi-Isanghila road by order of Stanley. Crossing over the Inkisi River. From Stanleys expedition till Emin Paschas undsättning (1890) Sir Francis de Winton mediated with Stanley, who gave back the Zanzibaris to Valcke, and with many difficulties the caravan reached Isanghila on 4 September 1884. It left by water on 14 September, reached Tshumbu by water and on 3 December set off on the Tshumbu-Lukungu road, reaching Lukungu on 23 December 1884. Valcke suffered from another bout of hematuria, but pressed on and the seven boat sections and the boilers reached Lutete on 14 February 1885. On 10 March 1885 the exhausted caravan camped at the Inkisi River. The local people all deserted overnight. The Zanzibaris bridged the river and carried all he equipment across on the evening of 13 March, but some of them deserted that night leaving only 82 men with Valcke. Valcke left a guard at the Inkisi under Wall and Olsen and set off for Vivi, again suffering from hematuria. He went on to Boma and took ship to Rotterdam, which he reached in mid-April, where he was bedridden for six weeks. He returned to Belgium on 19 May 1885. In his absence, the Stanley completed its journey and was launched on the pool in December 1885. Third and fourth tours in the Congo In 1885 Valcke married the 18-year-old Augusta Eerebout (5 December 1866 – 12 August 1940). She accompanied him in June 1886 when he returned to the Congo after being appointed director of the navy and transport of the Congo Free State. She was the first Belgian wife of a State agent authorized to stay in Central Africa during the term of her spouse. She was accompanied by a young Flemish servant and settled in a comfortable house by the standards of the time in the capital of the state, Boma. There she entertained senior officials of the Free State. Albert Thys from Le chemin de fer du Congo (Matadi-Stanley-Pool) (1907) In the absence of Camille Janssen, at one time Valcke was interim governor-general at the age of 29. In 1887 he began construction at Matadi of a landing stage connected to the shore by two walls. On 2 June 1887 he was visited at his house in Boma by Albert Thys and members of the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie (CCCI), and by engineers who were to study construction of the first railway in the Congo. On 8 August 1887 Valcke and Thys directed transport of five carts weighing to Stanley Pool, which took hundreds of local laborers a month to achieve. The heavily loaded carts carried spare parts for the Roi des Belges and Ville de Bruxelles boats. His wife accompanied Valcke on this trip, as she had when he was building the pier in Matadi. In 1888 Valcke and the engineer Fabry reported the general route of the railway based on a sketch map drawn up by Thuys. Valcke came down with hematuria again, followed by dysentery and an abscess of the liver, and in February 1888 returned to Europe. While in Begium Valcke and Thys created the Compagnie du chemin de fer du Congo, the Compagnie des Produits du Congo and the Société anonyme belge du commerce du Haut-Congo (SAB). Valcke returned to the Congo in July 2889 on behalf of the SAB, where he replaced Major Parminter as director until March 1890. He established trading posts of this company as far as the Falls. He left the Congo for the last time for health reasons, and after a dispute with Jérôme Becker he retired from the army. Later career In 1892 Valcke left for Colombia, where he managed several Franco-Belgian industrial enterprises, mainly gold mines. His wife joined him there with their two children. Later the British government asked that he represent English interests in an arbitration between an English company and the Colombian government over a railway construction project. He remained in Colombia until 1910, when he finally returned to Belgium. He was involved in the Colonial Veterans Association and lectured on colonial subjects in Brussels, Ghent and Bruges. Valcke was involved in many colonial enterprises including the Union Nationale des transports fluviaux (Unatra), Kilo-Moto Gold Mines, Société minière de Luebo, Société minière de l'Aruwimi-Ituri, Société minière du Kasai, Cie du Lomami-Lualaba, Ciments du Katanga and Cie du Kasai. He died in Ghent on 16 March 1940.

It is found in high-elevation locations in South America. It is a somewhat unusual species in its genus, characterized by a single holdfast that attaches to its substrate, and pores in its cortex. Taxonomy Peltigera vainioi was first formally described as a new species by Hungarian lichenologist Vilmos Gyelnik in 1929, based on specimens that had been collected in Colombia in 1860 by Alexander Lindig. The specific epithet honours Finnish lichenologist Edvard August Vainio, who died that year. In the Latin description for the species Gyelnik mentions the smooth upper surface, the soredia, and the lower surface with the presence of a single rhizine in the centre, similar to Peltigera venosa. A few years later, Gyelnik wrote that the presence of cyanobacteria in the thallus of Peltigera vainioi distinguished it from Peltigera venosa, which contained green algae in the thallus. In 1994, Venezuelan lichenologists Vicente Marcano and Antonio Morales Méndez proposed erecting a new genus Peltigeropsis to accommodate this species, which would have then been called Peltigeropsis vainioi . However, the name was not published validly because it did not follow the conventions of the code for botanical nomenclature, namely, the basionym was not indicated and the reference was omitted. Description Peltigera vainioi has a club-shaped (clavate) thallus with a short stipe; it measures up to by wide. It grows on the ground, to which it is attached by a single holdfast. The upper surface of the thallus is smooth and bluish-grey. It has tiny pores that are 5–6 μm long by 0.75 by 1.57 μm wide. The upper cortex is paraplectenchymatous (a cell arrangement where the hyphae are oriented in all directions), and measures 72–82 μm thick. Soralia are found on the upper margin of the thallus; soredia are granular with a bluish colour. Pycnidia and apothecia are absent. The photobiont of Peltigera vainioi is a species of Nostoc, with cells that are 5.4–3.6 μm in diameter. These algal cells are contained in a continuous tissue layer, 44–50 μm thick, below the upper cortex. Habitat and distribution Peltigera vainioi is found in South America. It has been reported from Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. It has been collected from elevations ranging from . In Venezuela, where it appears to be locally abundant, it is typically found growing on the ground in thin, sandy soil, near the mosses Bryum and Polytrichum.

Sharma served as the First Lady of India from 1992 to 1997 and the Second Lady of India from 1987 until 1992 during the tenures of her husband, the late President Shankar Dayal Sharma. She was also elected to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1985, representing the Udaipura constituency, and headed the Madhya Pradesh Social Welfare Board for several terms. Sharma died in August 2020 after recovering from COVID-19. Biography Vimala Sharma was originally from Rajasthan and spent most of her early life in Jaipur. She married Shankar Dayal Sharma, who later became President of India from 1992 to 1997. Sharma was a social worker by profession. She headed the Madhya Pradesh Social Welfare Board, which oversees social services in the state, for several terms. In 1985, Vimala Sharma was elected to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, representing Udaipura, as a member of the Indian National Congress party. Sharma became the first female MLA to hold the Udaipura seat in its history. (Her husband, Shankar Dayal Sharma, was also elected as the first MLA from the same Udaipura seat upon the district's creation in 1962). She declined to seek re-election to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly after her husband became Vice President of India. She then served as the Second Lady of India from 1987 until 1992 before becoming First Lady of India in 1992 during her husband's presidency. Much of her work focused on women's rights. During her time as First Lady, Sharma also simultaneously served as Minister of State of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution from 1993 to 1996 and Minister of State for the Ministry of Women and Child Development from 1993 until 1996. Towards the end of his presidency, Vimala and Shankar Dayal Sharma, who lived in Bhopal, began to discuss where they would live after his retirement from office. First Lady Vimala Sharma advocated for a move to her hometown on Jaipur, which had better hospitals and medical facilities than Bhopal, as her husband was in declining health at the time. However, the couple ultimately chose to retire to a home in Delhi. Former President Shankar Dayal Sharma died on December 26, 1999, just 2 years after leaving office . Vimala Sharma remained highly involved in social and charitable organizations throughout her later life, especially in the Bhopal and Raisen districts, according to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In June 2020, Sharma developed breathing difficulties, a symptom of COVID-19. She exhibited low oxygen levels on June 5th and tested positive for COVID-19 on June 6, 2020. Sharma was immediately admitted to the AIIMS Trauma Centre in New Delhi, where she was treated for COVID-19 for 18 days. Her condition continued to deteriorate for the first four days of her hospitalization before she began to show some improvement to her health. Sharma received high flow oxygen through a nasal cannula and was given antibiotics, but was not placed on a ventilator. She was discharged from AIIMS Hospital on June 25, 2020, but still required 2-3 litres of nasal oxygen per hour during her recovery. Vimala Sharma, who was 93-years old at the time of her diagnosis and hospitalization, was one of the oldest coronavirus patients to be released from the hospital in Dehli during the pandemic. Vimala Sharma died in Bhopal on August 15, 2020, at the age of 93, less than 2 months after her hospitalization for COVID-19. Indian President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted his condolences, writing, \\"Sad to hear about the demise of Mrs. Vimala Sharma, wife of former President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma.

It is also the type species of genus Brianaria. Taxonomy The species was first named Lecidea sylvicola by Julius von Flotow in 1829. This name, however, was not published validly because it did not follow the conventions of the code for botanical nomenclature; namely, it did not provide a diagnosis or reference to a validly published diagnosis. Gustav Wilhelm Körber published the species validly in 1855. In 2014, Stefan Ekman and Måns Svensson circumscribed the genus Brianaria to contain four closely related species formerly in the Micarea sylvicola group, and made Brianaria sylvicola the type species. Description Brianaria sylvicola is a crustose lichen that grows on rocks. It prefers acidic rocks, particularly those that are in the shade and protected from the rain. Occasionally, the lichen is found growing on other substrates, such as wood or rusted iron. No lichen substances are found in Brianaria sylvicola that are detectable by thin-layer chromatography.

They often have less stringent content moderation policies, and have become popular among the far right and others who espouse extreme and fringe viewpoints. Many alt-tech platforms position themselves as protectors of free speech. Alt-tech social media platforms experienced an increase in popularity in the late 2010s into 2020 due to the deplatforming, shadow- banning, and content moderation by mainstream platforms of some prominent people and organizations, as well as the perception among some in the political right that technology companies are censoring their views. Hope Not Hate researcher Joe Mulhall identified the deplatforming of Britain First in 2018 and Tommy Robinson in 2019 as two major events that spurred British social media users to join alt-tech platforms. Some websites and platforms that have been described as alt-tech include the Twitter alternatives Gab and Parler; YouTube alternatives BitChute and PewTube; Patreon alternative Hatreon; GoFundMe alternatives GoyFundMe and WeSearchr; Facebook alternatives Minds, MeWe, and WrongThink; Reddit alternative Voat; Wikipedia alternative Infogalactic; imageboard websites 4chan and 8chan; and chat and messaging platforms Discord and Telegram.

In 1981, the band's members again decreased to three and they released their albums Dream and After the Rain - Live in April 1981 on the Recession label. After that, the band's members split up. There have been no further record releases of the band after 1981.  Legacy  The most famous song of the band is Strangers, whose band was unknown for many people for a while until the song with the band's name was found on YouTube and was thought to have been made by the same band as The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet because of the singer's voice.

A naumachia, it functioned as a large stadium that could be filled with water to reenact naval battles for an audience. The building was located south of the Vatican Hill, northwest of the Mausoleum of Hadrian, and near the Gaianum. Based on a 5th century biblical text that recounts the crucifixion of St Peter saying: \\"Holy men … took down his body secretly and put it under the terebinth tree near the Naumachia, in the place which is called the Vatican\\" the ruins of a structure were excavated in 1743, between the streets via Alberico and via Cola di Rienzo. Hülsen, a historian involved in the project, suggested that this structure, built close to the Circus of Nero and lying north-west of the later Mausoleum of Hadrian, was the naumachia the name of the church was referring to and gave it the current name \\"Naumachia Vaticana\\". Subsequent excavations have helped to identify its shape, size and orientation. It was a rectangular structure with round internal and external corners, wide and, estimating from the excavations, at least long, oriented north-south. Esther Boise van Deman identified the style of the brickwork facing the naumachia as Trajanic. The archaeological work reveals it had substantial bleachers (tiered stands for spectators) and the surface was about one sixth the size of the earlier Augustan naumachia. Two parts of the foundations of the stands, with vaulted corridors and remnants of four rows of seats, have also been found preserved. Other remains show that the walls were covered with a water-resistant mortar and the area was fitted with drainage pipes. The current Church of San Pellegrino in Vaticano was once called San Pellegrino in Naumachia due to its vicinity to this stadium. A possible explanation for some sources erroneously calling it the Circus of Hadrian could be due to the similarities of its shape to that of other excavated ancient circuses, along with the site’s proximity to the Mausoleum dedicated to the same emperor. In the absence of any other texts or further mention of this naumachia, it is assumed that it was mainly used at the time of Trajan's rule. In 1932, Jérôme Carcopino reported the discovery among Fasti Ostienses of the dedication by Emperor Trajan on 11 November 109 of a naumachia.

He was a member of the Hsinchu City Council from 2002 to 2020, when he was elected to the Legislative Yuan. Early life and education Cheng was born on 31 May 1969, in Hsinchu, and graduated from National Hsinchu Senior High School. He studied journalism and diplomacy at National Chengchi University and completed a master's degree within the university's Graduate Institute of East Asian Studies, followed by doctoral study at Chung Hua University. He has taught as an assistant professor at Chung Hua University and Hsuan Chuang University. Political career Cheng served on the Hsinchu City Council from 2002 to 2020. He won his first election to the body as a Kuomintang candidate. Chen was listed as an independent candidate in the 2005 local elections, and returned to the Kuomintang for the 2009 election cycle. Cheng retained his seat in 2014 and 2018, running both times under the Kuomintang banner. Cheng contested a Legislative Yuan seat in Hsinchu during the 2004 legislative election as an independent candidate, and was not seated. He ran as the Kuomintang candidate in the Hsinchu City Constituency during the 2016 legislative election, after defeating in a party primary. He faced New Power Party candidate Chiu Hsien-chih and Democratic Progressive Party incumbent Ker Chien-ming. The Democratic Progressive Party suspected Cheng of buying votes during a banquet hosted by the Hsinchu City chapter of the Kuomintang in December 2015, as he attended the event while wearing a vest promoting his campaign. Subsequently, the Hsinchu District Prosecutors’ Office began an investigation into the banquet. The Democratic Progressive Party then filed a lawsuit against Kuomintang chair Eric Chu at the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office related to alleged vote buying at the banquet. The vote buying allegations became a topic of discussion during the second televised presidential debate between Chu and Tsai Ing-wen. During his unsuccessful 2016 campaign, pamphlets distributed by Cheng's supporters were confiscated by Hsinchu police. Though Cheng protested the confiscation, the Hsinchu District Prosecutors' office stated that the pamphlets merited further investigation, as they contained distortions about and sensationalist allegations against Ker Chien-ming. During his 2020 campaign, Cheng drew attention to a perceived double standard, stating that he had been labeled a pro-China candidate by the Democratic Progressive Party, but that his opponent used the term \\"Taiwan, China\\" while establishing a business in China, only to campaign on a promise to \\"Protect Taiwan\\". Cheng Cheng-chien was elected to the 10th Legislative Yuan, and became a member of the legislature's Education and Culture Committee. In July 2020, New Power Party chair Hsu Yung-ming asked Cheng to step down from that role, as Huang Kuo-chang accused Cheng of plagiarizing a portion of his doctoral thesis.

The surviving ramparts are high and wide at the base, now forming parts of hedgebanks. There are crossbanks between the concentric defences, built in more recent times to create fields. By the inner rampart on the south-west side, a pool of water marks a prominent rock-cut spring, and there are other springs in nearby fields; these may have influenced the choice of the site. Penbryn Spoons In 1829, two objects of cast bronze were found by a tenant farmer beneath a heap of stones in the hillfort. Known as the \\"Penbryn Spoons\\", they were donated in 1836, by the Rev.

On his left, Prince Olav of Norway. Vladimir Ivanovich Shcherbakov (, (14 July 1901 – 4 November 1981) was a Soviet general of the Red Army during World War II.  Biography  Born in a village in the Oryol Governorate (today in the Izmalkovsky District in Lipetsk Oblast), he entered the Red Army in 1919 by attending the officers course of the South-Western Front in Serpukhov. As part of the course, he participated in the fighting against the forces of General Denikin in the Kalach-na-Donu area in the period May-June 1919, and subsequently against the Cossack Mamontov Raid in the Yelets region. In July 1920 he took part in the Soviet-Polish War, fighting against the Poles and the Ukrainian forces of Simon Petlyura with the south- western front of General Yegorov, reaching the rank of company commander. In 1939-1940, as commander of the 104th Mountain Infantry Division of the 14th Army, he took part in the Winter War, in the artic sector of the front. He led his unit in the occupation of the Rybachy Peninsula, the city of Petsamo, the port of Liinahamari and the locality of Luostari on the border with Norway. For the skill shown in the conduct of the 104th division, Shcherbakov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In January 1941 he was appointed commander of the 50th Rifle Corps of the 23rd Army of the Northern Front on the Karelian Isthmus. At the beginning of the German invasion he became commander of the 42nd Army, then still under formation, with which in August 1941 he was engaged in the defense of the Koporye Bay, on the Leningrad front, where he was wounded in combat. Between 1 and 24 September 1941 he commanded the 8th Army, in defense of the Oranienbaum Bridgehead during the battles to block the German advance towards Leningrad. On 24 September he was removed from office, on the orders of Generals Georgy Zhukov and Andrei Zhdanov, because he was deemed \\"unsuitable for the role\\" and passed to command of the 11th Rifle Division in the same 8th Army. As commander of the 11th Division, Shcherbakov fought bravely, so in February 1942 he was again awarded the Order of the Red Banner and on 6 March of the same year he was promoted to command the 14th Army, a command which he would hold until the end of the war. With his army, he was engaged in the far north of Russia in defending the region between Murmansk, Kandalaksha and Uhtua against numerically superior German and Finnish forces, and managed to prevent the Nazis from capturing Murmansk and the railway that connected the city to the rest of Russia. For his valor as commander of the 14th Army, in 1943 he was promoted to the rank of general in the army corps. In the autumn of 1944 he led the 14th Army in the victorious Petsamo-Kirkenes Offensive, driving the German troops out of Soviet territory, capturing the Finnish port city of Petsamo, and liberating the far north of Norway including the town of Kirkenes. After the end of the war, he was first appointed deputy commander of the Baltic Military District and then commander of Arkhangelsk Military District. In 1949 he passed to the command of the Gorky Military District and in 1953 became deputy commander of the Voronezh Military District. In 1957 he retired from service and was elected deputy at the III convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. He died in Leningrad on November 4, 1981.

He was one of his brother's closest generals, and after he was killed in an ambush in 303, he was chosen as his successor. He saved Li Te's army from destruction during the aftermath of his death but later decided to let his nephew, Li Xiong handle military affairs. Although Li Liu succeeded Li Te first before Li Xiong, when Li Xiong became emperor in 306, he was not honored as an emperor.  Service under Li Xiáng and Li Te  Li Te was the fourth son of Li Mu and the younger brother of Li Te. His family was originally from Baxi Commandery (巴西郡; around present-day Langzhong, Sichuan) but moved to Qinzhou (秦州, modern eastern Gansu) and assimilated with the Di people. He was talented from a young age, earning the respect of the Colonel of Eastern Qiang Tribes He Pan, who made Li Liu his Director. In 296, A Di chieftain named Qiwannian rebelled around Li Liu's home coinciding with a terrible famine and military occupation. Li Liu followed his brother to their ancestral home in Yizhou to escape the turmoil in the north.(元康中，氐齊萬年反，關西擾亂，天水、略陽、扶風、始平諸郡皆被兵，頻歲大饑，流移就穀，相與入漢川者數萬家。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 In 300, Li Liu's other brother, Li Xiáng joined a rebellion led by Zhao Xin against the Jin dynasty (266–420) in Yizhou. Li Liu followed suit and gathered his own men to join his brother. However, Zhao Xin would kill Li Xiáng out of jealousy the following year. Zhao Xin sent messengers to console Li Liu and Li Te about their loss but they only grew enraged. The two brothers led troops to Chengdu to avenge Li Xiáng, forcing Zhao Xin to flee from the province.(廞恐朝廷討己，遣長史費遠、犍為太守李苾、督護常俊督萬餘人斷北道，次綿竹之石亭。特密收合得七千餘人，夜襲遠軍，遠大潰，因放火燒之，死者十八九。進攻成都。廞聞兵至，驚懼不知所為。李苾、張征等夜斬關走出，文武盡散。廞獨與妻子乘小船走至廣都，為下人硃竺所殺。特至成都，縱兵大掠，害西夷護軍薑發，殺廞長史袁治及廞所置守長，遣其牙門王角、李基詣洛陽陳廞之罪狀。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 Li Te was now in control of Yizhou but with Jin forces led by Luo Shang heading his way, he decided to establish friendly relationships. Li Liu was tasked in sending oxens and wine to Luo Shang at Mianzhu, which were accepted. For his efforts in putting down Zhao Xin, Li Liu was made General Who Exerts Valor.(朝廷論討趙廞功，拜特宣威將軍，弟流奮武將軍，皆封侯。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 84 However, Li Te's attempts at making peace with Luo Shang was met with issues as the court in Luoyang demanded that refugees who fled from the north return to their respective provinces. The refugees did not want to leave the south, as they heard that the north was still in chaos, so Li Te begged Luo Shang for months to extend their stay. Luo Shang was lenient at first but was soon inclined to have them move, so Li Te prepared himself for war. Li Liu helped his brother gather more men and trained the refugees to bolster his forces.(特從之。冬，十月，特分爲二營，特居北營，流居東營，繕甲厲兵，戒嚴以待之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 84 As predicted, fighting broke out between the two side in 301. Li Te scored the first victory despite Luo Shang attacking first. Li Te then made Li Liu Grand General Who Guards The East and had him follow Te through most of his campaigns. The following year, Li Liu joined in the assault on Piqiao (毗橋, in present-day Xindu County, Sichuan), helping his other brother Li Xiāng (note the different pinyin) rout Luo Shang's best troops.(八月，特破德陽。流次成都北「上」〔郭〕。李驤在毗橋，尚遣將張興偽降於驤，覘士眾。還以告尚。尚遣叟兵襲驤，破之。流、驤并眾攻尚軍。軍失利，喪其器甲。) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 7.6 Yet, even through the efforts and successes of Li Liu and his brothers, Li Te would suddenly die during an ambush in 303 led by Luo Shang.  Taking command of the army  Li Te's sudden death took his army by surprise. Li Liu and the others fell back to Chizu (赤祖, in present day Mianzhu,Sichuan), where they hastily appointed Li Liu to succeed his brother. However, Luo Shang was quick to capitalise on his recent victory and sent a large contingent of troops to attack Li Liu's camp. Li Liu and the others fought hard against the invaders but the situation worsened when the Di leaders, Fu Cheng (苻成) and Kui Bo (隗伯) betrayed him. The situation was so desperate, that Li Te's widow Lady Luo personally fought in the defense. Miraculously, Li Liu drove out both the invaders and traitors from his camp before quickly putting Chengdu under siege to place pressure on Luo Shang.(三月，羅尚遣督護何沖、常深攻李流，涪陵民藥紳亦起兵攻流。流與李驤拒紳，何沖乘虛攻北營，氐苻成、隗伯在營中，叛應之。蕩母羅氏擐甲拒戰，伯手刃傷其目，羅氏氣益壯；會流等破深、紳，引兵還，與沖戰，大破之。成、伯率其黨突出詣尚。流等乘勝進抵成都，尚復閉城自守。蕩馳馬逐北，中矛而死。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 85 After just barely surviving an attack, Li Liu began to wonder if he should continue the rebellion. Jin reinforcements led by Zong Dai (宗岱) and Sun Fu (孫阜) were approaching and his brother Li Han was pushing for surrender. His nephew Li Xiong and Li Xiang opposed him but Li Liu had made up his mind. He sent his son Li Shi and Li Han's son Li Hu as hostages to Sun Fu. However, Li Xiong and Li Li (李離) went against Li Liu's orders, and instead routed Sun Fu while Zong Tai passed away naturally. The reinforcements from Jingzhou all fled home because of this. Li Liu grew ashamed due to not following Li Xiong's advice but seeing that his nephew was more capable than he is, decided to entrust Xiong with military matters.(五月，李流〔請〕降於孫阜，遣子為質。乃舉兵與李離襲阜。阜軍敗績。宋岱病卒墊江，〔荊〕州軍退。〔初〕，〔流以特、蕩死，而岱、阜並至，恐懼。李含勸流降，流從之。雄與驤諫之，不納。遣子世及含子胡質於阜。李離聞父、舅將降，自梓潼還，欲諫不及。雄與離謀襲阜，曰：「若功成事濟，當為人主，要三年一更。」雄曰：「與君計雖定，老子不從，若何？」離曰：「當制〕〔之。若不可，便行大事。雖君叔，〕〔事不得已。老父〕〔在君，夫復何言。」雄乃說六郡人士，激以尚之自侵〕，〔懼以共殘蜀民〕〔之禍，陳〕〔可富貴之利。〕〔得以破阜。阜軍死者甚眾。而岱病亡，荊州軍退。轉攻尚。流慚其短，軍事任雄。雄數破尚軍〕。「雄」逼攻尚，尚保「太」「城」〔成都〕「中」。) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 8.7 Li Liu moved his camp to Pi County. His army was left with little supply as many of the people of Yizhou decided to migrate to neighbouring provinces. Luckily, Luo Shang had a fall out with his subordinate Xu Yu (徐轝), who wanted him to ally with the hermit Fan Changsheng but was turned down. Xu Yu defected to Li Liu who carried out Xu Yu's wishes. Fan Changsheng had thousands of families under him at Mount Qingcheng, who seeked his protection from the war. Fan agreed to ally himself with Li Liu and provided him with food and supply to last the entire war.(遂入郫城，流移營據之。三蜀百姓並保險結塢，城邑皆空，流野無所略，士眾饑困。涪陵人范長生率千餘家依青城山，尚參軍涪陵徐轝求為汶山太守，欲要結長生等，與尚掎角討流。尚不許，轝怨之，求使江西，遂降於流，說長生等使資給流軍糧。長生從之，故流軍復振。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 During the winter of 303, Li Liu grew deathly ill. He had decided that his nephew, Li Xiong should be the one to lead his army. Li Liu soon died and Li Xiong took over his command. Li Xiong would drive out Luo Shang and the Jin forces out from Yizhou the following year, establishing his own state of Cheng (later renamed Han in 338). Li Xiong posthumously honored his uncle as \\"King Wen of Qin (秦文王)\\" but did not give any further promotion unlike his father after Li Xiong became emperor in 306.(九月，流疾篤，謂諸將曰：「驍騎高明仁愛，識量多奇，固足以濟大事，然前軍英武，殆天所相，可共受事於前軍，以為成都王也。」遂薨，年五十六。諸將共立雄為主，雄稱尊，追諡流秦文王，子龍嗣。) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 6  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.)

While this list is mainly about Presidental spouses, administrations with a bachelor or widowed President have a section on the individual (usually a family member) that filled the role of First Lady. The list includes books and journal articles written in English after c.1900 as well as primary sources written by the individual themselves. The books included here were selected because they were either published by an academic press or major nationally known publisher or were reviewed in mainstream academic journals. These works are generally intended for an adult audience; works specifically intended for a youth or children are not included. Several Presidents were unmarried for all or part of their administration. * Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Chester A. Arthur, and Martin Van Buren were widowed prior to becoming President and remained unmarried during their administration; in these cases, family members acted in the place of First Lady and White House host. * John Tyler, Benjamin Harrison, and Woodrow Wilson's wives died while they were in office. Tyler and Wilson both quickly remarried during their presidency. * James Buchanan was a life long bachelor and never married. * Grover Cleveland entered the White House as a bachelor, but married while in office. Because this list also serves as a bibliography of first ladies, in these cases, when someone regularly filled the role of White House hostess and informal first lady while the President was unmarried, an entry is provided.

It followed the boundaries of the city at that time. History The invasion of Portugal (1807) by the French that led to the occupation of Lisbon, followed by a second French invasion in 1810 that was repelled by British and Portuguese troops at the Lines of Torres Vedras, the Portuguese Civil War of (18281834) and other foreign military interventions that plagued Portugal at the beginning of the 19th century led to the development of the doctrine that it was impossible to defend the entire national territory of Portugal with the resources available. At the same time, it was observed that as the capital, Lisbon, had the greatest population and was the economic centre of the country, no invasion of Portugal would succeed unless the city was controlled. It was therefore concluded that the best way to defend Portugal was to defend Lisbon with all available resources. Fort of São Julião da Barra Planning In 1857, the then Minister of War, the Marquis of Sá da Bandeira appointed a commission to define a defensive system for Lisbon. The study initially suggested the development of a system in three lines, making use of previous defensive installations. The first line would be a ring between Sacavém and the Fort of São Julião da Barra, which would be centred on new fortifications on the Monsanto Hills (Serra de Monsanto). The second line would make use of the second line of defence built by the Liberals in 1833 during the Civil War, while the third line would be on the left bank of the Tagus, centred on the Fort of Almada. After the death of Sá da Bandeira in 1876, the idea of using the Civil War lines of 1833 was definitively abandoned and the 1857 plan ended up consisting of a northerly line that made use of the Lines of Torres Vedras; a line closer to Lisbon between Vialonga, north of Sacavém on the Tagus, and Sintra; a third line, which became the Campo Entrincheirado; and a line to the south of the river. Development The main means established for the defence of the capital was the Campo Entrincheirado, which involved developing a fortification system that followed the city’s perimeter at that time. To this end, several new and modern fortifications were built and existing ones, in one case dating back to the 16th century, were upgraded. The forts were equipped with modern artillery pieces and connected by roads and by telephone and telegraph networks that were quite advanced for the time. From 1899, the Campo Entrincheirado became a separate military command, permanently organized on a war footing, whose commander was a general, reporting directly to the Minister of War. With headquarters at the Monsanto Fort, considered the essential stronghold of the system, the Campo Entrincheirado was to be manned by a permanent staff of 25,000, consisting of infantry, artillery and engineering troops. In event of attack it was envisaged that these would be reinforced by other troops garrisoned in the Lisbon area. Subsequent use After the First World War, the defensive concept of a fixed defence, on which the Campo Entrincheirado was based, became obsolete. During World War II some of the facilities were used for anti-aircraft positions. After that war some of the coastal fortifications remained active, the last one being deactivated in 1999. Over time, the forts took on new functions, which now include housing the national archives, a museum, and two prisons. The Forts The nucleus of the Campo Entrincheirado extended from Caxias to Sacavém and consisted of the following forts, which were connected by a road, completed in 1902, known as the Estrada Militar de Caxias-Sacavém (Military Road of Caxias-Sacavém): *Fort of Sacavém *Fort of Ameixoeira *Fort of Monsanto * Fort of King Luís I, Caxias This land perimeter was complemented by fortifications that protected the River Tagus, namely: *Fort of Bom Sucesso *Fort of Alto do Duque The Tagus estuary and the south bank of the river were protected by two other forts: *Fort of São Julião da Barra *Fort of Almada Several other smaller forts, redoubts, posts, and batteries complemented this system.

Opening  Federal Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and French Defence Minister Florence Parly spoke at the opening and reaffirmed their commitment to stronger military cooperation. According to von der Leyen, Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) marks an important step towards a European Security and Defence Union. The agreement on Pesco and a European defence fund are a \\"cultural revolution\\", enthused Parly. \\"And there would be more steps to follow.\\"  Agenda  The Munich Security Report 2018 was published before the conference with the title \\"To the Brink - and Back?\\". The key themes of the conference and the Munich Security Report 2018 included the crisis of the liberal international order and the consequences from Donald Trump's first year as President of the United States. \\"Last year, the world moved too close to a major international conflict,\\" MSC chairman Wolfgang Ischinger stated in the run-up to the conference. \\"The rhetorical escalations of individual decision-makers are very worrying, whether on the Korean peninsula, in the Gulf or in Eastern Europe - if someone makes a wrong decision in charged situations, that could quickly set off a dangerous chain reaction,\\" Ischinger warned. In particular, the future and capacity of the European Union and its relations with Russia and the United States were on the agenda of MSC 2018. In addition, the threat of the liberal international order, the numerous conflicts in the Middle East - in particular the worsening relations between the Gulf States - and the development of the political situation in the Sahel were discussed. Also disarmament issues were discussed, especially with respect to the conflict over the North Korean nuclear program. Panel discussions took place on the following topics: * EU and NATO defence cooperation * Nuclear security policy * Security for the Sahel * Jihad after the caliphate * Countries between Russia and Europe  Participants  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu displays a piece of an armed Iranian drone that was shot down over Israel after infiltrating from Syria. The idea to display the drone piece came from his spokesman David Keyes. Benjamin Netanyahu was the first-ever Israeli Prime Minister to take part in the conference. While delivering his remarks, Netanyahu brandished a wing flap from an Iranian drone that infiltrated Israel a few weeks earlier and was shot down. Netanyahu's dramatic display grabbed headlines around the world and inspired memes on social media. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif called Netanyahu's prop a \\"cartoonish circus\\" that \\"does not even deserve the dignity of a response.\\" Netanyahu said the fact that Zarif was forced to respond was \\"the whole point\\" of the display and a public relations win. Netanyahu's spokesman David Keyes was credited for his role in shaping the prime minister's media strategy. Other guests included UN Secretary-General António Guterres, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Arriving from the US were Secretary of Defense General James Mattis and National Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, H.R. McMaster.

Statements  Nicholas Burns, the former US Ambassador to NATO, stated: \\"We have troops in Poland and three Baltic countries. I think NATO is unified. We have to continue the sanctions against Russia.\\" Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Senate, claimed that \\"NATO’s continued existence provokes new threats, rather than overcoming them. This conference has always been anti-Russian. Unfortunately, they try to blame Russia for all the problems facing the West.\\" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel accused Russia and China of trying to \\"undermine\\" the liberal Western world order.

Among the 600 participants were heads of state and government from more than 35 countries, 50 foreign and 30 defence ministers, other representatives from the fields of politics, the military, the arms industry, business and science, as well as members of international intergovernmental and civil society organizations.  Welcome  The chairman of the conference Wolfgang Ischinger opened the event with the motto \\"The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?\\" The question was also discussed in the \\"Munich Security Report,\\" the annual publication accompanying the event. Ischinger described \\"a reorganization of central building blocks of the international order,\\" characterized by a new era of Great Power rivalries between the USA, China and Russia as well as a certain leadership vacuum in the \\"liberal world order.\\" Prior to this, he had emphasized the importance of multilateralism in today's world and described the European Union in this context as \\"alive and kicking.\\"  Opening statements  Federal Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and British Defence Minister Gavin Williamson spoke at the opening. Both politicians advocated greater European cooperation in defence. Williamson highlighted the growing global threats and stressed the importance of the continued close cooperation of NATO partners despite Brexit, as NATO is indispensable for the protection of citizens. Von der Leyen spoke of \\"the Great Powers returning to rivalry,\\" which also affected Germany and Europe. She declared that she would continue to support closer military cooperation between the EU and the United Kingdom even after Brexit. Among the main topics of the conference were \\"the self-assertion of the European Union, transatlantic cooperation and the possible effects of a new era of competition between major powers.\\" When discussing European security, the European NATO members' defence budgets were also discussed. Other topics included the security situation in the Sahel, Eastern Europe, Southeastern Europe, the Middle East and Syria, and non- proliferation of nuclear weapons and trade barriers.  International cooperation  During a panel discussion on the future of defence alliances, Japanese Foreign Minister Tarō Kōno called for greater international cooperation for the protection of the international order: \\"If the U.S. can no longer act alone as a policeman, Japan, Europe and other like-minded countries will have to increase burden-sharing.\\" Other participants in the discussion, however, expressed doubts as to whether cooperating Central Powers would be able to stand their ground against competing goals of the Great Powers. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticized the USA's demand to the Europeans to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran and urged the European states to make a greater effort to preserve the agreement.  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)  Another focus of the conference was the INF Treaty. The speeches of Vice President of the United States Mike Pence and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made it clear that the failure of the INF Treaty could hardly be prevented. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described the consequences of a failure of the INF Treaty as \\"very serious.\\" In order to save the treaty, some participants expressed the hope that China would participate in the negotiations on medium- range nuclear systems, but this was rejected by Chinese foreign policy expert Yang Jiechi, as China rejects a \\"multilateralisation of the INF Treaty for the Asia-Pacific region.\\" India expressed similar sentiments. Chancellor Merkel warned against \\"blind rearmament\\" should the INF Treaty fail.  Transatlantic relations  When discussing transatlantic relations, observers described \\"rifts between the USA and Germany.\\" These were also evident in the speech by Vice President Mike Pence, who defended US policy and called on European states to give the US more support in conflicts with Iran or the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasized the importance of multilateral structures and transatlantic cooperation in his speech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also emphasized the importance of international cooperation: \\"We must not break this up.\\" Within the US delegation, opinions were divided. Former US Vice President Joe Biden, for example, was very critical of the current president's policies: \\"This will pass! We'll be back!\\"  Climate change and security  For the first time since the conference was founded, a panel discussion on the topic of \\"Climate Change and Security\\" was included in the conference's main programme. The German climate researcher Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned sternly about the consequences of climate change. Bunny McDiarmid, co-managing director of Greenpeace, explained the European Fridays for Future movement to the audience and said: \\"We have schoolchildren marching in the streets because they don't believe that politicians act fast enough.\\" Amnesty International Secretary- General Kumi Naidoo warned: \\"Nature does not negotiate.\\" Representatives of the US government did not take part in the discussion. However, former US Secretary of State John Kerry sat in the audience and declared politics as being in the process of committing \\"consensual suicide of our planet.\\"  Participants  Among the heads of state and government attending the event were German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani, President of Romania Klaus Iohannis, as well as Prime Minister of Bangladesh Hasina Wajed, and Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The US delegation included US Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of the US President, Ivanka Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner. Other guests included Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Federica Mogherini, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, IMF Director Christine Lagarde, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim, British Minister of Defence Gavin Williamson and his French counterpart Florence Parly, Yang Jiechi, as a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party responsible for foreign policy, and the Nobel Peace Prize winners Tawakkol Karman and Beatrice Fihn. On behalf of the German Federal Government, in addition to Chancellor Merkel and Defence Minister von der Leyen, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, Economics Minister Peter Altmaier, Health Minister Jens Spahn and Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner attended the conference. French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled their visits.  Award ceremonies  This year, the annual Ewald von Kleist Preis was awarded to the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Northern Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev for their agreement over the naming dispute between the two countries. For the first time during the conference, the John McCain Dissertation Award for outstanding research on security-political issues was presented to two political scientists, Abigail Post and Ulrike Franke.  Side events  In addition to the main conference, there were numerous side events, including the Munich Young Leaders Program organized by the MSC and the Körber Foundation, and other events on climate change and security hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme, energy security, cyber security, health security and international threats.  Evaluation  According to conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, it was one of the most important conferences of recent years, as it had become clear that the international system was under extreme threat. By far the most important speech, in his opinion, came from Angela Merkel. As a negative tendency, it could be observed that although conflict parties used the conference to present their position, they did not want to discuss with each other what had originally been the strength of the conference.

Early life Buckley was born in Tullamore, County Offaly, Ireland. He was the eldest of 17 children, 6 of whom died without passing infancy His father was a trade union official who later became a barrister and his socialist views influenced his son Pat. Buckley decided that he wanted to become a priest at the age of three. Priesthood He studied for the priesthood in Waterford and was ordained there in 1976. He later gained a master's degree in politics and social anthropology from Queen's University Belfast. His first posting was to St Peter's in the Lower Falls area of West Belfast. Buckley claimed that, believing the quality of the priests' accommodation to be much higher than properties in poverty-stricken area in which it was located, he clashed with his fellow clergy. During the 1981 Irish hunger strike, Buckley celebrated Mass in the Maze prison. During this time he met and spoke with prisoner Bobby Sands, the leader of the IRA prisoners participating in the hunger strike, predicting that Sands' dedication to his beliefs would lead to the hunger striker's death, which occurred on 5 May 1981. Following disagreements with Cardinal Cahal Daly, he was sent to Kilkeel parish in 1983. He claimed that Cardinal Daly later offered to move him to an Australian parish on account of Buckley's liberalism before deciding on transferring Buckley to Larne, a mainly Protestant town, in 1984. Daly then suspended Buckley from the priesthood in 1986. Buckley continued to practice independently and refused to move out of the parochial home. In 2011 he brought a legal case against the diocese of Down and Connor claiming Squatters' Rights. In January 2012, agreement was reached between the parties which allowed Buckley to remain in the property. Independent ministry and excommunication He organised bi-weekly masses and officiated at marriages of divorcees who wished to remarry, as well as baptising babies from mixed marriages and blessing same-sex couples. In August 2016, Buckley claimed to have married over 3,000 couples. On 19 May 1998 he was ordained a bishop by Bishop Michael Cox in June 1998, Jim Cantwell, director of the Irish Catholic Press and Information Office, said that Cox's consecration of Buckley was valid but illicit. In response, both Cox and Buckley were excommunicated by the Catholic Church. Local councillor He was elected to Larne Borough Council in the 1989 Northern Ireland local elections, but lost his seat at the following elections in 1993. Sham marriage conviction In December 2013, Buckley pled guilty to officiating at 14 sham marriages and received a 3-and- a-half-year sentence, which was suspended for three years because he was being treated for HIV. He stated that his actions had been motivated by \\"strong compassion\\" for the illegal immigrants' situations, However it was also noted by the judge that Buckley received considerable financial reward for his actions and had \\"lost face and standing in the community\\" as a result of his actions. Personal life In October 1999 he announced that he was gay. In February 2010 at the age of 57 he married his boyfriend of three years, 32-year-old Eduardo Yango from The Philippines, in a ceremony in Larne.

The mouthpiece is a circular opening that is enclosed by a rim and that leads to the instrument via a semi-spherical or conical cavity called the cup. From the cup, a smaller opening (the throat) leads into a tapered cylindrical passage called the backbore. The backbore is housed in a tapered shank, which is inserted into an opening called the receiver on the main body of the instrument. Single-reed instruments, capped double-reed instruments, and fipple flutes have mouthpieces while exposed double-reed instruments (apart from those using pirouettes) and open flutes do not. The characteristics of a mouthpiece and reed can play a significant role on the sound of the instrument. On all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. This is done by pressing the lips together and blowing air through them in order to produce a 'buzz.' The mouthpiece is where this lip vibration takes place. On most instruments, the mouthpiece can be detached from the main instrument in order to facilitate putting the instrument in its case, to use different mouthpieces with the same instrument, or to 'play' the mouthpiece by itself to exercise the player's embouchure. Different mouthpieces will produce different qualities of tone when used with the same instrument. Lower instruments also have larger mouthpieces, to maximize resonance (see pitch of brass instruments). Also, mouthpieces are selected to suit the embouchure of the player, to produce a certain timbre, or to optimize the instrument for certain playing styles. For example, trumpet and trombone mouthpieces are usually semi-spherical whereas French horn mouthpieces are conical. * Mouthpiece (woodwind), a component of a woodwind instrument * Mouthpiece (brass), a component of a brass instrument  Bibliography  * * Category:Musical instrument parts and accessories Category:Woodwind instruments ","title":"Mouthpiece (wind instrument)"},{"id":"65231040","text":"Caccia al tesoro () is a 2017 Italian comedy film directed by Carlo Vanzina.

He was linked to the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. He served as Minister of State from 1931 to 1933, during the Second Republic.  Biography  Born on 8 April 1878 in Barcelona to a well-off family, son of Juan Antonio Zulueta y Fernández and María Dolores Escolano y de la Peña.; ; He was of Cuban descent on his father side and Gaditan on his mother side. Zulueta, a native Spanish speaker, never got to fully dominate the Catalan language. His father (who died in 1894) was a prominent lawyer, linked to the local banking industry. After the decease of the former, Zulueta interrupted his secondary education studies to work as bank clerk. Since 1903 he shared letters with Miguel de Unamuno who encouraged him to travel to Geneva and Paris. After a spell in Berlin, he returned to Spain in 1905. He was elected as Barcelona municipal councillor in 1905, running within the Alejandro Lerroux's Fraternidad Republicana platform, yet he disengaged from the commitment to the party and moved away from Barcelona. He met Francisco Giner de los Ríos (founder and leading figure of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza), for whom he served as interlocutor until 1910, as Giner de los Ríos seeked to cultivate the cultural and political bridges between Barcelona and Madrid. After starting studies in Philosophy and Letters at the University of Salamanca, he earned the licentiate degree from the Central University in Madrid in 1906. He would later earn a PhD from the same centre in 1910,; reading a dissertation titled La pedagogía de Rousseau y la educación de las percepciones de espacio y de tiempo (\\"Rousseau's pedagogy and the education of the perceptions of space and time\\"). Zulueta, caricaturised by Bagaria (1911) He was attracted by the Republican-Socialist Conjunction in 1910. Linked to the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, Zulueta joined the Republican Reformist Party led by Gumersindo de Azcárate by 1914. His political ideas oscillated in between regenerationism, the left-wing, and a moderate liberalism. He would become an opponent of marxism-leninism. In 1910, he was appointed as lecturer of the Central University, where he would later obtain the chair of Pedagogy. For the rest of the Restoration, Zulueta was elected a number of times to the Congress of Deputies in representation of Barcelona (1910), Madrid (1919), and Redondela (1923). He was one of the intellectuals who signed the Manifesto for the Unión Democrática Española para la Liga de la Sociedad de Naciones Libres (\\"Spanish Democratic Union for the Society of the League of Free Nations\\"), published in 1918. Following the proclamation of the Spanish Second Republic in April 1931, he was proposed as Ambassador to the Holy See by the Provisional Government, but the Vatican rejected the Agrément because he was a disciple of Giner de los Ríos. His application had counted with the endorsement of Francisco Vidal y Barraquer, the Archbishop of Tarragona, and by Federico Tedeschini, the Apostolic Nuncio in Madrid. He was elected to the constituent Cortes at the June 1931 election in representation of Badajoz. Zulueta (upper right) accompanying Niceto Alcalá Zamora during a visit to San Sebastián in 1932. Following the exit of the Radical Republican Party from the government, Zulueta (still not a member of Republican Action) was appointed as Minister of State by Manuel Azaña in December 1931, replacing Alejandro Lerroux. After Zulueta's exit from the ministry in June 1933, he was destined as Spanish Ambassador to Nazi Germany, where he barely served for three months. Years later, he wrote the memoirs of his brief spell in Berlin, \\"Mis recuerdos del Führer\\" (1954), leaving a portrait of Adolf Hitler and the pervasive manipulation techniques of nazism. Following the exit of Azaña from the premiership, Zulueta joined Republican Action (he had not been a member until then). He was again appointed as Ambassador to the Holy See after the 1936 general election, and this time the Vatican accepted him. Zulueta was forced out from the Palazzo di Espagna in Rome by Francoists upon the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and decided to go in exile, moving to Paris. He was later offered a place in Colombia by President Eduardo Santos. From then on, he collaborated with the Liberal newspaper El Tiempo and also worked for the Universidad Nacional, the , the and the University of Los Andes. He decided to move to the United States in 1960, and died in New York on 2 August 1964.

Ernst & Young has become the new auditor.Martin Jašminský, Olga Skalková, Unexpected exchange of audit firm may prolong IPB privatization , Hospodářské noviny, March 5, 1997 At government meetings on July 23, 1997 and March 4, 1998, the government decided to sell the state share to Nomura Holdings. Nomura Holdings paid CZK 3 billion for 36.29% of the shares and its shareholding increased to 46.6%. As the bank's financial situation was unsustainable, Nomura increased its share capital by CZK 6 billion and issued subordinated bonds in the same amount, which was supposed to stabilize IPB. However, a change in credit risk management was necessary for further successful development. Issues In order to avoid the need to create provisions, IPB carried out operations to reduce credit risk. These were often non-standard operations leading to a reduction in the volume of classified loans in the bank which did not result in a reduction in risk, such as the sale of bad debts to NIPB. The short-term measures of the turn of 1998 and 1999 ensured that the bank did not have to make provisions. In February 2000, the Czech National Bank identified multiple deficiencies in IPB, which appealed against the findings and filed objections against individual points. IPB stated that it is taking steps to reduce credit risk and increase the bank's share capital by CZK 13.4 billion. The appeal contained 270 pages of text and 9700 pages of annexes. Due to the scope of this document, the CNB did not have a good chance of intervening on the basis of the findings of the comprehensive inspection and therefore had to wait for the confirmation of its findings by the auditor. On June 12, 2000, massive withdrawals were made from the bank. By June 19, all the assets and liabilities of IPB were taken over by ČSOB. The bank's collapse resulted in losses valued at CZK67.8 billion.

Polis (born April 28, 1947 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American lawyer, writer, stockbroker and former professional boxing judge. From 1973 to 2009, she judged 143 professional boxing contests, including many world championship ones. Polis is the first woman in the sport's history to become licensed to judge professional boxing fights. Biography Polis is the daughter of a man from New York City who moved to Philadelphia and opened a store there, named \\"Consolidated Home Furnishings\\". She grew in Jenkintown and enjoyed tennis, swimming and cheer-leading. In 1971, already in her early twenties, Polis got married to Bob Polis, a boxing referee. Polis would attend boxing fights live to accompany her husband to his job. One night, he decided to teach her how to score a fight he was officiating at, figuring that keeping a score sheet would keep her entertained. Her husband later checked her score card and was impressed enough by her scoring that he took it to Zack Clayton, who was the Pennsylvania State Boxing Commissioner. Clayton told Carol Polis that he agreed with her score more than with the fight's three official judges' cards and encouraged her to keep scoring fights. Eventually, Polis applied for a boxing judge license and was appointed one by Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp during the early 1970s. On February 19, 1973, Polis was given her first assignment as a boxing judge, the important main event between perennial Heavyweight world title contenders Jimmy Young and Earnie Shavers at the Philadelphia Spectrum. Shavers won this fight by a third round knockout; both he and Young would later lose decisions to Muhammad Ali for the world Heavyweight title (and Shavers would also lose to Larry Holmes for Holmes' WBC world Heavyweight title as well) Polis' first international assignment and first world title contest as a boxing judge came when she traveled to Denmark to judge a fight between WBA world Junior Middleweight champion Ayub Kalule and challenger Emiliano Villa. This fight took place on April 17, 1980 at the Brondby Hallen in Brondby and was won by Kalule by a tenth round knockout. On November 14, 1980, Polis got her second world championship boxing contest assignment, a fight between WBA and lineal world Bantamweight champion, Puerto Rico's Julian Solis and Polis' fellow Philadelphian, challenger Jeff Chandler. Polis had Chandler ahead by 128-118 when he beat Solis by 14th round knockout. The first fight with a world Heavyweight championship on the line in which Polis was invited to judge took place on December 10, 1982 at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was the controversial first fight between WBA world champion Mike Weaver and Michael Dokes. Despite being present at the contest as a judge, she was not able to score since the bout was stopped one minute and three seconds into the first round; referee Joey Curtis, a WBA investigation later found, had been affected by the then recent tragedy in the fight between Ray Mancini and Duk Koo Kim-after which Kim died- and he waved the fight over giving Dokes the win by first round knockout. Dokes and Weaver would then rematch five months later with Dokes retaining the title by a 15 round draw (tie). Polis was not involved in their rematch. On October 19, 1984, as part of a program headlined by the undisputed world Middleweight title rematch bout between champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler and challenger Mustafa Hamsho in a doubleheader that was televised by HBO Boxing from the Madison Square Garden in New York, Polis officiated the fight for the WBA's vacant world Junior Middleweight title between Jamaica's Mike McCallum and Ireland's Sean Mannion. Polis had been assigned the main event between Hagler and Hamsho along with Eva Shain; Hagler-Hamsho 2 was going to become the first ever world title bout to be judged by two women judges. But one of Hagler's trainers (not Hagler himself) protested having two women judge the fight, and when Polis was reassigned to judge McCallum-Mannion instead along with Carol Castellano the historic honor fell on the program's secondary event instead. Polis scored the fight 149-136 for McCallum, who, with a fifteen rounds unanimous decision victory made history as well, as the first Jamaican world boxing champion in history. Polis was one of the three judges assigned the rematch between World Boxing Association world Super-Bantamweight champion, the Puerto Rican Victor Callejas and his challenger, former world champion, Italy's Loris Stecca, fought on November 8, 1985 at Rimini, Italy, in which Callejas won with a highlight-reel sixth round knockout. Polis had Stecca ahead after five rounds but the two knockdowns suffered by the Italian in round six gave the Puerto Rican a one point lead on her card when the bout was stopped in the champion's favor right after the bell finishing that round sounded (since round seven had not started yet, the fight was recorded as a sixth round knockout victory for the Puerto Rican boxer) Carol Polis judged the December 16, 1995 contest between former and future world Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and Buster Mathis, Jr., won by Tyson by a third round knockout at the Spectrum (by then named the \\"Cores States Spectrum\\") in Philadelphia. Polis retired as a boxing judge after scoring a bout between Gabriel Rosado and Ariel Espinal at South Philadelphia High School in Philadelphia on April 4, 2009. Rosado won the bout by a fifth round technical knockout. Book Polis, along with author Rich Hershlag, co-wrote a biographical book about her life and experiences as a boxing judge. The book, titled \\"The Lady is a Champ\\", was released on May 10, 2012. Personal Polis and her husband had four children. She moved to Cape Coral, Florida, near Ft. Myers, once her days as a boxing judge were over.

Above all, he made a name for himself worldwide as an interpreter of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1922, Hansen went to Berlin as a pupil of Edwin Fischer, with whom he studied together with Grete Sultan and Ferry Gebhardt, and five years later he made his debut with the Berliner Philharmoniker under their principal conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Further concerts followed under Eugen Jochum, Willem Mengelberg, Herbert von Karajan and even Richard Strauss.

Cava is running in the 2020 Miami-Dade County mayoral election.  Early life and education  Daniella Levine was born on September 14, 1955 in New York City. Levine traveled throughout Latin America in her youth. She later attended Yale University, where she served as the President of the Student Council, graduating in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology. Levine later attended Columbia University, receiving a Juris Doctor in 1981 and a Master of Social Work in 1983. Levine moved to Miami in 1980 with her husband, Dr. Robert Cava.  Legal and non-profit career  Upon her arrival to Miami in 1980, Levine became an attorney with Legal Services of Greater Miami, later leaving in 1985 after becoming legal director for the Guardian Ad Litem program, a court-run child welfare legal program. During her time as a lawyer, she served on the Florida Bar Committee on Legal Needs of Children. In 1992, following Hurricane Andrew, Levine was appointed as the Miami-Dade County program manager for the Florida Department of Children and Families, holding the position until 1994. The following year, she founded a youth outreach program with Barry University. In 1996, Levine founded the Human Services Coalition, later renamed Catalyst Miami, which, through partnerships with the United Way and local businesses, aids low-income families with monetary advice. At Catalyst Miami, she launched the Prosperity Campaign which helps people increase their income and savings, allowing families to build financial security. Levine served as the president and chief executive officer of Catalyst Miami until 2013.  Political career  = Miami-Dade County commission = In 2013, Levine, a Democrat, began mulling a run against Miami- Dade County District 8 Commissioner Lynda Bell, a hard-line conservative who was unpopular in the district. The district includes much of southern Miami- Dade County, including suburban localities like West Kendall and Cutler Bay, and agricultural communities like Homestead and Redland. Levine entered the race in 2014, taking her husband's last name in a district where more than 40% of the district's population is Hispanic. Levine Cava narrowly defeated Bell in the August 26 election, receiving 52% of the vote to Bell's 48%. In 2016, Levine Cava sponsored legislation in the Miami-Dade County Commission that requires local candidates for office to register when they raise money for political action committees. Levine Cava easily won reelection in 2018, receiving over 61% of the vote. In November 2019, Levine Cava published a letter in the Miami Herald criticizing the Florida State Legislature for diverting funds for affordable housing. This diverted nearly $1.4 billion to balance the state budget. Levine Cava also created the Infill Housing Program which aims to build affordable housing on County-owned land in her district. During her tenure, Levine Cava has advocated for the protection of the environment. In 2017, Levine Cava sponsored the resolution to support the Paris climate agreement. In response to the presence of fecal bacteria in Biscayne Bay in early 2020, Levine Cava also sponsored legislation to improve water testing in the area. In 2018, Levine Cava created an initiative to protect pedestrians and bikers from harm's way. The initiative featured a plan for engaging with the business community to create incentives that could train people to be better drivers and an agenda for improving biking accessibility on roads. Throughout her political career, Levine Cava has gained key endorsements from labor unions like the Service Employees International Union, and the AFL–CIO, and environmental groups like the Sierra Club. = 2020 Miami-Dade County mayoral election = In early 2020, Levine Cava announced her run for the 2020 Miami-Dade County mayoral election, to succeed incumbent Mayor Carlos Giménez, who is term-limited. Levine Cava earned the endorsements of many major organizations and newspapers, including the Miami Herald, and received the endorsement of many prominent Democrats, including congresswomen Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala. Levine Cava has also received significant funding from Donald Sussman, a hedge fund executive who was the largest single donor to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election In the August 18 primary, Levine Cava placed second behind fellow Commissioner Esteban Bovo, receiving 28% to Bovo's 29%, with former County Mayor Alex Penelas trailing in third with 24%. Since neither Levine Cava or Bovo received over 50% of the vote, this triggered an runoff election between the two candidates, which will be held on November 3, 2020.  Personal life  Levine Cava is married to Dr. Robert Cava, a Miami-Dade doctor of Italian descent. They have two children, Eliza and Edward.  Awards  For her non- profit work, Levine Cava has received numerous awards.

The initiative would emohasize education on the political status issue and the merits of statehood through social media and live training events throughout Puerto Rico's townships and universities. PlebiscitoPR, a collateral initiative of Proyecto Estrella led by former PRSSA National Secretary Javier Aguilú, promoted citizens’ awareness of the plebiscite and voter participation. Proyecta Estrella advocated for statehood ahead of the 2012 Puerto Rican status referendum, holding training events in San Juan, Las Piedras, Vieques, the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez, the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, and the University of Puerto Rico at Bayamón. For these endeavors, the organization joined a coalition of advocacy groups, including the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, the Young Democrats of Puerto Rico, Igualdad Futuro Seguro, the Young Republican Federation of Puerto Rico, and Boricua Ahora Es. A majority of voters (54%) rejected Puerto Rico's current territorial status and another majority (61%) chose statehood.  Post referendum  Following the plebiscite, Proyecto Estrella joined Boricua Ahora Es to promote awareness of statehood’s victory and to promote the occurrence of a congressionally- sanctioned status plebiscite, including the Taking of Congress. Afterward, the 2014 budget bill included $2.5 million in funding for a future vote in Puerto Rico's political status. In 2013, Proyecto Estrella and the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association joined together to commemorate the birthday of Puerto Rican statesman Dr. José Celso Barbosa, the founder of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican statehood movement, with an event held at Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan. The event gained prominence because it featured the only joint appearance by Congressman Pedro Pierluisi and Boricua Ahora Es leader and statehood activist Ricardo Rosselló, who were then rivals for the 2016 New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico gubernatorial nomination.

Life Gray was born in York. She was the first of seven children born to Margaret (born Batty) and her husband Jonathan Hopwood. When she was fourteen she began the diaries that made her notable. She recorded how she spent her time reading and sewing with her mother whilst her brothers also read, but learnt languages. In 1777 on 9 October she married William Gray who was training to be a solicitor. Her parents were worried that she might became a Methodist. William managed to save the family firm from the poor position he found it in, albeit at the cost of working long hours. Together they would have seven children. In 1782 she began an enterprise with Catharine Cappe. They created evening classes so that the workers at a local hemp factory could learn to read there and at Sunday School each week. With Cappe, Gray established in 1784 a School for Spinning Worsted in York, offering an education for girls. The school was staffed by women volunteers and the girls were taught to read and to spin and in return the student's were paid wages for their work and clothed. Cappe wrote that the purpose was to \\"excite a spirit of virtuous industry among the children of the poor\\". The parents were keen because they were clothed as the students were taught how to create garments from the yarn they had spun. Given this education they were able to apply for better paid work and avoid the options usually open to poor uneducated girls. After their success with poor girls, Gray was approached to become involved with the Grey Coat School in York which had lost its way. She wrote tactical notes to the (male) governors of the school. The master of the school had been deemed unfit and his wife was mentally ill. The Ladies's Committee were allowed to take over the school's management. She and Faith Gray founded the York Female Friendly Society in 1788. The society was open to ex-students of the Grey Coat School and to their \\"School for Spinning Worsted\\". The society's object was to provide basic health insurance for its members. In 1788 Cappe married and became \\"Catharine Cappe\\" and Gray moved into a new home with her husband which would be named \\"Gray's Court\\". The purchase was possible as Faith's father had left them a bequest in 1784. Death and legacy Gray died in the family home of Grays Court in York in 1826.

After two years, he bribed an army doctor to certify that he was unfit for service, and moved to St Petersburg to work for Pravda and as an organiser of the Metal Workers Union. He was arrested twice during 1913, and banished to Chelyabinsk. He was arrested there at the outbreak of war, in 1914, and again in 1915. After his release, he returned to Ekaterinburg.  Revolution and civil war  After the February Revolution of 1917, Sosnovsky was Assistant Chairman, and later Chairman of the Urals Regional Soviet, based in Ekaterinburg. In December, after the Bolshevik Revolution he moved to Petrograd/St Petersburg, and in 1918 followed the Soviet government when it transferred the capital to Moscow. He was sent back to Ekaterinburg after the Red Army had regain control of the city from the White Russian army of Admiral Kolchak, and was dispatched to Kharkiv for three months in 1919-20 after the rout of General Denikin, but otherwise he worked full time as a journalist. In spring 1918, he founded the newspaper Bednota (The Poor), which he edited until 1924.  The Dymovka affair  During 1924, Sosnovsky was involved in recruiting village corespondents (selkors), who were mostly communist party members based in the count ryside, who invited to submit reports on village life. In March 1924, a selkor named Grigori Malinovsky, from a village called Dymovka, in the Nikolaev (Mykolaiv) region of Ukraine, was murdered, after sending a report exposing two local officials whom he accused of bribery and intimidation. In October, Sosnovsky travelled to Nikolaev to deliver a long speech on behalf of the prosecution at the trial of six men accused of the murder, three of whom were executed. Sosnovsky interpreted the murder as part of the class struggle in the countryside between rich peasants (known as kulaks) and the poor. In an article published in Pravda in November 1924, he warned that 'Dymovka is not an exceptional phenomenon'. The publicity caused the number of selkors to swell by more than 100,000, to 115,000, in the 17 months to August 1925, but also exposed Sosnovsky to criticism from party officials who accused him of indulting party offiicials working in the countryside, until Stalin intervened personally in Sosnovsky's defence. In a speech to the Orgburo, in January 1926, he pronounced that \\"it is to the credit of Pravda, to the credit of Sosnovsky, that they had the courage to drag into the light of day a piece of real life...\\" An editorial in Pravda in February 1925 entitled \\"The Lessons of Dymovka\\" warned that Malinovsky's murder was a symptom of the dangers of the growth of capitalism in the countryside.  On Mayakovsky  In September 1921, Sosnovsky published a diatribe against the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, who had successfully taken up a case in the relevant trade union against Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, head of the state publishing house, who had refused to pay for him for a script that had been published in a magazine. The case angered Sosnovsky because Skvortsov was an old comrade “who had joined the revolutionary movement before Mayakovsky was born.” Sosnovsky claimed that there was a movement that he called Mayakovshchina, full of “overgrown oafs” trying to be like the poet, warning that A few months later, the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin came out in defence of Mayakovsky, but in January 1925, after Lenin’s death, Sosnovsky returned to the attack. At a writers’ conference, in January 1925, he accused Mayakovsky to his face of insulting Lenin, by comparing him to a general. Actually, there had been a misprint. Mayakovsky had written перевал (pereval), meaning a pass, or trail, but in his absence this had been mistakenly transcribed as генерал (general).  On Yesenin  In Summer 1926, Sosnovsky launched an even fiercer attack on the poet Sergei Yesenin, who had committed suicide the previous December. Writing in Pravda, he blamed the sexual references in Yesenin’s work for a recent series of gang rapes by members of the communist youth league (Komsomol), and implied that his entire output should be banned. However, during a debate on literature at the Communist Academy in February 1927, he attributed Yesenin’s popularity to the dreariness of political propaganda. When the young encountered human feelings in Yesenin’s poetry, it was like “escaping from a cellar that reeks of rotten cabbage into the fresh air.”  Left Opposition  Sosnovsky was one of the signatories of The Declaration of 46, and supported Leon Trotsky in the power struggle that followed the death of Lenin, despite their differences on cultural issues. (Trotsky defended Mayakovsky and Yesenin). Sosnovsky's opposition to the party leadership was based on economic: he believed that the communist party needed to act against the growing influence of kulaks, whom he accused of exploiting and intimidating poorer peasants. He was dismissed form the editorship of Bednota in 1924, but was allowed to continue working as a journalist on Pravda. He was one of \\"75 active leaders of the Trotskyist Opposition\\" expelled from the communist party during its 15th Congress, in December 1927. After his expulsion, Sosnovsky was made to leave Moscow and take up a post in Barnaul. In exile, he was one of the last Trotskyists to capitulate and ask to be reinstated in the party. When the group led by Grigory Zinoviev surrendered, he wrote a scathing letter to Illarion Vardin, one of Zinoviev's supporters, citing what he said was a Jewish funeral custom: In the latter part of 1928, when Stalin turned party policy sharply to the left, initiating a campaign against the kulaks, with Trotsky sent into enforced exile in Turkey, Sosnovsky was the leading voice among the remaining left oppositionists arguing that this was a 'temporary manoeuvre' by Stalin, not a genuine turn to the left. He studied local conditions in Barnaul, where he calculated that just eight per cent of peasants were wealthy enough to own a threshing machine, which made the majority, which made the majority utterly dependent on them, because In May 1929, four letters that he had written in exile were published abroad in Trotsky’s Bulletin of the Opposition. The Ogpu appear to have known about these letters being smuggled abroad, because Sosnovsky was arrested in Barnaul on 29 April 1929, and in May he was sentenced to three years in prison, and transferred to an'isolator' in Chelyabinsk. By the end of 1929, after most of the leading Trotskyists, including Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Karl Radek, had capitulated to Stain, Sosnovsky was, after Christian Rakovsky, the best known oppositionist still holding out in exile. In January 1930, the Bulletin of the Opposition reported that Sosnovsky was editing a magazine Pravda Behind Bars produced by imprisoned Trotskyists. Sosnovsky was then transferred to an 'isolator' in Tomsk In April 1932, he was sentenced to a further two years in prison.  Final years  In 1934, following Rakovsky's capitulation, Sosnovsky decided that the completion of the First Five-year plan and the worsening international situation no longer justified his opposition to Stalin. He was permitted to work as a journalist, and in 1935, his membership of the communist party was restored. But he was arrested again on 23 October 1936, sentenced to death in a secret trial on 3 July 1937, and shot the same day.  Family  Sosnovsky married a fellow Bolshevik, Olga Danilova Gerzhevan. She was arrested in August 1937, sent to a labour camp in Mordvinia, then brought back to Moscow in 1938, accused of being a member of a terrorist group of wives of 'enemies of the people', tortured and forced to confess. She retracted her confession, but was nevertheless sentenced to death on 6 July 1941, and executed on 28 July. Their older son, Vladimir Lvovich (1920-1994) was expelled from school and evicted from the family apartment when his mother was arrested. He worked as a labourer in several towns before being called up for military service in 1941, then soon afterwards sentenced to ten years in labour camps. In 1944, he received another ten year sentence. He was released in December 1953, and reunited with his younger brother, Andrei, who had also survived a long prison term. In 1990, Vladimir Sosnovsky was one of the founders of the Memorial Society, set up to create a record of the repression.

Life  May Louise Seaton-Tiedeman spent the early years of her life in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Alfred Herbert and Hannora Seaton. As a teenager, she moved with her family to England. In 1886 she married Dutch journalist and editor Frederick Henry Lewis Tiedeman, with whom she had one son, Henry Seaton Tiedeman. Based in London, the couple travelled widely, socialising with a large group of influential and reformist friends. Frederick Tiedeman died in 1915, ending a happy marriage of nearly three decades. The following year, May married a longtime family friend, Edward Woolf Abrams, a metal mining agent. This marriage too lasted nearly 30 years, until Abrams' death in 1945. Seaton- Tiedeman was a devoted suffragist, as well as a longtime campaigner for changes to divorce laws in the United Kingdom. She served for many years on the executive committee of the Union of Ethical Societies (today Humanists UK) and, at the age of 70, spoke in Hyde Park for women's suffrage celebrations.  Work for the Divorce Law Reform Union  Arthur Conan Doyle, President of the Divorce Law Reform Union Despite her own happy marriages, May Seaton- Tiedeman was extremely active as the honorary secretary of the Divorce Law Reform Union. The Union advocated for changes to existing divorce laws, achieving some of its aims with the passing of A. P. Herbert's Matrimonial Causes Act of 1937, which extended the grounds for divorce to include cruelty, desertion and incurable insanity. Although eclipsed by the Union's more famous figureheads, such as Arthur Conan Doyle and Lord Birkenhead, Seaton-Tiedeman worked tirelessly for the cause. She was described as 'a woman of tremendous dynamism and drive'. In the year of the Act's passing, friend and colleague A. D. Howell Smith wrote to The Times to redress her lack of recognition, noting > the strange silence of so many newspapers on the long sustained work of Mrs. > Seaton-Tiedeman, the union's hon. secretary, without whom Mr. Herbert's Bill > might well have miscarried. For 25 years, in season and out of season, by > lectures and debates in many places (nearly every Sunday she has advocated > her cause in Hyde Park), by correspondence in the Press, and by innumerable > interviews, Mrs. Seaton-Tiedeman has worked for divorce law reform, sparing > neither her health nor her purse. In addition to lecturing and debating, Seaton-Tiedeman edited the quarterly paper of the Divorce Law Reform Union, The Journal, from 1919 to 1931. An active member of the Union of Ethical Societies, she spoke regularly at meetings of the Women's Group of the Ethical Movement, and assisted with the Ethical Societies' Chronicle. Cordelia Moyse notes that Seaton-Tiedeman was motivated > by her belief that immorality, injustice, and unnecessary human suffering > were not to be tolerated... her secular humanism found its fullest > expression in the divorce reform movement not least because the primary > ideology of opponents of reform was Christianity. Seaton-Tiedeman sought 'fair conditions for marriage and parenthood,' which she argued would be 'more efficacious than all the scolding we have heard from the pulpits of late years.' A focus on lessening the suffering of women in the case of marital breakdown and desertion could be clearly seen in Seaton- Tiedeman's writing in the cause of divorce law reform. In 1920, she argued that without amendments to the laws that disadvantaged them > Women will go on being deserted without the remotest possibility of being > able, in a vast number of cases, either to trace the man or prove adultery — > desertion which may cover long periods of years, with immense suffering to > them, and which keeps them for ever tied to a husband who has gone out of > their lives, leaving them often with his children to support. In a deputation to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald in March 1924, Seaton- Tiedeman presented a case study 'typical of thousands of the cases that come to us': > A woman asked if she could get a divorce from her husband, and obtain the > custody of her two children. She is 33, her husband has not co-habited with > her since the birth of the second child, telling her that he has no further > use for women, and boasting of his friendships with young men, but defying > her to prove anything... Her health is breaking under this abominable > cruelty... Her grief and horror were great when I informed her than not only > could she not get a divorce, but that if she established the vice of her > husband he might be committed to penal servitude for a period of years. Even after the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 was passed, the Union resolved to 'continue to agitate and organize for further amendment of the law... to give reasonable and equitable divorce.'  Society for the Abolition of Blasphemy Laws  May Seaton-Tiedeman was part of delegations in 1924 and 1929 in which a case for the repeal of British blasphemy laws was presented to the Home Secretary. The Society believed that > The law of blasphemy is an attack on opinion; punishment for blasphemy > becomes virtually a punishment for lack of education or taste; the law > cannot prevent blasphemy; only the Church of England is protected by the > law; many clergymen favour the repeal and genuinely indecent language would > still be subject to ordinary law relating to disturbance of the peace.  Trial of The Sexual Impulse  In 1935 Seaton-Tiedeman testified in defence of Edward Charles' An Introduction to the Study of the Psychology and Physiology and Bio-Chemistry of the Sex Impulse among Adults in Mental and Bodily Heath, a work facing prosecution under obscenity laws. The book included 'an exposition of coital technique intended for the ordinary educated man and woman'. Seaton-Tiedeman stated that 'in the light of fifty years' experience as a social worker, during the last twenty-three years of which she had had a special acquaintance with wrecked marriages as Honorary Secretary of the Divorce Law Reform Union, she considered the book of immense value for the preservation of marriage.'  Death  After 1937, Seaton-Tiedeman continued to campaign for further reforms, the Union feeling that it must continue 'till other grounds [for divorce] were admitted', but retired during World War II. She died at Friern Hospital on 22 October 1948, and was cremated four days later. A memorial meeting was held for her at Conway Hall, led by H. J. Blackham, on the anniversary on her death. Tributes described Seaton-Tiedeman as an 'energetic worker for Divorce Law Reform', as well as 'an enthusiastic supporter of the Ethical Movement and other humanist activities.'

White (20 June 1927 - 6 September 1996) was an Irish writer, academic, broadcaster and journalist. Early life Born in Durrow, County Laois, White was educated at Durrow National School and St Kieran's College, Kilkenny before moving on to St. Patrick's College, in Kiltegan, County Wicklow. He obtained a B.A. in English and Philosophy from University College Cork in September 1949 and a Higher Diploma in Education from University College Dublin in June 1950. He then completed a thesis on \\"Standish O'Grady and the Irish Literary Movement\\" and was awarded an M.A. degree with First-Class honours in December 1953. During this time he began teaching English at Catholic University School, University College Dublin and Maynooth College - the first layman to teach there since Éamon de Valera taught Mathematics (1912–13). From 1954 to 1956 he also studied at the University of Oxford. Career In 1954, he succeeded David Marcus as editor of Irish Writing, a literary quarterly specialising in new Irish writing and criticism. As such, he was instrumental in the publication of new work by Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Thomas Kinsella and other Irish and British writers and poets. In 1958, he joined The Irish Press where - in addition to literary and theatre criticism - he wrote a regular column with his friend and colleague Benedict Kiely under the joint by-line of \\"Patrick Lagan\\". The pair traversed the country, collecting news of local festivals, traditions and characters. He was also a regular contributor to radio and television programmes on Raidió Teilifís Éireann, including several series on Shakespeare for school students. In 1965 he joined Bord Fáilte - the Irish Tourist Board - as Senior Public Relations Officer. He moved to their New York office the following year as Publicity Director for North America. He returned to Ireland in 1970 to serve as Head of Information for CIÉ the Irish national transport body. In the same year he was appointed to the Taoiseach's Steering Committee, established by Jack Lynch in response to the Northern Ireland conflict and tasked with \\"the presentation of the Irish Government's point of view in Great Britain and elsewhere.\\" It was in this capacity that - in the immediate aftermath of Bloody Sunday - he was asked to accompany Father Edward Daly to the United States to counter the British Government's version of the event which had gained primacy there. White's experience of and contacts in the U.S. media proved vital in securing interviews for Father Daly on prominent news programmes and allowing his eye-witness testimony to turn the tide of American opinion on the atrocity. In 1977 he left CIÉ to concentrate on writing and broadcasting. On television, he wrote and presented an account of his childhood home Durrow entitled My Own Place (RTÉ) and a history of Skellig Michael (BBC). On radio he was a regular contributor to the Thomas Davis Lectures, On This Day, Sunday Miscellany and Mo Cheol Thú on RTÉ as well as representing the Republic of Ireland, a guest team on Round Britain Quiz (BBC). For The Irish Times he wrote a regular feature entitled Outings as well as contributing to the magazine Ireland of the Welcomes. In 1980 he was appointed Dean of The School of Irish Studies, a Dublin-based institution providing study abroad courses, principally for North American university students. In 1992 he was appointed Adjunct Professor, Irish Studies at the University of Limerick. During this time he continued to actively pursue the promotion of Irish literature and arts. He served on the board of Cumann Merriman for many years and was Director of the Merriman Summer School on three occasions. From 1982 he was Irish Trustee of the James Joyce International Foundation and was Director of the James Joyce XIII International Symposium in Dublin in June 1992. He served as a founding director of the James Joyce Centre and was elected a Shareholder of the Abbey Theatre. From the early 1960s, one of his chief enthusiasms was The Burren region of County Clare. Indeed, for many years he worked towards a comprehensive study of the history, archaeology and topography of the region to be titled The Burren: The Fertile Rock which was never published. He did however support and advise the founders of the Burren College of Art as they were establishing the college and joined the faculty to lecture on Irish Studies. It was while leading a group of students on a visit to Black Head on the Burren that he died suddenly on 6 September 1996.

In 1946, Jean-Marie Simon created the Ducale brand in Nancy, then in 1962, he bought the Grimaud to become the number one cardmaker in France, France Cartes. In 1989, Yves Weisbuch took over the business which he had helped grow since 1962 as sales manager. With the takeover of Héron in 1994, France Cartes became Groupe France Cartes. Subsequently, other acquisitions were made, as in 2003 with that of Editions Dusserre, specializing in historical cards. In 2014, as part of its international expansion, the Cartamundi group acquired France Cartes, offering the French market a wider and more complete range of cards and gaming accessories.  Grimaud, Master Cardmaker since 1848  The quality of playing cards is the result of handed-down knowledge and results in clean graphics, smooth touch, optimal glide, perfect opacity, rounded corners, double-headed designs and formats adapted to the type of game. It is therefore thanks to the demands of a master cardmakerMaître Cartier at cartamundi.fr.

History The Štimlje Mosque was built in 1824 near the Shtime River at 1 Ahmet Shtimja St. The mosque has been extensively altered, especially after the construction of a massive reinforced concrete annex next to the original entrance. The old portico of stone, clay mortar, and wooden studs (hatula) is gone as well. The changes are more visible from within than from without, as with the Atik Mosque in Gjilan. The prayer hall is largely authentic, however, with the plastic replacements for old wooden windows kept in their old wood frames. Not counting the annex, the mosque has 9 prayer hall windows. The walls were plastered in 2004 and decorated from the floor to the windowpane with decorative boards. The mihrab features muqarnas (also known as “stalactite vaulting”) in the cone, but the wooden pulpit remains, as in most old mosques, between the mihrab and the side wall. The pulpit includes conical and other geometrical moldings, including a heptagram in a triangular mold, described by the imam as representing that the “separation of the star’s corners do not matter, such that they share in their encompassing love for Allah.” The mosque is roofed on the inside by an octagonal dome of wooden planks similar to fish scales. At the top of the dome, a circular wooden slab is decorated geometrically and surrounded by three concentric circles. A frieze runs through the top of the side wall alongside the base. The 2006 annex connects there to the müezzin mahfili with a massive circular dome and its own separate windows. The minaret dates to 1996 and ends in a concrete- brick pyramid (all brick on the seventh and final layer); two balconies are embossed with muqarnas and the spire is topped with a crescent.

It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 1102–1103 in its catalogues. Two of Méliès's frequent collaborators appear in the film: Fernande Albany as the plump client, and Manuel as one of the barbers. The film's special effects are created with substitution splices. The film appears to have been inspired by a 1906 Pathé film in which a Black man uses bootblack to darken the face of a woman who mocks him. The Black character in Méliès's film is played as a pejorative caricature, typifying the stereotypical figure of the dandy nègre (\\"Black dandy\\") that frequently appeared in turn-of-the- century French imagery. There may also be some influence from American minstrel shows. In a study of otherness in popular entertainment, French writer Enrique Seknadje comments that the film perpetuates racist stereotyping by associating erotic desire with Blackness, but also that the woman's anger seems to imply a criticism of society's casual racism.

He rose to power in Yizhou as its Inspector after Zhao Xin's rebellion in 300. There, he attempted to maintain a friendly relationship with Zhao Xin's killer, Li Te but an order that dictated that Li Te and his refugees move back to the north caused ties between the two to be shaky. They eventually went to war with each other in 301 and although Luo Shang performed poorly in the early stages, he finally killed Li Te in an ambush in 303. However, his family members continued the fight and Li Te's son Li Xiong drove him out to Ba Commandery, where he remained until his death in 310.  Early life and career  Luo Shang was from Xiangyang and his father Luo Shi (羅式) died when he was still very young. Luo Shang was thus adopted by his uncle Luo Xian, the famed general of Shu Han who defended Yong'an from 30,000 Eastern Wu soldiers. Luo Shang inherited his uncle's talents in writing articles and found himself a position as Army Adviser under the Inspector of Jingzhou, Wang Rong. He partook in Jin's conquest of Wu in 280, in which he was ordered to attack Wuchang. After the conquest, he was appointed as Inspector of Liangzhou.(尚字敬之，一名仲。父式，牂柯太守。尚少孤，依叔父憲。善屬文。荊州刺史王戎以尚及劉喬為參軍，並委任之。太康末，為梁州刺史。) Book of Jin, Volume 57  Inspector of Yizhou  = Establishing ties with Li Te = In 300, the Inspector of Yizhou, Zhao Xin rebelled against Jin in hopes of starting his own state. Hearing this, Luo Shang quickly wrote a petition to the Jin court, volunteering himself to put down the rebellion. The court agreed, and Luo Shang was made the new Inspector of Yizhou. Luo Shang would not be the one to defeat Zhao Xin, however, rather it was a Ba-Di refugee named Li Te, who had originally joined Zhao but turned on him after he had killed his brother. Luo Shang before Luo Shang arrived at Chengdu the following year, he was welcomed by Li Te with gifts. Luo Shang accepted them in spite of opposition from his advisors Xin Ran (辛冉) and Wang Dun (王敦, not to be confused with the more famous Wang Dun). Luo Shang also made Li Te's brother Li Xiang as his Cavalry Commander.(初，梁州刺史羅尚聞廞反，表：「廞非雄才，又蜀人不願為亂，必無同者，事終無成，敗亡可計日而俟。」惠帝因拜尚平西將軍，假節，領護西夷校尉，益州刺史，給衛節兵一千，梁州兵二千，又配上庸都尉義部千五百人，合四千五百人。遷梓潼太守樂陵徐儉為蜀郡，揚烈將軍隴西辛冉為廣漢太守。尚又表請牙門將王敦兵七千餘人入蜀。特等聞尚來，甚懼，使弟驤奉迎。厚進寶物。尚以驤為騎督。特、流奉牛酒勞尚於綿竹。王敦說尚曰：「特等隴上塞盜劫賊，會所殺之。〔軍無後患也。〕」辛冉本趙王倫所用，非資次，召當還，欲〔以〕討廞「以自新」〔自為功〕，亦言之。尚不納。又冉謂特曰：「故人相逢，不吉當凶。」特自猜懼。) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 7.5 = Refugee issue in Yizhou = Later in 301, the Jin court in Luoyang issued an order to all refugees in Yizhou to return north to their original homes in Yongzhou and Qinzhou (秦州, modern eastern Gansu). Many of the refugees refused to abide this as they received news that the north was still a chaotic place. Li Te decided to send his subordinate Yan Shi (閻式) along with bribes to Luo Shang to negotiate their stay until autumn, which Luo Shang permitted. Luo Shang made preparations to have the refugees sent back before autumn despite their woes. Li Te sent Yan Shi again to negotiate with Luo Shang but this time he refused. Yan Shi even got one of Luo Shang's official, Du Tao to argue for him but he would not budge. Luo Shang's popularity continued to deteriorate as he introduced checkpoints to confiscate any goods held by the refugees.(尋有符下秦、雍州，凡流人入漢川者，皆下所在召還。特兄輔素留鄉里，托言迎家，既至蜀，謂特曰：「中國方亂，不足復還，」特以為然，乃有雄據巴、蜀之意。朝廷以討趙廞功，拜特宣威將軍，封長樂鄉侯，流為奮威將軍、武陽侯。璽書下益州，條列六郡流人與特協同討廞者，將加封賞。會辛冉以非次見征，不顧應召，又欲以滅廞為己功，乃寢朝命，不以實上。眾咸怨之。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 Li Te had Yan Shi meet with Luo Shang for one last time, but his attempt proved futile. Xin Ran had already started placing bounties on Li Te's family for their insubordination, but Li Te used this against him by editing the notices to make it seem that Xin Ran not only wanted the Li family dead, but also the other major refugee families. The notices caused many to band themselves together with Li Te, making war between him and Luo Shang to be inevitable.(羅尚遣從事催遣流人，限七月上道，辛冉性貪暴，欲殺流人首領，取其資貨，乃移檄發遣。又令梓潼太守張演于諸要施關，搜索寶貨。特等固請，求至秋收。流人布在梁、益，為人傭力，及聞州郡逼遣，人人愁怨，不知所為。羅尚遣從事催遣流人，限七月上道，辛冉性貪暴，欲殺流人首領，取其資貨，乃移檄發遣。又令梓潼太守張演于諸要施關，搜索寶貨。特等固請，求至秋收。流人布在梁、益，為人傭力，及聞州郡逼遣，人人愁怨，不知所為。又知特兄弟頻請求停，皆感而恃之。且水雨將降，年穀未登，流人無以為行資，遂相與詣特。) Book of Jin, Volume 120  War with Li Te  = Repeated defeats = Luo Shang would fire the first shot although without his knowledge. His officials, Xin Ran and Li Bi (李苾) independently sent Ceng Yuan (曾元) and others to attack Li Te's camp. Hearing this, Luo Shang decided to support them and sent Tian Zuo (田佐) to strengthen their attack. However, Li Te routed Luo Shang's forces and sent their deceased generals' heads as a warning. Li Te then proceeded to attack Guanghan county were Xin Ran was situated. Luo Shang ordered Li Bi and Fei Yuan (費遠) to rescue Xin Ran but they were defeated. The county fell and Xin Ran fled to Deyang County before advancing to Chengdu.(於是六郡流民共推特行鎭北大將軍，承制封拜；以其弟流行鎭東大將軍，號東督護，以相鎭統；又以兄輔爲驃騎將軍，弟驤爲驍騎將軍，進兵攻冉於廣漢。尚遣李苾、費遠帥衆救冉，畏特，不敢進。冉出戰屢敗，潰圍奔德陽。特入據廣漢，以李超爲太守，進兵攻尚於成都。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 84 Luo Shang's unpopular policies had taken its toll as more people supported Li Te over him because of this. Luo Shang thus decided to fortify his defense and fought Li Te to a stalemate. Meanwhile, he also asked for reinforcements from Liangzhou. The following year, aid arrived in the form of Ya Bo (衙博) who marched into Zitong, so Luo Shang coordinated by sending Zhang Gui (張龜) to Fancheng. However, Zhang Gui would be defeated by Li Te while Ya Bo was forced into retreating due to an assault by Li Te's son Li Dang. After this victory, Li Te challenged Luo Shang's position of Inspector of Yizhou by proclaiming himself the Governor of Yizhou(河間王顒遣督護衙博、廣漢太守張征討特，南夷校尉李毅又遣兵五千助尚，尚遣督護張龜軍繁城，三道攻特。特命蕩、雄襲博。特躬擊張龜，龜眾大敗。蕩又與博接戰連日，博亦敗績，死者太半。蕩追博至漢德，博走葭萌。蕩進寇巴西，巴西郡丞毛植、五官襄珍以郡降蕩。蕩撫恤初附，百姓安之。蕩進攻葭萌，博又遠遁，其眾盡降於蕩。太安元年，特自稱益州牧、都督梁、益二州諸軍事、大將軍、大都督，改年建初，赦其境內。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 Li Te's army arrived at Chengdu later that year. Luo Shang sen army to battle them but were routed by Li Te's brothers Li Xiang and Li Liu. Luo Shang had his general Zhang Xing (張興) feign surrender to get a better look into Li Te's army. Once he returned and informed Luo Shang, Zhang Xing went back to Li Te's camp now with thousands of his strongest soldiers in the night. They killed Li Pan (李攀) and routed Li Xiang but Li Xiang came back with Li Liu's army to defeat Zhang Xing. Many of Luo Shang's men died that night and many of their equipment were abandoned.(以騫碩為德陽太守，碩略地至巴郡之墊江。特之攻張征也，使李驤與李攀、任回、李恭屯軍毗橋，以備羅尚。尚遣軍挑戰，驤等破之。尚又遣數千人出戰，驤又陷破之，大獲器甲，攻燒其門。流進次成都之北。尚遣將張興偽降於驤，以觀虛實。時驤軍不過二千人，興夜歸白尚，尚遣精勇萬人銜枚隨興夜襲驤營。李攀逆戰死，驤及將士奔於流柵，與流並力回攻尚軍。尚軍亂，敗還者十一二。晉梁州刺史許雄遣軍攻特，特陷破之。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 = Ambushing Li Te = In early 303, the Lesser City of Chengdu surrendered to Li Te. Luo Shang sent his agents to negotiate peace with Li Te. Many of Li Te's generals doubted Luo Shang's intentions but he ignored their concerns and accepted the terms. While they were discussing, Jin forces from Jingzhou led by Sun Fu (孫阜) and Zong Dai (宗岱) made their way to Yizhou to help Luo Shang. It was then when Luo Shang's subordinate, Ren Rui (任叡) proposed a plan to him. Luo Shang and Ren Rui slipped out the city at night. Ren Rui then went to the fortified areas of Chengdu to reveal his plans and date to the leaders of said areas. Ren Rui later surrendered to Li Te and lied to him about Luo Shang's situation. Once finished, Li Te allowed him to return to Chengdu to meet his family. On the tenth day of the second month, Luo Shang and the other leaders of the area ambushed Li Te's camp. Li Te fought desperately for two days but in the end died alongside Li Fu (李輔) and Li Yuan (李遠). Luo Shang had their bodies burnt and sent their heads to the capital.(益州從事任明說尚曰：「特既凶逆，侵暴百姓，又分人散眾，在諸村堡，驕怠無備，是天亡之也。可告諸村，密克期日，內外擊之，破之必矣。」尚從之。明先偽降特，特問城中虛實，明曰：「米穀已欲盡，但有貨帛耳。」因求省家，特許之。明潛說諸村，諸村悉聽命。還報尚，尚許如期出軍，諸村亦許一時赴會。二年，惠帝遣荊州刺史宋岱、建平太守孫阜救尚。阜已次德陽，特遣蕩督李璜助任臧距阜。尚遣大眾奄襲特營，連戰二日，眾少不敵，特軍大敗，收合餘卒，引趣新繁。尚軍引還，特復追之，轉戰三十餘里，尚出大軍逆戰，特軍敗績，斬特及李輔、李遠，皆焚屍，傳首洛陽。在位二年。其子雄僭稱王，追諡特景王，及僭號，追尊曰景皇帝，廟號始祖。) Book of Jin, Volume 120  War with Li Liu and Li Xiong  = War with Li Liu = Li Te's sudden death rocked the rebel army. Many of their generals did not know what to do, so they retreated to Chizu (赤祖, in present day Mianzhu, Sichuan), where they elected Li Te's brother Li Liu as the new leader. Luo Shang took advantage of the confusion to strike at them by sending He Chong (何沖) and Chang Shen (常深). A native named Yao Shen (藥紳) also rose up in support of Luo Shang to attack Chizu. As the two sides fought, the Di chieftains, Fu Cheng (苻成) and Kui Bo (隗伯) defected over to He Chong. Li Liu's camp was on the verge of falling but through desperation, Li Liu managed to not only repel Luo Shang's forces but also the traitors within his camp. Li Liu capitalised on his victory by attacking Chengdu, putting Luo Shang under siege again.(三月，羅尚遣督護何沖、常深攻李流，涪陵民藥紳亦起兵攻流。流與李驤拒紳，何沖乘虛攻北營，氐苻成、隗伯在營中，叛應之。蕩母羅氏擐甲拒戰，伯手刃傷其目，羅氏氣益壯；會流等破深、紳，引兵還，與沖戰，大破之。成、伯率其黨突出詣尚。流等乘勝進抵成都，尚復閉城自守。蕩馳馬逐北，中矛而死。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 85 Sun Fu and Zong Dai's reinforcements did not arrive as Sun Fu was defeated by Li Xiong and Zong Dai died of natural causes. Luo Shang's subordinate Xu Yu (徐轝) begged him to ally with the Taoist hermit at Mount Qingcheng, Fan Changsheng, for he has thousands of families under his wing. Luo Shang's refusal backfire as Xu Yu defected in anger to Li Liu, who allowed him to carry out his plans. As a result, Li Liu's army was supplied with food from Fan Changsheng's followers.(遂入郫城，流移營據之。三蜀百姓並保險結塢，城邑皆空，流野無所略，士眾饑困。涪陵人范長生率千餘家依青城山，尚參軍涪陵徐轝求為汶山太守，欲要結長生等，與尚掎角討流。尚不許，轝怨之，求使江西，遂降於流，說長生等使資給流軍糧。長生從之，故流軍復振。) Book of Jin, Volume 120 = War with Li Xiong = Li Liu would die during the winter of 303. He chose his nephew and Li Te's son Li Xiong to succeed him. Upon his succession, Li Xiong sent a man named Pu Tai (朴泰) to trick Luo Shang into attacking Picheng (郫城, in present-day Pixian County, Sichuan). Luo Shang ordered Kui Bo to do so during the night and Kui Bo was defeated by Li Xiang. Li Xiang went to Chengdu pretending to be Kui Bo's army by shouting at the gates \\"We had already taken Picheng!\\" As it was too dark, Luo Shang could not notice in time before Li Xiang swarmed into the Lesser City. Luo Shang holed himself up in the Greater City section of Chengdu.(九月，流病死。雄復稱大將軍、都督、州牧。尚數攻郫。雄使武都朴泰譎尚曰：「李驤與雄，以飢餓孤危，日鬥爭相咎。驤欲將民江西食穀。若潛軍來，我為內應，可得也。」尚以為然，大與金寶，泰曰：「今事故未立，效後取，不晚也。」又求遣人自隨覘伺。尚從之。泰要：發火，遣隗伯諸軍攻郫。驤使「道」設伏〔導〕，以長梯上伯軍。伯軍見火起，皆爭緣梯。雄因放兵擊之，大破尚軍。雄徑追退，夜至城下，稱萬歲，曰：「已得郫城矣。」入少城，尚乃覺，保「太」〔大〕城。) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 8.7 Li Xiong intensified his attack on Chengdu. Luo Shang's foody supply had been cut off after Li Xiang captured Qianwei, leaving the city with little to no ration. Luo Shang entrusted Zhang Luo (張羅) to hold the city while Luo Shang fled the city through the night in 304. Zhang Luo eventually surrendered and allowed Li Xiong to occupy Chengdu. Luo Shang reached Jiangyang, where he sent a letter to the Jin court about the situation in Yizhou. He also asked the Inspector of Jingzhou, Liu Hong for supplies, which Liu Hong gave.(永興元年，春正月，尚至江陽，〔遣〕軍司辛寶詣洛表狀。詔書權統巴東、巴郡、涪陵三郡，供其軍賦。〔二年[月]，都督荊州軍事劉弘，運米三萬斛助尚。〕) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 8.8  Commanding from Ba Commandery  With the fall of Chengdu, Luo Shang based himself at Ba Commandery (巴郡; present-day Chongqing). Prior to that, Li Xiong had established himself king of his state of Cheng in Yizhou. He sent his men to raid the Shu region and captured Li Xiang's wife Lady Zan (昝氏) and their child Li Shou.(羅尚移屯巴郡，遣兵掠蜀中，獲李驤妻昝氏及子壽。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 85 By 307, Luo Shang had established camps and defenses around Yizhou. As many were fleeing from Jingzhou in Yizhou, Luo Shang countered this by setting up new counties and commanderies for the refugees to settle in. Despite his failures in Yizhou, the court rewarded Luo Shang with Cavalier In Regular Attendance and Commander of Yizhou and Liangzhou in 308. Luo Shang found himself with more success in Ba. In 309, Zitong Commandery was surrendered to Luo Shang by Hong Qi (訇琦). Hong had killed Li Li (李離) and Yan Shi before that. Li Xiong, now emperor as of 306, sent Li Xiang, Li Yun (李雲) and Li Huang (李璜) to retake the commandery. Luo Shang this time managed to defend himself from Li Xiang, even killing Li Yun and Li Huang in the process.(天水人訇琦等殺成太尉李離、尚書令閻式，以梓潼降羅尚；成主雄遣太傅驤、司徒雲、司空璜攻之，不克，雲、璜戰死。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 87 Luo Shang then sent Xiang Fen (向奮) to camp at Anhan (安漢, in present-day Nanchong, Sichuan). Li Xiong attacked him but to no avail. In his last year in 310, Luo Shang received the surrender of Baxi Commandery (巴西郡; in present-day Langzhong, Sichuan) from Wen Shi (文石). However, he would also lose Zitong Commandery after Li Xiong's general Zhang Bao (張寶) tricked him into letting him hold the city. Luo Shang would pass away later that year and was succeeded by Pi Su (邳皮).(秋七月，尚薨於巴郡。尚字敬之，一名仲，字敬真，襄陽人也。歷尚書丞、郎，武陵、汝南太守，徙梁州，臨州。詔書除長沙太守「下邳」皮素「泰昆」為益州刺史，兼西夷校尉、揚烈將軍，領義募人及平西「將」軍。當進治三關。) Huayang Guozhi, Volume 7.8 His son Luo Yu (羅宇) would serve Pi Su but later assassinated Pi Su after he was about to punish him for not helping Qiao Deng. Luo Yu was then killed himself by Bao Zhong (暴重).  References  * Fang, Xuanling (ed.) (648). Book of Jin (Jin Shu). * Chang, Qu (4th century).

It is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Strasbourg, France. Its inventory number is 1969. The painting's lesser known and lesser used title is Human Love and Divine Love; it was also known in the past as Pagan Life and Christian Life. Although the Dutch Republic was mostly Protestant in 1616, van Haarlem's painting was made for a Catholic patron. The foreground of the painting depicts a couple: a woman with a mirror and bare breasts, who personfies Vanitas; and a musician looking at the viewer, who personifies fleeting pleasure, as in the sounds of his instrument. On a table in front of them lay a crown, golden coins, and other precious wordly objects, such as a hanap. A bearded monk looking through the window attracts the viewer's attention by pointing towards Jesus praying in the Garden; his outstretched right hand towards the couple signifies that they may join him through repentance and be saved.

Krauss- Sánchez, \\"Ibn ʾAlqāmā, ʾAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn al-Khālaf\\", in Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu (eds.), Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Brill Online, 2016), retrieved 5 September 2020. A native of the city of Valencia, he wrote a history of the fall of the city to the Christian army of El Cid in 1094 under the title Clear Exposition of the Disastrous Tragedy. He may have completed it before the death of El Cid in 1099, or as late as 1110. It is a lost work that can be partially reconstructed only from excerpts in other works, primarily that of Ibn ʿIdhārī. On one reconstruction it covers the period from September 1092 until May 1102, including the recapture of Valencia after El Cid's death. It is also excerpted in Ibn al-Khaṭīb, and found its way into several Christian chronicles: the Estoria de España, Crónica geral de Espanha de 1344, Tercera crónica general, Crónica de los reyes de Castilla, Crónica de veinte reyes and Crónica particular del Cid.Gonzalo Martínez Diez, El Cid histórico (Planeta, 2007), pp. 25–26. Ibn ʿAlqāmā was a partisan of the Almoravids.Menéndez Pidal, The Cid, p. 341. He writes with pathos and clearly detests all agreements between the Valencians and the Christians. His account is lively, as well as detailed to the point of triviality. Partial reconstructions of his work based on excerpts in Christian and Muslim chronicles, respectively, were made by Ramón Menéndez Pidal in 1929.Ramón Menéndez Pidal, La España del Cid, 2 vols. (Plutarco, 1929), pp. 888–894 and 894–906, respectively, per Martínez Diez, pp. 25–26. He believed that the Christian sources preserved more and better information from Ibn ʿAlqāmā than the Muslim chronicles, and tried to tease it out accordingly.Richard A. Fletcher, The Quest for El Cid (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 101. His position is not now widely accepted. In 1948, Évariste Lévi-Provençal provided an edition of the Arabic excerpts with a French translation,Évariste Lévi- Provençal, \\"La prise de Valence par le Cid, d'après les sources musulmanes et l'original arabe de la «Crónica General de España»\\", Islam d'Occident: Études d'histoire médiévale (Paris: 1948), pp. 187–238. which was later also translated into Spanish.Évariste Lévi-Provençal (trans.
