Biography Born in Hobart, Tasmania, Bea Maddock studied art education at the University of Tasmania, Hobart and taught secondary school in her home city before travelling abroad to study at the Slade School of Art, London. Her teachers included William Coldstream, Ceri Richards and Anthony Gross. Maddock visited Paris, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, where she closely studied the work of the German Expressionists, who were a formative influence. She also stopped in Bombay, India during the return trip by ship to Australia. Maddock returned to Australia in order to teach in Launceston, Tasmania before settling in the state of Victoria. She taught printmaking at the Victorian College of the Arts for several years from 1970 and returned to Tasmania as Head of the School of Art, Launceston in 1983‚Äì84. Maddock was a Creative Arts Fellow at the Australian National University, Canberra in 1976. Maddock lived and worked at Mount Macedon, Victoria until the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983 forced her to flee. Her house, studio and a large archive of many decades' work was destroyed. She later returned to her native state of Tasmania. In 1987 Maddock participated in the 'Artists in Antarctica' program with Jan Senbergs and John Caldwell. While on that voyage, she badly fractured her leg on Heard Island, which compromised her mobility for several years afterwards. She was appointed Member of the Order of Australia in the 1991 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to art and to art education\\".  Work  Maddock is best known as a printmaker, in which area she had a profound impact on contemporary practice in Australia, combining printing with encaustic painting and installation art to explore the natural environment, Aboriginal Australia, and Australian history. She won many prizes and is represented in the National Gallery of Australia, all Australia State galleries, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the USA's National Gallery in Washington. Maddock's most recent major work, 'Terra Spiritus... With a Darker Shade of Pale', is a 51 part inscribed etching of the entire coastline of Tasmania, each feature labelled with both the English and the aboriginal Tasmanian topographic names. The pigments used to make the drawing are locally occurring Tasmanian ochres. Staff of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in Launceston, Tasmania are currently preparing a catalogue raisonn√©. It will contain entries on 978 works produced by the artist between 1952 and 1983.

As of 2014, the Diocese of Youngstown contains 94 parishes, 1 mission, 102 Diocesan Priests, 18 Religious Priests, 67 Permanent Deacons, 11 Religious Men, and 211 Religious Women. It has a Catholic population of 198,332 in an area totaling . As of 2010, the diocese had 8 seminarians studying at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus and at Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West in Cincinnati. Early history One of the earliest Roman Catholic communities in this Diocese was in Ashtabula, Ohio. In 1850, a small group of Catholics living in and around Ashtabula petitioned the Diocese of Cleveland for their own parish. A shortage of clergy, however, prevented the assignment of a resident priest. Instead, a visiting priest from Painesville would intermittently undertake an entire day's journey by horse over secondary rural roads. Eventually in 1858 the St. Joseph Mission was established and Father Charles Coquelle took up permanent residence. The inaugural members of the St. Joseph Parish were primarily Irish and German, drawn to Ashtabula by the railroad industry. Initial services were in private homes but in 1860 a small wooden frame church was built. The purchase of an additional five acres in 1877 allowed construction of St. Joseph's two-story brick secondary school staffed by the Sisters of the Humility of Mary. In 1878, the group began to celebrate worship services in a grocery store adjacent to Ashtabula Harbor. Out of this gathering a parish was established in 1890 dedicated to St. Mary as \\"Mother of Sorrows.\\" A permanent church was constructed nearby in 1898 and remains today. Towards the turn of the century, a large influx of Italian American Catholics made the formation of a third church in Ashtabula desirable. In 1897 land was purchased on the southwest corner of Columbus Avenue and Sibley Street (whose name was changed to 16th street by city government in 1930) and construction of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church began in 1902. The first mass was celebrated in 1903. As the Catholic presence grew, the cornerstone of a larger masonry building to replace the original St. Joseph's was laid on Aug. 1, 1905. That church cost $34,000 to build and is still in use. St. Columba's Church (1916), which became the diocesan cathedral in 1943 and was destroyed in a 1954 fire.  Diocese history Pope Pius XII created the Diocese of Youngstown from territory formerly part of the Diocese of Cleveland in 1943. The new administrative construct consisted of six northeastern counties of Ohio, namely Ashtabula, Columbiana, Mahoning, Portage, Stark, and Trumbull. Bishop James A. McFadden (former auxiliary bishop of Cleveland) became the first bishop and chose St. Columba Church on Wood Street in downtown Youngstown as his Cathedral. The new diocese covered with 110 parishes, three Catholic-run hospitals, 54 elementary schools, one junior high school, and three Catholic high schools.McFadden, Rev. James A. The March of the Eucharist from Dungannon (Youngstown, OH: Diocese of Youngstown, 1951), p. 22 When Bishop McFadden died on November 16, 1952, Emmet M. Walsh succeeded him. Walsh had been named Coadjutor Bishop and was formerly the Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina. In 1954, St. Columba Cathedral was destroyed by a fire and Bishop Walsh undertook the task of building a new cathedral, which he dedicated in 1958. St. Patrick Church on the south side of Youngstown served as Pro-Cathedral until the new St. Columba's was ready. In 1962, when Pope John XXIII convened the Vatican Council II, Bishop Walsh and Auxiliary Bishop James W. Malone attended. Upon the illness of Bishop Walsh, Bishop Malone was named Apostolic Administrator; after Bishop Walsh died on March 16, 1968, Bishop Malone became Bishop of Youngstown on May 2, 1968, a position he held for 28 years. In 1996, Bishop Malone retired and Bishop Thomas J. Tobin was named his successor and installed as Bishop of Youngstown on February 2, 1996. On March 31, 2005, Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Tobin as Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island. On 30 January 2007, Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop George Murry, S.J. as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Youngstown. On May 28, 2010, Bishop Murry announced the plan for the reconfiguration of parishes which will reduce their total number to 87 over the next two years. From 2000 to 2018 the Diocese of Youngstown experienced a sharp decline, as baptisms fell by 69%, weddings by 62%, first communion by 61%, and funerals by 25%. The numbers of Catholics overall fell by 36%, while the comparative population of the 6 counties the diocese represents decreased by 4.3%. Diocesan Leaders =Bishops of Youngstown= *James A.

The three schools conducted an appeal process in order to keep them open as PreK-8 schools. On February 27, 2014, the Diocese announced the results of the appeal. Within the report, it was announced that the St. Joseph Canton campus would still close at the end of the 2013-2014 school year. For the 2014-2015 school year, the St. Peter and St. Louis campuses would remain open, but serve only grades PreK-5th. The Regina Coeli/St. Joseph and Our Lady of Peace campuses would also serve only grades PreK through 5. The 6-8th grade students within the diocese would be served by a new middle school operating on the campus of St. Thomas Aquinas High School.

Biography Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was Sigmund Freud. Lipps then being the main supporter of the idea of the Unconscious.Pigman, G.W. Freud and the history of empathy, The International journal of psycho-analysis, 1995 Apr.; 76 (Pt 2):237‚Äì56. He adopted Robert Vischer's notions of empathy or esthetic sympathy (Einf√ºhlung, literally translated to \\"feeling-into\\"). This concept of aesthetic resonance finds parallels throughout aesthetic philosophy. Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from Edmund Husserl. Disliking his psychologism, some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called phenomenology of essences. Among them there was Moritz Geiger who wrote one of the first phenomenological essays on the essence and meaning of empathy in which the influence of Lipps is relevant.G√∂del, Florian (2015), \\"An introduction to Moritz Geiger‚Äôs psychological contribution on empathy.\\" Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 8(1):161‚Äì8.

Two years later, he scored the West Indies' first century in Test matches, followed two matches later by the team's first double century. Roach played for Trinidad, but before having any great success at first-class level, he was chosen to tour England with a West Indies team in 1928 and scored over 1,000 runs. When England played in the West Indies in 1930, he recorded his ground-breaking centuries but had intermittent success at Test level afterwards. He toured Australia in 1930‚Äì31 and returned to England in 1933, when he once more passed 1,000 runs, but was dropped from the team in 1935. Within three years, he lost his place in the Trinidad team. Roach was generally inconsistent, but batted in an attacking and attractive style. Outside of cricket, he worked as a solicitor. Later in his life, he suffered from diabetes which necessitated the amputation of both his legs. Early life and career Roach was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and attended St Mary's College, for whom he played football. He played his early cricket on matting pitches in Trinidad, and represented Maple, a cricket club for middle-class players.James, pp. 50, 54. He was coached by George John from an early age. He made his first-class debut for Trinidad in February 1924, when he scored 44 and 22 against British Guiana. He did not play for Trinidad again until 1926, when he faced the touring Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in two games without much success. Despite another unproductive match for Trinidad in January 1927, this time against Barbados, Roach was named in the Trinidad press later that year as a likely candidate to join the West Indies team to tour England in 1928. Already judged a leading batsman in Trinidad, other factors cited in his favour included his fielding, given that West Indian teams had been inconsistent in that discipline, and an ability to bowl. That December, he passed fifty for the first time in first-class matches, when he scored 84 runs for a combined Trinidad and Guiana team. The latter match was played to assist in selecting a team for the forthcoming West Indian tour of England; Roach played a further two such games without success in early 1928. Even so, he was chosen in the touring party; previews again suggested his fielding and ability to bowl played a part in his selection. Meanwhile, he trained as a solicitor, and successfully took his examinations shortly before the tour began. Test match cricketer =First tour and Test debut= The West Indian tour of England in 1928 included the team's first Test matches. However, all three Test matches were lost by an innings and the poor overall results led commentators to judge the team unsuccessful. The review of the tour in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack suggested: \\"Everybody was compelled to realise that the playing of Test Matches between England and West Indies was a mistake\\". The batsmen in particular struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar conditions and the wet summer.Manley, p. 26. The Wisden report singled out Roach as a success, and the best of the batsmen who had not toured England before: \\"Possessed of strong defence and a nice variety of stroke‚Äîespecially on the off-side‚Äîhe created a distinctly favourable impression, and he added to his abilities as a run-getter the further qualifications of being a brilliant fieldsman‚Äîespecially at cover point.\\" In total, Roach scored 1,222 first-class runs during the tour at an average of 26.56. Although he did not score a century, he passed fifty nine times, with a highest score of 92 against the Minor Counties. He finished fifth in the first-class batting averages for the team, and also took two wickets.Wynne-Thomas, p. 260. Making his Test debut in the first Test match, Roach scored 0 and 16. In the second match, promoted to open the batting, he scored 50 and 0, and in the final game had scores of 53, part of an opening partnership of 91 in 70 minutes with George Challenor, and 12. He was fourth in the West Indian Test batting averages, but only one other player, Joe Small, reached fifty in the series, and he only did so once. =Tests against England and Australia= Returning to Trinidad, Roach scored two fifties in three first-class matches in 1929. In 1930 the MCC undertook a tour of the West Indies which included four Test matches‚Äîthe first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing.Manley, p. 32. Roach played in the first Test and, opening the batting, scored 122 in the first innings, the first Test century for West Indies and Roach's maiden century in first-class cricket. He hit the English bowler Wilfred Rhodes for successive fours to reach three figures. In his second innings, he scored 77 runs and the match was drawn. After the Test, Roach played twice for Trinidad against the MCC team without much success. When he failed to score in either innings of the second Test, played in Trinidad, he had scored just 24 runs in his last six innings. Disappointed with his form, he intended to miss the next Test, but the selectors picked him anyway, and he scored 209, the first double-century for the West Indies in Test matches.Manley, p. 30. He shared partnerships of 144 for the first wicket with Errol Hunte, and 192 with George Headley for the second wicket. His second hundred runs were scored in 74 minutes. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley describes Roach's innings as \\"dashing\\" but containing an element of luck which contrasted with the safe play of Headley. West Indies eventually won the match comfortably to record their first win in Test matches. Roach did little during the final Test, but finished the series with 467 runs at 58.37, placing him third in the team batting averages. Only Roach and Headley from the home team played in every Test match. Inter-island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the Test. In the series, 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match. (Book Club edition. First published London, 1975. Allen & Unwin. ) Roach during the West Indies' 1930‚Äì31 tour of Australia Late in 1930, the West Indies team toured Australia for the first time. They played five Test matches in the 1930‚Äì31 season, losing all but the last which they won by 30 runs. For much of the tour, the team was outplayed. Roach was expected to be one of the leading batsman, along with Headley, on the tour, and he scored 56 in the first Test, but only reached double figures twice in his next seven Test innings until he scored 31 and 34 in the final game. He finished fifth in the team's Test batting averages with 194 runs at 19.40. In other first-class matches, he scored 104 against Victoria and, in total, scored 637 runs at 24.50. Contemporary reports suggested that he was never out of form but possibly tried to attack the bowling too much. A report in the Sporting Chronicle, a Trinidad newspaper, in April 1931 suggested, without elaboration, that he \\"was not himself\\" during the tour, which accounted for his poor form.Reprinted in =Second tour of England= Roach was unsuccessful playing for Trinidad in 1932. His poor form led some critics to call for his exclusion from the West Indies team; he failed in a trial match in early 1933, but was picked to tour England during the 1933 season. The West Indies team did not perform as well as expected, and lost the Test series 2‚Äì0, and their batting was generally unsuccessful. After a slow start, Roach scored 67 against Hampshire then, in his next innings, 180 against Surrey in 170 minutes. In the latter innings, described by Wisden as the most dazzling innings on the tour, he scored a century before lunch. Wisden noted: \\"The Surrey bowling on that occasion admittedly was moderate, but, at home from the very start, Roach cut, drove and hooked in a style seen only on very rare occasions.\\" After other substantial innings against County teams, he failed to score in either innings of the first Test. He was more successful in the other two Tests, scoring 64 in the second Test and 56 in the third, reaching fifty in 33 minutes during the latter innings. The Wisden report stated: \\"If not nearly so sound as Headley, Roach was easily the best man in the team to watch, his batting on many occasions being brilliant to a degree. Nothing, indeed, in the whole tour was so dazzling as the innings of 180 Roach played against Surrey at the Oval\\". In total, Roach scored 1,286 runs at 25.72 in first-class matches to finish ninth in the team averages,Wynne-Thomas, p. 269. and 141 runs at 23.50 in Tests. Wisden suggested that, had his defensive abilities matched the style of his strokeplay, he would have been more successful. A review in a Trinidad newspaper suggested that Roach was the \\"best stroke maker\\" in England during the 1933 season, but he was undependable when his side faced adverse circumstances.Reprinted in There were suggestions that Roach should have dropped down the batting order to counter his periods of poor form, but the captain, Jackie Grant, suggested that his aggressive approach made him an attraction and that he was happier opening the batting. =Final years of career and later life= Undated photo of Roach Roach played twice for Trinidad in 1934. Unsuccessful in his first game in February, in September he scored 128 against British Guiana. When MCC toured West Indies in 1934‚Äì35, he was selected for the first Test, scoring 9 and 10 not out, but this was his final game for West Indies. In 16 Tests, he scored 952 runs at an average of 30.70. He also took two wickets. Roach continued to play for Trinidad. In the same month as his final Test, he played for Trinidad against the MCC team, scoring 28 and 0. He played twice for the team in 1936, scoring a fifty in the second game. His final first-class games came in 1937. Against Barbados, he scored 89, and in his final game he scored 7 and 28 against British Guiana. As late as 1939, critics suggested that Roach should be picked to play for Trinidad, and even for the West Indies team, but he never played again. In 98 first-class games, he scored 4,851 runs at 28.04, with five centuries, and took five wickets. During the Second World War, he played several non-first-class matches in England for a team styled a \\"West Indies XI\\". In later life, Roach suffered with diabetes; as a result, he had both legs amputated, the first in 1968 and the second in 1970. He had artificial legs fitted in England, but continued to work as a solicitor throughout.Lawrence and Goble, p. 129. Roach also had some success as a footballer. He played for the Maple team, for whom he played at inside right until the late 1930s, but also represented Trinidad at international level. He and his wife, Edna, had nine children, most of whom moved to live in England. He died in Port of Spain in 1988, aged 84. Style and impact Roach's batting was marked by inconsistency. In summing up his career, the historian Bridgette Lawrence wrote that his \\"style took him to the heights and depths of batting\\".Lawrence and Goble, p. 128. She suggests that he provided a bridge in West Indian batting between George Challenor, the first notably successful batsman to represent the West Indies, and George Headley, the leading West Indian batsman before the Second World War. Whether successful or not, Roach concentrated on entertaining spectators through aggressive batting. Michael Manley described Roach as \\"swashbuckling\\",Manley, p. 469. playing risky but attractive shots outside off stump. He could play with equal ability from either the front foot‚Äîwith his weight going forward into a batting shot‚Äîor back foot. George John, his former coach, believed that he was more effective on the back foot, and sometimes failed to move his feet when batting, but that his ability to deflect the ball by the movements of his wrist was unsurpassed in the whole world. John also suggested that Roach might struggle to play one delivery but then hit the next for six. The writer C. L. R. James described how he attacked the short ball outside off stump: \\"[He moves] his right foot back and across as far as it will go, and then let him lift his bat as high as he possibly can and from that position let it go like a piston at the unfortunate ball.\\" The resulting stroke left little chance for the fielders.\\"Quoted in From this description, the journalist Frank Keating suggested a playing resemblance to Gordon Greenidge. On another occasion, James described Roach as \\"an untalkative but cheerful soul.\\"James, p. 56. Roach's form may have been affected by his lack of a regular partner to open the batting; he frequently had different partners from one Test to the next. He was a very effective fielder, especially in the covers. In 1984, he was entered into the Trinidad and Tobago Sports Hall of Fame, while in 2008, he was among former footballers honoured by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation at their centenary awards.

Between 1969 and 1984 he played 55 Tests and 45 One Day Internationals and took 177 Test wickets at an average of 32.75. In 1978‚Äì79 he took 9/86 against Australia at Melbourne ‚Äì including a spell of 7/4 off 33 balls (including 3 no-balls) ‚Äì to give Pakistan victory, but in the next Test at Perth Sarfraz controversially but technically rightly dismissed the Australian batsman Andrew Hilditch for handling the ball. Cricket career =Early career= In his first Test ‚Äì against England at Karachi in 1969 ‚Äì the twenty-year-old Sarfraz took no wickets, did not bat and was dropped for three years. In 1972‚Äì73 by taking 4/53 and 4/56 against Australia at the SCG, accounting for Ian and Greg Chappell, Keith Stackpole and Ian Redpath, but this did not stop the hosts winning by 56 runs. At Headingley in 1974 Sarfraz hit 53 off 74 balls to convert 209/8 into 285 all out, driving the ball fiercely off Geoff Arnold, Chris Old, Mike Hendrick, Tony Greig and Derek Underwood in a low scoring match.p78, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Cricket Characters, Stanley Paul & Co Ltd, 1987 Against Clive Lloyd's West Indians in 1974‚Äì75 he took 6/89 at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore to dismiss them for 214, but the Test and the series were both drawn. Sarfraz was made vice-captain to Wasim Bari, but disappeared before the Second Test against England in 1977‚Äì78. He was found in London where he had gone to see Christmas even though he was a Muslim and returned to Pakistan in time for the Third Test. As World Series Cricket was operating at time it was speculated that he was negotiating with Kerry Packer. At Lord's in 1978 he took 5/39 to reduce England to 119/7, dismissing Mike Brearley, Graham Gooch, David Gower, Ian Botham and Bob Taylor, but rain ruined play and the match was drawn.p132, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1986 More decisively in 1978‚Äì79 Sarfraz's haul of 4/89 and 5/70 against India at Karachi gave Pakistan victory in the third and final Test by eight wickets. He took 17 wickets (25.00) in the series, the most by any player and Pakistan won their first Test series against their rivals despite having played them since 1952.p171, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1986 =Australia 1978‚Äì79= Sarfraz's greatest bowling performance took place in the First Test at Melbourne on 15 March 1979 when Australia were 305/3 with Allan Border (105) and Kim Hughes (84) at the crease needing only 77 runs to win. Sarfraz took 7/4 in 33 balls (3 of these runs came in no-balls) and dismissed Australia for 310 to give Pakistan a surprise 71 run victory. At the time his 9/86 in an innings was the best Test match analysis in Australia, the best by a Pakistani bowler and the fifth best in Test cricket. Sarfraz had also made 35 coming in at 99/6 in the first innings and took 11/125 in the match. He was also involved in the controversial dismissal of Andrew Hilditch for handling the ball in the Second Test at the WACA in Perth. The batsman was at the non- striker's end when the ball was returned to the crease by the wayward throw of a fielder. Hilditch picked up the ball and politely gave it to Sarfraz, Sarfraz appealed and Hilditch was given out. It was second time in a hundred years of Test cricket that a batsman had been given out in this fashion and although strictly correct it was considered to be against the spirit of the game. Earlier in the match the Australian tailender Rodney Hogg had been run out while 'gardening' and Alan Hurst controversially ran out Sikander Bakht when backing up, two pieces of gamesmanship which caused bad feeling between the teams.p156, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1986 Australia made 236/3 to win the Test and square the series, the other two batsmen being run out and no bowler taking a wicket. =Later career= Sarfraz played for Northamptonshire in two separate spells and in the 1980 Benson and Hedges Cup Final he took 3/23 off 11 overs to restrict Essex to 203/8 in Northant's six run win. In 1983‚Äì84 he took 4/42 and 2/27 in the First Test against England at Karachi and hit the winning runs when Pakistan made 66/7 to win.p134, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1986 After several 'retirements' the Third Test at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore proved to be his last and in the first innings his 4/49 helped dismiss England for 241. When Pakistan were reduced to 181/8 Sarfraz made 90, his highest Test and first-class score, adding 161 for the ninth wicket with his captain Zaheer Abbas (82 not out) to give his team a 102 run lead. Unfortunately, David Gower made 173 not out and Safraz was hit for 1/112 in the second innings, but came in at 199/5 and saw out the match with 10 not out. This ensured that Pakistan kept their 1‚Äì0 lead to win their first Test series against England.pp170-171, Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, W.H. Smith, 1986 =Style= From the boundary Sarfraz looked like a medium paced trundler, but the six-foot-six tall cricketer was \\"as strong as a cart-horse\\" and his powerful upper body and good action allowed him to bowl at a fast-medium pace. He could seam the ball in either direction and despite the convention he repeatedly bounced other fast bowlers such as Jeff Thomson and Joel Garner. The flat wickets found in Pakistan were not ideal for a bowler of his pace, but could sometimes surprise batsmen with his ability to make to ball seam, swing or bounce awkwardly. More importantly with Sikander Bakht Sarfraz developed reverse swing. Commentators did not realise this was reverse swing at the time, though they realised that he had an uncanny ability to move the old ball in the air. He passed on his knowledge to Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who made this new type of bowling famous in the late 1980s and 1990s. As a batsman he was a good lower-order striker of the ball particularly when driving and averaged over 40 in a series on three occasions. =Battle against match fixing= When Bob Woolmer was found dead in Jamaica, Sarfaraz Nawaz was quick to suggest that he was murdered, even before the postmortem, linking it to corruption in cricket. He subsequently raised concerns about the safety of Pakistani cricketers in West Indies, claiming Woolmer and Inzamam Ul Haq were getting threats from the bookies without naming his sources. He requested the involvement of Scotland Yard in the investigations, questioning the credibility of Jamaican police. He also alleged that the match Pakistan lost against West Indies in the 2007 Cricket World Cup was fixed. Political career He left cricket and joined politics. He was elected as a member of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab as an independent candidate in 1985 Pakistani general election. Personal life He married Pakistani film actress Rani in 1985.

History  The brewery was founded on 4 February 1803 by Johannes Haas. His father Johann Eberhard Haas was running a tavern in Krombach. According to a regulation of 25 July 1618 the sale of beer was permitted only to restaurants having their own brewery and malt kiln. Therefore, John Haas established the brewery within the family business. The water for the brewery (\\"Hasbrauerei\\") was first brought in barrels from a spring at the foot of Grumberg in the west of the village by ox cart to the brewery. In 1854, the brewery owner Haas had to pay annually 17 guilders (Florin) to the church, because the water pipeline was constructed on church property in the village. The relocation to its current site is estimated to have occurred between 1858 and 1879/82. In that time, two caverns were created that served as beer cellars. In 1896, Hermann Haas sold the brewery for 360.000 marks to Otto Eberhardt (‚Ä† 17 August 1924). Eberhardt ran the brewery as a limited partnership called \\"Hasbrauerei Eberhardt and Co.\\" and converted it to a corporation in 1905. At the beginning of the 20th century, \\"Krombacher Pilsener\\" was introduced, which led to a rapid recovery. In October 1922, Bernhard Schadeberg (the grandfather of current CEO Bernhard Schadeberg) assumed the management of the company, which has been running as a family business to this day. The current owners are Friedrich Schadeberg and his sister Barbara Lambrecht-Schadeberg, his son Bernhard Schadeberg and his daughter Petra Schadeberg-Hermann. The Krombacher Rock Spring supplying the water for the brewery (together with the \\"Breitenbach\\" Dam near Hilchenbach), was discovered by the mountain inspector Fresenius in 1722. The soft, low mineral water is the basis for the brewed beer. The brewery is one of the largest employers in the city. On the emblem of the brewery the Kindelsbergturm (Kreuztal's landmark) and among the Littfe creek is visible.  Location  Krombacher Brewery Krombach is a suburb of Kreuztal near Siegen, a city in a part of Germany called Siegerland, a part of North Rhine- Westphalia. The small town of Krombach is located at the foot of the Rothaargebirge.  Products  Krombacher Pils in Espoo, Finland. Krombacher Brewery produces the most consumed Pilsener in Germany, the Krombacher Pils. An alcohol free variant is also produced. Krombacher Radler is a mixture of 50% Krombacher Pils and 50% lemonade. Krombacher brews Krombacher Weizen, a wheat beer, since 2007 in response to market research.Press Release: \\"Entdecken Sie das Krombacher unter den Weizen\\", retrieved on 2008-06-25. Targeted at young adults, Cab is a brand of beer-based mix drinks. Initially meaning Cola and Beer, three variants are now produced: Cab Cola and Beer, Cab Banana and Beer, Cab Cherry and Beer. All variants are flavored with dragon fruit. Krombacher Brewery also produces Rhenania Alt, a dark beer and distributes Schweppes in Germany.

Schweppes Germany (and indirectly Krombacher) both control the German and Austrian licenses for Snapple (not available in Germany/Austria), Dr. Pepper (available since 2006) and Orangina.  Regenwaldprojekt  In 2002, Krombacher Brewery started a Rainforest campaign. It announced that for every crate of Krombacher sold one square meter of rainforest would be saved for at least 100 years. For achieving this, Krombacher Brewery partnered with World Wildlife Fund, famous German television host G√ºnther Jauch promoted the campaign. The campaign was very successful, but was also criticised. In fact no rainforest was acquired by WWF or Krombacher. Rather, existing nature reserve were supported. Accordingly, a German court decided the campaign was partly anticompetitive.OLG Hamm, 2003-11-18, File Reference 4 U 105/03 The campaign was started again in 2008.Krombacher ¬ª Regenwaldprojekt, retrieved on 2008-06-25.

He played in the Auckland and Gloucestershire cricket teams and was in New Zealand's first team to go to England in 1927, though no Tests were played on the tour. Rugby career Dacre played rugby union in the war years for the Railway club (a wartime combination of the Marist and City clubs). In 1917 he was involved in a breakaway movement from the club that switched to rugby league, playing matches against Ponsonby United and the City Rovers.Coffey, John and Bernie Wood Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909‚Äì2009, 2009. . Railway XIII merged with Grafton Athletic for the 1918 Auckland Rugby League season, though it is unknown if Dacre was still with the club. Cricket career Dacre was a hard-hitting, somewhat impetuous, right- handed middle order batsmanWisden 1977, p. 1051. and an occasional slow left- arm bowler, who also kept wicket a few times in a first-class career that spanned more than 20 years. An outstanding schoolboy cricketer, he made his debut for Auckland when only 15 and appeared regularly for the team until the 1927‚Äì28 season, and then again in two matches in 1932‚Äì33. He toured Australia twice and England once with New Zealand cricket teams in the period before New Zealand played Tests. In 1927, in a strong batting side, he was a success with 1,070 runs at an average of 31.47 in the first-class matches. In the first innings of the match against Marylebone Cricket Club he scored 107 in an hour and a half. Though he returned to New Zealand the following winter, in 1928 he was back in England where he spent two years playing occasional cricket before becoming qualified to play County Championship matches for Gloucestershire. Winning a regular place for Gloucestershire as soon as he was qualified in 1930, he made more than 1,000 runs in each of the next six seasons, though his average declined steadily over the period. His best season was 1930, when he hit his highest score, 223, with five sixes and 25 fours, in 255 minutes against Worcestershire. He scored two centuries in the match against Worcestershire in 1933. By 1935, he was averaging no more than 21 runs an innings and when his form declined further in 1936 his contract was terminated by mutual agreement and he returned to New Zealand. Football career Dacre also represented New Zealand in football, appearing in 4 A-Internationals in 1922 and 1923, scoring 2 goals. Dacre was also a member of the North Shore side who reached the 1926 Chatham Cup final, losing 4-2 to Sunnyside.

He was a contemporary and the main rival of Zhu Xi. In China, Japan, and Western countries, he is known by his honorific name rather than his private name.Chan, Wing-tsit. Sourcebook in Chinese Philosophy. Greenwood Publishing Group, March 1, 2002. xii. Retrieved on April 1, 2012. , 9781400809646.  Lu Jiuyuan's Main Ideas  = Lu's Philosophy of the Mind: Unity of the Mind and the Way= In his own words, Lu said, \\"The universe is my mind, and my mind is the universe.\\" Unlike Zhu's emphasis of li, which is the principle that contains and underlies all things and beings, Lu brought forward the concept of the heart/mind as the ultimate one or source that encompasses everything including the universe and the principle. The unity of the mind expressed in the work of Lu means that the mind of humanity and the mind of the Way (Dao) are one and the same. This is in direct opposition to Zhu Xi's idea that the mind of Humanity and the mind of the Way are separate and distinct from each other. Zhu Xi also claimed that every individual thing possesses its own unique material force (qi) distinct from the principle (li). Lu vehemently opposed this dualistic doctrine and further emphasized that everything is connected and originated from the heart/mind. = Original Mind = The concept of original mind was first conceived by Mencius but was further developed by Lu. The original mind means that all human beings are born with innate moral knowledge and virtue. This original mind is fourfold as Mencius called them 'four roots of the heart': *Compassion - The root of humaneness (ren). *Shame - The root of righteousness (yi). *Respect - The root of propriety and ritual observance (li). *Knowledge of right and wrong - The root of wisdom (zhi). D.C. Lau, Mencius: (Penguin Books 1970, 2003) p.38. Like real roots in nature these four roots must be nurtured first before flowers to bloom. So, in other words, these four roots of the heart are nothing but just tendencies of the mind. These four roots of the heart need proper nurturing and care to grow strong and healthy to manifest their true nature, which is moral virtue. Lu believed that moral virtues are innately present in the human heart/mind and that, endowed by Heaven, humaneness and righteousness form the Original Mind of human beings. The original mind is shared by all human beings, both sages and common people, and its truth is ageless and eternal.Xingzhong Yao, An Introduction to Confucianism: (Cambridge University Press 2000) p.110.  Influence of Mencius on Lu's Philosophy  Mencius undoubtedly had a major influence on Lu, this can easily be attested to by the numerous quotes of Mencius used in the works of Lu. Their similarities are striking since Lu used many concepts and ideas first conceived by Mencius; but without exception Lu developed Mencius' ideas on his own and caused these ideas to reach a greater maturation. Furthermore, influenced by both Buddhism and Daoism, Lu incorporates the metaphysical aspects to his philosophy that added more complexity and subtlety to Mencius' original ideas.  Influence of Daoism on Lu Jiuyuan There is a real and significant influence of Daoism on Lu's philosophy. The most prominent influences are the concept simplicity and spontaneity. The concept of spontaneity is the central point of Daoism. According to Daoism, an ideal ruler is the king who has cultivated quiescence (stillness) to such a level that he can act harmoniously and spontaneously to any situation. Zhuangzi, Daoist philosopher, expresses this in his own words, \\"in stillness a sage, in motion a king\\"The Zhuangzi Another influence of Daoism on Lu Jiuyuan in his belief that if one is 'to establish what is fundamental, one must eliminate desire.'Chang, Carsun, The development of Neo- Confucian Thought, (Westport: Greenwood Press 1957) p292. This is to emphasize the simplicity of living without human desires that usually corrupt human beings' true simplistic nature.  School of the Universal Mind after Lu Jiuyuan  The philosophy of Lu Jiuyuan attracted not many followers in China following Lu's death in 1193. Lu's philosophy was almost completely forgotten until a later thinker named Wang Yangming republished and wrote his commentaries on Lu's works during Ming dynasty. Wang Yangming played a significant role in developing Lu's philosophy and the school of the universal mind rivaling Zhuxi's school of the principle. The school of the universal mind is also called the Lu-Wang school after the names of two major thinkers, Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. The influence of this school in China following Wang's death was however curtailed by the strong centralized bureaucratic state system which controlled the education of all the government officials through the state sponsored examination which was heavily influenced by the curriculum designed by Zhu Xi. The influence of Lu-Wang school in Japan was however much greater owing to the comparatively more decentralized government system following the Sengoku (Warring states) period. The Oyomei (Japanese for Wang Yangming) school in Japan inspired and made great influences on subsequent Japanese thinkers and activists such as Nakae T≈çju and ≈åshio Heihachir≈ç. Lu's interpretation of Confucianism remained influential in China into the twentieth century. In the early twentieth century Lu's philosophy was re-popularized by Liang Shuming in his book The Civilization and Philosophy of the East and the West (1921). The Nationalist warlord Yan Xishan attempted to revive Confucianism in Shanxi largely on the model of the Lu-Wang school.Gillin, Donald G. Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province 1911-1949.

Plot  = Ragasiyam = Ragasiyam is the first season of Marmadesam series. The story-line is about the mysterious healing powers of Navabhashanam Lingams of Lord Shiva. The plot opens with a small fictional village named Chitharpatti, where a temple of Chitheswarar (also pronounced as Sitheshwarar) attracts a large number of devotees thanks to its legend as well as its purported power to heal any known or unknown disease. An ashram adjacent to the temple, headed by Oomaisaamy (Charuhasan) is also a popular name, as it cures literally any physically or mentally ill patient. The temple is closed from 6 pm every evening until 6 am the following morning. It is believed that Siddhars enter the temple past its closure for the day, and perform their rituals and prayers and leave before dawn, and anyone who disturbs the prayers of the Siddhars is done away with by the guardian of the temple, Kaalabhairavar, who is believed to guard the temple during the night in the form of a dog. This belief attracts a number of rationalists to the temple, who want to try and solve the mystery. One such rationalist, a journalist names Srikanth (Indra Soundar Rajan), hides in the temple when it is being closed for the day, in an attempt to find out what really happens in the temple in the dark. However, as if the villagers' fear is made true, Srikanth is killed by a dog while he is inside the temple. Hence, the entire village is convinced that the temple of Chitheshwarar is actually a den of heavenly Siddhas who pray during the night, leaving ordinary people to pray during the day. Srikanth's friend, Mani Sundaram (Ramji) is the young son of the temple's chief priest. He is a rationalist, who does not believe in myths and rituals. Instead, he chooses to rationalize his beliefs, and hence often ends up at odds with his father with regard to the temple's mysteries and rituals. One by one, four people are killed inside the temple, including a police inspector who is there to investigate the mystery. At this juncture, Dr. KR (Delhi Ganesh)‚Äîonce a great psychiatrist, but now mentally retarded‚Äîstrays into the village, and is admitted to Oomaisaamy's ashram by Mani. Prasad (Prithviraj), Dr. KR's son, comes in search of him, and ends up being a guest to Mani and his sister Lalitha (Vasuki). As Mani and Prasad try to reveal the temple's mystery even more, they come to know that Dr. KR is actually acting as a retard, and he too is trying to do the same. But Dr. KR has personal intentions. He had been regarded as one of the best psychiatrists of India, and an Indian Central Minister admits his mentally retarded son to his hospital for treatment. But Dr. KR is unable to cure the Minister's son even after giving his best for the patient. Enraged by this, the Minister ridicules Dr. KR and moves his son away to Oomaisaamy's ashram after hearing other people speak so highly about it. Dr. KR feels insulted and decides to find out how Oomaisaamy is able to cure patients so effortlessly in his ashram. To achieve this, he makes everyone believe he is retarded, and lands up in Oomaisaamy's ashram. What Dr. KR does not know, is that he was unable to cure the Minister's son not because of his incompetency, but because of a sinister scheme laid out by his junior, Dr. Vishwaram (Mohan V. Ram). As Dr. KR acts as a retard and tries to uncover Chitharpatti's mystery, he stumbles upon a greater truth about what might be going on inside the temple during the dark. Dr. KR and Mani then decide to work together to find out the truth. Mani finds out that there are actually one or more persons entering the temple at night through a secret entrance to the temple, and exiting at dawn. In an attempt to find out what they are actually doing inside the temple, Mani hides in the temple one night. He finds out that the two men enter the temple with trained dogs searching for Navabhashana lingams, of which, he learns, they have six already and are trying to locate the remaining three. Mani finds out that these dogs were the ones that killed the four, and it was just the work of thugs and not God, as the villagers believe. Also, the two men seem to get instructions from someone inside the village, who knows and is capitalizing on the superstitious nature of the villagers. Meanwhile, Prasad fall in love with lalitha(Vasuki), (sister of Sundaram) and they decide to marry. Mani is found hiding by these men, and a chase ensues where Mani, fighting for his life, kills the dogs, and forces the two men to leave the temple as stealthily as they arrived, and set the ball rolling for a police probe. Vaithiyar (Kavithalaya Krishnan), Mani's best friend in the village, turns out to be the man behind these killings inside the temple. As he is about to get caught, he escapes with the lingams he had already stolen, and sets off to Chennai with an accomplice. However, on the way, the accomplice is killed by a truck, which also chases Vaithiyar, but only manages to send him into a coma. The box containing the lingams is lost in the van Vaithiyar was driving, and finds its way to Chennai. The rest of the story is a nail-biting chase for these lingams. In between this hunt for the Lingams, people who are involved in this case gets killed by a moving lorry. A guy, known as Guruji, is the reason behind all these crimes and the police tries to crack the code, to find the man. Mani on his own, tries to find him, with the help of his girlfriend, Devi (Nithya), who unfortunately gets killed by the lorry. Angered, Mani goes and meets Vaithiyar, who is acting as a retard, asking him to disclose who Guruji is. From him, Mani gets to know about a book, which had stated all the current happenings, and it was written 400 years ago. He also learns that the box containing the Lingams would find its way to his sister Lalitha. Shocking truth about many people that Mani believes, come to light, making him not to trust anyone around him except his sister and Rudrapathi (Poovilangu Mohan). Rudrapathi also gets killed by the truck. Finally, Mani becomes the one to find the Guruji. Also in various stages of the plot, the significance of these lingams, values of ancient Hindu scriptures are brought out, which makes the viewer intrigued until the last scene. The last scene was made in a way to tell the viewers about human life and nature's significance. The people who died in the plot, by the lorry, comes to life to address the viewers. The actors declare that Marma Desam series would continue. Thus, telling the viewers about the second season of the series, Vidaathu Karuppu, which turned out to be the most successful of the whole Marma Desam series. The novel version of this season is ‡Æ∞‡Æï‡Æö‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æï ‡Æí‡Æ∞‡ØÅ ‡Æ∞‡Æï‡Æö‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç. = Vidaathu Karuppu = The second season was titled Vidaathu Karuppu. Vidathu Karuppu was the most successful of the Marmadesam series. The story examines the psychological underpinnings of the concept of split personalities even while exploring in detail the rural cult of Karuppu Sami prevalent in the southern part of Tamil Nadu. Starring C. T. Rajakantham, Chetan, Devadarshini, Meenakumari, Vijaya Sarathy, Master Lokesh, Mohan V. Ram, Poovilangu Mohan, Ponvannan, Sureshwar, Kausalya, Muthusubramanian and Sivakavitha, the series was a huge commercial success and triggered imitations and supernatural thrillers by other television directors. Each episode was made of two parts‚Äîthe first ten minutes of each 30-minute episode was set in the year 1970; the second part of each episode was set in 1995 and related to the events shown in the first part. While the first part revolved around the events of the Anaimudi Alampriyar household as seen through the eyes of the young Rajendran (played by Master Lokesh), the second part was mainly concerned with the customs, beliefs and traditions of the village and events unfolding in the Anaimudi Alampriyar household as seen through the eyes of the sceptical medical student Reena (Devadarshini) and her superstitious Chief Doctor, Nanda (Mohan V. Ram). The story begins with Reena's arrival in the village in the company of her colleague and best friend, Ratna, daughter of the village headman, Anaimudi Alampriyar, who seeks sanction from her village's guardian deity Karuppu Sami to marry her lover Aravind. In Ratna's village, Reena and her boss learn about the cult of Karuppu Sami, the guardian deity and how Karuppu Sami punishes people who transgress his rules. While Reena's Chief believes it, due to him getting hold of some mysterious notebook with weird stuff and a sword which draws blood, every time it is taken out, Reena is skeptical about it. Eventually, they witness some mysterious and gruesome deaths. Simultaneously, the story of the Anaimudi Naicker's mother, the evil moneylender Pechi who indulges in usury is told in flashback through the eyes of Naicker's son and Ratna's older brother, the extremely soft and timid Rajendran who is obsessed with legends of Karuppu Sami. Pechi murders one of her opponents and is eventually killed herself, the first in a string of mysterious deaths attributed to Karuppu Sami. A few days later, strange events and sightings take place in the Anaimudi Naicker household, prompting Anaimudi Naicker's family to conclude that the house is haunted by Pechi's ghost and move out. Among the mysterious death (believed to be done by Karuppu Sami), is the hunt for some gold. Happened to be gold not only of Aanamudiyar, but also the whole village. Every single one in the village had been looking for it, though some of the women try to avoid it extremely (thought that the gold is cursed due to the warth gained by Pechi). Aanamudiyar and Ratna's Uncle, Brahmman are the two people in the whole village putting in the greatest effort to find the gold. Believing Pechi had hidden the gold and jewels in four golden pots and hid it in the village, they near it but miss them. Each time one of the pots is found, it is always empty. Taking it as a challenge and to win over Karuppu Sami, to prove to the villagers that no such deity is around, Reena starts to uncover it too. Reena, anxious to know the identity of Karuppu Sami, investigates the murders and discovers that the haunting was a sham perpetuated by the village schoolteacher (played by Poovilangu Mohan) who held a grudge against the Alampriyar's family and orchestrated the haunting to drive them out of the house. But the schoolteacher vehemently denies that he had anything to do with the mysterious murders. Reena, then suspects the priest of the Karuppu Sami shrine in the village who frequently enters a state of trance during which he is possessed by Karuppu Sami and pronounces judgement. But Reena discovers that though the priest is genuinely possessed by the spirit of Karuppu Sami on occasion, he was not the killer. In her investigations, Reena is assisted by Rajendran who acts as her guide. Rajendran gradually falls in love with Reena. Eventually, Rajendran proposes to Reena who rebuffs him questioning his masculinity. Shamed, Rajendran rapes Reena and absconds. Who the actual karuppu is revealed later. The novel version of this season is Vittu Vidu Karuppa. = Sorna Reghai () = It is a crime story based on palmistry, story revolves between honest police, criminal and Astrologer.

Anwar never gets to know about the gold. In the end, the gold finds its way to the hands of Meenakshi, the theater owner's daughter and her boyfriend, Thirunavukarasu, as they leave the city in order to get married, as Thirunavukarasu's mother asks high amount of dowry from Meenakshi's father. = Iyanthira Paravai () = It is a crime story based on the Varma kalai, which is using to kill the people.

Finally Anwer found the culprit, why he murder the people, culprits' scope and reveals the Aandevar vanams' Mysteries to charu too. Meanwhile, the right hand of culprit was killed by Aasan using Varma Kalai along with a boomerang to save the Varma Kalai. = Edhuvum Nadakkum (Anything Can Happen) = 'Edhuvum Nadakkum' which explores the legend of the Kalpa vriksham tree and environment as a living entity. Thanumalayakkudi is a small tribal settlement (fictional) in a jungle in the interior of South India. Strict inter-clan codes and beliefs bind the members of the tribe. They do not accept money in exchange for their produce of chiefly honey and fruits; they are ready to barter them. In this tribal settlement, there exists a myth that the Kalpavriksham, the celestial tree that can grant any wish and desire of the person standing underneath it, is situated somewhere in the forest. Strangers to the area who go in search of this tree are lost in the forest. To this forest come Sivagurunathan, a divisional forest officer and his brother Natarajan, a wildlife filmmaker and a visiting lecturer of the film and TV institute. Witnesses to the miracles and mysteries of the forest, they are lost in the jungle in pursuit of the Kalpavriksham. It is believed that they are killed in the pursuit of this sacred tree. Siddharth, a student of Natarajan and an aspiring filmmaker, comes to the settlement along with Varsha a sound recordist to make a film on the forest and its wildlife. As the duo learn about the mysteries of the place, they smell something fishy in the alleged deaths of Sivagurunathan and Natarajan. This serial was stopped by the makers for unknown reasons. The plot does not continue. The secret is untold. There seems to be talks to revisit this season since it's left unfinished as per an interview (in 2019) by the director Naga. The novel version of this season is Vaanathu Manithargal. An interesting fact is that the novel was published much later after this series ended. Because of that we can say that this novel is based on Edhuvum Nadakkum series. However the novel's story is slightly different (like characters, sub- plot endings) to that of the one telecasted.

Since the content was not enough for more than 26 episodes, Naga wrote additional 26 episodes with him writing urban part adding lorry as a main character. For the characters, Naga cast many popular actors in different characters which according to him, \\"made the audience more aware of each character's presence in the show\\". Delhi Ganesh who usually portrayed a cook in films appeared as high-profile psychiatrist while Subalekha Sudhakar who usually portrayed sacrificing brother was roped in to play a village gangster. =Vidathu Karuppu= For Vidathu Karuppu, Naga adapted Indira's other book Vittu Vidu Karuppa which according to writer Indira was germinated from a real-life event where the dreaded gangster who was feared by everyone had the fear and respect for deity Karuppana Samy. Naga cast different actors for Vidathu Karuppu since \\"the audience has to decipher everyone's character based on their background story.\\" Chetan was cast as Rajendran based on his \\"features and soft-spoken nature\\". Devadarshini was chosen to play important character after Naga saw her anchoring in a television show. Naga revealed that \\"each actor's first half of the face (from the forehead to the nose) or the second half (from the nose to the chin) would match that of the actor who would play their parent's role\\". For that Sureshwar was chosen to play Poovilangu Mohan's son to match his height. Broadcast From 1996‚Äì1998, The first 2 seasons of the series were aired in Sun TV.

The party mainly operated within the Republic of Ireland. Boland resigned from D√°il √âireann on 3 November 1970 rather than support a motion of confidence in Taoiseach Jack Lynch, who had sacked ministers Neil Blaney and Charles Haughey for their refusal to support Government policy on Northern Ireland amid allegations of misuse of aid to Northern Ireland during the Arms Crisis. In May 1971, Boland resigned from Fianna F√°il; on 19 September 1971, he launched the new party before an audience of over one thousand delegates.Gallagher (1985) Se√°n Sherwin, Fianna F√°il TD for Dublin South-West, was the only serving member of the D√°il to join Aontacht √âireann. Sherwin would later return to Fianna F√°il and serve as its National Organiser. Boland tried to persuade Fianna F√°il dissidents Neil Blaney, Paudge Brennan and Des Foley to join his party, but they remained within Fianna F√°il, contesting the 1973 general election as independents. Captain James Kelly, who was implicated and then cleared in the Arms Trial, became Vice-Chairman of Aontacht √âireann.Captain James J Kelly: A brief biography The party supported Northern Ireland's republicans more vehemently than Fianna F√°il. It was described by Boland as \\"a return to what Fianna F√°il was when it was set up to subvert the Free State\\". At the 1973 general election, Boland, Sherwin and eleven other candidates stood for D√°il √âireann under the Aontacht √âireann banner. None was successful and the party received less than 1% of the total national vote. Boland himself won only 6% of the vote in his constituency, Dublin County South.ElectionsIreland.org: Kevin Boland The party briefly had local representation, with Gerry Carroll serving as a member of Cork City Council. Boland and most of the original members of the party resigned in 1976 after it was taken over by a number of far-right individuals.O'Maolain, Ciaran, The Radical Right: A World Directory (Keesing's Reference Publications), pg 164.

It is on the Lizard Peninsula between The Lizard and Coverack.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth It is in the civil parish of Grade Ruan History St Mary's Church The village has its origins in medieval times as a collection of fish cellars in a sheltered south-east facing coastal valley with a shingle cove. Fishing subsidised local farmers' livelihoods. Cadgwith was originally called 'Porthcaswydh', becoming 'Por Cadjwydh' in Late Cornish, and is derived from the Cornish word for 'a thicket', literally meaning battle of trees, probably because the valley was densely wooded.Weatherhill C. (2007) Cornish Place Names and Language. Ammanford: Sigma Press. From the 16th century, the village became inhabited, with fishing as the main occupation. Subsequently, houses, lofts, capstan houses, and cellars constructed of local stone or cob walls and thatched or slated roofs were built along the beach and up the sides of the valley leading to Cadgwith's characteristic Cornish fishing village appearance. In recent times a very small Anglican church was built, next to the path from the car park down to the seafront, dedicated to St Mary. Geography Cadgwith has two beaches separated by a promontory called \\"The Todden\\", thought to mean laying ground in Cornish. To the north-east is the larger beach, made mostly of shingle with a shallow slope, referred to as Cadgwith Cove, Big Beach, The Cove, Fishing Beach, or the Working Cove; all the fishermen work from this beach. The other smaller beach on the south-west side is a mixture of sand and large boulders and is called Little Cove, Cadgwith Cove or Little Beach and used as the swimming beach by locals and holiday-makers. The Todden, maximum height about 9m above sea level, provides a view of the beaches and the village. There is a natural passage through The Todden which connects the beaches. Pointing seaward from The Todden are two rocks called The Island and The Mare. At low tide the beaches are connected by a strip between the Todden and The Island. Cadgwith is sheltered from prevailing winds from the south- west or west, but easterly or south-easterly winds can produce rough seas and swells. During stormy weather waves can break over The Island. Rough seas can reach the low-lying buildings and homes. The sea has eroded large areas of The Todden and access to the promotory by a narrow pathway has been preserved by sea wall defences funded by Cornwall Council and The Tham Trust. Cadgwith lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Cadgwith Cadgwith Fishing Cadgwith owes its existence to the fishing industry. Pilchard fishing occurred until the 1950s using large seine boats and seine nets, which was a system used to enclose the large shoals of pilchards, and coordinated by the use of lookouts, known as huers (from the Cornish 'Hevva, Hevva!' ('Here they are!)), positioned on the cove's two headlands. In 1904, a record 1,798,000 pilchards were landed over four days. Due to overfishing and climate changes pilchards are no longer found in large enough numbers to sustain pilchard fishing in Cadgwith, instead brown edible crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, sharks, monkfish, and conger eel are regularly landed with most being sold abroad through fish merchants but some being sold locally by the fishmonger, caf√©, public house, and seafood snack shop. However, the Huer's hut can still be seen on the cliff above the beach. Wrecks The Lizard Peninsula has a treacherous coastline due to a combination of submerged rocks and weather factors (gales, storms, or fog). There are numerous wrecks on the rocks off Lizard Point known as The Stags, and The Manacles which lie near Coverack, and there are a number of other rocks off the coast of Cadgwith known as The Craggan and The Boa. Deep sea diving onto the wrecks is quite popular. Lifeboats Lifeboat services throughout the United Kingdom are run as a charity and manned by volunteers organised by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Cadgwith lifeboats were crewed by local fishermen between 1867 and 1963 as a benevolent service to all seafarers especially due to the treacherous local waters. In 1961 the service was transferred to a new lifeboat station at Kilcobben Cove, situated approximately halfway along the coast between The Lizard and Cadgwith which is more sheltered from the prevailing winds. The Lizard and Cadgwith lifeboats were merged and known as the Lizard-Cadgwith Lifeboat between 1961 and 1987 and subsequently called The Lizard Lifeboat. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Cadgwith in 1867. Until 1941 the station operated a 'pulling and sailing' boat, but in 1941 the motor lifeboat Guide of Dunkirk arrived. The station was closed in 1963 when a new Lizard-Cadgwith Lifeboat Station was opened at Kilcobben Cove, which is currently being rebuilt and modernised to house a new lifeboat. The redundant lifeboat house at Cadgwith has since been used by the Cadgwith Pilot Gig Club. =History of the Cadgwith lifeboats= The first lifeboat was Western Commercial Traveller. She was and wide. She had a crew of thirteen and was rowed by ten oars. She cost ¬£290 and was built by Woolfe and Shadwell. In 1878, the Western Commercial Traveller was renamed Joseph Armstrong after the late Chief Superintendent of the locomotive and carriage developments of the Great Western Railway. A replacement lifeboat, also named Joseph Armstrong, came on station in June 1887. She was and . With twelve oars and fifteen crew, she cost ¬£454 and was built by Forrest Limehouse. In 1898, a new lifeboat named Minnie Moon arrived in Cadgwith. She was and wide, with twelve oars and fifteen crew. She cost ¬£798 and was built at Thames Ironworks, Blackwall. She holds the record for the greatest number of lives saved from one rescue: 227 lives were saved from the SS Suevic on the night of 17/18 March 1907 which was wrecked in fog and gales on The Stag Rocks on the Maenheere Reef, off Lizard Point. Two silver RNLI gallantry medals were awarded to members of the Cadgwith lifeboat crew: Edwin Rutter, Coxswain Superintendent and Rev. ‚ÄòHarry‚Äô Vyvyan, Honorary Secretary. Other lifeboat crews involved in the rescue included , Coverack, and Porthleven. The centenary of the rescue was commemorated on 17 March 2007. The Herbert Sturmey arrived on station in 1932. She was and wide, with twelve oars and fifteen crew. She cost ¬£2000 and was built by Summers and Payne of Cowes. The last Cadgwith lifeboat was the Guide of Dunkirk, so called as the money was raised by the Girl Guides of the Empire. Originally destined for the Station, she took part in the Dunkirk evacuations in 1940 where she sustained bullet holes and other damage. She was and wide. She was the only Cadgwith lifeboat to have an engine and had a crew of seven. She cost ¬£5523 and was built by Rowhedge Ironworks. She is now on display at Mevagissey. Tourism Tourism is the major source of income in the village nowadays, due to the decline in the fishing industry, and many of the houses are let as holiday accommodation. Cadgwith has long been popular as a holiday destination, especially during the summer when there are numerous local events: gig racing days, summer barbecues, a regatta, Morris dancing, musical bands, and regular singing by the Cadgwith Singers in the public house, the Cadgwith Cove Inn, which is thought to be over 400 years old. The South West Coast Path traverses the village and is regularly used as destination to stop over and gain refreshment.

Most are found in the genus Cracticus, but the black butcherbird is placed in the monotypic genus Melloria. They are native to Australasia. Together with three species of currawong and two species of peltops, butcherbirds and the Australian magpie form the subfamily Cracticinae in the family Artamidae. (Despite the name of the Australian magpie, this family of birds is not closely related to European magpies, which are members of the family Corvidae.) Butcherbirds are large songbirds, being between in length. Their colour ranges from black-and-white to mostly black with added grey plumage, depending on the species. They have a large, straight bill with a distinctive hook at the end which is used to skewer prey. They have high-pitched complex songs, which are used to defend their essentially year-round group territories: unlike birds of extratropical Eurasia and the Americas, both sexes sing prolifically.Johnson Gayle; \\"Vocalizations in the Grey Butcherbird Cracticus torquatus with Emphasis on Structure in Male Breeding Song: Implications for the Function and Evolution of Song from a Study of a Southern Hemisphere Species\\"; PhD Doctorate; Griffith University, 2003 Butcherbirds are insect eaters for the most part, but will also feed on small lizards and other vertebrates. They get their name from their habit of impaling captured prey on a thorn, tree fork, or crevice. This \\"larder\\" is used to support the victim while it is being eaten, to store prey for later consumption, or to attract mates. Butcherbirds are the ecological counterparts of the shrikes, mainly found in Eurasia and Africa, which are only distantly related, but share the \\"larder\\" habit; shrikes are also sometimes called \\"butcherbirds\\". Butcherbirds live in a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to arid shrubland. Like many similar species, they have adapted well to urbanisation and can be found in leafy suburbs throughout Australia. They are opportunistic, showing little fear and readily taking food offerings to the point of becoming semi-tame. Female butcherbirds lay between two and five eggs in a clutch,Jetz, Walter; Sekercioƒülu, Cagan H. and B√∂hning-G√§se, Katrin; \\"The Worldwide Variation in Avian Clutch Size across Species and Space\\" Supplementary Material S4 with the larger clutch sizes in more open-country species.

It first aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on March 15, 2000. In the episode, SpongeBob gets stranded in an abyssopelagic zone that is a city called Rock Bottom. The episode was written by Paul Tibbitt, Ennio Torresan, Jr., and David Fain, and the animation was directed by Tom Yasumi. Upon release, \\"Rock Bottom\\" was viewed by two million households and received positive reviews from critics. Plot summary SpongeBob and Patrick board a bus to go home from Glove World, which is a glove-themed amusement park. They accidentally board the wrong bus, which then takes them to a 90-degree cliff. The cliff leads to an abyssopelagic zone called Rock Bottom, which is inhabited by many strange deep-sea animals. Patrick gets on the bus to go home but accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several unsuccessful attempts to get on the bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom.

It lies in a valley to the south of the Magaliesberg mountain range and north of the Witwatersberg mountain range, about 35 kilometres north west of Johannesburg and 20 kilometres west of Pretoria. The name of the dam means \\"gorge of the hartebeest\\" (a species of antelope) in Afrikaans. This \\"poort\\" in the Magaliesberg was a popular spot for hunters, where they cornered and shot the hartebeest. The dam was originally designed for irrigation, which is currently its primary use, as well as for domestic and industrial use. The dam has suffered from a hypertrophic state since the early 1970s. Mismanagement of waste water treatment from urban zones within the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment area is largely to blame, having distorted the food web with over 280 tons of phosphate and nitrate deposits. The town of Hartbeespoort is situated close to the dam wall and the villages of Kosmos, Melodie, Ifafi, Meerhof and The Coves, Pecanwood, Westlake and several other estates can be found alongside its shores. The town of Schoemansville was named after General Hendrik Schoeman, owner of the land during the 19th century.  History  Plaque located at the dam wall gives a short history of the dam. In 1906, the government ordered a public inquiry into the feasibility of building an irrigation dam in the Hartbeespoort of the Magaliesberg. The engineer of the Department of Irrigation that led the inquiry, submitted a favorable report to the government and the Hartebeestpoort Act. 32 of 1914 was accepted by Parliament.Turton, A.R., Meissner, R., Mampane, P.M. & Sereno, O. 2004. A Hydropolitical History of South Africa‚Äôs International River Basins. Report No. 1220/1/04 to the Water Research Commission. Pretoria: Water Research Commission. As early as 1909 there were test holes drilled at the bottom of the river to determine whether the rock formation was suitable for building such a huge dam. The size of the catchment area was calculated, the water flow was measured and estimates made of the potentially irrigable land. Downstream claims to the existing water stream were established. The topography of the riverbank and rock formations were examined to evaluate the viability of the port for the construction project. The construction of the dam officially started in August 1916. Initially, work was delayed pending a court judgment with General Hendrik Schoeman and a certain Mr. Marshevin about the expropriation of their properties. The dispute was later resolved but discontent remained after a hastily passed law to facilitate the expropriation. In his book \\"Agter die Magalies\\", Bertus de Beer argues that the government acted in a heavy-handed manner to resolve a number of issues surrounding the construction of the dam. Mother Nature caused further delays due to flooding. In 1914 and again in 1918, huge amounts of construction wood washed down the river and were never recovered. During 1915, the wall of the Geldenhuysdam further up the river broke and the flooding of the site also caused a delay. The disruption caused by the First World War, and the complications brought on by the Rebellion of a group of Afrikaners, brought further delays to the building. Then the first company was liquidated due to financial losses resulting from the floods and delays. In 1921 a second company took on the project and appointed an engineer, F. W. Scott, who tackled the project with renewed energy. In April 1923, after all the setbacks and political upheaval, the project was completed. In September of that same year the road over the wall of the Dam and through the tunnel was opened to traffic. The dam first overflowed in March 1925. The dam was built on the farm Hartebeestpoort, once owned by the Boer General Hendrik Schoeman (1840‚Äì1901). The farm and adjacent land were acquired by the State, mainly through the facilitation of his son, Johan Schoeman (1887‚Äì1967), around 1912. The completion of the dam made the agricultural land north of the Magaliesberg much more valuable, especially land close to canals and the Krokodil River.  Construction  Top of the dam wall and the motorway. The dam wall is long and high, built across a gorge cutting through the Magaliesberg. The reservoir is fed by the waters of the Crocodile River and Magalies River and covers approximately , with a mean depth of and maximum depth of . It has a surface area of , and its normal range of annual water level fluctuation is . The mixing type of the reservoir is monomictic. A single-laned, tarmac road skirts the water's edge on the north side; along its route it passes through a 56.6 m long tunnel and also crosses the dam wall.

Shows the course of the river on a topographic map. It is in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin and is a left tributary of the Rideau River. The Tay River watershed, covering a drainage area in excess of 800 square kilometers, is the westmost of the 6 recognized subwatersheds managed by the Rideau Valley Conservation Authority. Course This river starts at Bobs Lake and leaves the lake, controlled by a weir, near the community of Bolingbroke in geographic South Sherbrooke Township, part of the municipality of Tay Valley. It heads northeast, passes under Lanark County Road 36, reaches Christie Lake and passes there into geographic Bathurst Township. It continues northeast, passes under Lanark County Road 6, and divides into two channels; the right channel is known as Scotts Snye. The river then travels through the community of Glen Tay, continuing to Perth. The river splits into two main channels as it flows through downtown Perth. The two channels have recombined by the time it leaves Perth and continues to the Rideau River, which drains via the Ottawa River into the Saint Lawrence River. The river is in length and drains an area of . A canal connects the river to the Tay Canal, and Rideau Canal systems at Beveridge Bay on Lower Rideau Lake.

The name given to it by the Mississauga First Nation, who controlled its territory at the time of the arrival of the first European settlers, appears to have not been recorded. They used its territory for hunting, especially in the winter, and likely harvested manoomin (wild rice) on some of its lakes, for instance Christie Lake. Early European settlers called it the Pike River; the name Tay replaced it at some time during the arrival of many Scottish settlers after the founding of the Perth Military Settlement in 1816, doubtless in reference to the River Tay in Scotland. The new name was already clearly established during the construction of numerous mills on the river in the 1820s, and the Tay Canal in the 1830s. Mills on the Tay, the Tay Canal, and more broadly the resultant access to the Rideau Canal system provided important commercial connections from Frontenac and Lanark Counties to Ottawa and markets beyond, in particular for logging. Dams on the upper Tay created lakes (e.g. Bobs Lake) that were reservoirs of water for the Rideau Canal at the time, and are important to cottagers and seasonal residents today. Following municipal amalgamation in Ontario in 1998, the river has provided its name to the municipality of Tay Valley, Ontario, even though the municipality neither wholly contains, nor is wholly contained by, the Tay River watershed.

G. Wodehouse, being a mischievous red-headed girl who is fond of practical jokes. She is a friend and one-time love interest of Jeeves's master Bertie Wooster, and a relative of Mr. Mulliner. Life and character Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Wickham is the daughter of Lady Wickham and the late Sir Cuthbert of Skeldings Hall, Herts. She is also the first cousin, once removed, of Mr. Mulliner, Lady Wickham being his cousin. She has bright red hair, which is sometimes styled into a shingle bob.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 197-198. Described as being built along the lines of Clara Bow, she is a slim, boyish-looking girl, who \\"resembled a particularly good-looking schoolboy who had dressed up in his sister's clothes\\".Wodehouse (1999), p. 49. Bertie's Aunt Dahlia describes her as \\"a one-girl beauty chorus\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 1, p. 12. Bobbie was educated at St. Monica's school at Bingley-on-Sea. She enjoys pranking others, and generally creates trouble, both intentionally and otherwise, in the stories she appears in. Bertie Wooster is in love with her in one story, \\"Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit\\", though Bertie's valet Jeeves does not think she would be a suitable partner for Bertie. Jeeves is concerned by her frivolous nature, as well as her vivid red hair, which he considers a dangerous sign. At first, Bertie ignores Jeeves's misgivings, but Bertie's feelings about Bobbie change after he discovers that he was a target of Bobbie's latest prank, which involved himself, Tuppy Glossop, and hot water bottles. However, Bertie remains friendly towards her and helps her with various tasks in later stories, as he feels that he can still be civil to her even though he is no longer in love with her.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], chapter 5, p. 114. In \\"Episode of the Dog McIntosh\\", Bobbie wants Bertie's help to sell a play written by her mother to the American producer, Mr. Blumenfeld. In \\"Jeeves and the Kid Clementina\\" she tells Bertie to return her cousin kid Clementina to school. As Clementina is out without permission, Bobbie tells Bertie to use a method involving a flower pot and string to sneak Clementina into school. These three short stories are collected in Very Good, Jeeves. Bobbie's last appearance is in the novel Jeeves in the Offing, in which Bertie is alarmed by an announcement in The Times stating that he is engaged to Bobbie. Bertie later learns from her that the announcement is fake; Bobbie's plan is that her mother, who does not like Bertie, will be so relieved that Bobbie is not actually engaged to Bertie that she will readily approve of Bobbie's engagement to the man Bobbie really wants to marry, Reginald \\"Kipper\\" Herring. Her mother might not otherwise approve, since, though Bobbie loves Kipper, she acknowledges that he does not have a title and is not wealthy.Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 3, pp. 31-34. Bobbie and Kipper have disputes in the novel but they ultimately reconcile and are engaged at the end of the story.Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 277. Aside from Bertie and Kipper, Bobbie was courted by Roland Attwater in \\"Something Squishy\\", Dudley Finch in \\"The Awful Gladness of the Mater\\", Clifford Gandle in \\"Mr Potter Takes a Rest Cure\\", and Ambrose Wiffin in \\"The Passing of Ambrose\\". Bobbie also appears in \\"Dudley Is Back to Normal\\", though this story was later rewritten to be a Mr. Mulliner story without Bobbie. In the original version of the story, Dudley is charmed by Bobbie and falls for her again. After she tricks him, Dudley no longer has feelings for her and is back to normal.Garrison (1991), pp. 212-213.

In the beginning of each of these episodes, Bertie wants to propose to Bobbie, whereas in the original Jeeves canon, Bertie was only romantically interested in her in one story. The first time he wants to propose to her in the television series is still related to the hot water bottle incident; the second time, Bertie considers marrying Bobbie when he becomes interested in raising a daughter. Bobbie did not appear in the canonical story in which Bertie considers parenthood, \\"Bertie Changes His Mind\\".

Only dynastic members of the family are eligible to inherit the throne. The dynasty's membership, rights and responsibilities are defined by a law of the family, which is enforced by the reigning prince and may be altered by vote among the family's dynasts, but which may not be altered by the Government or Parliament of Liechtenstein.Princely House of Liechtenstein. House Laws History The family originates from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria (near Vienna), which the family possessed from at least 1140 to the 13th century, and from 1807 onwards. Heinrich I von Liechtenstein (d. 1265) was lord of Nikolsburg, Liechtenstein and Petronell. Through the centuries, the dynasty acquired vast swathes of land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia and Styria, though in all cases, these territories were held in fief under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the Habsburg family, to whom several Liechtenstein princes served as close advisors. Thus, and without any territory held directly under the Imperial throne, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). A seat in the Imperial government would add power, and would be afforded by lands which would be immediate, or held without any feudal personage other than the Holy Roman Emperor himself having rights on the land. The head of the family was able to arrange the purchase from the Hohenems family of the minuscule Lordship of Schellenberg in 1699, and the County of Vaduz in 1712. Schellenberg and Vaduz indeed had no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor. On 23 January 1719, after the purchase had been made, Charles VI as Holy Roman Emperor decreed Vaduz and Schellenberg to be united and raised to the dignity of a Principality by the name of \\"Liechtenstein\\", in honour of \\"[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein\\". On this date, Liechtenstein became a member state of the Holy Roman Empire. The Princes of Liechtenstein did not set foot in their new principality for several decades, a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchases. According to the Constitution of the Princely House of Liechtenstein of 26 October 1993, all members other than the reigning prince shall bear the titles of Prince or Princess of Liechtenstein and Count or Countess of Rietberg.

Most of the buildings in the village date from the 18th & 19th centuries. Bohan is located in the Belgian Ardennes mountains on the banks of the Semois river. It is located in the province of Namur in the French-speaking part of Belgium, Wallonia. Bohan is only 2 km from the French border (just across from the town of Charleville) and is surrounded by splendid walks and nature, as well as being close to important second world war sites in the Ardennes. The micro- climatic conditions in Bohan are very mild. Bohan is the former centre of the forgotten tobacco agriculture in Belgium, evidence of which can still be seen in the village today. Today Bohan is famous for its specialties like tobacco, trout fishing and tourism. The population of Bohan during the year is very small (in the village itself this is around 100) and mainly agricultural; however during the summer the population of the area swells to be several thousand due to this being one of the centres of holidays in Belgium.Original tram bridge from 1930 destroyed in second world warThe village is made up of a main square (on which there is a church from the 17th century, plus a number of different bars and restaurants, as well as two butchers and a patisserie) and then a couple of side roads. Due to the Semois river on one side and the hills all around, there is not much room for the village to grow any further. In the area are a large number of camping and holiday parks, thanks to the walking, cycling, horse-riding and kayaking opportunities on offer in the area. The whole surrounding area is a nature lovers paradise. The village also has an important Delhaize grocery and general store, as well as a post office, so is very well catered for given its small size. Bohan has two bridges across the Semois river. The first is built in stone and is missing two arches. This bridge was originally started in 1930 and was opened in 1935, formed to carry the tram that went through the village to Membre (another village 3 km up the road). In May 1940 two arches were blown up by the French army, to stop the German advance through the Ardennes. The bridge was repaired in 1941, only to be again destroyed in 1944 by the German army as it retreated from Belgium. The bridge remains today with its missing arches, although the tram tracks themselves have long disappeared. The second bridge was built in the 1950s and today is festooned with European and USA flags to show peace and harmony between the various countries. Bohan is part of the Commune of Vresse sur Semois.

It opens to Bristol Bay, a large body of water in the eastern Bering Sea north of the Alaska Peninsula. It is home to the area's largest city, Dillingham, and the bay hosts one of the world's last great sustainable sockeye salmon fisheries. Cannery worker making boxes at Clarks Point, Nushagak Bay in 1918 Bristol Bay residents have historically valued the estuary resources for both subsistence gains and commercial profits. However, given the estuary's importance, there have been few comprehensive scientific studies conducted in the bay. Species diversity as measured through richness and total biomass is generally low with 16 macro invertebrate species encountered in a 2007 field study, including teleost fishes, isopods, amphipods, and crangon shrimps. During the summer 2007, Nushagak Bay was found to have a Shannon Diversity (H‚Äô) value of 1.54, ranking it below similar subarctic estuaries such as Ungava Bay, near Labrador (60¬∞34‚ÄôN, 67¬∞35‚ÄôW) and Lower Herring Bay in Price William Sound (60¬∞30‚ÄôN, 147¬∞13‚ÄôW) where the Shannon Diversity values are H‚Äô=2.11 and H‚Äô=2.5, respectively. This lower diversity of Nushagak Bay is most likely due to its low salinity, high turbidity, and silty sediments. Nushagak Bay is downstream of the proposed Pebble Mine, whose tailings storage lake would sit at the headwaters of the Koktuli River, one of the Nushagak River's tributaries. Villages on the Nushagak are among the major opponents of the proposal. The bay runs primarily north‚Äìsouth from the mouth of the Nushagak River to Bristol Bay some 30 miles (48 km) southward. The bay is also fed by several additional rivers, including the Wood, Igushik, and Snake rivers.

He became a merchant in Aalborg and later captain and vice admiral in the navy of King Christian II of Denmark. In 1523, Christian II was sent into exile and his uncle, Frederick I of Denmark had taken over the throne. In 1525, Clement mutinied and became a privateer. Count's Feud Clement later allied himself to Christopher of Oldenburg. At Count Christoffer's instruction, he instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. On 16 October 1534 the peasant army of Clement, re-enforced with professional soldiers from Count Christoffer, met the army of the Jutland nobility, that had been sent to crush the revolt. The Battle of Svenstrup (Slaget ved Svenstrup) resulted in the defeat of the nobility army. For a couple of months the revolting peasants controlled a major part of northern Jutland. They expelled the noblemen and burned down many of their manor houses. However, in the long run the peasant army was too poorly armed and too undisciplined. King Christian III of Denmark made a separate peace with Count Christoffer and his general Johan Rantzau was freed to fight the peasant revolt. In December 1534, the army of Johan Rantzau defeated the peasant army which had retreated to Aalborg and strengthened the defenses of the city. After a hard battle, Rantzau's army overcame the defenses, sacked the city and killed as many as 2,000 people. Clement managed to escape, but was betrayed and captured by his enemies. He was kept in prison until the end of the civil war and was then executed by breaking on the wheel in Viborg, Denmark. Evaluation Later historians and fiction writers have admired Clement as a revolutionary figure and a champion for the rights of the common man. Also as a local North Jutland hero he is admired and a statue was erected there in 1931. The depth of his social or ideological engagement is unprovable but as the last active, and perhaps most influential, peasant rebel in Danish history he might be viewed a Danish parallel of Wat Tyler in England, Thomas M√ºntzer in Germany and Yemelyan Pugachev in Russia.Bondeopr√∏ret i 1534 (Introduktion til Clement) References Other sources *Dansk Biografisk leksikon, vol.3, (Copenhagen: 1979) *Politikens Danmarkshistorie, vol 6, by Svend Cedergreen Bech, (Copenhagen: 1963) External links *Grevens Fejde (Count's Feud) Category:1536 deaths Category:16th-century businesspeople Category:16th-century merchants Category:Privateers Category:Danish rebels Category:History of L√ºbeck Category:Executed Danish people Category:People executed by Denmark‚ÄìNorway Category:History of Aalborg Category:16th-century Danish people Category:People from Aalborg Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:16th-century executions by Denmark Category:People executed by breaking wheel Category:Danish merchants Category:People of the Count's Feud ","title":"Skipper Clement"},{"id":"3018937","text":"is a 1987 video game for the MSX2 developed by Konami, produced alongside a similarly named game for the Famicom.

London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 No. 5305 (British Railways no. 45305) is a preserved British steam locomotive. In preservation, it has carried the name Alderman A.E. Draper, though it never carried this in service.  Service  5305 was built by Armstrong-Whitworth of Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1936, works No 1360. It spent most of its career based in North-West England. After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways renumbered it as 45305. 45305 survived to the last month of steam on British Railways. It was even a candidate for the well known Fifteen Guinea Special which ran on 11 August 1968, but on the night before the trip it was failed with a collapsed firebox brick arch and had to be replaced by engine 45110. 45305 was withdrawn from service at Lostock Hall shed as a result of the firebox brick arch failure.  Preservation  45305 was sold to scrap merchants Albert Drapers and Sons Ltd. of Hull. No.5305 became the last locomotive on the scrap line of Drapers of Hull, who broke up 742 former BR locomotives. No.5305 was to have been the 743rd and last, but the scrapyard's owner, Albert Draper, decided to save one of the yard's locomotives for posterity, and have it restored to full running order. He eventually chose 45305, simply because it was the cleanest engine in the yard, but nevertheless, the engine was saved. Albert Draper was, at the time, the president of Hull Kingston Rovers Rugby League Football Club, and it was his fond wish that No.5305 would one day head a special train from Hull to Wembley, where he hoped the club would be playing in the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final. No.5305 was put in the care of the Humberside Locomotive Preservation Group and based at Hull Dairycoates MPD where it was eventually brought up to full main line standard. 5305, restored to original LMS livery was steamed again in 1976. In 1984, 5305 was named Alderman A E Draper by the Mayor of Hedon, Bill Tong. A.E. Draper was twice Mayor of Hedon and the Hedon coat of arms is on the nameplates. However, for reasons of authenticity, the engine does not always carry these nameplates. Between 1986 and 1992 5305 spent several summer seasons working over the West Highland Line between Fort William and Mallaig, continuing the class's particular association with Scotland. The locomotive left Hull Dairycoates in April, 1992 on the closure of that shed, first moving to the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, running there until its ten-year boiler certificate expired in December 1994. In 1996, the engine left the KWVR, first moving to RAF Binbrook in Lincolnshire, and then to the preserved Great Central Railway at Loughborough in Leicestershire, arriving there on 20 November 1996. Following a full overhaul at Loughborough works, the engine returned to service in August 2003, this time in BR guise as 45305. After suffering buffer beam damage in early 2006, 5305 spent 2006 in use at the GCR before being withdrawn for repairs, which were completed in October 2010. 5305 has now returned to service complete with a new 10 year boiler ticket and renewed mainline certificate. The locomotive is still owned by the Draper Family of Hull, but is now looked after by the 5305 Locomotive Association, the successor to the Humberside Locomotive Preservation Group, and while the engine does visit other heritage railways when not out on the mainline, including visits back to the KWVR in 2013 and 2014, and visits to the North Norfolk Railway in September 2011 and 2014, the GCR remains its heritage railway base.  Fame in Preservation  2013 marked the 45th anniversary since the end of steam on British Railways in 1968, and because Aug 11 was on a Sunday it was decided for a re-run to take place to mark 45 years since the end of steam. 45305 was booked to work the original train in 1968 but was failed the night before the trip due to a collapsed firebox brickarch, so allowing her to work the anniversary run 2013 allowed the ghost of 1968 to finally be put to rest. There was also a change of routing as the original route through Newton-le-Willows from Liverpool to Manchester was closed for engineering works so the tour was diverted down the line to Piccadilly via Warrington Central which had not seen steam traction since 1968. 45305 worked from Liverpool to Longsight and then worked back from Longsight to Liverpool in the evening. Other locos that worked the tour included BR Britannia Pacific no 70013 Oliver Cromwell which worked from Longsight to Carlisle via Bolton, Farington & Settle while LMS Black 5 4-6-0's no's 45231 & 44932 double headed the train from Carlisle to Longsight via Settle, Darwen & Bolton. The loco also featured in Season 2 Episode 3 of the Netflix Series 'The Crown', hauling a train that carried Sir Anthony Eden to Sandringham to offer his resignation to the Queen following the Suez crisis.

Plot Jayakrishnan (Mohanlal) is a well-to-do bachelor who lives a contrasting dual life: one among his friends in the town, and the other with his mother and sister at their village. While he is an audacious guy celebrating life with his friends in town, he is a frugal family man at home. The film is about his dual life, and how he falls in love with two women, namely Clara (Sumalatha) and Radha (Parvathy), and his difficulty in deciding between them. Jayakrishnan is a typical Malayali guy belonging to an aristocratic family from Thrissur. He has his own vision of life, especially when it comes to marriage. He is hardworking and works on his own farm. At the same time he enjoys a modern lifestyle with his friends in town, unknown to most people in his village. While working on his farm one day, Jayakrishnan becomes reacquainted with Radha, a distant relative he hasn't seen since childhood. Radha's no-nonsense attitude immediately attracts him and he soon falls for her. Jayakrishnan decides to confess his feelings to her so he heads to Radha's college campus. In the midst of a group of about 20 students, he requests a moment of privacy and then expresses his desire to marry her. Radha, unfortunately, refuses his proposal and proceeds to humiliate him by citing his flirtatious/promiscuous reputation. One day, Jayakrishnan is persuaded to write a letter on behalf of his friend Thangal, a pimp, to a girl named Clara. The letter is intended to fool Clara's father, and thereby introduce Clara to the sex industry under Thangal's supervision. As Jayakrishnan writes the letter, it begins to rain. It turns out that Clara is a poor girl who belongs to the coastal fishing community. She has been mistreated by her stepmother, and is trying to escape from her home. She agrees to become a sex worker and meets Jayakrishnan in Thangal's supervision. Their meeting is graced by the rain. Jayakrishnan, saddened by Radha's rejection, and urged on by his friend Thangal, agrees to be Clara's first customer. This is Jayakrishnan's first time being physical with a woman. Later he realizes that Clara was a virgin, a fact that disturbs him. He had made a promise to himself that he would not sleep with a virgin unless she was his wife, and if he couldn't keep his pledge, then that girl would at least become his wife. On breaking the one promise he was determined to keep in life, he is deeply disturbed and proposes marriage to Clara. She admires his sincerity and scruples, but does not want to cause Jayakrishnan any hurt socially or personally (as she considers herself a sex worker), hence she decides to disappear from his life. During this time, Radha hears more about Jayakrishnan from her brother (Madhavan), who was a junior in college to Jayakrishnan. She hears more about the dual life of Jayakrishnan, his small games of fooling people around him, and his ready-to-do-anything-for-friends attitude. She also learns that he had never fooled around with girls, despite his free-spirited lifestyle. Her brother tells her that it would be the first time that Jayakrishnan had proposed to a woman. For the first time, Radha sees Jayakrishnan for the sincere person that he is. She begins to love him, and agrees to his marriage proposal. She meets Jayakrishan to express her feelings towards him, and apologizes for her brusque behavior in the past. However, Jayakrishnan has now begun to feel differently. He tells Radha that he does not regard himself as being the right person for her. When questioned by Radha about the reason behind his change of heart, he discloses everything that transpired between him and Clara. Radha is not offended by his behavior at all. She admires his sincerity and depth of feeling. She tells Jayakrishnan that she is not bothered by his past with Clara. One day, Jayakrishnan receives a telegram from Clara. She informs him that she is coming to visit him again. Jayakrishnan cannot resist meeting her. It rains again around the time they meet. He tells her about Radha. Clara expresses her joy at his new relationship, but she also wonders if she is the reason Jayakrishnan is unable to commit to Radha. She decides to leave his life forever. Before leaving, she implores Jayakrishnan to not disappoint Radha. Jayakrishan and Radha decide to get married. One day, Jayakrishnan receives a late night phone call that Clara is coming to see him, and this will be their last meeting, taking place at Ottapalam railway station. It rains heavily that day. Shocked, Jayakrishnan and Radha can't decide what to do. Radha asks Jayakrishnan not to meet Clara, but he cannot resist seeing her. He goes to meet Clara. Toward the end of the movie, Jayakrishnan reaches the station to meet Clara. Radha also reaches the station, but without Jayakrishan's knowledge. At the station, both are surprised to see that Clara is married and is the mother of a child. She tells Jayakrishnan that she had decided to marry to save both their futures. Now she can have a family life and Jayakrishnan can marry Radha, with whom he has fallen in love. Clara leaves Jayakrishnan's life forever, and Radha and Jayakrishnan unite. It does not rain at the final meeting between Clara and Jayakrishnan.

Raveendranath with lyrics by Sreekumaran Thampi. Initially, O. N. V. Kurup was the lyricist, who wrote the lyrics first as a poem and Raveendran composed the tune based on it. For the scenes of \\"Megham Poothu Thudangi\\", the lyrics he wrote began in the line \\"Ini Nin Manassinte Koodu Thurannathil Oru Minnaminniye Konduvakkam\\". However, Padmarajan felt that the song is not aligning to the scenes in the film, hence, it was decided that the tune should be set first and lyrics should be written based on it. Raveendran composed a total of 10 tunes for both the songs. But Kurup was not willing to alter his poem for the tune. Hence, Thampi was called for writing the lyrics. He wrote \\"Megham Poothu Thudangi\\" in a single night by watching the scenes of the song. The songs were recorded at AVM Studios in Chennai. \\"Megham Poothu Thudangi\\" was recorded ten days after \\"Onnam Raagam Paadi\\".

Life and career Dearden was born at 5, Woodfield Road, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex to Charles James Dear, a steel manufacturer, and his wife, Florence Tripp.Class: RG14; Piece: 10121; Schedule Number: 79, Census Returns of England and Wales, 1911. The National Archives of the UK. Dearden graduated from theatre direction to film, working as an assistant to Basil Dean. He later changed his own name to Dearden to avoid confusion with his mentor. He first began working as a director at Ealing Studios, co-directing comedy films with Will Hay, including The Goose Steps Out (1942) and My Learned Friend (1943). He worked on the influential chiller compendium Dead of Night (1945) and directed the linking narrative and the \\"Hearse Driver\\" segment. He also directed The Captive Heart starring Michael Redgrave, a 1946 British war drama, produced by Ealing Studios. The film was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. The Blue Lamp (1950), probably the most frequently shown of Dearden's Ealing films, is a police drama which first introduced audiences to PC George Dixon, later resurrected for the long-running Dixon of Dock Green television series. His last Ealing film, Out of the Clouds, was released in 1955. In later years he became associated with the writer and producer Michael Relph, and the two men made films on subjects generally not tackled by British cinema in this era. These included homosexuality (Victim, 1961) and race relations (Pool of London, 1951; Sapphire, 1959). In the mid to late 1960s Dearden also made some big-scale epics including Khartoum (1966), with Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier, and the Edwardian era black comedy The Assassination Bureau (1969), again with Michael Relph. His last film was The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970) with Roger Moore, with whom he later made three episodes of the television series The Persuaders!: Overture, Powerswitch and To the Death, Baby. He had two sons, Torquil Dearden and the screenwriter and director James Dearden. Dearden died on 23 March 1971 at Hillingdon Hospital, London after being involved in a road accident on the M4 motorway near Heathrow Airport, in which he suffered multiple injuries. Reputation The film critic David Thomson does not hold Dearden in high regard. He writes: \\"Dearden's films are decent, empty and plodding and his association with Michael Relph is a fair representative of the British preference for bureaucratic cinema. It stands for the underlining of obvious meaning\\".David Thomson The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, London: Little, Brown, 2002, p.213 More positively, for Brian McFarlane, the Australian writer on film: \\"Dearden's films offer, among other rewards, a fascinating barometer of public taste at its most nearly consensual over three decades\\".Brian McFarlane (ed.) The Encyclopedia of British Film, 2003, London: Methuen/BFI, p.168 Regular Ealing cinematographer Douglas Slocombe enjoyed working with Dearden personally, describing him as the 'most competent' of the directors he worked with at Ealing.

It is located in the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence. History The Trinity is thought to have been created by Masaccio sometime between 1425‚Äì1427. He died in late 1428 at the age of 26, or having just turned 27, leaving behind a relatively small body of work. This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces. =Location= The fresco is located along the middle of the basilica's left aisle. Although the configuration of this space has changed since the artwork was created, there are clear indications that the fresco was aligned very precisely in relationship with the sight-lines and perspective arrangement of the room at the time; particularly a former entrance-way facing the painting; in order to enhance the tromp l'oeil effect. There was also an altar, mounted as a shelf- ledge between the upper and lower sections of the fresco, further emphasizing the \\"reality\\" of the artifice. =Commissioners and donors= Not much is known about the details of the commission; no contemporaneous documents naming the altar-piece's patron(s) have been found. The two donor portraits included in the fresco, one figure kneeling on either side of the archway, have not been positively identified. The persons depicted are almost certainly contemporary Florentines; either the persons who funded the work, or relatives or close associates. According to the established conventions of such depictions, it is generally, but not universally, assumed that they were probably still alive at the time of the artwork's commissioning. Presumably, the representations in the painting serve as relatively accurate likenesses of their actual appearance at the time when their portraits were created. The leading theories as to their identity favour two local families; either the Lenzi or, for at least one of the figures, a member of the Berti, who were a working-class family from the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence. According to recently discovered (as of 2012) records of the Berti family, they owned a tomb at the foot of the fresco,Rita Maria Comanducci, \\"'L'altare Nostro de la Trinit√†': Masaccio's Trinity and the Berti Family,\\" The Burlington Magazine, 145 (2003) 14-21. and it has been suggested that they might have had a particular \\"devotional loyalty\\" to veneration of the Holy Trinity. Other sources mention a Lenzi tomb near the altar, with the inscription \\"Domenico di Lenzo, et Suorum 1426\\", as well as other Lenzi decorations in the chapel at that time, and assume the donor portraits to be posthumous images of Domenico (and his spouse?); based on the full-profile pose used for the figures. In the Florentine dating system of that time, the new year began on March 25; and factoring in the conversion from Julian to Gregorian calendars Domenico's death, as recorded, would have been on 19 January 1427. It has been hypothesized that Fra' Alessio Strozzi and/or Filippo Brunelleschi may have been involved, or at least consulted, in the creation of Trinity. Brunelleschi's work on linear perspective and architecture certainly inspired the painting, and this is clearly demonstrated within Massacio's work. Fra' Alessio's involvement has been posited more on the matter of the appropriate depiction of the Holy Trinity, according to the preferences and sensibilities of the Dominican order. However, there is, to date, no concrete evidence for the direct involvement of either of these 2 persons, and due to the lack of documentation about the exact circumstances of the piece's creation, theories about 3rd party involvement in the creative process remain speculative. =Giorgio Vasari and Cosimo I= Around 1568 Cosimo I, then Duke of Florence, commissioned Giorgio Vasari to undertake extensive renovation work at Santa Maria Novella; in keeping with the tastes and religious politics of the time. This work included reconfiguring and redecoration of the chapel-area in which Masaccio's fresco was located. Vasari had already written about Masaccio, including a highly favorable mention of this specific work, in his Vite. When it came time to implement the planned renovations of the chapel containing Trinity, circa 1570, Vasari chose to leave the fresco intact and construct a new altar and screen in front of Masaccio's painting, leaving a small gap, and effectively concealing and protecting the earlier work. While it seems reasonably clear that it was Vasari's deliberate intention to preserve Masaccio's painting, it is unclear to what extent Duke Cosimo and/or other \\"concerned parties\\" were involved in this decision. To decorate the new altar, Vasari painted a Madonna of the Rosary; the image is extant, but has been moved to a different location within the church. =Rediscovery and subsequent history= Masaccio's Holy Trinity was rediscovered when Vasari's altar was dismantled during renovations in 1860. The Crucifixion, the upper part of the fresco, was subsequently transferred to canvas, and relocated to a different part of the church. It is unclear from available sources whether the lower section of the fresco, the cadaver tomb, remained unknown or was deliberately omitted (and possibly plastered over) during the 1860s construction work. Restoration was done to the Crucifixion section of the painting at that time, to replace missing areas of the design; mostly architectural details around the perimeter of the work. While the painting was in damaged condition when rediscovered, it is also likely that further damage was caused by the transfer from plaster to canvas. In the 20th century, the cadaver tomb portion of the work was rediscovered in situ, and the two halves were re-united in their original location in 1952. Leonetto Tintori undertook restoration work on the combined whole during 1950‚Äì1954. Description (note that this line-drawing does not include adequate spacing for the altar-ledge between upper and lower sections) =Dimensions= The painting is approximately 317 cm (125 in) wide, and 667 cm (263 in) high. This gives an overall vertical-to-horizontal proportion of about 2:1. The ratio between the upper and lower sections of the work is very roughly 3:1. =Altar= Originally, the design included an actual ledge, used as an altar, physically projecting outward from the now-blank band between the upper and lower sections of the fresco; further enhancing the sense of depth and reality in the work. Constructed as a pillared-shelf ~5 ft. above the floor, and estimated to be about 60 cm. wide, the altar-table's appearance would have been intended to match and/or complement the painted architecture. Its facing-edge and upper surface integrating with the fresco's steps and archway; and its supporting pillars, both real and illusory, combining with the shadows caused by the over-hang to create a crypt-like effect for the tomb beneath. The upper section of the fresco still retains traces of candle-smoke and heat-effects from use of this altar. =Figures= The painted figures are roughly life-sized. For an adult of average height facing the painting, their eye-line would have been slightly above 'ground-level' in the work; with Death in the form of the crypt and skeleton directly front of them, and the promise of Salvation above. =Damaging and restoring= Over the course of time and events (see above), the fresco has been damaged and subsequently restored. Much of the outer edge of the upper section, mainly architectural detail, is replacement work. Some regions of \\"new\\" paint can be clearly identified by differences in colour, visual texture and detail; and in certain places, by apparent \\"cracks\\" along the boundary between the original fresco surface, and areas of the design where the original surface is entirely absent and was repainted. The skeleton represents a memento mori, or reminder of death. =Lower section= The lower section, depicting a memento mori, in the form of a cadaver tomb, has also lost significant paint; but the restoration work there has been more restrained and less extensive. This is probably due, at least in part, to the fact that the lower half of the fresco was not recovered until the mid-20th century. By this time, \\"standard practice\\" in restoration had become more conservative, with a stronger emphasis on preserving and revealing the authentic work of the original artist; whereas earlier restorations tended to have more focus on producing an aesthetically pleasing \\"recreation\\" of the artwork. As far as can be determined from available records, at the time when this painting was created no large-scale Roman-style coffered barrel vault, Triumphal arch or otherwise, had been constructed in Western Christendom since late antiquity.Siegfried Giedion, in Space, Time and Architecture, points out that the first would be Leon Battista Alberti's interior and external barrel vaults at Sant'Andrea, Mantua, begun nearly five decades after Masaccio's premature death. =Notable characteristics= The Trinity is noteworthy for its inspiration taken from ancient Roman triumphal arches and the strict adherence to recently developed perspective techniques, with a vanishing point at the viewer's eye level, so that, as Vasari describes it \\"a barrel vault drawn in perspective, and divided into squares with rosettes that diminish and are foreshortened so well that there seems to be a hole in the wall.\\"Le vite...:\\"Masaccio\\" This artistic technique is called trompe l'oeil, which means \\"deceives the eye,\\" in French. The fresco had a transforming effect on generations of Florentine painters and visiting artists. The sole figure without a fully realized three-dimensional occupation of space is the majestic God supporting the Cross, considered an immeasurable being. The kneeling patrons represent another important novelty, occupying the viewer's own space, \\"in front of\\" the picture plane, which is represented by the Ionic columns and the Corinthian pilasters from which the feigned vault appears to spring; they are depicted in the traditional prayerful pose of donor portraits, but on the same scale as the central figures, rather than the more usual 'diminution', and with noteworthy attention to realism and volume. Interpretation Several diverse interpretations of the fresco have been proposed. Most scholars have seen it as a traditional kind of image, intended for personal devotions and commemorations of the dead, although explanations of how the painting reflects these functions differ in their details.Ursula Schlegel, \\"Observations on Masaccio's Trinity Fresco in Santa Maria Novella,\\" Art Bulletin, 45 (1963) 19-34; Otto von Simson, \\"Uber die Bedeutung von Masaccios Trinit√§tfresko in Santa Maria Novella,\\" Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen, 8 (1966) 119-159; Rona Goffen, \\"Masaccio's Trinity and the Letter to the Hebrews,\\" Memorie domenicane, n.s/ 11 (1980) 489-504; Alessandro Cortesi, \\"Una lettura teologica,\\" in La Trinit√† di Masaccio: il restauro dell'anno duemila, ed. Cristina Danti, Florence, 2002, 49-56; Timothy Verdon, \\"Masaccio's Trinity,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio, ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158-176. The iconography of the Trinity, flanked by Mary and John or including donors, is not uncommon in Italian art of the late 14th and early 15th centuries, and the association of the Trinity with a tomb also has precedents. No precedent for the exact iconography of Masaccio's fresco, combining all these elements, has been discovered, however. The figures of the two patrons have most often been identified as members of the Lenzi family or, more recently, a member of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella quarter of Florence. They serve as models of religious devotion for viewers but, because they are located closer to the sacred figures than the viewers are, they also lay claim to special status. The cadaver tomb consists of a sarcophagus on which lies a skeleton. \\"Carved\\" in the wall above the skeleton is an inscription: \\"IO FU[I] G[I]A QUEL CHE VOI S[I]ETE E QUEL CH['] I[O] SONO VO[I] A[N]CO[R] SARETE\\" (I once was what you are and what I am you also will be). This memento mori underlines that the painting was intended to serve as a lesson to the viewers. At the simplest level the imagery must have suggested to the 15th-century faithful that, since they all would die, only their faith in the Trinity and Christ's sacrifice would allow them to overcome their transitory existences.

It is currently a Latin Catholic titular see and an archaeological site near the village of San Giovanni di Sinis, municipality of Cabras, in the Province of Oristano. It is located on the southern shore of the Sinis peninsula, which forms the northern cape of the Bay of Oristano, by the cape of San Marco. Tharros, mentioned by Ptolemy and in the Itineraries, seems to have been one of the most important places on the island.  History  = Foundation = Until some years ago, the archaeological findings in the area of Tharros supported the theory that Phoenicians founded the town in eighth century BC. The probability of this was reduced by the finding of some parts of the old settlement in the Mistras Lagoon. A submerged 100 m wall seems to be part of a port structure much older than the Phoenician one, since in 1200 BC sea level rose, swallowing the existing buildings.Antonioli, Fabrizio; Orr√π, Paolo; Porqueddu, Alessandro and Solinas, Emanuela, \\"Variazioni del livello marino in Sardegna durante gli ultimi millenni sulla base di indicatori geo-archeologici costieri.\\" In L'Africa romana: trasformazione dei paesaggi del potere nell'Africa settentrionale fino alla fine del mondo antico: atti del 19.

A previous nuragic settlement apparently existed there in the Bronze Age, as the nuragic presence near the tophet area seems to suggest.Zucca, Raimondo \\"Bronzi nuragici da Tharros\\" In La Sardegna nel Mediterraneo tra il secondo e il primomillennio a.C.: atti del II Convegno di Studi \\"Un millennio di relazioni fra la Sardegna ei Paesi del Mediterraneo\\", 27-30 novembre 1986, Selargius-Cagliari, Italia. p. 117-132. Cagliari: 1987. = Thopeth = Archaeologists found a tophet, an open-air sacred place common for several installations of Phoenicians in the western Mediterranean, on top of a hill called Su Muru Mannu near the remains of a village built by the nuragic peoples (1900-730 BCDepalmas, A. and R.

Springer Science+Business Media, New York: 2010.). This is seen as a first sign of colonization and urbanization. = Later history = Excavations showed that from the 8th century BC until its abandonment in the 10th century Tharros was inhabited, first by Phoenicians, then by Punics and then by Romans. The town was the capital of the medieval Giudicato of Arborea, a Roman/Byzantine relict state from the 9th century until 1070 when Orzocorre I of Arborea relocated to Oristano under pressure of Saracen raiders. The town was effectively abandoned at this time or shortly thereafter. The site was then used for centuries as a quarry. An inscription records the repair of the road from Tharras to Cornus as late as the reign of Roman emperor Philip.De la Marmora, Voy. en Sardaigne, vol. ii. pp. 359, 477. The Antonine Itinerary correctly places it 18 miles from Cornus and 12 from Othoca (modern Santa Giusta near Oristano).Itin. Ant. p. 84; Ptol. iii. 3. ¬ß 2. However, its history during most of the period of Roman domination or early Christianity is unknown. Diocese = Residential (arch)diocese = The Diocese of Tharros was established around the year 400, its only presumably historically recorded bishop being Johannes circa 500. It was renamed as the Diocese of Sinis-Tharros in 700. In 800 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Cornus. From 1000 it was promoted the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Sinis-Tharros, apparently to match the prestige of the Giudice (feudal temporal governor) of Arborea, which had taken residence there, with two suffragan sees: Diocese of Santa Giusta and Diocese of Terralba and Uselli. In 1070 it lost territory to establish the Diocese of Bosa. It was formally suppressed in 1093, its territory being reassigned to establish of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Oristano, where its seat had been established in 1070 following the depopulation of the city thereto. =Titular see= In 1755 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin titular bishopric, bearing the name of Sinita until it was renamed Sinis in 1793. Its incumbents were/are of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank, with an Archiepiscopal exception (title Tharros).

Based on his research at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, New York for understanding carbon dioxide absorption, he developed a prototype ventilator device that efficiently could absorb carbon dioxide during surgery, dubbed the Roswell Park ventilator. This was further developed into the Air-Shields Ventimeter ventilator that were used for a period of almost 50 years. Elam contributed significantly to the development and understanding of modern rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and brought it to the attention of the medical community and the general public. In 1954, Elam was the first to demonstrate experimentally that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was a sound technique, and together with Dr. Peter Safar he demonstrated its superiority to previous methods. Elam wrote the instructional booklet Rescue Breathing, which was distributed throughout the U.S. in 1959. He also participated in producing films demonstrating the life-saving technique and contributed with Peter Safar in the development of a mannequin called Resusci Anne, produced by Laerdal of Norway, that allowed the public to learn the technique in a safe manner. Elam received his medical doctorate from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1945.

It is an estimated 150,000 light-years diameter, and has a mass of about solar masses; its outer ring has a circular velocity of . It was discovered by Fritz Zwicky in 1941. Zwicky considered his discovery to be \\"one of the most complicated structures awaiting its explanation on the basis of stellar dynamics.\\" An estimation of the galaxy's span resulted in a conclusion of 150,000 light years, which is slightly smaller than the Milky Way. The large Cartwheel galaxy is the dominant member of the Cartwheel galaxy group, which consists of four physically associated spiral galaxies. The three companions are referred to in several studies as G1 - the smaller irregular blue Magellanic spiral, G2 - the yellow compact spiral with a tidal tail, and G3 - a more distant spiral often seen in wide field images. Structures The structure of the Cartwheel galaxy is noted to be extremely complicated and heavily disturbed. The Cartwheel consists of two rings - the outer blue ring, the site of massive ongoing star formation due to gas and dust compression, and the inner yellow nucleic ring that surrounds the galactic center. A ring of dark absorbing dust is also present in the nucleic ring. Several optical arms or ‚Äúspokes‚Äù are seen connecting the outer ring to the inner, and are theorized to be reforming spiral arms following the collision. Observations show the presence of both non-thermal radio and optical spokes, but the two do not overlap and have been shown to be unassociated with each other and thus are different structures. Evolution The galaxy was once a normal spiral galaxy before it apparently underwent a head-on ‚Äúbullseye‚Äù style collision with a smaller companion approximately 2-300 million years prior to how we see the system today. When the nearby galaxy passed through the Cartwheel Galaxy, the force of the collision caused a powerful gravitational shock wave to expand through the galaxy, like a rock being tossed into a sandbed. Moving at high speed, the shock wave swept up and compressed gas and dust, creating a starburst around the galaxy's center portion that were unscathed as it expanded outwards. This explains the bluish ring around the center, brighter portion. It can be noted that the galaxy is beginning to retake the form of a normal spiral galaxy, with arms spreading out from a central core. These arms are often referred to as the cartwheels ‚Äúspokes‚Äù. Alternatively, a model based on the gravitational Jeans instability of both axisymmetric (radial) and nonaxisymmetric (spiral) small-amplitude gravity perturbations allows an association between growing clumps of matter and the gravitationally unstable axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric waves which take on the appearance of a ring and spokes. Based on observational data, however, this theory of ring galaxy evolution does not appear to apply to this specific galaxy. While most images of the Cartwheel display three galaxies close together, a fourth physically associated companion (also known as G3) is known to be associated with the group through an HI tail that connects G3 to the cartwheel. Due to the presence of the HI tail, it is widely believed that G3 is the ‚Äúbullet‚Äù galaxy that plunged through the disk of the cartwheel, creating its current shape, not G1 or G2. This hypothesis makes sense given the size and predicted age of the current structure (~300 million years old as mentioned before). Considering how close G1 and G2 are to the Cartwheel still, it is much more widely believed that the roughly 88 kpc (~287,000 light years) distant G3 is the intruding galaxy. Neutral hydrogen tail mapping is extremely useful in determining ‚Äúculprit‚Äù galaxies in similar cases where the answer is relatively unclear. Hydrogen gas, being the lightest and most abundant gas in galaxies, is easily torn away from parent galaxies through gravitational forces. Evidence of this can be seen in the Jellyfish Galaxy and the Comet Galaxy, which are undergoing a type of gravitational effect called ram pressure stripping, and other galaxies with tidal tails and star forming stellar streams associated with collisions and mergers. Ram pressure stripping will almost always cause trailing-dominant tails of HI gas as a galaxy infalls into a galaxy cluster, while mergers and collisions like the cartwheel often create leading-dominant tails as the culprit galaxy‚Äôs gravity attracts and pulls on the victim galaxy‚Äôs gas in the direction of the culprits motion. The existing structure of the cartwheel is expected to disintegrate over the next few hundred million years as the remaining gas, dust and stars that hasn‚Äôt escaped the galaxy begins to infall back towards the center. It is likely that the galaxy will regain a spiral shape after the infall process completes and spiral density waves have a chance to reform. This is only possible if companions G1, G2 and G3 remain distant and do not undergo an additional collision with the cartwheel. collision between two galaxies is seen in this NASA Hubble Space Telescope true-color image of the Cartwheel Galaxy. X-ray sources The unusual shape of the Cartwheel Galaxy may be due to a collision with a smaller galaxy such as those in the lower left of the image. The most recent star burst (star formation due to compression waves) has lit up the Cartwheel rim, which has a diameter larger than the Milky Way. Star formation via starburst galaxies, such as the Cartwheel Galaxy, results in the formation of large and extremely luminous stars. When massive stars explode as supernovas, they leave behind neutron stars and black holes. Some of these neutron stars and black holes have nearby companion stars, and become powerful sources of X-rays as they pull matter off their companions (also known as ultra and hyperluminous X-ray sources). The brightest X-ray sources are likely black holes with companion stars, and appear as the white dots that lie along the rim of the X-ray image. The Cartwheel contains an exceptionally large number of these black hole binary X-ray sources, because many massive stars formed in the ring. light spectra (X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, and infrared).

Origins and early career Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles at age 4 (Fran√ßois-Hubert Drouais) Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles was born in Paris into a noble and well-known family. His grandfather was Ren√© H√©rault, who had served as Lieutenant General of Police of Paris between 1725 and 1739. His great- grandfather was Jean Moreau de S√©chelles (1690‚Äì1760), who had served as Controller-General of Finances between 1754 and 1756 and had given his name to the Seychelles archipelago. Jean Moreau de S√©chelles's daughter, H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles (1715‚Äì1798), was the second wife of Ren√© H√©rault. Most authors, however, consider that Ren√© H√©rault was not the biological grandfather of Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles. His biological grandfather was most likely Louis Georges √ârasme de Contades (1704‚Äì1795), Marshal of France, who had an affair with H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles during her marriage to Ren√© H√©rault. H√©l√®ne Moreau de S√©chelles gave birth to a son in 1737, Jean-Baptiste Martin H√©rault de S√©chelles - the father of Marie-Jean, who died in 1759, at the Battle of Minden, where Contades was commanding the French army. Contades took care of Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles after the early death of his father. He had arranged to marry his illegitimate son Jean-Baptiste Martin H√©rault de S√©chelles to his wife's niece, so that he might present himself in society as the \\"uncle\\" of Marie-Jean. Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles was also the first cousin of the famous Duchess of Polignac, the friend and confidant of Queen Marie Antoinette. The Duchess of Polignac, who would later be the object of deep revolutionary disapprobation, was the daughter of Jeanne Charlotte H√©rault (1726‚Äì1753 or 1756), herself the daughter of Ren√© H√©rault and his first wife. Finally, he was also the nephew of Claude-Henri Feydeau de Marville, Lieutenant General of Police of Paris between 1739 and 1747, who had married Marie-Jean's aunt - the second daughter of Ren√© H√©rault and his first wife.

At the age of twenty, he became King's Advocate (a position similar to Advocate General) at the Ch√¢telet, in part due to the aid of the Duchess of Polignac. Associates of the Polignac family presented him to the queen, who pushed his appointment as Advocate General at the prestigious Parlement of Paris.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.34 Active freemason, he was a member of Les Neuf Soeurs lodge since its creation in 1776.Dictionnaire universelle de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie, page 360 (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc Cara, ed. Larousse , 2011) His legal occupation did not prevent him from devoting himself to literature, and in 1785 he published an account of a visit he had made to the noted naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, the Comte de Buffon at Montbard: La visite √† Buffon, ou Voyage √† Montbard. He was also the author of a philosophical work published after his death, Th√©orie de l'ambition. Despite his upbringing, H√©rault became an early proponent of Revolutionary ideas, and took part in the storming of the Bastille in July 1789. In December 1790 he was appointed judge of the court of the 1st arrondissement in the d√©partement of Paris.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.188 From the end of January to April 1791, H√©rault was absent on a mission in Alsace, where he had been sent to restore order following a period of civil unrest and to enforce the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Here he received death-threats.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.208 On his return he was appointed Commissaire du Roi in the Cour de cassation.

He also served as a member of several committees; during his time as a member of the diplomatic committee, on 11 June 1793, he presented a memorable report demanding that the nation should be declared to be in danger. During and after the 10 August 1792 insurrection, he worked alongside Georges Danton, one of the organizers and leading figures of this rising and, on 2 September, was appointed president of the Legislative Assembly. In 1792, he was elected to the National Convention as deputy for the d√©partement of Seine-et-Oise, and was sent on a mission to organize the new d√©partement of Mont Blanc. He was thus absent during the trial of King Louis XVI, but he made it known that he approved of his execution. 1793‚Äì1794 On his return to Paris, H√©rault was several times president of the Convention, notably on 2 June 1793, the occasion of the attack on the Girondins (when he unsuccessfully pleaded for the troops to retreat),Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.341 and on 10 August 1793, on which was celebrated the passing of the Acte constitutionnel (called \\"of The Mountain\\"); H√©rault de Sechelles served, alongside Louis de Saint-Just, as one of the writers and redactors of the 1793 Constitution, which was fated never to be applied. H√©rault was a member of the Reign of Terror's Committee of Public Safety, to which he was elected on 13 June 1793.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.344 He was chiefly concerned with diplomacy, and from October to December 1793 was employed on a diplomatic and military mission in Alsace. This mission made him an object of suspicion to the other members of the Committee. H√©rault, whose aristocratic background was also accounted a source of suspicion, was accused of collusion with foreign agents, amounting to treason by Bourdon de l'Oise on 16 December 1793. He responded by offering his resignation from the Committee of Public Safety, but this was refused.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.398 However the following Spring brought further accusations against him of collusion with counter-revolutionaries, and he was also embroiled in the scandal around the dissolution of the East India Company.Chronicle of the French Revolution, Longman 1989 p.409 He was tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and condemned alongside Danton, Fran√ßois Joseph Westermann, Camille Desmoulins, and Pierre Philippeaux.

It is a structural analogue of acetic acid with all three of the acetyl group‚Äôs hydrogen atoms replaced by fluorine atoms and is a colorless liquid with a vinegar like odor. TFA is a stronger acid than acetic acid, having an acid ionisation constant that is approximately 34,000 times higher,Note: Calculated from the ratio of the Ka values for TFA (pKa = 0.23) and acetic acid (pKa = 4.76) as the highly electronegative fluorine atoms and consequent electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group weakens the oxygen-hydrogen bond (allowing for greater acidity) and stabilises the anionic conjugate base. TFA is widely used in organic chemistry for various purposes. Synthesis TFA is prepared industrially by the electrofluorination of acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting trifluoroacetyl fluoride: : + 4 ‚Üí + 3 + : + ‚Üí + Where desired, this compound may be dried by addition of trifluoroacetic anhydride. An older route to TFA proceeds via the oxidation of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,3,3-trichloropropene with potassium permanganate. The trifluorotrichloropropene can be prepared by Swarts fluorination of hexachloropropene. TFA occurs naturally in sea water, but only in small concentrations (‚â§200 ng/L). Uses TFA is the precursor to many other fluorinated compounds such as trifluoroacetic anhydride, trifluoroperacetic acid, and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. It is a reagent used in organic synthesis because of a combination of convenient properties: volatility, solubility in organic solvents, and its strength as an acid. TFA is also less oxidizing than sulfuric acid but more readily available in anhydrous form than many other acids. One complication to its use is that TFA forms an azeotrope with water (b. p. 105 ¬∞C). TFA is popularly used as a strong acid to remove t-butyl derived side-chain protecting groups in Fmoc peptide synthesis, and in other organic syntheses to remove the t-butoxycarbonyl protecting group. At a low concentration, TFA is used as an ion pairing agent in liquid chromatography (HPLC) of organic compounds, particularly peptides and small proteins. TFA is a versatile solvent for NMR spectroscopy (for materials stable in acid). It is also used as a calibrant in mass spectrometry. TFA is used to produce trifluoroacetate salts.  Implication in anaesthesia  TFA is a metabolic breakdown product of the volatile anaesthetic agent halothane. It is thought to be responsible for halothane induced hepatitis. Safety Trifluoroacetic acid is a corrosive acid but it does not pose the hazards associated with hydrofluoric acid because the carbon-fluorine bond is not labile. Only if heated or treated with ultrasonic waves will it decompose into hydrofluoric acid. TFA is harmful when inhaled, causes severe skin burns and is toxic for aquatic organisms even at low concentrations. TFA's reaction with bases and metals, especially light metals, is strongly exothermic. The reaction with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) results in an explosion.Safety data sheet for Trifluoroacetic acid (PDF) from EMD Millipore, revision date 10/27/2014.

Nubkheperre Intef is one of the best attested kings of the 17th dynasty who restored numerous damaged temples in Upper Egypt as well as constructing a new temple at Gebel Antef. The best preserved building from his reign is the remains of a small chapel at Koptos. Four walls that have been reconstructed show the king in front of Min and show him crowned by Horus and by another god. The reliefs are executed in raised and sunken relief.Reconstruction of the walls on Digital Egypt At Koptos, the Coptos Decree was found on a stela which referred to the actions of Nubkheperre Intef against Teti, son of Minhotep.W. M. Petrie Flinders: Koptos, London 1896, Pl.8 At Abydos, several stone fragments were found, including columns which attest to some kind of restoration work.W.M.F. Petrie: Abydos I. EEF Memoir 22.

XXXII, 3-4 On a stela found at Abydos, a mention is made of a House of Intef. This most likely refers to a building belonging to Nubkheperre Intef.W.M.F. Petrie: Abydos I. EEF Memoir 22. London 1902, pp. 28, 41-2, pl. LVII Therefore, while Nubkheperre Intef's highest‚Äîand only known‚Äîyear date is his Year 3 on the Koptos stela, this must be considered an underestimate since he must have ruled much longer to accomplish his ambitious building program and also complete his royal tomb.Ryholt, p.204 Indeed, Nubkheperre Intef is alone \\"mentioned on over twenty contemporary monuments\\" from his reignJanine Bourriau, \\"The Second Intermediate Period (c.1650-1550 BC)\\" in Ian Shaw (ed.) The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press, 2000. p.204 which demonstrates his position as one of the most powerful rulers of the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt. Nubkheperre Intef's timeline and tomb robbery Both Kim Ryholt and the German Egyptologist Daniel Polz concur that this pharaoh did not rule at or near the start of the 17th dynasty but rather late into the 17th dynasty just prior to the final three known kings of this dynasty (Senakhtenre, Seqenenre and Kamose.)Thomas Schneider, \\"The Relative Chronology of the Middle Kingdom...\\" p.187 Ryholt, however, in his 1997 reconstruction of the sequence of 17th dynasty rulers felt that a king Sobekemsaf intervened between the last Intef king and Senakhtenre.Ryholt, pp.170-171 & 272 whereas in more contemporary literature, Detlef Franke rejects this view (below) and argues that there is no space for a king Sobekemsaf to intervene in the space after Nubkheperre Intef. \\"Contrary to Ryholt, I see no place for a king Sobekemsaf who ruled after Nubkheperra Antef. Nubkheperra Antef (c.1560 BC) is the best attested (from Abydos to Edfu, e.g. BM 631, EA 1645, coffin 6652) and [the] most important of the three Antefs.\\"Detlef Franke, The Late Middle Kingdom (Thirteenth to Seventeenth Dynasties): The Chronological Framework, Journal of Egyptian History, Vol.1 No.2 (2008) Koninklijke Brill, p.279 Polz, in his 2007 book, places Sekhemre- Heruhirmaat Intef as a short-lived king between the reigns of Nubkheperre Intef and Senakhtenre Ahmose‚Äîthe first ruler of the Ahmoside family of kings.Polz, Der Beginn des Neuen Reichs, p.50 Nubkheperre Intef's tomb was originally penetrated by tomb robbers in 1827 but some of its treasures made it into the hands of Western collectors; his unique rishi style coffin was purchased by the British Museum from the Henry Salt collection where its catalogue number is EA 6652.Coffin of King Nubkheperra Intef His tomb was later found by early Egyptologists around 1881 but knowledge of its location was lost again until it was rediscovered in 2001 by German scholars. The coffin of Nubkheperre Intef was reportedly found in his tomb complete with a diadem or crown, some bows and arrows, and the heart-scarab of a king Sobekemsaf.I.E.S. Edwards in P. Posener-Kri√©ger (ed.), M√©langes Gamal Eddin Mokhtar I, (Cairo, 1985) p.239 Tomb rediscovery A royal crown believed to have originated from Nubkheperre Intef's Dra' Abu el-Naga' tomb now located in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden of the Netherlands. Nubkheperre Intef's tomb was rediscovered by Daniel Polz, the deputy director of the German Archaeological Institute in 2001.

He and his brother shared many common traits: each very strong, ardent Free Methodists, and great sporting shooters‚Äî-a skill that brought him many trophies. In his mid-twenties, Bullock immigrated to America. He began working in the Black Hills of South Dakota first as a miner, and then as a bullion guard for the Homestake Mine, which at that time was owned by Senator George Hearst, father of William Randolph Hearst. A bullion guard is somebody who protects gold shipments being transported by stagecoach. Around the age of 35, Bullock began to achieve fame. It is claimed that Bullock had a part in the death of Black Hills outlaw Cornelius Donahue (also known as \\"Lame Johnny\\"), although some sources dispute this.

Having originally been produced only as a coach chassis, the B10M was made available as a city bus, in which form it was also very popular. It was available as B10M-46, B10M-50, B10M-55, B10M-60, B10M-62, B10M-65 and B10M-70, where the number represents the wheelbase in decimetres. Many bodybuilders did however shorten or extend the chassis to fit their needs. No later than 1981 a tri-axle chassis was introduced, available as B10M-50B, B10M-55B, B10M-60B, B10M-65B and B10M-70B, with some bodybuilders extending them up to 7.25 metres wheelbase. =Citybus (B10MD/D10M)= A double-decker version of the B10M was developed for Strathclyde PTE in 1981. It was launched in early 1982, with a downrated engine from the coach, and was named Citybus (also known unofficially as B10MD or D10M). Most early examples were bodied by Alexander Coachbuilders, who provided a modified version - common to all Volvo double-deck chassis bodied by the company after 1980 - of their popular and attractive R type bodywork. Eastern Scottish and Fife Scottish bought many of these early versions in 1985-1987. Two were exported in 1984, one of them to Singapore Bus Service and the other to Kowloon Motor Bus, but was destroyed by fire in 1988. The Citybus lasted until the end of B10M production but fell out of favour after Volvo re- engineered the Leyland Olympian as the Volvo Olympian in 1993.Volvo power for Olympian Commercial Motor 27 February 1992 =B9M= The B9M was launched in 1982 as a light-weight, stripped-down, budget version of the standard B10M. It was available as B9M-46, B9M-50, B9M-55 and B9M-60. Although technically not a successor to the B57, it found more or less the same place in the markets where it was available. The B9M had the same 9.6-litre engine as the B10M, but at lower outputs. It sold well in the Nordic countries, with the exception of Denmark, where only a few were sold. The model was available at least past 1996. In the United Kingdom, the B9M-46 was sold as a shorter 9.5 to 9.7 metre version of the B10M from 1985.Midi Volvo on sale Commercial Motor 24 August 1985 =B10MT and B10T= From 1984, a RHD version of the B10M-55B was available as the B10MT, later also B10T. =C10M and B10M-C= In 1984, Swiss bodybuilder Ramseier & Jenzer collaborated with Volvo to unveil a semi- integral coach known as the C10M, with the engine in the middle of the chassis. Production of the C10M was ended in 1987, but the position of the engine was still available as an option and became known as B10M-C. United Kingdom Coach operators National Express, Park's of Hamilton, Shearings and Wallace Arnold all purchased large quantities of B10Ms.Shearings builds up Commercial Motor 13 December 1990 In the 1990s, Stagecoach standardised on the bus version of the B10M as their full-size single decker. Most received Alexander PS bodies but some received Northern Counties Paladin bodywork. Stagecoach also took numerous examples of the coach version with Plaxton's Interurban bodywork and Jonckheere's Modulo bodywork. South Yorkshire Transport and Kelvin Central Buses also purchased large numbers of the type with Alexander PS bodies. The B10MA articulated variant was of limited popularity among bus operators in the UK. British Caledonian Airways took four in 1988, the next examples sold in Britain were supplied eight years later, with the delivery of four to Ulsterbus. Stagecoach was the biggest customer for the model in the UK, purchasing 18 in the mid- to late-1990s, with the last delivered in 1999. Singapore Singapore Bus Service evaluated a mid- engine Volvo B10MD double-decker bus bodied by East Lancashire Coachbuilders registered as SBS4961B in 1984. No further double-deck B10MD units were acquired however. A second B10M demonstrator, SBS9C, was an air-conditioned single-deck bus bodied by Van Hool and was acquired in 1986. It was also the only Volvo B10M Mark I acquired by SBS and it was sold to an operator in New Zealand by the end of the 1990s. Singapore Bus Service (SBS Transit) purchased 977 units between 1988 and 2000, making up a large part of its single-decker bus fleet. The Volvo B10M Mark IIs were the first to be used, with 200 delivered between March 1988 and April 1989. They were retired by May 2008 after fulfilling their 19-year lifespan, except one which was sold to New Zealand. The Mark IIs were replaced by Scania K230UB Euro 4 and the Volvo B10BLE CNG. 300 B10M Mark IIIs were delivered between November 1992 and June 1993. They were bodied by Duple Metsec, and had received mid-life refurbishment. Most units received a two-year lifespan extension due to insufficient replacement buses, and were all retired by June 2012. 475 B10M Mark IVs were delivered between June 1995 and December 2000. They were bodied by either Duple Metsec or Walter Alexander Strider. Mid-life refurbishments extended their lifespan by two years, and 30 DM3500-bodied buses received another one-year extension in 2017 due to insufficient replacement buses. All these buses have been retired as of 23 December 2018. A 14.5m B10M Superlong tri-axle bus, bodied by Duple Metsec, was purchased in 1995 (UITP Congress 1995) and retired in October 2012. A 19m B10MA articulated bus, also bodied by Duple Metsec, was purchased in 1996. It was known as \\"Asia's Longest Bus\\". In 2006, it was sold to Bayes Coachlines in New Zealand. Japan For Expo '85 in Tsukuba, Fuji Heavy Industries bodied 100 B10MLs. Seventy-nine were exported to Australia in 1986 with Brisbane Transport, Busways, Grenda's Bus Service, Hornibrook Bus Lines, Invicta Bus Service, Kangaroo Bus Lines, Metro- link Bus Lines, Metropolitan Transit Authority, Premier Roadliners, Sunbury Bus Service and Surfside Buslines purchasing examples.\\"Tsukuba Expo Volvos in Australia\\" Australian Bus Panorama issue 6/1 July 1990 pages 3-8 United States From 1983 to 1986, a number of B10Ms were built and used in the United States. The American B10M was manufactured mostly in its articulated form (which was purchased by SEPTA, SamTrans, and New Jersey Transit) though a standard length B10M model was made for the RIPTA with one example going to SEPTA as compensation for delays. Canadian production of the B10MA articulated bus under licence to Ontario Bus Industries nearly took place, however it fell through when that company negotiated a more favorable deal with Ikarus Bus. Australia In Australia, the B10M was purchased by government operators Adelaide Metro, Brisbane Transport and Metro Tasmania,Bus Fleet Lists Brisbane Transport BusesMetro Tasmania Australian Bus Fleet Lists as well as private operators, with large fleets built up in Sydney by Busways and Westbus,Busways Australian Bus Fleet ListsCDC Group NSW Australian Bus Fleet Lists and in Melbourne by Grenda Corporation and Sita Buslines.Ventura Group Australian Bus Fleet ListsSita Bus Lines Australian Bus Fleet Lists Three-axle B10Ms were fitted with high and double decker coach bodies with AAT Kings, Ansett Pioneer, Australian Pacific Tours, Greyhound and Westbus among the buyers. New Zealand In New Zealand, two Volvo B10Ms with V√∂V bodies built by Coachwork International were ordered by Auckland Regional Council in 1985. These are the only Volvo buses to receive the VoV body.Volvo B10M Buses & Coaches Omnibus Society of New Zealand In 1996, 5 ex-Hong Kong Stagecoach Volvo B10Ms were sold to New Zeleand from Hong Kong because of disposal in Hong Kong residential bus services. Belgium At least 168 B10M and B10MA buses were purchased by Belgian operators (SNCV / NMVB, TEC and De Lijn). They were fitted with carbodies built by Belgian manufacturers : Van Hool (, ), Jonckheere (TransCity, 056, , , ) and a few had a Dutch Hainje/Berkhof , or a Berkhof Excellence 500 body. In Belgium, most of the buses on B10BMA chassis were owned by public operators while the B10B buses belonged to private leasers, working on contract with these operators. While most of these buses are now withdrawn in Belgium, De Lijn still owns some articulated Jonckheere Transit 2000 G. Greece An articulated B10M in Patras, Greece The articulated version of the B10M constructed by Saracakis under the name \\"Alexandros\\" in 1993, 1995 and 1997. All the buses were ordered by Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organization (ŒüŒëŒ£Œò) in Thessaloniki, Greece. * 1993 version was featured with steering in the rear axle. * The 1995 and 1997 are facelift versions and the chassis on the rear part was changed. In Thessaloniki 44 buses (1997 version) still in use but OASTH fitted them with modern telematics GPS tracking systems. The older versions were recycled and some of buses were sold to Astiko Ktel Patron (the transport organization of Patras), and are still (Q3 2015) in use in the city of Patras, Greece. They operate routes connecting the outskirts of Patras to the city center and the city center to the University of Patras in Rion. In 2015, all the Astiko Ktel Patron buses were fitted with GPS tracking systems for use with modern real time bus arrival boards at the bus stops and a mobile application. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, there were total of 3 bus companies has bought Volvo B10M to their fleets. The Citybus company (CTB) has ordered 10 Volvo B10Ms with VanHool bodied and THD101GD engine fitted between 1990-1992 for their border- crossing service between Hong Kong and Mainland China. In 1997, CTB has ordered 2 more Volvo B10Ms with China Volvo bus bodied and DH10A engine fitted into their border fleet. After the closure of border-crossing service, those B10Ms has been sold to private tourist bus companies in Hong Kong. All ex-CTB B10Ms has disposed in 2009. The KCRC company has ordered 15 Volvo B10Ms in 1995 for replacing second-handed MCW Metrobus fleet, with Northern Counties bodied, ZF4HP500 gearbox and Volvo THD102KF engine fitted. These buses also fitted with Lazzerini chairs inside the interior. All ex-KCRC B10Ms has sold to the MTR company because of the merge of mass railways service in Hong Kong in late 2007, MTR has repainted into new fleet color in 2008. All KCRC(MTR) B10Ms has disposed in 2012 because of incoming ADL Enviro500 11.3m fleet. In 1994, the Stagecoach company Hong Kong has ordered 5 B10Ms with Alexander PS bodied and THD101GC engine fitted, these B10Ms were serviced at private house estates residential services in Hong Kong operated by Stagecoach company. But in 1996, Stagecoach company Hong Kong has closed, these Volvo B10Ms were sold to New Zealand afterwards. Replacement The B10M as a single-deck bus was complemented (and was largely replaced) by the low-floor rear-engined B10L and B10BLE chassis in some markets in the late 1990s. In 2001 the B10M was replaced by the B12M, sporting a larger 12.1-litre engine and the engine position of the C10M/B10M-C.

This chronic neurological disorder involves a single nerve‚Äîthe lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, which is also called the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (and hence the syndrome lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy).IASP, XXXI: LOCAL SYNDROMES IN THE LEG OR FOOT: PAIN OF NEUROLOGICAL ORIGIN , 2012 The term \\"meralgia paraesthetica\\" combines four Greek roots to mean \\"thigh pain with anomalous perception\\". The disorder has also been nicknamed skinny pants syndrome, in reference to a rise in teenagers wearing skin-tight trousers.  Signs and symptoms  * Pain on the outer side of the thigh, occasionally extending to the outer side of the knee, usually constant. * A burning sensation, tingling, or numbness in the same area * Multiple bee-sting like pains in the affected area * Occasionally, aching in the groin area or pain spreading across the buttocks * Usually more sensitive to light touch than to firm pressure * Hyper sensitivity to heat (warm water from shower feels like it is burning the area) * Occasionally, patients may complain of itching or a bothersome sensation rather than pain in the affected area. The entire distribution of the nerve is rarely affected. Usually, the unpleasant sensation(s) affect only part of the skin supplied by the nerve. Cause  Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh and other structures passing between the left inguinal ligament and ilium, frontolateral view of the right side of the pelvis. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve most often becomes injured by entrapment or compression where it passes between the upper front hip bone (ilium) and the inguinal ligament near the attachment at the anterior superior iliac spine (the upper point of the hip bone). Less commonly, the nerve may be entrapped by other anatomical or abnormal structures, or damaged by diabetic or other neuropathy or trauma such as from seat belt injury in an accident. The nerve may become painful over a period of time as weight gain makes underwear, belting or the waistband of pants gradually exert higher levels of pressure. Pain may be acute and radiate into the rib cage, and into the groin, thigh, and knee. Alternately, weight loss or aging may remove protective fat layers under the skin, so the nerve can compress against underwear, outer clothing, and‚Äîmost commonly‚Äî by belting. Long periods of standing or leg exercise that increases tension on the inguinal ligament may also cause pressure. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh can occasionally be damaged during laparoscopic hernia repair, or scarring from the operation can lead to meralgia paraesthetica.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is largely based on patient description and relevant details about recent surgeries, hip injuries, or repetitive activities that could irritate the nerve. Examination checks for sensory differences between the affected leg and the other leg. Accurate diagnosis may require an abdominal and pelvic examination to exclude problems in those areas. Electromyographic (EMG) nerve-conduction studies may be required. X-rays may be needed to exclude bone abnormalities that might put pressure on the nerve; likewise CT or MRI scans to exclude soft tissue causes such as a tumor.  Treatment  Treatment varies. In most cases, the best treatment is to remove the cause of compression by modifying patient behavior, in combination with medical treatment to relieve inflammation and pain. Whatever the cause, typical treatment takes several weeks to months‚Äîdepending on the degree of nerve damage. Typical treatment options include: * Active Release Technique (ART) soft tissue treatment * Wearing looser clothing and suspenders rather than belts * Weight loss if obesity is present *Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammatory pain if pain level limits motion and prevents sleep * Reducing physical activity in relation to pain level. Acute pain may require absolute bed rest * Deep tissue massage to reduce tension in the gluteal muscles, most commonly the gluteus maximus. The tensor fasciae latae may also be implicated. For lower pain levels, treatment may involve having the patient: * Seek appropriate physical therapy, such as stretching and massage, which plays a large role in the management of pain * Learn to perform inguinal ligament stretching (from a physical therapist) which can rapidly relieve symptoms * Use rest periods to interrupt long periods of standing, walking, cycling, or other aggravating activity * Lose weight, and exercise to strengthen abdominal muscles * Wear clothing that is loose at the upper front hip area * Apply heat, ice, or electrical stimulationMeralgia Paresthetica * Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for 7‚Äì10 days * Remove hair in affected area (shave) * Lidocaine patches (must shave area first) * Titanium dioxide patches to interfere with the electrostatic effect of the nerves on the surface of the skin Pain may take significant time (weeks) to stop and, in some cases, numbness persists despite treatment. In severe cases, the physician might perform a local nerve block at the inguinal ligament, using a combination of local anaesthetic (lidocaine) and corticosteroids to provide relief that may last several weeks. Pain modifier drugs for neuralgic pain (such as amitriptyline, carbamazepine or gabapentin) may be tried, but are often not as helpful in the majority of patients.Meralgia Paresthetica Persistent and severe cases may require surgery to decompress the nerve or, as a last resort, to resect the nerve. The latter treatment leaves permanent numbness in the area.

This applies to cross from Latin crux, Old Irish cros overtaking Old English rood ; appearing in Welsh and Cornish as Croes, Krows.

A reason for the word Bow originating from Welsh, is due to Welsh Bowmen playing a major role in the Hundred Years War, such as the Battle of Cr√©cy, Battle of Agincourt and the Battle of Patay, and the bows were often created in Wales.https://www.sarahwoodbury.com/the- welsh-longbow/http://warbowwales.com/the-welsh-longbow/4557703062 ; coombe: meaning \\"valley\\", is usually linked with the Welsh cwm, also meaning \\"valley\\", Cornish and Breton komm.

The work, often described as a Russian Uncle Tom's Cabin, is a polemical study of the problems in the Russia of Catherine the Great: serfdom, the powers of the nobility, the issues in government and governance, social structure and personal freedom and liberty. The book starts from an epigraph about The Beast who is \\"enormous, disgusting, a-hundred-maws and barking\\" meaning the Russian Empire. The book was immediately banned and Radishchev sentenced, first to death, then to banishment in eastern Siberia. It was not freely published in Russia until 1905. In the book, Radishchev takes an imaginary journey between Russia's two principal cities; each stop along the way reveals particular problems for the traveller through the medium of story telling. In Petersburg, the narrator's story begins at an inn where the proprietor is too lazy to harness his underfed horses for a carriage. Eventually getting on the road, he encounters a man trying to sell genealogical papers to nobles seeking to increase their rank, and a poor peasant laboring on a Sunday. He goes on to satirize Catherine's favorite, Viceroy Potemkin, with an anecdote about his appetite for oysters and the absurd lengths his servant would go to get them.Lang, D.M. 1977. The First Russian Radical: Alexander Radischev. Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group. p 133 Likely the most famous scene is the narrator's dream of being a ‚Äútsar, shah, khan, king, bey, nabob, sultan, or holder of some such dignity, sitting in regal power on a throne.‚Äù At his most minor expression, the courtiers sigh, frown, light up with joy. Seeing this obsequiousness, the narrator-tsar orders the invasion of a distant country, which he is assured will submit to his mere reputation. Suddenly, the female figure of Truth appears, offering him clearsightedness and defending the rights of dissenters. After being reprimanded, the king is overcome by visions of his own brutality, the sins of his court, and the general disrepair of the empire. In a final moment of self-reproach and guilt, inspired by the gaudy and wasteful palace he's built, the narrator is woken from his dream in agitation.Lang, 139 Considered by many to be the seminal radical text of the 18th century, A Journey continued to influence Russian political thought even after its condemnation. As the progenitor of public liberal discourse in Russia, Radischev is considered an ancestor of all major subversive literature written in the 19th and 20th centuries.Yarmolinsky, Avrahm. 1959. Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism. New York: Macmillan. p 13 The book itself represented a challenge to Catherine in Russia, despite the fact that Radishchev was no revolutionary: merely an observer of the ills he saw within Russian society and government at the time. Published during the period of the French Revolution, the book borrows ideas and principles from the great philosophers of the day relating to an enlightened outlook and the concept of Natural Law.

Biography He was born at Windham Manor in Norfolk, the son of Francis Southwell, an auditor of the exchequer, and Dorothy (n√©e Tendring). He was the eldest brother of Robert Southwell. Richard's father died in 1512, and he inherited the estate.on 2 September 1512 Less than two years lateron 30 March 1514 he was also to inherit the estate of his uncle Sir Robert Southwall who had served as chief butler to Henry VII. In 1515 he became the ward of his uncle's widow and William Wootton. In 1519 Thomas Wyndham acquired the wardship. Wyndham married Southwell to his stepdaughter Thomasin, who was the daughter of Roger Darcy of Danbury in Essex and sister of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Chiche. They had a daughter. He later married Mary, the daughter of Thomas Darcy of Danbury, and the widow of Robert Leeche of Norwich, Norfolk. They had one legitimate daughter and two illegitimate sons (including Richard Southwell alias Darcy) and two illegitimate daughters. In 1526 he entered Lincoln's Inn. He became tutor to Gregory Cromwell, son of Thomas. For some period Gregory lived with Southwell in Woodrising Manor in Norfolk, which Southwell had inherited from his uncle. In 1531 Southwell became a Justice of the Peace for Norfolk and Suffolk. In the same year, he was involved in the murder of Sir William Pennington and the following year he paid a fine of ¬£1000 to obtain a pardon. From 1534 to 1535, Southwell was High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. It was in 1536 that his portrait was painted by Hans Holbein the Younger. He was a witness in the trial of Sir Thomas More, where he claimed not to have heard the details of the damning conversation between Richard Rich and the accused. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1539 as knight of the shire for Norfolk and knighted in 1540. After the death of James V of Scotland, Southwell went to Edinburgh in January 1543 to negotiate with the Scottish lords. Southwell was a principal accuser of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, who was arrested in December 1546 on charges (very likely trumped up) of threatening the succession of Prince Edward by displaying the lions of England in his personal coat of arms. Following the arrest of Surrey's father, Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, Southwell was one of three royal commissioners (along with Sir John Gates and Wymond Carew) sent to seize and inventory the Howards' possessions.Although Gates was the principal author, Southwell assisted him in inventorying Norfolk's mansion at Kenninghall as well as Surrey's house at St. Leonard's, Norwich. The manuscript inventory is National Archives (Kew) LR 2/117, with LR 2/116 and 115 accompanying follow-up accounts. He was one of the assistants to the executors of the will of Henry VIII. Southwell was one of the signatories of The Will of King Edward the Sixth, and His Devise for the Succession to the Crown. He was appointed to the Privy Council on 12 March 1547, although he was removed from the full council the following year. He was reappointed by Mary I of England. Southwell was described as the driving force behind the plan to marry Elizabeth I of England to Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon. He was re-elected to represent Norfolk again in 1542, 1553 and twice in 1554. He was Master of the Armoury from 1554 to 1559.

There will therefore be little difficulty in prosecuting as theft situations where the stolen car is later sold (sometimes through a process of 'ringing' i.e. its identity is changed and forged documents of title produced) or broken for spare parts, because the evidence of an intent permanently to deprive is clear. But the twoccing situation usually describes joyriding where all that is intended is an unauthorised use for a short period of time. Alternatively, it covers situations where a vehicle is taken for the purposes of another offence, e.g. it is to be used to escape after a bank robbery and then abandoned. This offence is an alternative verdict under section 12(4) which provides: =Elements of the offence= Taking There must be some positive movement of the vehicle. Simply rolling it forwards or backwards a few metres is not sufficient (if someone parks their car so close to yours that they make it impossible to drive your vehicle, it is permissible to move their vehicle a few feet to extricate yours) but, equally, it is not necessary that the engine be started. Releasing the brake and allowing the vehicle to run down a hill would be sufficient, as would driving the vehicle for a short distance. The taking may also be a material unauthorised use. For example, if a person hires a car to drive from London to Birmingham, but actually drives it to Liverpool, that will be a taking. The conveyance need not have anyone in it at the time of the taking; merely being a conveyance is sufficient. A conveyance To be a conveyance, the vehicle must have been constructed or adapted to carry a driver (and others, depending on the design) whether by land, water or air (so it includes a hovercraft). Pedal cycles are excluded from section 12(1), but are covered by section 12(5) with reduced penalties, except for one constructed or adapted only for use under the control of a person not carried in or on it. Without the consent of the owner If the vehicle is taken with the owner's knowledge, the owner has consented. But apparent consent can be ignored if obtained by a deception, e.g. giving a false identity when hiring a car. This overlaps with the section 15 offence of obtaining property or services by deception. Taking by force may be robbery when the defendant did not intend the victim to recover the vehicle at all or so seriously damaged it that such conduct amounts to a theft (see section 6). If the evidence is insufficient for theft, the alternative charges are aggravated vehicle taking or blackmail under section 21. Note that section 12(7) protects the interests of people hiring or buying under a hire purchase agreement by deeming them to be the owner for the purposes of section 12. Mens rea The defendant must know that the vehicle has been taken without the owner's consent, and that the accused has either driven the vehicle or been a passenger. Statutory defence This is a statutory version of the so- called claim of right defence which represents an exception to the general rule that ignorantia juris non excusat, i.e. a limited mistake of law defence. Thus, section 12(6) allows a defence where the defendant believes that he has the lawful authority to do it or that he would have the owner's consent if the owner knew of his doing it and the circumstances of it. So, for example, if a vehicle was moved a short distance because it was causing an obstruction, those moving it might reasonably believe that they have lawful authority to remove the obstruction. =Attempt= Because section 12 is a summary only offence, there can be no attempt, so anticipatory acts are an offence of vehicle interference contrary to section 9 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. The defendant must interfere with the vehicle or a trailer or anything in or on it. Merely touching the vehicle would not be enough. There must be some positive effort made to enter or affect it, and an intention to take or steal it. =Aggravated vehicle taking= The offence of aggravated vehicle-taking was created by the Aggravated Vehicle-Taking Act 1992, which amended the Theft Act 1968 to address the issue of joyriding. It is committed if a person commits an offence under section 12(1) of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to a mechanically propelled vehicle and it is proved that at any time after the vehicle was unlawfully taken (whether by that person or another) and before it was recovered, the vehicle was driven, or death, injury or damage was caused, in one or more the circumstances listed in section 12A(2): :(a) that the vehicle was driven dangerously on a road or other public place; :(b) that, owing to the driving of the vehicle, an accident occurred by which injury was caused to any person; :(c) that, owing to the driving of the vehicle, an accident occurred by which damage was caused to any property, other than the vehicle; :(d) that damage was caused to the vehicle. There are two offences: under section 12A(2)(b) where an accident results in the death of another (maximum 14-year sentence), and the less serious version under the other three headings (maximum two years sentence). In R v Marcus Leon Ashley Forbes (2005) EWCA Crim 2069, the defendant was seen to take a car and then engaged in a high-speed car chase with the police. The judge at first instance described the defendant as a menace, having driven in ways that could so easily have killed wholly innocent road users while disqualified, while released on licence having been convicted of other aggravated TWOC offences, and while \\"out of his head\\" on ecstasy. He had a long track record of convictions. The judge imposed the maximum consecutive sentences for aggravated taking and driving while disqualified. According to R v March (2002) 2 Cr App R (S) 448, credit should be given for a guilty plea and Forbes felt a keen sense of injustice that he had been given the maximum sentence. The Court of Appeal confirmed the consecutive element of the sentence but felt that there was no overwhelming public policy justification for awarding the maximum sentence. Accordingly, a reduction was made to 22 months' detention in a young offender institution. Northern Ireland The offence of taking without consent exists in Northern Ireland under article 172 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. Scotland A similar offence known as taking and driving away exists in Scotland. It is an offence under section 178 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to take and drive away a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner or, knowing the vehicle has been taken, to drive it or be carried in it. The offence is intended to be used where a motor vehicle is taken, driven away and later abandoned. Where the vehicle is abandoned in a place where it is unlikely to be found the common law offence of theft is the more appropriate charge. Where police trace the vehicle and it is still in the possession of the person who took the vehicle is would also be more appropriate to charge the person with theft.

He also was the past owner of the Rainfair Company, which made protective footwear. He has also been a director of Gaylord Entertainment Company, owner of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. =Hockey team ownership= Leipold first was considered a potential owner or investor in the NBA Milwaukee Bucks and Sacramento Kings teams. He attributed this interest to the fact that he knew the sport of basketball well. He became interested in ownership of a professional ice hockey franchise because there were more opportunities than in basketball. Leipold bought an expansion franchise from the NHL in 1997 for $80 million. He sold the Nashville Predators due to rising operating costs and low fan attendance. Leipold claims more than $70 million in losses during his tenure as owner of the Predators. Initially, Leipold had an agreement to sell the team to Jim Balsillie for $220 million, but he withdrew from the agreement after Balsillie started season ticket advertising for a move of the team to Hamilton, Ontario. The Predators were sold instead to an investor group that included William J. \\"Boots\\" Del Biaggio. The final sale price of the Predators was reported as $193 million. Leipold has gone on record objecting to Jim Balsillie becoming an NHL owner, stating that he doesn't trust Balsillie. Leipold's purchase of the Minnesota Wild from founding owner Bob Naegele, Jr. was announced on January 10, 2008. Leipold had this to say about his newest acquisition, \\"It is a true privilege to become part of the organization and the hockey community in Minnesota.\\" Fans of the Minnesota Wild had already begun welcoming Leipold as the new owner via the team's message board.

It lies on the Huddersfield Line managed by Northern but also now served by Grand Central and is north east from . The platforms have an unusual configuration. Platforms 1 and 2 form an island platform on the western side of the bridge over Station Road/Hopton New Road. Trains from Platform 1 go to Leeds and Wakefield Westgate (eastbound); Platform 2 is rarely used for normal scheduled services but is passed by non-stopping westbound trains to Huddersfield. Platform 3 is a side platform on the eastern side of the bridge; trains are towards Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford Interchange and (westbound). The train to Leeds takes around 25 minutes and to reach Huddersfield takes around 10 minutes.  History  Eastbound empties west of Mirfield in 1950 Eastbound empties passing Mirfield Station in 1964 Overall roof being demolished, October 1977 The town received its first railway in 1840, when the Manchester and Leeds Railway opened the first section of its cross-Pennine main line between Normanton and Hebden Bridge (completing it through to Manchester on 1 March 1841). It did not actually get a station though until April 1845, when the company opened one shortly before submitting plans to Parliament to build a branch line from the town along the Spen Valley to Bradford via Cleckheaton. Approval was granted for the route the following year and it was opened as far as on 12 July 1848 and through to Bradford two years later. By this time further lines had been opened from nearby Heaton Lodge Junction to Huddersfield by the Huddersfield & Manchester Railway (opened on 3 August 1847) and from Thornhill to Leeds by the Leeds, Dewsbury & Manchester Railway (opened 18 September 1848). The LNWR (which had absorbed both the H&M; and LD&M; by 1849) had originally planned to build its own route through Mirfield, but after negotiations with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (successors to the M&L;) agreed to not to go ahead in return for the granting of running powers over the Thornhill to Heaton Lodge section (and also allowing the L&Y; access to Huddersfield). This meant that the railway passing through the town soon became extremely congested, carrying as it did the traffic on two main trunk routes between Manchester and Leeds (the Huddersfield & Manchester company having completed its route through Stalybridge in August 1849) and it led to the station gaining a notorious reputation for delays. This persisted even after the Heaton Lodge - Thornhill section was quadrupled in 1884, and it was not until the LNWR opened an alternative Huddersfield to Leeds route at the turn of the century that the situation began to improve. To facilitate interchange, a new station was built to the east of the original; the contract for the station (excluding roof) was placed on 25 May 1864, the roof contract being placed on 26 April 1865. The new station centred on a large island platform with overall roof, and facilities included a hotel, buffet and billiard room; it opened on 5 March 1866. Today the station remains busy, despite the loss of the Spen Valley service to Bradford from 14 June 1965 and the links to Normanton and on 5 January 1970 (the line via also closed at the same time, but this reopened in 2000 for peak hour services). It has also lost its buildings to demolition (in the mid-1980s) and one of its four tracks but gained the aforementioned third platform as part of a set of capacity improvements in the late 1980s. Facilities The station is unstaffed and has a ticket machine available on the platform. Digital display screens, timetable posters and automated announcements provide train running information. Shelters are provided on each platform, but only platform 3 has step-free access (from the station car park).

Distant Proximities: Dynamics Beyond Globalization. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003. pp. 237. Print. She is also the leader of Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha, a social movement that has been agitating since 2001 for redistribution of land to the landless tribal people in Kerala. The movement has positioned itself under the aegis of the Dalit-Adivasi Action Council. In 2016, she announced a new political party, Janathipahya Rashtriya Sabha, and contested the 2016 Kerala assembly polls in alliance with BJP, as a part of NDA from Sultanbathery unsuccessfully. The JRS left the NDA in 2018. Biography Janu was born in chekot, near Mananthavady, a tribal village, in Wayanad to poor tribal parents from Ravula community, called Adiya due to their historical background, one of the several tribal groups in Kerala who used to be indentured labourers. Adiya literally means slave and are mostly landless agricultural labourers. She did not have any formal education but learned to read and write through a literacy campaign that was conducted in Wayanad.Kumar, N Vinoth. Tale of a tribal struggle for land. March 12, 2013. The New Indian Express Janu started her career as a domestic servant at a local school teacher's house, at the age of seven, and spent five years there. By the age of 13, she started working as a labourer for a daily wage of Indian Rupess 2 (3.5 US cents). Later, she learned tailoring and started a small shop, which had to be closed down due to financial constraints.C K Janu: 'Experience is my guide' C K Janu was influenced by her uncle P K Kalan, a member of Communist Party of India (Marxist), and became a part of the left party. She became an activist through Kerala State Karshaka Thozhilali Union (KSKTU), associated with the Communist Party of India in the 1970s, who led a tribal uprising in Tirunelli forest in Wyanad, and speaking out from personal experience soon became identified as the voice of tribal people. She worked as a campaigner for the Union until 1987 when she quit the party, disillusioned because she felt the party was less interested in the cause of the tribal people.[4] She then embarked on a tribal tour to understand their problems and to mobilise them for struggle.[3] Kudil ketti samarm Janu's stint with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) helped her to gain experience in party politics. In 2001, Janu led a protest march through the state and held a kudil ketti samaram in front of the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram to demand land for landless tribal people which lasted 48 days and resulted in convincing Kerala Government to distribute land to the tribal people.  Muthanga incident  On February 19, 2003, Janu also led the occupation of land at Muthanga.The Hindu : Janu, Geetanandan arrested The occupation ended with massive police violence in which a policeman and a tribal were killed.The Hindu : Two killed as tribals, police clash It came to be known as the Muthanga incident and Janu had to undergo imprisonment and face 75 cases filed against her. The Muthanga incident refers to an incident of police firing on the tribal people in the Muthanga village of Wayanad. On 19 February 2003, the tribal people had gathered under Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha (AGMS) to protest the Kerala government's delay in allotting them land, which had been contracted in October 2001. During the protest, Kerala police fired 18 rounds resulting in two immediate fatalities (one of which was a police officer). In a subsequent statement, the government placed the official death toll at five. A video of the firing was aired on several television news programs and prompted noted author, Arundhati Roy, into writing You have blood on your hands. The agitation was deemed a success as, according to Janu, nearly 10,000 tribal families have received land following the 2001 agreement and over 4,000 hectares of land including the Aralam Farm land in Kannur district has been assigned to the landless Adivasis.  Aralam protests  After the Muthanga agitation, Janu shifted her concentration onto occupying land at Aralam farm, a huge cooperative farm that the government had promised to distribute amongst landless tribal people. Janu is sometimes described as the first 'organic' leader of tribal people in Keralahttp://www.drustvo- antropologov.si/AN/PDF/2011_2/ and holds status among notable women politicians in Kerala such as KR Gowriamma and Kunnikkal Ajitha. She is reported to be devoid of abstract political dogmas. She has often cooperated with national and international indigenous people's organisations but was always very wary of being funded by any organisation. Most of the activities of the Adivasi Gothra Maha Sabha are funded entirely through the solidarity of poor tribal people and former untouchables.  Mother Forest: The Unfinished Story of CK Janu  An autobiography, a small book consisting of only 56 pages, 'Janu: The Life Story of CK Janu, was published in Malayalam by DC Books in 2003. The book was later translated into English by N Ravi Shankar under the name, Mother Forest: The Unfinished Story of CK Janu. Personal life C K Janu is a single mother. The tribal leader adopted a three-year-old daughter from Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh and named her as C K Janaki. The mother and daughter stay at Panavally with Janu's mother and sister.

The Kumbum holds a vast number of images of deities throughout its structure with Vajradhara (Sanskrit:VajradhƒÅra, Tibetan: rdo rje 'chang (Dorje Chang), English: Vajraholder), the cosmic Buddha, at the top. :\\"The lhakangs of the nine levels of the Kummbumm, decreasing in number at each level, are structured according to the compendium of Sakya tantras called Drubtab Kantu. Thus each lhakang and each level creates a mandala, and the entire Kumbum represents a three- dimensional path to the Buddha's enlightenment in terms of increasingly subtle tantric mandalas.\\"Dowman, Keith. 1988.

Ward, trans. The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler: A Contemporary Account (1324). Asheville, N.C.: Pegasus Press, 2004. She fled the country, but her servant Petronilla de Meath was flogged and burned to death at the stake on 3 November 1324. Life Kyteler was born in Kyteler's House, County Kilkenny, Ireland, the only child of a Flemish family of merchants settled in Ireland since the mid- late thirteenth century. She was married four times, to William Outlaw, Adam le Blund, Richard de Valle, and Sir John le Poer. # First husband c.1280‚Äì85 ‚Äì William Outlaw, merchant and moneylender of Kilkenny. Son: William Outlaw, was mayor of Kilkenny in 1305. Daughter: Rose? # Second husband (by 1302) Adam Blund of Callan, moneylender # Third husband (by 1309): Richard Valle, a landholder of County Tipperary. After Valle's death c.1316 Alice took proceedings against her stepson, Richard, for the recovery of her widow's dower. # Fourth husband (c.1316‚Äì24) John Poer. In 1302, Kyteler and her second husband were briefly accused of killing her first husband. She incurred local resentment because of her vast wealth and involvement in moneylending. When her fourth husband, John le Poer, fell ill in 1324, he expressed the suspicion that he was being poisoned. After his death, the children of le Poer and of her previous three husbands accused her of using poison and sorcery (maleficarum) against their fathers and of favouring her first-born son, William Outlaw. In addition, she and her followers were accused of: * denying the faith of Christ and the Church * cutting up animals to sacrifice to demons at crossroads * holding secret nocturnal meetings in churches to perform black magic and undermine/overpower the church * using sorcery and potions to control Christians * possession of a familiar, Robin Artison, a lesser demon of Satan * murder of husbands =Trial= Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory, sought to uphold the laws of the church and morality. When the case was presented before him in 1324, he began his larger project of addressing witchcraft. Ledrede made initial attempts to have Kyteler arrested, and Kyteler called on the assistance of powerful friends. The bishop was jailed and questioned by Sir Arnold le Poer, Seneschal of Kilkenny. On Ledrede's release he renewed his efforts to have Kyteler imprisoned. The bishop wrote to the Chancellor of Ireland, Roger Utlagh (Outlaw), demanding that she should be arrested. Ledrede's use of the decretal, designed to protect the faith Ut inquisitions (1298), demanded that secular powers should concede to church wishes, and this point of law became a thorny issue throughout the trial. Kyteler was related to the Chancellor (he was probably her first husband's brother) and he asked the bishop to drop the case. A delay in proceedings (the Chancellor insisted the accused be excommunicated 40 days before arrest) allowed Alice to flee to Roger Utlagh; Ledrede accused him of harboring heretics, but a commission cleared him of any wrongdoing. Alice and her accomplices were accused of and investigated on seven accounts: * Committing heresy * Sacrificing to demons * Communing with demons * Magically excommunicating/usurping the church * Making love and hate potions to corrupt Christians * Murdering her past husbands * Engaging in a sexual affair with a demon After some months of stalemate, one of Kyteler's servants, Petronella de Meath, was tortured, and confessed to witchcraft. Her confession detailed her involvement, along with Alice's, in six out of seven of the above listed crimes. It would seem, although her testimony was likely forced and unreliable, that the accusers gained most of their information from this confession. Although the testimony did implicate Kyteler to performing heresy, questions concerning Petronella's credibility come into light, especially when examining the contents of her confession. In Ledrede's retelling of Petronella's confession, he writes: > On one of these occasions, by the crossroads outside the city, she had made > an offering of three cocks to a certain demon whom she called Robert, son of > Art (Robertum filium Artis), from the depths of the underworld. She had > poured out the cocks' blood, cut the animals into pieces and mixed the > intestines with spiders and other black worms like scorpions, with a herb > called milfoil as well as with other herbs and horrible worms. She had > boiled this mixture in a pot with the brains and clothes of a boy who had > died without baptism and with the head of a robber who had been decapitated > ... Petronella said she had several times at Alice's instigation and once in > her presence, consulted demons and received answers. She had consented to a > pact whereby she would be the medium between Alice and the said Robert, her > friend. In public, she said that with her own eyes she had seen the > aforesaid demon as three shapes (praedictus daemon tertius), in the form of > three black men (aethiopum) each carrying an iron rod in the hand. This > apparition happened by daylight (de die) before the said Dame Alice, and, > while Petronella herself was watching, the apparition had intercourse with > Alice. After this disgraceful act, with her own hand she (Alice?) wiped > clean the disgusting place with sheets (kanevacio) from her own bed. It is said Kyteler fled to England. She appears no further in contemporary records. The Bishop continued to pursue her working-class associates, bringing charges of witchcraft against them. Petronella de Meath was flogged and burned at the stake on 3 November 1324. Petronella's daughter, Basilia, fled with Kyteler. Kyteler's son, William Outlaw, was also accused inter alia, of heresy, usury, perjury, adultery, and clericide. William \\"recanted\\" and was ordered to hear three masses a day for a year and to feed the poor. = Chronology of events = * c.1280‚ÄîAlice Kyteler marries her first husband William Outlaw. * 1302‚ÄîAlice and her second husband, Adam le Blund, are accused of homicide. * c.1316‚ÄîAlice's third husband, Richard de Valle, dies and she sues his heir for the widow's share. * 1317 April‚ÄîPope John XXII appoints Richard Ledrede as bishop of Ossory. * October‚ÄîLedrede arrives in Ossory and holds a synod. * 1320 August‚ÄîJohn XXII sends a letter to the justiciar of Ireland regarding complaints of harassment and imprisonment made by Ledrede. * 1324? -- Ledrede accuses Alice Kyteler and her associates of witchcraft and heresy. * March/April‚ÄîArnold le Poer imprisons Ledrede for 17 days. * Dublin parliament; the magnates, including Arnold le Poer and Maurice FitzThomas, swear to discipline their own people and followers (lineages). * Arrest of heretics by Ledrede. * November‚ÄîPetronilla of Meath burnt for heresy and witchcraft. * William Outlaw's penance payment is guaranteed by the magnates. * 1325 January -- Alexander Bicknor deserts to the queen's party while on an embassy to France. * 1326‚ÄîThe feud between the le Poers and Maurice FitzThomas worsens. * Maurice FitzThomas and John le Poer, baron of Donoil, are allowed four months to discipline their followers; Arnold le Poer goes to England. * 1327 January‚ÄîDeposition of Edward II by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer. * 1327/8 -- Ledrede appeals to Isabella and is given permission to come to court but fails to use it, later claiming that Bicknor and Outlaw had closed the ports against him. * Arnold is confirmed as seneschal of Kilkenny and given custody of Kilkenny castle. * The \\"Munster war\\" breaks out between the le Poers and Maurice.

Significance In the late thirteenth and fourteenth century, heresy was considered as evidence of the struggle with the devil, with the \\"dangers\\" of witchcraft voiced by the papacy in Avignon. Pope John XXII listed witchcraft as a heresy in his bull Super illius specula. Kyteler's was one of the first European witchcraft trials, and followed closely on the election of this pope (1316‚Äì1334). Kyteler's case appears to involve the first recorded claim of a witch lying with her incubus. Annales Hiberniae state that: Ricardus Ledered, episcopus Ossoriensis, citavit Aliciam Ketil, ut se purgaret de heretica pravitate; quae magiae convicta est, nam certo comprobatum est, quendam demonem incubum (nomine Robin Artisson) concubuisse cum ea ... ‚Äì that is, that Kyteler had intercourse with a demon named as \\"Robin Artisson\\".Lee Morgan.

The Stone, a novel about the times of Alice Kyteler, was published in 2008, written by a Kilkenny woman named Claire Nolan. A musical version of The Stone, based on Nolan's book premiered in Kilkenny in 2011. Robin Morgan wrote a novel, The Burning Time (Melville House, 2006; ) about Alice Kyteler.

However, the ghost also claims to have died in regnal Year 14 of a later king Mentuhotep.

Mainz am Rhein, 1997 Alternatively Claude Vandersleyen has tentatively dated Rahotep to the 13th Dynasty on the grounds that he believes Rahotep to be related to Sobekemsaf I, which Vandersleyen also dates to the 13th Dynasty because of the quality and number of statues attributable to him.Claude Vandersleyen: Rahotep, S√©bekemsaf Ier et Dj√©houty, rois de la 13e Dynastie, Revue d'√âgyptologie Baker deems these arguments \\"slim and rejected by most scholars\\". If he was indeed a ruler of the early 17th Dynasty, Rahotep would have controlled Upper Egypt as far north as Abydos. According to Ryholt's reconstruction of the Second Intermediate Period, Rahotep's reign would have taken place shortly after the collapse of the 16th Dynasty with the conquest of Thebes by the Hyksos and their subsequent withdrawal from the region. In the wake of the conflict the Hyksos would have looted and destroyed temples and palaces. Rahotep consequently \\"boasts of restorations [he performed] in temples at Abydos and Coptos\\".Janine Bourriau, Ian Shaw (edit), The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt Oxford University Press, 2000. p.205 In Abydos he had the enclosure walls of the temple of Osiris renewed and in Coptos he restored the temple of Min of which \\"gates and doors [have] fallen into ruins\\". This chronology of events is debated and some scholars contest that Thebes was ever conquered by the Hyksos. Rather, they believe the kings of Upper Egypt could have been vassals of the Hyksos.

Scott was the son of Dr Helenus and Augusta Maria Scott. He was born in Bombay, India and was educated at Bath Grammar School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1822 and an MA in 1825. Scott was elected to the new Legislative Assembly, representing Northumberland and Hunter from 1856 to 1859, Northumberland 1858 to 1859 and Lower Hunter from 1860 to 1861. He supported the secret ballot and franchise extension. In 1861 he was nominated to the Legislative Council for life, but he took no part in it and resigned in 1866. Ash Island (artist A.W.Scott) A failed entrepreneur, he later became a prominent figure in the commercial establishment of the Newcastle region. He lived at Ash Island on the Hunter River with his wife, formerly Harriet Calcott, a seamstress, and his two daughters Harriet (1830‚Äì1907) and Helena Scott (1832‚Äì1910), both born in Sydney. At Ash Island the sisters helped their father in his entomological work, collecting, preparing and drying specimens of plants and insects, and also accepted painting, drawing and lithography commissions from Australian naturalists including Gerard Krefft, William Macleay, Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, Edward Pierson Ramsay, William Woolls and Ferdinand von Mueller.Ord, M.

This work, published in 1864, was time-consuming and expensive and publication was delayed for 12 years. Although published (in London : John van Voorst) under Alexander Walker Scott it was an entirely collaborative work as its title states. Alexander Walker Scott was a trustee of the Australian Museum 1862‚Äì79 and a Fellow of The Entomological Society of New South Wales, founded in 1862, as were both Helena and Harriet, though in their case it was honorary, a rare distinction.

It is situated on the Huddersfield line between Leeds and Manchester, north east of Huddersfield. The station is managed by Northern, although all services are currently provided by TransPennine Express. Ravensthorpe station is sited just north-east of Thornhill LNW (London North Western) Junction, where a line branches to Wakefield Kirkgate. There are plans to rebuild the station to the west of the junction, on the route built by the former Manchester and Leeds Railway. History Ravensthorpe was a late addition to the London and North Western Railway, with the station and goods shed built in 1890 to attract freight traffic in the area. The line itself had opened some 42 years earlier. As part of a wider upgrade to the route between Huddersfield and Dewsbury, Network Rail propose to partially grade separate the junction between the two lines and increase capacity for express trains by 4-tracking the route to the west. The new junction design would move the alignment of the Leeds route slightly to the south, meaning the existing station would have to be largely demolished and rebuilt. Network Rail therefore plan to abandon the current station site, and build a replacement approximately to the west, which would turn Ravensthorpe into a junction station, allowing trains to and from Wakefield to call in addition to the existing Leeds services. Facilities Ravensthorpe station is unstaffed. The former station buildings, having been damaged by fire, were demolished and replaced with basic shelters. There are no facilities to purchase tickets and so passengers must purchase tickets on the train. There are timetable posters and a telephone available to obtain train running information, along with digital information screens. Step-free access is limited to the eastbound platform, as the westbound platform can only be reached by steps.Ravensthorpe station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 28 November 2016 Ravensthorpe is one of West Yorkshire's least used stations due to its relatively remote location, although it does also serve the nearby village of Thornhill. Services Ravensthorpe is served each day (including Sundays) by an hourly TransPennine Express service running between Leeds and Huddersfield.

Situated south west of Leeds on the main line to Huddersfield and Manchester, the station was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1848. The station is now managed by TransPennine Express, who provide trains to Leeds, Huddersfield, Manchester, York, Hull and Redcar Central. Northern Trains also serve the station with trains on the Calder Valley line. History A 1911 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Dewsbury (upper right) The line between Leeds and Ravensthorpe was built by the Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester Railway, which was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway prior to opening. Dewsbury railway station was opened on 18 September 1848 and was subsequently named Dewsbury Wellington Road from 2 June 1924 until 20 February 1969, when it reverted to the original name. Dewsbury was also served by three other stations which have since closed: * Dewsbury Central, served by the Great Northern Railway on the to Wakefield line, closed in 1964. * Dewsbury Market Place, built by the Manchester and Leeds Railway, closed in 1930. * Thornhill, also built by the Manchester and Leeds Railway, closed in 1961. No trace of Market Place station remains, but the fa√ßade of Dewsbury Central was incorporated into a bridge supporting the Dewsbury Ring Road in 1985. Facilities The station is staffed through the day, with the ticket office on Platform 1. Self-service ticket machines are also provided in the booking hall. There are waiting rooms on each platform, along with digital display screens, customer help points, timetable poster boards and automated announcements to offer train running information. There are no toilets. Lifts integrated into the footbridge provide step-free access to both platforms. The footbridge is also a public right of way. On Platform 1 there is a piece of art called Horizons. The art club from Carlton Junior and Infant School \\"worked alongside artist Candida Wood from Can Do Art, and over 10 weeks they designed a piece of art aiming to attract members of the local community to visit the station\\". Ticket barriers were installed in 2018. In summer 2018, Kirklees Council started work on making improvements to the outside of the station. Plans included pedestrianizing the area directly outside the station and redesigning the car park entrances to improve traffic flow. The improvements are part of the \\"North Kirklees Growth Zone\\" initiative, intended to be a kick start to improvements to the town. Services As of December 2019, Dewsbury is served by four trains per hour to Leeds and four trains per hour to Manchester.

Only Platform 1 has step-free access, as the subway to Platform 2 has stairways.Batley station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 16 January 2017 Services The service here, which changed substantially in May 2018, was altered again at the December 2018 timetable change after issues with punctuality and service reliability. The net effect has been to essentially restore the pattern that formerly served the station prior to the May 2018 changes, i.e. one Leeds to Huddersfield stopping train per hour each way (now operated by TransPennine Express and calling at all local stations) and one Northern Trains service between Leeds, Manchester Victoria and via Brighouse. On Sundays, there is an hourly service to Leeds and Huddersfield. History The station was at one time rather larger than it is today, as it was also served by the Great Northern Railway branch line from Bradford to Wakefield via Dewsbury Central from December 1864 to 7 September 1964, when it fell victim to the Beeching Axe.Railway Ramblers - Kirklees Accessed 11 April 2008 It was also the junction for branch lines to Birstall (opened in 1852, closed to passengers as a wartime economy measure in 1917 and to all traffic in 1963) and to Tingley and Beeston (opened in 1890, closed in 1951). \\"Tracking down history of local railways\\" Batley & Birstall News article 29 November 2007; Retrieved 8 January 2016Batley to Beeston 1890-1951Lost Railways West Yorkshire; Retrieved 8 January 2016 The station was significantly enlarged (with the addition of three extra platforms) on the opening of the latter route in August 1890, but reverted to the present twin-platform configuration after the closure and abandonment of the Bradford - Wakefield line in 1964/5. Few traces of any of these routes remain today, but the abutments of the former bridge that took the Bradford line across the line from Leeds near Batley signal box (east of the station) can still be seen. On June 2018, a protest was held by Batley and Spen MP, Tracy Brabin following weeks of disruption to its services after Northern announced the roll out of a new timetable. The Labour MP argued people who live in the north of the country are fed up of being at the bottom of the pile when it comes to transport investment.

The station is on the Huddersfield Line and is currently operated by Northern. It is located approximately south west of Leeds at the northern end of the Morley Tunnel which passes beneath the town. History Morley railway station was opened by the London and North Western Railway on 15 September 1848. Originally named Morley, it was renamed Morley Low on 30 September 1951, owing to it being far below the town, under which the Morley Tunnel passes. The town's other station (known as \\"Morley Top\\"), which was situated nearer to the town centre and served by trains on the Bradford-to-Ardsley line of the Great Northern Railway, was closed by British Rail on 2 January 1961. In 2003, plans were in place to upgrade Morley station's facilities by introducing cycle stands, CCTV, and improvements to the car park. As only one platform is accessible to disable people Morley Town Council lobbied (unsuccessfully) to have the upgrade include the installation of wheelchair ramps to platform 2. Only the cycle stands were completed at that time. In January 2011, plans were laid out once again for CCTV cameras to be installed, and these were installed in the following months. Patronage growth Patronage at Morley station has increased remarkably in recent years; this is shown in the annual figures published by the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). Recorded usage in 2002/03 was 27,296 journeys per year (average of entries and exists). By 2005/06 this had increased to 68,664 journeys per year, an increase of 252% in four years. The figures for 2010/11 increased by 21% on the previous year, to 328,558 journeys per year. Actual growth may be higher since the ORR data does not accurately take account of the multi-modal 'MetroCard' season tickets issued by the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, which are valid for journeys to and from this station. Current problems Entrance to the station The increase in demand, combined with growth elsewhere on the line, means that overcrowding in the morning peak, particularly for commuters heading towards Leeds, is becoming more of an issue. Despite this commuter growth little has been done to bring this station into the 21st century. For example, only one platform is accessible for disabled passengers, there is insufficient parking, access routes to and from the station are often overgrown with weeds, and there are frequent drainage problems which all combine to make the station not as pleasant as other stations in West Yorkshire. In 2012 a \\"Friends of Morley station\\" group was formed, and is addressing some of these issues. Work to improve the car park and drainage commenced in February 2013. The Morley Observer & Advertiser stated on 12 January 2011 that plans are now in place to update the station, starting with the installation of CCTV. This was later installed. The outlying location of the station could put some users off as it is a ten to fifteen minutes walk from the centre of Morley. The shortest walking route being via Queen Street, Ackroyd Street and then via the station steps (approx. 90) to the side of the Miners Arms Pub. The nearest bus service to the station is the 54 operated by First. This runs along King George Avenue and New Bank Street. The nearest stops are only a few minutes walk away. There's no taxi rank at the station, but there are a number of local cab firms in the area. Services A TransPennine Express leaves Platform 1 in 2020 Morley railway station is on the Huddersfield Line. , it is served by two separate hourly services throughout the day. TransPennine Express provide an hourly stopping service between and while Northern provide an hourly service mostly between and via , , and . The two services combine to provide a half- hourly service to/from , and ; diverging to the west of the latter. On Sundays, TransPennine Express provide an hourly stopping service between and . Tickets Ticket machines have been provided on both platforms and these have recently been brought into use. It is expected that Morley will become a penalty fare station in due course. Passengers can also purchase tickets from the conductor on the train if they have not booked in advance. On some occasions staff are on hand to sell tickets. This would otherwise present a problem at peak times, as one person cannot possibly sell tickets to every passenger on a crowded train; passengers travelling into Leeds therefore would have to queue up at the excess fares kiosk in Leeds to purchase tickets on arrival, in order to pass through the ticket barriers. It is, however, possible to buy tickets to or from Morley in the usual way at any manned station, with the nearest manned stations being Dewsbury and Leeds. It is also possible to buy mobile tickets in advance online using the Northern App. Northern (train operating company). An alternative is to purchase a 'MetroCard' season ticket offered by West Yorkshire Metro. As Morley is in Zone 2, all MetroCard tickets that include rail travel are valid at Morley. National Rail also offers a wide selection of rail-only season tickets, allowing unlimited travel between Morley and another named station. West Yorkshire residents who hold a Metro-issued Concessionary Pass are entitled, after 09:30, to purchase a ticket for any rail journey wholly within West Yorkshire for half the normal fare. This can be combined with a standard ticket beyond West Yorkshire, and hence longer journeys can also be made slightly cheaper. For example, travelling from Morley to Manchester Victoria costs significantly less by travelling to on the concessionary rate, leaving only the relatively short Todmorden to Manchester journey to be paid for in full.

The magazine was launched in 1992 by Richard Ingrams, who was its editor for 22 years, following 23 years in the same post at Private Eye.William Turvill \\"Private Eye co-founder Richard Ingrams, 76, retires after judging himself 'too old' to attend Oldie disciplinary hearing\\", Press Gazette, 30 May 2014 In June 2014, after Ingrams's dispute with the magazine's publisher led to his departure, Alexander Chancellor became the editor.Harry Mount \\"Richard Ingrams on his successor at The Oldie: 'He‚Äôs a bloody fool for taking the job‚Äô\\", The Daily Telegraph, 12 June 2014 Alexander Chancellor died suddenly in January 2017, and Harry Mount took over the editorship. That year the magazine celebrated its 25th anniversary, and its circulation continues to rise. History and outline The magazine was founded in 1992 by Richard Ingrams, previously editor of Private Eye, together with Alexander Chancellor. The magazine aimed to contrast with youth culture. The Independent on Sunday described it as \\"The most original magazine in the country\\". The Oldie magazine is owned by Oldie Publications Ltd. It carries articles of general interest, humour and cartoons. Its contributors include Gyles Brandreth, Craig Brown, Virginia Ironside, Stephen Glover, Raymond Briggs, James Le Fanu, Thomas Stuttaford, John Walsh and Giles Wood. It is sometimes regarded as a haven for \\"grumpy old men and women\\"‚Äîan image it has played up to over the years with such slogans as \\"The Oldie: Buy it before you snuff it\\", and its lampooning of youth subculture and what it sees as the absurdities of modern life. It was the first mainstream publication to break the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. Despite being called The Oldie, the magazine often stresses that it is not an age-specific publication, and has many readers in their twenties, thirties and forties. It has similarities to Punch, Viz, The Spectator, Private Eye, and The New Yorker. Oldie of the Year Awards The Oldie of the Year Awards (TOOTY) is the magazine's annual awards ceremony, hosted by Terry Wogan until 2014, and Gyles Brandreth since then, and held at Simpson's-in- the-Strand. The awards celebrate lifetime achievement, as well as \\"oldie\\" achievements and/or notoriety over the previous year, the whole ceremony being very much tongue-in-cheek. Past winners include Olivia de Havilland, Ian Paisley, David Hockney, Eileen Atkins, Stanley Baxter, Peter Blake, Glenda Jackson and Moira Stuart. At the magazine's 2011 awards, Prince Philip was named Consort of the Year; Oldie of the Year was Barry Humphries. In 2015, Oldie of the year was Ken Dodd. In 2017, David Cameron's mother, Mary Cameron, was honoured with a \\"Mother Knows Best\\" award in recognition of her signing a petition condemning a decision by Oxfordshire county council to close over 40 children's centres in the Conservative-run area whilst her son was Prime Minister. The Oldie monthly Literary Lunches are also held in London (at Simpson's-in-the-Strand).

It lies south west of Leeds on the Huddersfield Line. It is the nearest railway station to Leeds United F.C.'s Elland Road stadium. A proposed White Rose railway station south of Cottingley station is currently under consideration. It is undecided whether to retain Cottingley station or to close it, if and when, White Rose opens. History The station was opened by British Rail on 25 April 1988 with financial assistance from West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive and is currently managed by Northern Trains, however, most trains that call at Cottingley are now operated by TransPennine Express apart from a handful of peak hour services. Patronage growth Patronage at Cottingley station (off Cottingley Drive) has increased significantly in recent years, and this is reflected by the figures published by the Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR). Recorded usage in 2002/03 was 9,467 journeys per year (average of entries and exits). By 2005/06, this had increased to 73,894 journeys per year, an increase of 781% (almost eightfold) in four years. Actual growth may be higher, since the ORR data does not accurately take account of the multi-modal 'MetroCard' season tickets issued by WYPTE which are valid for journeys to and from this station. From 2008/9, such MetroCard data are included, but only an estimation is made. Recent growth can also be attributed in part by a significant new housing development adjacent to the railway station, called Churwell New Village. That, combined with growth elsewhere on the line, means that overcrowding in the morning peak for commuters heading towards Leeds is now a serious problem. Efforts to address this have been hampered by the relatively short platforms at the station, which limited the length of trains that can call here. The platforms have since been extended (towards Leeds) and can now accommodate three car trains easily. Network Rail further extended the platforms in November/December 2018.\\"North of England Platform Extension Programme\\" Network Rail press release, retrieved 18 November 2018 Facilities Signage at the entrance to Cottingley railway station The station is unmanned and has only basic shelters on each platform. Platform 1 is the ‚Äòdown‚Äô platform for trains to Leeds and platform 2 is the ‚Äòup‚Äô platform for trains to Dewsbury, Huddersfield, Brighouse and Manchester. There are ticket machines on both sides and these were recently been brought into use. Automatic announcements, timetable posters and dot matrix display screens provide train running information. Step-free access is available to both platforms; however they are linked by a stepped footbridge. Services As of May 2020, Monday to Friday and Saturday there's an hourly service from Cottingley to Leeds and to Huddersfield calling at all intermediate stations. Three early morning services and one evening peak service (05:27 to via , 06:58 and 07:57 to Leeds, and 17:23 to Wigan North Western) are operated by Northern with the rest being operated by TransPennine Express. The service pattern is generally XX:21 to Leeds and XX:52 to Huddersfield. The service on a Sunday is similar, but starts later. Most trains operate Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds calling at all stations from Stalybridge onwards.

While it allowed bilateral participation in sacraments, it does not require from either the acceptance of all doctrinal opinions. This communion has since been extended to all churches of the Anglican Communion through their synods. Principles The agreement expresses three principles: # Each communion recognizes the catholicity and independence of the other and maintains its own. # Each communion agrees to admit members of the other communion to participate in the sacraments. # Full communion does not require from either communion the acceptance of all doctrinal opinion, sacramental devotion or liturgical practice characteristic of the other, but implies that each believes the other to hold all the essentials of the Christian faith. To monitor the progressive growing together of the two communions, the Anglican-Old Catholic International Co-ordinating Council was established by the International Bishops' Conference and the Lambeth Conference. Its first official meeting took place in 1999. Bibliography * Affirmation of the 1931 Bonn Agreement between old Catholics and Anglicans.

John Haydon had married Joan Grenvill (d.1592), heiress of Cadhay, whose family had inherited it from the de Cadhay family some generations before.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.47 The couple's Easter SepulchrePevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.620 monument survives in Ottery St Mary Church. John Haydon was the first Governor of the Collegiate Church of Ottery St Mary following the Dissolution of the Monasteries.Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.620 He died without progeny and bequeathed it to his great-nephew Robert Haydon (1560-1626), the eldest son of his nephew Thomas HaydonRisdon, p.47 of Bowood and Epforde, and the husband of Joan Paulet (d.1630), a daughter of Sir Amias Paulet (1532-1588), Governor of Jersey and gaoler for a period of Mary, Queen of Scots. It was built on the site of an earlier house, the great hall of which, dating back to 1420, was retained. His great-nephew Robert Haydon subsequently added a long gallery, a feature of late 16th century housebuilding, which closed in the south side of the house to form a courtyard. The residents of the Manor House have had a long association with the parish church of Ottery. By 1737 the house was in a poor state of repair and the new owner, Peere Williams, restored the house in the Georgian style. He blocked up most of the Tudor hearths and panelled a number of the rooms. He inserted a ceiling in the Great Hall under the magnificent oak-timbered roof to form the present dining room and roof chamber. During the 18th and 19th centuries the house was at times divided into two and again fell into a poor state of repair. It was bought by Dampier Whetham in 1910 who uncovered the old Tudor hearths and put the house into sound structural condition. In the 1920s he let the house to the William- Powlett family, descendants of Amias Paulet, who purchased the property in 1935, and have occupied it until 2002. In 2002 the house was inherited by Rupert Thistlethwayte, a nephew of the last of the William-Powletts, and a furniture maker. He restored it to its previous splendour and introduced modern comforts such as heating and additional bathrooms, as well as contemporary furniture of his own designs to complement the antique furniture. Sir Simon Jenkins in his book England's Thousand Best Homes described the house thus: \\"The courtyard...with statues of Henry VIII and his three monarch offspring, Edward, Mary and Elizabeth...is one of the treasures of Devon.\\" Statues Four statues dating from 1617 survive, standing over the doors in the courtyard, and represent Kings Henry VIII, Edward VI and Queens Mary and Elizabeth I.

It is a quiet resort, surrounded by Maltese countryside and some of the most fertile valleys in Malta. There is also a picturesque small fishing harbour. The resort is the gateway to the sandy beaches of Golden Bay and to Mellieƒßa Bay. There are a number of hotels and restaurants in Xemxija. History The area around Xemxija has been inhabited since prehistoric times. It contains a number of archaeological sites, which now form a heritage trail. These include a number of rock-hewn tombs, remains of two megalithic temples, a Bronze Age grain silo, trogloditic dwellings, cart ruts, a Roman road, and Roman apiaries. In around 1715, the Order of St. John built Arrias Battery as part of a series of fortifications defending Malta's coastline. It was also called Xemxija Battery since it was on the sunny side of the bay (xemxija means \\"sunny\\" in Maltese), and the area around it became known as Xemxija. Today, the battery is a restaurant. In 1839, the British built an aqueduct allowing the transportation of water. The water travelled from an underground aqueduct in an area in Wardija, known as tal-Ballut, that extends to an above ground aqueduct and then to a reservoir both in Xemxija. The conservation of water was needed for the British military and their horses, who surveilled the area from the nearby defence posts. An underground emergency flour mill was built in Xemxija during the Cold War. It has been restored to working condition by the Fondazzjoni Wirt Industrijali Malti (Maltese Industrial Heritage Foundation), and is now open to the public. Since the 1980s, several apartment blocks were built in Xemxija making it a popular residential area. It is also a small resort, mainly catering with bars and restaurants.

Built in 1899, it is one of the only surviving 19th-century commercial buildings in the downtown area. History The Southwestern Brewery was founded in 1888 by Don and Harry Rankin, and later taken over by Jacob and Henry Loebs. By the start of the 20th century it was one of Albuquerque's largest employers and its flagship product, Glorieta Beer, was distributed throughout the southwest. The statewide enactment of Prohibition in 1917 forced the company out of the brewing business, but its ice-making operations remained profitable. The facility changed hands several times starting in 1948, but continued to produce ice for most of the 20th century. It finally closed in 1997. The brewery was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1975 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In 1998, the former cold storage and mechanical building on the south side of the complex was destroyed by a fire that also slightly damaged the main brewery building.

Location Cham lies within the Cham-Furth lowland, which is bordered on the south by the Bavarian Forest and on the north by the Oberpf√§lzer Wald. The city lies on the Regen River, which joins the Danube at Regensburg. Etymology The name \\"Cham\\" is of Celtic origin and probably means \\"bend\\" or \\"curvature\\". In fact, a few kilometers from the city, a winding brook called the Chamb flows into the Regen; it probably gave its name to Cham, the first settlement at the bend of the larger river. Alternatively, the name may have derived from Kamm (comb). The city's coat of arms contains a comb. A partner city, also called \\"Cham\\" in Switzerland, is actually pronounced with an initial \\"ch\\" sound (Ach-Laut), whereas Bavarian Cham is pronounced with a . History Monks from Regensburg founded the Marienm√ºnster, the first and oldest church in the Bavarian forest, at Chamm√ºnster in the 8th century. The first reference to Cham as a city appears in 976. An imperial castle stood on the Galgenberg (German: \\"gallows hill\\"), providing protection for the trade route into Bohemia. Cham was granted its own currency around 1000, the so-called Cham Denar. The 12th century saw the town's location shifted to its current place. The Hussite Wars of the 15th century inflicted great hardships on the townspeople. In 1742, the Pandur troops of Franz Freiherr von der Trenck overran and destroyed the city. Cham's first railway connection came in 1861. On April 18, 1945, a British air raid on the western part of Cham caused 63 deaths. The arrival of numerous German war refugees from Silesia and the Sudetenland swelled Cham's population from 5,860 to over 10,000. Cham is referred to in relation to the death of the father of the French resistance fighter Jeannette Guyot, Jean-Marie Guyot. He was also a member of the resistance, arrested early 1944 and transported to Cham where he died.http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jeannette- guyot-french-resistance- fighter-1-4120341https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/04/26/jeannette- guyot-intelligence-agent--obituary/ International relations Cham, Germany is twinned with: *Cham, Switzerland *Klatovy, Czech Republic *Gainsborough, Great Britain  Notable people  Nicolas Luckner * Anne of Bohemia (1323‚Äì1338), a sister of Emperor Charles IV, later Duchess consort of Austria, Styria and Carinthia * Nicolas Luckner (1722‚Äì1794), Marshal of France, to whom the Marseillaise was dedicated * Karl Stern (1906‚Äì1975), professor of neurology and psychiatry, author; a street in Cham is named after him * Fritz Z√§ngl (1914‚Äì1942), German skier, born in Katzbach, now Cham * Ernie Stautner (1925‚Äì2006), German-born American football ‚Äì coach and poker player * Wolfgang Gedeon (born 1947), doctor, author and politician (AfD) * Max Deml (born 1957), publisher, writer, entrepreneur * Christoph Janker (born 1985), football defender  References   External link  * Category:Cham (district) ","title":"Cham, Germany"},{"id":"3019524","text":"The Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP), is one of India's national parks, is located in Kullu region in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The park was established in 1984 and is spread over an area of 1171 km2 at an altitude of between 1500 and 6000 m. The Great Himalayan National Park is a habitat to numerous flora and more than 375 fauna species, including approximately 31 mammals, 181 birds, 3 reptiles, 9 amphibians, 11 annelids, 17 mollusks and 127 insects. They are protected under the strict guidelines of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972; hence any sort of hunting is not permitted. In June 2014, the Great Himalayan National Park was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The Unesco World Heritage Site Committee granted the status to the park under the criteria of \\"outstanding significance for biodiversity conservation\\". Biogeography The GHNP is at the junction of world's two major faunal regions: the oriental to the south and palaearctic to the north. The temperate forest flora-fauna of GHNP represents the westernmost extension of the Sino-Japanese Region. The high altitude ecosystem of the Northwest Himalaya has common plant elements with the adjacent Western and Central Asiatic region. As a result of its 4,100 m elevation range the park has a diversity of zones with their representative flora and fauna, such as alpine, glacial, temperate, and subtropical forests. These biogeographic elements are result of geological evolution of Himalaya which continues today from the action of plate tectonics and continental drift. Over 100 million years ago, the Indian sub-continent broke off from the large, southern landmass, Gondwanaland and moved north. It eventually slammed into the northern land mass, Laurasia, and formed the gigantic folded mountains of the Himalaya. Due to this union of Gondwanaland and Asiatic landmasses, exchange of flora and fauna was possible and this ultimately led to the unique biogeographical features in the region. Timeline of creation It took twenty years from inception to inauguration for GHNP to be realized as part of the Indian national park system. The following is a brief timeline: 1980: Preliminary park survey of the watersheds of Tirthan, Sainj, and Jiwanal in Banjar area of Kullu district 1983: Continued park survey, the Banjar area of Kullu district. 1984: Notification by state of Himachal Pradesh of the intention to create the Great Himalayan National Park with buffer zone. 1987: First Management Plan of the Great Himalayan National Park. 1988: Settlement Proceedings and settling of rights of local communities 1992: The Himachal Wildlife Project re-assesses wildlife abundance, livestock grazing, and herb collection and reviewed the existing management plan. 1994: The Government of HP revised the Notification of intention to include the Sainj Wildlife Sanctuary and the upper Parvati watershed. 1994-1999: Conservation of Biodiversity Project (CoB), the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun conducts research to assist in the management of the park. 1999: Declaration of Award upon Completion of Settlement Proceedings. Monetary compensation for individuals who had rights of forest produce in the park area, including a package for providing alternative income generation activities to everybody living in the Eco-development Project Area or Ecozone. The GHNP becomes the latest and newest national park of India. The Conservation of Biodiversity (CoB) Project completed on 31 December 1999. 2014: World Heritage Natural Site status conferred on GHNP on 23 June in the proceedings of the 38th World Heritage Committee meeting in Doha, Qatar. Biodiversity =Fauna= Mountain goat in park The Great Himalayan National Park is home to more than 375 faunal species. So far species of 31 mammals, 181 birds, 3 reptiles, 9 amphibians, 11 annelids, 17 mollusks and 127 insects belonging to six orders have been identified and documented. Most of the Himalayan fauna has been given protection under the high priority protection category of Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The state government of Himachal Pradesh has banned hunting in the state for more than ten years. A trek of 35 to 45 km in any of the park's valleys brings one into the high altitude habitat (3,500 m and above) of animals such as blue sheep, snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Himalayan tahr, and musk deer. Best sightings can be made in autumn (September‚ÄìNovember) as animals start their seasonal migration to lower altitudes. =Flora= The GHNP also supports a great diversity of plant life, thanks to its wide altitude range and relatively undisturbed habitats. From the lofty pinesand spruces and the great, spreading horse chestnuts of the lower valleys, to the dense cushions and prostrate branches of the alpine herbs and junipers, the park presents an endless variety of vegetation. Although some areas have been modified by grazing, this is one of the few areas of the Western Himalayas where the forests and alpine meadows can be seen in something approaching their original state. The subalpine zone is richest in species, followed by the alpine and upper temperate zones.

Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996), is a United States contract case involving a \\"shrink wrap license\\". One issue presented to the court was whether a shrink wrap license was valid and enforceable. Judge Easterbrook wrote the opinion for the court and found such a license was valid and enforceable. The Seventh Circuit's decision overturned a lower court decision. Facts The case involved a graduate student, Matthew Zeidenberg, who purchased a telephone directory database, SelectPhone, on CD-ROM produced by ProCD. ProCD had compiled the information from over 3,000 telephone directories, at a cost of more than $10 million. To recoup its costs, ProCD discriminated based on price by charging commercial users a higher price than it did to everyday, non-commercial users. Zeidenberg purchased a non- commercial copy of SelectPhone and after opening the packaging and installing the software on his personal computer, Zeidenberg created a website and offered the information originally on the CD to visitors for a fee that was less than what ProCD charged its commercial customers. At the time of purchase, Zeidenberg may not have been aware of any prohibited use; however, the package itself stated that there was a license enclosed. Moreover, because \\"the software license splashed across the screen and would not let him proceed without indicating acceptance,\\" Zeidenberg had ample opportunity to read the license before using SelectPhone. Zeidenberg was presented with this license when he installed the software, which he accepted by clicking assent at a suitable dialog box--this type of license is commonly known as a \\"click- through license\\" or \\"clickwrap\\". The license was contained, in full, on the CD. Holding The court first held that copyright law did not preempt contract law. Under the 1991 Supreme Court case Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, the court held that a telephone directory was not protectable through copyright. In this case, the court assumes that a database of a telephone directory was equally not protectable. However, the court held that a contract could confer among the parties similar rights since those rights are not \\"equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright\\". The court then held the license valid and enforceable as a contract. The court relied primarily on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) sections 2-204 (describing a valid contract) and 2-606 (describing acceptance of a contract). There was little doubt that ProCD, in fact, offered use of the software as described by UCC section 2-206. The court examined more closely the question of acceptance. The court held that Zeidenberg did accept the offer by clicking through. The court noted that he \\"had no choice, because the software splashed the license on the screen and would not let him proceed without indicating acceptance\\" [forced acceptance somewhat]. The court stated that Zeidenberg could have rejected the terms of the contract and returned the software. The court, in addition, noted the ability and \\"the opportunity to return goods can be important\\" under the Uniform Commercial Code.

Biography In 1942, Anderson joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) at a time when some Irishmen signed up out of idealism, but more joined in order to send money home to struggling families. He was posted to a radar station at Crossmaglen, County Armagh, Northern Ireland but also worked in India and Burma. Around this time, he met his wife, Isobel, whom he married in 1951. Upon demobilisation in 1946, he moved to her native Glasgow, Scotland, a city he took to instantly although his work continued to be influenced by his beloved County Monaghan. In 1947 he joined Glasgow Unity Theatre, effectively launching a career which saw him become a valuable player in Glasgow's left-wing artistic life. He later recalled that an encounter in Sauchiehall Street when he introduced himself to Roddy McMillan set everything in train. McMillan took the young Irishman into Craig's Restaurant and bought him a cup of tea and Anderson found his spiritual home at the Unity Centre. His first play, Thirty Three Years, was produced by the Glasgow Unity Theatre in the late 1940s. His literary work in the Easterhouse community in Glasgow where he lived was recognised by an Irish Post award. As a playwright, his 1979 work Krassivy about Scottish leftist politician John Maclean won a Fringe First award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Anderson became well known on the Glasgow political/socialist/Scottish/Irish/International Republican scene. His poetry, stories, plays and songs all reflected his Celtic charm, blending Scottish and Irish history and culture in an anti-sectarian manner. As a poet of the oral tradition, his work could sometimes lapse into sentimentality but at his best his lyrics had the same insight as other fellow Monaghan poets such as Patrick Kavanagh. Late in life he finally produced the book which drew together all his attributes. \\"Oiney Hoy\\", a tale of the wanderings of a green fool, toys with Ireland's myths, stereotypes, pretensions, and foibles, a gentle but effective satire which also translated with great success on to the Edinburgh Fringe stage. Towards the end of his life, Anderson had been preparing the further adventures of Oiney and was working on an autobiography. But the illness with which he struggled for more than 20 years caught up with him in 2001, two years after he lost his wife and companion, Isobel.

He was born near London in 1902 and was called to the Bar in 1923. Later in 1949 he was appointed a County Court Judge, a position he held until 1967. He used these experiences as inspiration for his work. His books typically feature educated and genteel fraudsters and blackmailers who lay ludicrously ingenious plots exploiting loopholes in the legal system. There are several recurring characters, such as the drunken solicitor Mr Tewkesbury and the convoluted and exasperating witness Colonel Brain. He writes well about the judicial process, usually through the eyes of a young barrister but sometimes from the viewpoint of the judge; Friends at Court contains a memorable snub from a County Court judge to a barrister who is trying to patronise him. Cecil did not believe that judges should be too remote from the public: in Sober as a Judge, a High Court judge, in a case where the ingredients of a martini are of some importance, states drily that he will ignore the convention by which he should inquire \\"what is a martini?\\" and instead gives the recipe for the cocktail himself. His 1955 novel Brothers in Law was made into a film in 1957 and, later, a television and radio series starring Richard Briers. While at Paramount Pictures, Alfred Hitchcock worked on adapting No Bail for the Judge for the screen several times between 1954 and 1960, and hoped to co-star Audrey Hepburn, Laurence Harvey, and John Williams, but the film was never produced. He also reviewed the Rowland case in the Celebrated Trials series published by David & Charles in 1975. The 1946 trial of Walter Rowland was for the murder of Olive Balchin, who had been found battered to death on a bomb site on Deansgate, Manchester. A hammer had been found near the body, and the police identified Rowland with three witnesses. He was found guilty and hanged at Strangeways Prison in 1947. He protested his innocence from the dock and afterwards. After the trial, another man confessed to the killing, but his evidence was ignored when the original judgment was reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Henry Cecil concludes in his book that Rowland was indeed guilty, although Cecil ignores the forensic evidence, or rather the absence of forensic evidence, linking Rowland to the crime scene. His book reveals the many prejudices of the judiciary in the 1970s, including the complete acceptance of police evidence at face value, for example.

The museum also has a collection of historical clothing and jewellery. New indoor exhibition space was built in 1999-2000\\\\. The museum won the European Museum of the Year Award in 2005. On site at the museum, there are re-enactors demonstrating the old way of life. Among these demonstrations are paper production, linseed production, and beer brewing. The heritage tram line opened in the museum in 1996. The line is 1750 m long, standard gauge. It has classic electric trams from Amsterdam, Arnhem, Rotterdam, and The Hague. The pride of the museum's line is a replica of an Arnhem tram from 1929, the GETA 76, which was constructed by the museum.  History  = Establishment = The Open Air Museum was created after Frederic Adolph Hoefer, suggested a plan in April of 1912 to build an Open Air Museum. He came up with this idea after visiting similar parks museums in Scandinavia. The rise of industrialization and urbanization caused regional differences to disappear. Traditions and craftsmanship threatened to vanish. By moving historical building to the museum, with people knowledgeable about the history, visitors could be shown how people used to live. This way the old traditions could be preserved the \\"Vereniging voor Volkskunde Het Nederlands Openluchtmuseum\\" (Association for Folklore The Dutch Open Air Museum) was created that same month. It opened its door on 13 of July 1918. At the time of its opening the museum contained 6 buildings that had been moved in from other locations across the country. One of the first buildings was the los hoes originally build in Beuningen in the 17th century. = World War II = During World War II the museum was hit with incendiary bombs, this caused a building in the Zaanse buurt to go up in flames. In 1941 the museum was renamed to the Rijksmuseum voor Volkskunde (National museum for folklore). During the Battle of Arnhem the museum was temporally lived in by some hundred evacuees. On the 17th of November 1944 Franneke van der Kallen was born in one of the houses in the Zaanse buurt. Later on the 15th of November 1944 Nora Olga Marijke was born. Her initials stand for NOM (Nederlands Openluchtmuseum). A third child passed away two weeks after birth. In 1945 during an attack from a V-1 flying bomb the collection of garbs and painted furniture were lost. Research Some research is done on-site at the Open Air Museum for the dating and conservation of materials acquired. The Multimedia Library of the museum contains pictures, slides, diagrams, videos, and audio recordings documenting Dutch folk life. They also work in tandem with the Foundation for Historical Farm Research (SHBO), the Working Party for Farmyards Foundation (SWB), and the Centre for Documentation and Information on Regional Dress (SDI) in their research on folk culture.

The club was founded in 1885 and are based at Mansfield Park at Hawick in the Scottish Borders. Splinter from Hawick and Wilton RFC The premier club of Hawick was Hawick and Wilton RFC. This was formed by the Hawick and Wilton Cricket Club members as a sport to play in the winter. It ran the Hawick and Wilton Sevens; the fourth oldest rugby sevens tournament in the world (behind Melrose [1883]; Gala [April 1884] and Selkirk Cricket Club [May 1884]). For the members of Hawick and Wilton RFC however cricket came first and this led to the splinter club of Hawick RFC forming in 1885. Hawick and Wilton RFC continued on after Hawick RFC formed as rivals; and for a time both the Hawick and Wilton Sevens and the later Hawick Sevens co-existed. Hawick and Wilton RFC eventually folded in 1890 as its members decided to purely focus on cricket.https://scottishsevens.sport.blog/hawick-and-wilton-sevens/ Establishment of the Club 1885 saw some rugby players of Hawick and Wilton RFC found a new club to instead solely concentrate on rugby: the Hawick Football Club, moving to new premises at the Volunteer Park, just beyond the cricket pitch. New colours were adopted, dark green jerseys and stockings with white shorts, and in 1886 Hawick was admitted to membership of the Scottish Football (later Rugby) Union, only the 19th club to be admitted, the only earlier Border clubs being Gala and Melrose RFC. In 1888 Hawick Football Club moved to its present home, Mansfield Park, at the other end of the town. The early seasons brought keenly contested games against Edinburgh Academicals, Gala, and Watsonians, and in 1896 Hawick won their first Scottish Unofficial Championship.Bath, 1997, p89 1945 to 1972 ‚Äì Scottish Domination Between 1945 and 1972 Hawick club firmly established among the leaders of Scottish rugby, winning the unofficial championship eight times, taking the Border League title fifteen times, and earning fame as sevens specialists. In the 1950s, all 15 of Hawick RFC were approached by rugby league scouts from Yorkshire. In this period, Hugh McLeod, George Stevenson, Adam Robson, and Derrick Grant alone won 100 international caps between them, while fifteen other Greens played for their country. 1972 onwards The official Scottish championship began in season 1973‚Äì74 and since that time Hawick has won the championship on twelve occasions. The proud record of winning the first Border League in 1901‚Äì02 and the first Scottish championship in 1973‚Äì74 was added to in 1995‚Äì96 when the club were also first winners of the Scottish Cup. Indeed, in season 2002‚Äì03, the Greens completed the treble, winning Scottish League championship, Scottish Cup and Border League championship. In 2009 the club was relegated to the 2nd tier for the first time in their history. Hawick regained their place in the Premiership at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season with a 39‚Äì38 playoff victory over Dundee HSFP.RBS 2012/2013 Season Playoff Game Result Hawick Force The club run a 2nd XV called Hawick Force who play in the top Scottish Reserve League.

He is portrayed by the show's writer, director, and executive producer B. J. Novak, and is based upon Ricky Howard from the original British version of The Office (as well as Neil Godwin, during the fourth season), although his role is significantly expanded to that of a main character. Character profile Little is known about Ryan Howard's early life, but it is revealed in a deleted scene from \\"Diversity Day\\" that he grew up in Scranton. In the webisode \\"The Story of Subtle Sexuality\\", Ryan mentions that his parents live in separate houses. At the beginning of the series, Ryan Howard is a temporary employee at the Scranton branch of the fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin who joined the staff in the first episode, earning him the nickname \\"The Temp\\". In early episodes, he is shown to be uncomfortable with his professional relationship with his boss, Michael Scott. Michael often forces Ryan to carry out menial tasks for him while at the same time, becoming obsessed with Ryan's personal life as well as gaining Ryan's friendship. As the series progresses, Ryan begins to display a great deal of contempt and disdain for both his coworkers and his job. This becomes more apparent when Ryan is promoted in \\"The Job\\" to work at Dunder Mifflin's corporate office in New York. This leads to Ryan becoming an egotistical braggart despite lackluster sales skills. In the season 4 finale \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Ryan is arrested for committing fraud. He is eventually released and required to work community service. In the season 5 premiere, Ryan returns to the Scranton branch after Michael arranges for him to work Pam's job. However, his malevolent aspirations to climb back to the top of the corporate ladder are revealed when he adds Jim and Kevin to a list of people who \\"will be sorry\\" when he returns to the top. In a deleted scene, he would add Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace to that list after Wallace called and became irate upon learning of Ryan's return to the Scranton branch. Ryan was a member of a fraternity in college and holds an MBA from the University of Scranton's Kania School of Management, which he earned during the second and third seasons. His dream is to one day own his own business. Throughout the series, Ryan changes his persona every year beginning with the third season. When offered a job for Corporate in the season 3 finale, Ryan relocates to New York City and adopts a nouveau riche persona: becoming extroverted, growing a beard, wearing nice suits and getting $200 haircuts. But he subsequently ends up partying hard and getting addicted to drugs and alcohol. His downfall culminates in misleading Dunder-Mifflin's shareholders via his website's sales numbers, effectively committing fraud as Oscar Martinez later claims. In season 5, he returns with blonde highlights and a \\"work hard, play hard\\" attitude. He works for Michael at the Paper Company and still tries to keep his work ethic and strive to do good. In seasons 6‚Äì8, Ryan seems to be devoid of many of his former morals and ambitions. He does not care to work, reads poetry and initiates various creative projects. He switches clothing, from wearing fanciful scarves, fake glasses, suspenders, bow ties, trench coats, etc. and tries to create an \\"unsolvable attitude\\". He stays at Dunder Mifflin, but his position is unspecified; Michael mentions that he works there full-time in WUPHF.com. Many of the staff, most notably Jim and Pam, note Ryan's ineptitude as an employee and that he sponges off his parents by living with them and driving his mom's car. =Seasons 1‚Äì2= For the first episode and for much of season 1, Ryan's purpose in the show mirrors that of his British equivalent, Ricky Howard. He is the audience surrogate, allowing other characters to introduce themselves to him, and by extension, the viewer. Ryan was hired to replace Tom Peets, an employee who had lost a battle with depression and committed suicide shortly before the start of the series.http://www.theofficeisms.com/2014/09/8-behind- scenes-facts-from-office-you.html Tom is first referenced in the season 2 episode Performance Review, where a note from him in Michael Scott's long- ignored suggestion box requests counseling for his depression. Michael initially assumes the note is a joke, as no-one who currently works at the branch is named Tom, until Phyllis reminds him of the suicide. Over the first two seasons, Ryan's character is a secondary one and he is primarily defined by his dissatisfaction with his job, and his relationships with Michael and Kelly. His dissatisfaction manifests itself in his use of sarcasm and general disinterest towards his co-workers. Ryan does not wish to stay at Dunder Mifflin long or even be remembered when he leaves, citing that his ultimate fear is that he will gain a nickname around the office (being \\"the something guy\\"). During Ryan's term as a temporary employee (and even for a few months after his promotion to full-time status), various characters (mainly Dwight) frequently address him as \\"Temp\\" instead of by his real name. In later seasons, several characters sarcastically use this term long after Ryan has risen to a more prominent position in the company. Ryan is often the victim of Michael's antics and bizarre man-crush on him, usually resigning to requests without complaint. Also, by the end of season 2, Jim facilitates a relationship between Kelly and Ryan, which is very rocky from the start. =Season 3= By the third season opener \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\", Ryan becomes a full-time employee and inherits the job vacated by Jim Halpert. Despite the promotion, Michael still treats Ryan as his personal assistant. Upon Jim's return to Scranton after the branch merger, there is a moment of awkwardness when Jim casually sets up at his former desk, only to learn that it now belongs to Ryan‚Äîwho refuses to give the desk back to Jim, the first hint at a rivalry between the two. Ryan goes to his first sales call in \\"Initiation\\", where he is subjected to a series of tests by Dwight. Despite his superior education, Ryan is not a good salesman‚Äîhis first client tells him flat out that he does not like him. In the last scene of \\"The Job\\", Ryan receives a call from the New York headquarters, offering him the job previously held by Jan Levinson and making him Michael's immediate superior.Confirmed by producer Greg Daniels in The Office Live Blog: To Anissa.Confirmed by writer/actor BJ Novak in his blog http: /blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=3241662&blogID;=266132650 After he hangs up, he immediately dumps Kelly. =Season 4= Novak, who also writes for the show, commenting on the fourth season, said, \\"We wanted him to dress as obnoxious as possible. As much black as possible.\\" This season also includes episodes that exhibit Ryan's social life outside the workplace, such as showing his studio apartment in Manhattan. Over the season, he also becomes increasingly arrogant, condescending and ambitious, speaking almost exclusively in business buzzwords. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", Ryan presents his concept of Dunder Mifflin Infinity, a new website, to the Scranton branch, and gives a BlackBerry to all of the main employees. He is eager to show off his newfound wealth. His occasional brushes with Kelly remain tense. In \\"Money\\", Darryl for the first time expresses his romantic desire for Kelly as he claims to \\"get excited every time I see that little dude (Ryan) walk through the door\\". It is also apparent that his new corporate peers also do not care for him; one employee yells at Ryan to get out of his office, and another tells Michael and Dwight, \\"it was funny to see Ryan all embarrassed\\". Later in the season, Ryan's new website is plagued by problems, including child predators and slow sales. The salesmen resist the new site as well. The later episodes show him becoming more excited and on edge. Feeling threatened by Jim Halpert's good relationship with David Wallace, Ryan conspires against Jim and sets out to get him fired. Ryan also begins dressing in an increasingly unkempt fashion. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\" Ryan is ‚Äì now typically ‚Äì curt with Jim. However, it is discovered that Ryan has been misleading the company's shareholders. In a YouTube video entitled \\"Whoaa! Check it out!\\", Ryan is seen being arrested and escorted out of Dunder Mifflin's New York office by police, much to Michael's dismay and Jim and Kelly's pleasure. =Season 5 = In the first episode of season 5, it is revealed that Ryan has been released with a sentence of community service, and has gotten sober. Michael hires Ryan through the temp agency as the fill-in receptionist. In a deleted scene, he receives a call from David Wallace for Michael. Infuriated that Ryan is back at Dunder Mifflin, Wallace abuses Ryan by telephone in front of the staff. This prompts Michael to defend Ryan and save his job. However, Ryan still exhibits the ego issues he developed in the fourth season. Ryan moves back to the annex with Kelly soon before Pam is scheduled to return. He starts showing off in front of Kelly and the two start kissing passionately. Ryan tells Kelly to break up with Darryl via text message. Darryl responds quickly saying \\"it's cool\\", with Kelly overjoyed and Ryan shocked. In \\"Frame Toby\\", Ryan breaks up with Kelly again, saying he is going with friends to Thailand, but convinces her to have sex with him one last time and give him some traveling money. Ryan is not seen again until the episode \\"Dream Team\\" in which he is seen working at a bowling alley until being hired by Michael to work at the Michael Scott Paper Company where he makes his first sale. His appearance has changed drastically with having a tan from his trip to Thailand (later revealed to be Ft. Lauderdale) and his hair is dyed blonde. Initially, Ryan acts with disinterest and irresponsibility toward the new company, choosing to spend his time talking on his telephone and surfing the web, which, along with lack of space, causes tension with Pam. However, as time passes, relations between the employees become more amicable as Ryan's behavior matures. Bonding with Pam and Michael over the company's relative success and through the close quarters, Ryan becomes more active and involved. After the buyout of The Michael Scott Paper Company by Dunder-Mifflin, much to David Wallace's vocal opposition, Ryan is initially rehired as a salesperson, though, as a result of budget problems, is reduced back to the position of a temporary employee. In an interview, he says now that he is a temp again the only thing he can control is his food, eating five small meals a day. = Season 6= season 6. In the sixth-season premiere, \\"Gossip\\", Ryan's appearance has changed back to his more traditional look ‚Äì black hair and no longer with a noticeable tan. In \\"The Promotion\\", Ryan seems to have picked up some persuasion skills from the sales team, as he manages to scam Pam out of a wedding gift and wheedle $50 from her. As of the beginning of season 6, he is dating Kelly again. The two dance down the aisle together at Jim and Pam's wedding. As the season progresses, Ryan develops a hipster persona, wearing suspenders, flannel shirts, bow ties and scarves. In \\"Double Date\\", Ryan is shown to have begun photography as a hobby, and gets Kelly to pose topless. He tries, but fails, to get Erin to do the same. In \\"Shareholder Meeting\\", he deflects Jim's instructions and refuses to do any work. He also spreads the rumor that Jim is not as powerful as Michael. Jim makes an example of him by putting him in the closet behind the kitchen with no windows or internet access. As a result, in \\"Scott's Tots\\", Ryan tells Dwight he will help him get Jim fired. At the end of \\"Manager and Salesman\\" he and Dwight go out and celebrate Jim's demotion to salesman. In \\"The Chump\\", he approaches Erin's desk and bluntly tells her that he would like to sleep with her. She asks if he is joking to which he backs down, claiming that he is. In \\"Whistleblower\\" Ryan announces a social networking website he is launching called \\"WUPHF\\". = Season 7= In \\"Nepotism\\", Ryan advertises his website WUPHF in the Lip Dub the Scranton Branch is making. In \\"The Sting\\", he helps Jim and Dwight spy on Danny. When they try to hatch a plan, Jim tells Ryan he is a \\"hot new executive\\" and Ryan tells them he wants to work at Google. In \\"Costume Contest\\", he dresses as Justin Bieber in hopes of winning the Scranton book of savings worth $15,000 in savings. In \\"Christening\\", he makes fun of the Youth Group pastor. In \\"WUPHF.com\\", Ryan tries to get people to invest in his company. When he reveals he will be broke in nine days, Kelly comes in and tries to invest. Then Ryan tells them that he has an offer from the Washington University Public Health Fund (WUPHF), only for Darryl to realize that they are only interested because of the domain name. Ryan tries to weasel more money from Michael, but is caught by surprise when Michael tells all the other investors that while he will not agree to divest their WUPHF holdings (they need Michael's assent because he holds more than 50% of the shares) he does think Ryan is shallow and a bad friend, and Ryan looks horrified when Michael says he has those nine days to make things right. At the end of the episode, Ryan tells everybody he has sold WUPHF.com. Ryan shows more immoral traits in \\"Garage Sale\\", when he sells jars of his mother's homemade Pesto sauce, which she intended to just be for family, for his own profits. Ryan is also in the group that helps Michael think of a good way to propose to Holly. When Michael does propose to Holly, he has some employees jokingly ask Holly to marry them. He states that Ryan was the only one he was concerned about.Garage Sale In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", he is shown to be hurt that Danny Cordray broke his streak of winning the \\"Hottest in the Office\\" award, although he tries to hide it. Ryan's contribution to the office workers' version of \\"Seasons of Love\\" is that Michael helped him get off drugs. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Michael gives Ryan his St. Pauli Girl beer sign, but only after making sure he is not prone to seizures. Ryan seems to genuinely appreciate the gift. In \\"The Inner Circle\\", Ryan lies to Deangelo about his job at the Scranton Branch. While Kelly is angry, she goes along with it in exchange for Ryan being a dutiful boyfriend. However, Kelly soon exposes Ryan as a fraud after reprimanding her severely about her paycheck in front of Deangelo. However, because Deangelo prefers Ryan over Kelly, he appoints him as her official supervisor. In \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\", after Dwight accidentally misfires a gun in the office and Toby is filling out the gun violence accident form, the HR rep asks the staff if they felt like this was a terrorist incident. Ryan, who is clearly enjoying Dwight's situation, openly says that he felt terrorized. In \\"Search Committee\\", Ryan reveals to the camera that he believes Angela's boyfriend Robert is gay, because he \\"liked\\" Ryan's Facebook photos at 3:00 AM. During a staff debate over who should be hired for the manager position, Ryan states he wants an outsider. While Jim thinks he is referring to the applicants outside of the office, Ryan says he meant an \\"outsider\\" as someone who is on the margins of society, and suggests a homeless person. Ryan laments that he got away with everything while Michael was his boss and it was not good for him. He says he wants guidance and leadership, but does not want the new manager to boss him around. =Season 8= In \\"The List\\", Ryan is on the \\"Losers\\" side of new CEO Robert California's list. He tries to convince the other members of the staff, that are also on the \\"Losers\\" side, that the list is in fact flawed, as he is on it. In \\"Spooked\\", he dresses up as Jesse Pinkman, a character from Breaking Bad. In \\"Pam's Replacement\\", he asks Jim if Pam's replacement, Cathy, is single. However, he does not approach her. In \\"Gettysburg\\", he decides to stay at the office while Andy and some of the other employees are at Gettysburg. He tries to impress Robert California with some ideas for the company, but is temporarily outshined by Kevin. In \\"Mrs. California\\", Ryan tells Susan California and his co-workers his \\"Dream for a Wish\\" idea. Susan refers to him as Bryan, and while he corrects her mistake and she apologizes, he calls her a \\"bitch\\" in a talking-head interview. In \\"Christmas Wishes\\", Ryan and Kelly give a pregnant Angela a shirt that reads 'Ask, then touch.' He is also seen dancing with Kelly a number of times during this episode. In a deleted scene, Andy tells Ryan that he will have health insurance for the new year, but Ryan is upset because he had wanted ten extra sick days, and looks uncomfortable when Andy says he expects Ryan to be a better worker going forward. Ryan joins Jim, Stanley, Erin, and Cathy Simms in traveling to Tallahassee and working on the Sabre Store project under Dwight's leadership. He briefly flirts with Erin when he learns she is planning to remain in Florida, but after she says he could join her as roommates and possibly begin dating in six months, he coldly states he is in love with Kelly. When Dwight and Nellie Bertram open a test store to see how the project could really work, Ryan is tasked to create and deliver a presentation about the Sabre Pyramid. However, he badly panics because his mother and Kelly are not there to keep him on an even keel, and Jim and Dwight's efforts to calm him down fail and leave Ryan to run out on the team and get on a bus. =Season 9= In \\"New Guys\\", Kelly Kapoor moves with Ravi, her Indian- American pediatrician fianc√©, to Miami, Ohio although she believes she is moving to Miami, Florida. Ryan follows her but claims it is for unrelated reasons. Ryan returns in \\"Finale\\" to attend Dwight and Angela's wedding. Sitting next to Kelly and Ravi, it is revealed that he has had an infant son named Drake with a former girlfriend who abandoned them. Kelly and Ryan make flirtatious glances before Ryan gives a strawberry to his son, who has an allergic reaction, prompting Ravi to tend to Drake. Ryan tells Kelly that he gave Drake an allergic reaction to talk to her. The two quickly make out and say they want to start a new life with one another. Ryan and Kelly then run away from the wedding together. Having tended to Drake, Ravi sees that the pair are gone and Kevin informs him as to what happened. Ravi tells Kevin to call social services, insisting that they will find a more suitable father. Nellie, wanting a child herself, takes Drake on the spot, later saying in a talking head that if Ryan wants the baby back he can find her in Europe. Relationships =Kelly Kapoor= Ryan has an on-again, off-again relationship with office chatterbox Kelly Kapoor. The relationship has been troubled from the outset, for Ryan desires a very casual relationship, whereas the overbearing Kelly wants to get married and have children as soon as possible. The two \\"hooked up\\" on the eve of Valentine's Day, although Ryan was brusque with her the following day. Things seemed to be starting up between the two again during the office \\"Casino Night\\". Ryan and Kelly are later seen dating in \\"The Convention\\". Ryan met Kelly's parents during Diwali, but they were not impressed by his low income, desire to travel and saving up money to buy an Xbox, rather than start a family. Ryan has more than once tried unsuccessfully to break up with Kelly, with one of the more notable occurrences after \\"The Merger\\" episode. Even though Ryan and Kelly continue to bicker, he is sweet to her in the episode \\"Safety Training\\". B. J. Novak has stated that Ryan and Kelly are going strong, well into the third season: \\"I think Ryan and Kelly is a relationship that everyone has been in. It's a puzzle as to why they're still together, but I think Ryan loves being loved-- even though he won't admit it. He lost Michael's love so he has to take in more love from Kelly.\\" After accepting a promotion to Corporate by telephone in \\"The Job\\", an elated Ryan immediately breaks up with Kelly, telling her \\"You and I are done,\\" with a smile. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", Kelly tries to rekindle their relationship by feigning pregnancy, a lie which she later reveals. This only upsets Ryan more and leads to him attempting to have her job outsourced to India. Ryan is visibly upset in later episodes when Kelly later flirts with and kisses Darryl in front of him. When Ryan is arrested in the season four finale, Kelly says she looks forward to rubbing in his downfall by visiting him in prison. Ryan and Kelly make amends in \\"Weight Loss\\", and Ryan indicates a renewed interest in her. He witnesses Kelly and Darryl kiss, as Kelly looks up to make sure Ryan sees it. In \\"Business Trip\\", Ryan and Kelly get back together when he moves back to the annex, though Ryan is uncomfortable again as he only made her breakup with Darryl with the expectation he would react violently, which he did not. In \\"Frame Toby\\", Ryan breaks up with her again and leaves the office altogether. Upon his return, the two do not rekindle their relationship, however, they constantly flirt and bicker with each other on Twitter. In an interview with Yahoo! TV, that was released before the episode \\"Business School\\", B. J. Novak describes Ryan and Kelly as \\"the worst relationship that all of us have been in.\\" He adds, \\"The bad news is that that's what a lot of people have actually experienced, something that just doesn't work on any level, and they just keep going for some weird reason.\\" Mindy Kaling (Kelly) adds, \\"It seems like Ryan has just adjusted to the fact that he is the boyfriend of this crazy girl.\\"Y! TV Exclusive: 'Office' Romances The Office (NBC) on Yahoo! TV, February 15, 2007. In interviews during the retrospective airing prior to \\"Finale (The Office),\\" Kaling and Novak revealed that their characters' turbulent on-again, off-again relationship was inspired by their relationship in the writers' room where they were best friends but often argued. In the season seven episode \\"The Search\\" during the cold open Ryan and Kelly announced to the office that they were getting a divorce, apparently having married over a week earlier on the spur of the moment and having neglected to tell anyone. Originally, they asked for no one to take sides, claiming it was an amicable break up. Upon realizing that no one cared and that they were getting little reaction to their news, Ryan declared that the split was not amicable and demanded that people take sides and also raise their hands to show whose side they were on; no one in the office raised a hand to support either one of them. In the episode \\"Spooked\\", Ryan and Kelly are seen standing next to each other and talking. At the end of the episode, he kisses her on the forehead. While they took a backseat for most of season eight, in \\"Angry Andy\\" Pam and Jim set up Kelly with their handsome, likable, kind Indian-American pediatrician Ravi, with Pam explaining that the Ryan-Kelly romance has become impossibly disruptive to the rest of the office. Pam also tells Ryan she doesn't think he's a good person and actively cheerleads against Ryan's efforts to win back Kelly (though Ryan admits he doesn't want to be with Kelly for the long run, or even a specific length of time beyond the present). In the end, Kelly tells Ryan she's decided to be with Dr. Ravi, but to Pam's horror immediately begins making out with Ryan again. When Kelly has a romantic portrait taken with Ravi in the season eight finale, Ryan looks on sadly, and later holds up a sign begging Kelly to take him back. However, he also holds up a sign for his picture making a romantic overture to a random blonde woman he'd met in Scranton. In the season nine premiere, Toby Flenderson says that after Kelly got engaged to Dr. Ravi and moved to Miami (Ohio), Ryan suddenly resigned and decided to pursue IT prospects in the \\"Silicon Prairie\\" of southwestern Ohio. During Dwight and Angela's wedding in the series finale, Ryan shows up with a baby son named Drake, stunning Kelly. Ryan later induces a mild strawberry allergy in Drake so that Kelly's husband Dr. Ravi will examine him, in order to get some time alone with Kelly. The two former lovers make out and leave the wedding, and baby Drake, behind on their final flight of romantic insanity. Nellie Bertram announces her intention to adopt Drake. =Michael Scott= Michael has one- sided affection for Ryan, which often frightens Ryan. In the early seasons, Ryan is inconveniently stuck in the position of being personal assistant to Michael, and was summoned to inappropriate tasks, on several occasions. In \\"The Dundies\\", Michael gives Ryan the \\"Hottest in the Office\\" award and slaps Ryan's buttocks after congratulating him. In \\"The Fire\\", when the office is playing the game \\"Who would you do?\\" Michael chooses Ryan, explicitly proclaiming \\"I would definitely have sex with Ryan\\". When Ryan works at the front desk, Michael frequently stares at him through his window blind. When Michael gets Ryan's cell phone number, he constantly prank calls Ryan with crude impersonations of Michael Jackson, Tito Jackson, Mike Tyson, and Saddam Hussein, and also pretends to be Ryan's mad girlfriend (\\"The Fight\\"). Michael gives Ryan a $400 iPod for the staff's Christmas Secret Santa exchange, despite the 20-dollar limit. In Season 3, Ryan begins correcting Michael for embarrassing him as evident by Michael sending Ryan kisses and calling him the belle of the ball in \\"The Convict\\". In a deleted scene from \\"Diwali\\", Carol says that Michael constantly talks about Ryan's attractiveness and knows where he lives. In a deleted scene of \\"Safety Training\\", Michael confesses that he will miss Ryan the most after dying, which angers Ryan. In a deleted scene of \\"Beach Games\\", Michael says he especially wants to see Ryan put a hot dog in his mouth. In \\"The Job\\", Michael comes back from his interview in New York and asks Ryan to get him coffee, but Ryan refuses. Michael is unaware that Ryan has just become his direct supervisor. In retaliation, Ryan orders Michael to get bottled water for him when returning to Scranton during \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\". In a deposition following Jan's lawsuit against Dunder Mifflin, the lawyers discovered Michael's obsession with Ryan in his diary, as he considers Ryan \\"just as hot as Jan, but in a different way\\" (\\"The Deposition\\"). In Launch Party, instead of inviting Michael to the Dunder Mifflin Infinity celebration in person, Ryan puts him in a company chatroom where Michael, highly angered, calls Ryan an \\"asshole\\" with the entire company watching. In \\"Night Out\\", Ryan tries to indirectly confide to Michael that he has a drug problem, but Michael ends up giving Ryan useless advice from The Wire. In a deleted scene, Michael is in bed with Ryan asking \\"Do you miss us?,\\" to which Ryan declines to answer. Michael later is devastated when he learns of Ryan's arrest. Michael arranges for Ryan's return to the Scranton branch, and temporarily grows a goatee like Ryan's. Disturbed by Michael's mimicry, Ryan shaves the goatee off. When Michael starts his own company in \\"Dream Team\\", he convinces him to leave his job at the bowling alley and join his newly formed paper company. When working together, Ryan comes to respect Michael's skills as a salesman. After the buyout of the Michael Scott Paper Company by Dunder Mifflin, Michael rehires Ryan as a salesman before demoting him back to a temp. In Season 6's \\"Secret Santa\\", Michael dresses up as Santa Claus and tries to lure Ryan to sit on his lap. In Season 7, Michael heavily invests in Ryan's WUPHF.com and won't agree to sell his majority shares when it's clear Ryan is exploiting Michael's goodwill and is incapable of saving the venture from bankruptcy. =Jim Halpert= Initially, Ryan and Jim got along well in the first three seasons and both seemed to respect each other, almost to the point of being friends. However, hints of a future rivalry were shown in \\"The Merger\\", where it is revealed to Jim that Ryan took his old job after he transferred to Stamford. Despite this, the two still got along fairly well with little to no annoyance from each other. However, after Ryan was promoted to his Corporate post as a Vice President of Sales for the company, he began behaving in a self-absorbed and egotistical manner, causing Jim to lose much respect for him. Their relationship soon turns into one of bitter rivalry once Ryan learns that Jim has been discussing with the CFO, David Wallace, the downsides of Ryan's company website. Once Ryan begins feeling overly stressed with the failure of the website, he turns to drugs and drinking and decides to find a way to fire Jim, fearing that Jim is undermining his authority and making him look bad to his superiors. He first puts a shocked Jim on \\"warning\\" for all of his pranks on Dwight, flirting with Pam, and inadequate sales figures, then pressures Jim to record a huge in-person sale as one made through Dunder Mifflin Infinity. As Ryan tries to fire Jim under false pretenses, Jim begins to develop raw hatred for him. Jim is also shown to be delighted when Ryan was arrested for sales fraud and is relieved that his job is finally safe from Ryan's paranoid business practices. After Ryan was released from prison, he returns as a fill in for Pam after she goes to design school and immediately apologizes to Jim, albeit in a very cynical and egotistical fashion, but Jim accepts his apology regardless, though not without sarcastically mocking him regardless (in his apology, Ryan expresses pride in \\"giving back to the community\\", to which Jim responds \\"You're talking about your court-ordered community service?\\") Once Ryan is rehired as a salesman before being demoted back to a temp at the company, he forms a bond with Pam, slightly softening his bitter relationship with Jim. Things finally improve a little between the two for most of season five, but they deteriorate anew in season six when Ryan does not take Jim's new position as co-manager seriously. Ryan then teams up with Dwight to get rid of Jim and the pair celebrate after Jim's demotion back to sales representative. Since then, Ryan and Jim seem to have resumed their former business relationship with the two no longer butting heads and even associating with each other in a friendly manner on a regular basis. =Dwight Schrute= Much like Jim, Ryan saw Dwight as an extremely odd and annoying person, stating in \\"The Return\\" that he will not miss Dwight after Dwight quit temporarily. During \\"The Initiation\\", Dwight takes Ryan on a series of bizarre tests to prove himself a worthy salesman. This does nothing except infuriate Ryan, who cannot believe that the best salesman within the company can act in such a ridiculous fashion. Regardless, Dwight tells Ryan he only wants to get along with him, unlike the way he and Jim worked together, and the two bond by throwing eggs at the potential buyer's company building when they refused their offer because they did not like Ryan. In season four, Dwight seems to respect Ryan much more after he was promoted to vice president of Northeast sales, with Ryan also seeming to tolerate Dwight much more than previous seasons. The two were rarely seen talking to each other in season five, but decide to team up in season six to get Jim fired from his newly appointed co-manager position. They often argued with each other, but celebrated after Jim got demoted. The two were last seen agreeing to go out for drinks to celebrate, but then end up arguing over where to drink. Inclusion in opening sequence and promotional images B. J. Novak's continued inclusion in the opening credits was sometimes questioned in the later years of the series, as the role of Ryan Howard had been significantly downplayed since season 5, and was now considered to be no more significant than other characters whose actors are not given an opening credit. Novak officially left the opening credits in the Season 9 premiere and was credited as a guest star. Appearances Ryan has appeared in most episodes of the series, with the exception of the season 4 episodes (\\"Branch Wars\\", \\"Survivor Man\\", \\"Dinner Party\\", and \\"Chair Model\\" as well as ‚ÄúJob Fair‚Äù), 12 episodes during season 5 (beginning with \\"The Surplus\\" through \\"Two Weeks\\", making his return in \\"Dream Team\\"‚Äîduring this absence, actor B. J. Novak was filming Inglourious Basterds with Quentin Tarantino), and a majority of the season 9 episodes (he appears in only \\"New Guys\\" and \\"Finale\\").

Origins The Hall was originally built by the Hemingway family, first recorded there in 1379The Returns for Yorkshire West Riding of the Poll Tax 1379, Council of the Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Association, London 1882. and in residence until 1654.CC136/1/7/3: Title Deeds - Calderdale - Southowram Township - Walterclough, Southowram, West Yorkshire Archive Service - Calderdale, Halifax. Walker family In that year Walterclough Hall was bought by William Walker (1596‚Äì1676), before he moved to Lower Crows Nest. The initials of his second son, Abraham Walker (1629‚Äì1695), and of his wife Anne n√©e Langley (1643‚Äì1688), were inscribed on the building. They were non- conformists and subject to the restrictions and harassments of the day. Their second son, Richard Walker (1672‚Äì1721), inherited the Hall from his father, and when he drowned in a canal, his son John Walker inherited the Hall from him. John Walker (1699‚Äì1771) was the squire of Walterclough Hall in the mid-18th century and a woollen factor of great prestige and wealth. While he and his wife, Ruth n√©e Nodder, had four children‚ÄîRichard (b. 1731), John (b. 1735), Grace (b. 1738) and Mary (b. 1740)‚Äîthey also adopted his nephew, Jack Sharp, and provided a home for four aunts and two uncles. Law Hill House John Walker‚Äôs youngest son, John, took no part in the business, so when his eldest son Richard died and John senior retired and left the district, Jack Sharp was left in possession of the business and the Hall, which he consumed with calculated avarice. In 1771, when John senior died, his surviving son John junior gave his cousin notice to quit the Hall. When he arrived from York with his new wife, he found the estate had been excessively mortgaged and most of the contents of the Hall had been removed. Only two rooms remained furnished, and what was left behind had been trashed. In 1778, Jack Sharp built Law House from the proceeds of his villainy on nearby Law Hill. Later, Miss Patchett established a Ladies Academy at Law House, and Emily Bront√´ taught there for six months in 1837-38. Her experiences at Law House and the now almost legendary story is believed to be the source for her only novel, Wuthering Heights.A Chainless Soul: A Life of Emily Bront√´ by Katherine Frank, Ballantine Books, New York NY 1990. In April 1867, the estate of the other Walker family of Crows Nest was sold by auction. This included most of the land at Hipperholme, Lightcliffe and Bailiff Bridge, as well as Crow‚Äôs Nest Mansion and Cliffe Hill Mansion. What happened to Walterclough Hall at this time is not yet known. Boarding academy However, by 1870, Walterclough Hall had become a young ladies boarding academy. Elizabeth Ann Gregory ran the academy with her sister, Emma, and their sickly live-in brother, Charles. She employed four staff members. In 1871, there were two governesses, a cook, and a housemaid, and, in 1881, a governess, a cook, a kitchen maid, and a housemaid. She may also have employed four children, paying them with an education, free board, and lodging.Census Returns of England and Wales for 1871, The National Archives, Kew (Surrey) 1871.Census Returns of England and Wales for 1881, The National Archives, Kew (Surrey) 1881. For the 1871 census, 18 young ladies were in residence, aged 11 to 19, and almost all from more distant parts; they were: Jessie Mosley, Fannie Mitchell, Helen Walter, Helen I. Simpson, Catherine Brown, Annie S. Aspinwall, Eleanor S. Graves, Mary I. Marsden, Marian Lomas, Sarah I. Speak, Clara Slack, Alberta Hellowell, Margaret Dempster, Gertrude Glendinning, Annie Bancroft, Elizabeth Wrigley, Amy Percival, and Mary D. Hamilton. There were also four young children, Francis Churchyard, Mary A. Stocks, William Town, and Arthur Town. For the 1881 census, 14 young ladies were in residence, aged 14 to 17, but mainly aged 15 and 16, and over half from the surrounding region: Julia Bancroft, Anne M Kirby, Longworth, Kate White, Mary A. , M. Scarby, Kate M. Smeeton, Ada Thomas, Lucy Lumb, Mary Blenkhorn, Florence Hirst, Annie Whitaker, Mary A. Bleasdale,Future wife of Henry Robinson Hall. and Susan Bentley. There were also four young local children: Rhoda Hoyle, Ethel Greenwood, Charles P. Greenwood, and Joe Walsh. However, the changing demographics of the academy suggest the school‚Äôs reputation was in decline along with its finances. Whatever happened, the school closed after a few years, and the staff were discharged. In 1888, Walterclough Pit, the largest and last coal pit in the area, was opened nearby, and in 1889, Charles Gregory finally died. Perhaps these also contributed to the academy‚Äôs ultimate demise. Nonetheless, by 1891, Emma Gregory was living alone at the Hall, seemingly retired.Census Returns of England and Wales for 1891, The National Archives, Kew (Surrey) 1891. By 1901, the two sisters were again living together nearby in Halifax.Census Returns of England and Wales for 1901, The National Archives, Kew (Surrey) 1901. Emma died in 1909, and Elizabeth in 1920. Decay By 1913, when Arthur Comfort sketched Walterclough Hall, it was almost entirely unoccupied and in an advanced state of dilapidation with many broken windows and the interior in disarray.35.- Walterclough Hall, Southowram in Ancient Halls in and about Halifax by Arthur Comfort, Halifax Courier Ltd, Halifax 1912-13. During the Second World War, Walterclough Hall's windows were shattered by a bomb dropped nearby by a German bomber. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the only part of Walterclough Hall which remained standing was the fa√ßade onto the yard and the rooms immediately behind it, together with the attached single-storey kitchen. These remnants were demolished in the late 1970s. An oil painting of the kitchen's interior was on display in the Smith Art Gallery in Brighouse during the 1970s. This painting showed one of the kitchen's unusual features which was a carved stone column which supported one of the roof joists. The kitchen ceiling was open to the slates. Water was supplied to a stone trough in the kitchen floor from a spring, which almost caused the death of one of the children then living at the hall. Today, the site of the former Walterclough Hall is part of Walterclough Hall Farm of Walterclough Lane, Halifax.

A leading scholar of Sƒ´bawayh's seminal treatise on grammar, \\"al-Kitab\\" (\\"The Book\\"), he lectured on philology and wrote critical treatises on linguistics and Quranic exegesis (tafsir). He is said to be the source of the story of Shahrbanu or Shahr Banu -- eldest daughter of Yazdegerd III. His quote to would-be students was:: :‚ÄúHave you ridden through grammar, appreciating its vastness and meeting with the difficulties of its contents?\\" Biography Ishaq Al-Nadƒ´m transmitted the written account of Ab≈´ al-·∏§usayn al-KhazzƒÅz, who gives al-Mubarrad's full genealogical name: Mu·∏•ammad ibn Yazƒ´d ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Akbar ibn ‚ÄòUmayr ibn ·∏§asanƒÅn ibn Sulaym ibn Sa‚Äòd ibn ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh ibn Durayd ibn MƒÅlik ibn al-·∏§ƒÅrith ibn ‚ÄòƒÄmir ibn Abd AllƒÅh ibn BilƒÅl ibn ‚ÄòAwf ibn Aslam ibn A·∏•jan ibn Ka‚Äòb ibn al-·∏§arƒ´th ibn Ka‚Äòb ibn ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh ibn MƒÅlik ibn Na·π£r ibn al-Azd, al-Azd said to be the son of al-Ghawth. According to Sheikh Ab≈´ Sa‚Äòƒ´d al-Sƒ´rƒÅfƒ´, Ab≈´ al-‚ÄòAbbƒÅs Mu·∏•ammad ibn Yazƒ´d al-Azdƒ´ al-ThumƒÅlƒ´ [al- Mubarrad] was a prot√©g√© of the grammarians al-Jarmƒ´, al-MƒÅzinƒ´, etc. He was descended from a branch of al-Azd, called the ThumƒÅlah. He began studying Sƒ´bawayh's Book with al-Jarmƒ´, but completed it with al-MƒÅzinƒ´, whose linguistic theories he developed. In a citation from the book called Device of the Men of Letters, al-Hakimi wrote that Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAbd Allah Muhammad ibn al-QƒÅsim called Al-Mubarrad a \\"S≈´ra·∏•≈´n\\", of al-Ba·π£rah. His origins were in al-Yaman, however his marriage to a daughter of al-·∏§af·π£ƒÅ al-Mughannƒ´ earned him the name ‚Äò·∏§ayyan al-S≈´ra·∏•ƒ´.‚Äô Ab≈´ Sa‚Äôƒ´d reports al-SarrƒÅj and Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAli al-·π¢affƒÅr that al-Mubarrad was born in 825-26 (210 AH)and died in 898-99 (285 AH), aged seventy-nine. Others said his birth was in 822-23 (207 AH). Al-·π¢≈´lƒ´ Ab≈´ Bakr Muhammad ibn Yahya said he was buried in the cemetery of the K≈´fah Gate. Al- Mubarrad related many anecdotes of the poets, linguists and satirists of his circle. In one such tale al-Mubarrad says :‚ÄúOne day Ab≈´ Mu·∏•allim al-ShaybƒÅnƒ´ said to me, ‚ÄòI had never seen a mortar among the nomads, so that when I came across one, I was disdainful of it.‚Äô‚Äù He estimated that ‚ÄúAb≈´ Zayd knew a great deal about grammar, but less than al-Khalƒ´l and Sƒ´bawayh.\\" He described al- A·π£ma‚Äôƒ´ as \\"equal to Abu ‚ÄòUbaydah in poetry and rhetoric but more expert in grammar, although ‚ÄòUbaydah excelled in genealogy.\\" In another tradition al- Mubarrad read a poem of the poet Jarƒ´r to a student of al-A·π£ma‚Äòƒ´ and Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbaydah, called al-Tawwazƒ´, in the presence of the poet‚Äôs great grandson UmƒÅrah, which began: ::The dove was happy in the trees exciting me; ::For a long time may thou tarry in the branches and the forest verdure, until he came to the line ::But the heart remaineth bound by longing ::For Jumanah or Rayya, the Barren Place (al-‚ÄòƒÄqir). When ‚ÄòUmƒÅrah asked al-Tawwazƒ´ how his master Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbaydah would interpret ‚ÄúJumanah and RayyƒÅ‚Äù, al-Tawwazƒ´ replied, ‚ÄúThe names of two women,‚Äù ‚ÄòUmƒÅrah laughed saying, ‚ÄòThese two, by AllƒÅh, are two sandy places to the right and left of my house!' When al-Tawwazi asked al-Mubarrad to write this explanation down, he refused out of respect for Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbaydah. Al-Tawwazƒ´ insisted that if he were present, Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbaydah, would accept UmƒÅrah‚Äôs interpretation, as it was about his own house.‚Äô Works * Meaning of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn; *Al-KƒÅmil (The Complete) *The Garden; *Improvisation; *Etymology; *Al-AnwƒÅ' and the Seasons; *Al-QawƒÅfƒ´; *Penmanship and Spelling; *Introduction to Sƒ´bawayh; *The Shortened and the Lengthened Masculine and Feminine; *The Meaning of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, known as KitƒÅb al-TƒÅmm (Entirety); *Proving the Readings [methods of reading the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn]; *Explanation of the Arguments of the ‚ÄúBook\\" of Sƒ´bawayh; *Necessity of Poetry; *The Training of an Examiner; *The Letters in the Meaning of the Qur‚Äôan to ‚Äú·π¨ƒÅ' (·π¨) Ha‚Äò(H); *The Meaning of the Attributes of AllƒÅh, May His Name Be Glorified; *Praiseworthy and Vile; *Pleasing Gardens; *Names of the Calamities among the Arabs; *The Compendium (unfinished); *Consolation; *Embellishment; *Thorough Searching of the ‚ÄúBook‚Äù of Sƒ´bawayh; *Thorough Searching of ‚ÄúKitab al-Awsa·π≠\\" of al-Akhfash; *Prosody- An Explanation of the Words of the Arabs, Rescuing Their Pronunciation, Coupling of Their Words, and Relating Their Meaning; *How the Pronunciations of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn Agree, Though Their Meanings Differ; *The Generations of the Grammarians of al-Ba·π£rah, with Accounts about Them; *The Complete Epistle; *Refutation of Sƒ´bawayh The Principles of Poetry; *Inflection (Declension) of the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn; *Exhortation for Morality and Truth; *Qa·∏•·π≠ƒÅn and ‚ÄòAdnan [the basic Arab tribes]; *The Excess Deleted from Sƒ´bawayh; *Introduction to Grammar; *Inflection (Declension); *The Speaker (The Rational Being); *Superior and Distinguished; Explanation of the Names of Allah the Almighty; *The Letters; *Declension (Conjugation). Transcribers of al- Mubarrad The copyists IsmƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l ibn A·∏•mad Ibn al-ZajjƒÅjƒ´ and IbrƒÅhƒ´m ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-ShƒÅshƒ´ were probably al-Mubarrad‚Äôs amanuenses. Other contemporary grammarians wrote commentaries of lesser value on The Book of Sƒ´bawayh. Among this group were: Ab≈´ DhakwƒÅn al-QƒÅsim ibn IsmƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l, who wrote ‚ÄúThe Meaning of Poetry‚Äù; Ab≈´ DhakwƒÅn‚Äôs stepson Al-Tawwazƒ´. ‚ÄòUbayd ibn DhakwƒÅn Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAli, among whose books there were Contraries, Reply of the Silencer, Oaths (Divisions) of the Arabians, Ab≈´ Ya‚ÄòlƒÅ ibn Abƒ´ Zur‚Äòah, a friend of al-MƒÅzinƒ´, who wrote A Compendium of Grammar (unfinished) Al-Mubarrad‚Äòs leading pupil al-ZajjƒÅj became an associate of al-QƒÅsim, the vizier of the ‚ÄòAbbƒÅsid caliph al-Mu‚Äòta·∏çid (892-902), and tutor to the caliph‚Äôs children. When al-Mu‚Äôta·∏çid was recommended the book Compendium of Speech by Mu·∏•ammad ibn Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Abi ‚ÄòAbbƒÅd, which was composed in the form of tables, the caliph ordered his vizier, al-QƒÅsim, to commission an expositionary commentary. Al-QƒÅsim sent first to Tha‚Äòlab, who declined -offering instead to work on KitƒÅb al-‚ÄòAyn of al-Khalƒ´l- and then to al-Mubarrad, who in turn declined on grounds of age. Al-Mubarrad recommended his younger colleague al-ZajjƒÅj for such a laborious task. Al-Mubarrad had a close friendship with Ibn al-SarrƒÅj, one of his brightest and sharpest pupils. When al-Mubarrad died al-SarrƒÅj became a pupil of al-ZajjƒÅj. Al Mubarrad taught Ab≈´ Mu·∏•ammad ‚ÄòAbd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Durust≈´yah. and Ab≈´ al-·∏§asan ‚ÄòAlƒ´ ibn ‚ÄòlsƒÅ al-RummƒÅnƒ´, wrote a commentary on the ‚ÄúIntroduction\\" (Al-Madkhal) (on grammar) of al-Mubarrad. Ibn al-·∏§ƒÅ‚Äôik HƒÅr≈´n, from al-·∏§ƒ´rah, a grammarian of al-K≈´fah, debated with al-Mubarrad. A conversation between al-Mubarrad and Ibn al-·∏§ƒÅ‚Äôik is related by al-Nadƒ´m were al-Mubarrad says to Ibn al-·∏§ƒÅ‚Äôik, ‚ÄúI notice that you are full of understanding, but at the same time free from pride.\\" Ibn al-·∏§ƒÅ‚Äôik replied, ‚ÄúOh, Ab≈´ al-‚ÄòAbbas, it is because of you that AllƒÅh has provided our bread and livelihood.‚Äù Then al-Mubarrad said, ‚ÄúIn spite of receiving your bread and livelihood, you would be proud if you had a proud nature.\\" Al-Nadƒ´m also relates a tradition from Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbayd AllƒÅh that Mu·∏•ammad ibn Mu·∏•ammad had related that Ab≈´ al-‚ÄòAbbas Muhammad ibn Yazid [al-Mubarrad] the grammarian had said: ‚ÄúI never saw anyone more avaricious for learning than al-JƒÅ·∏•i·∫ì, al-Fat·∏• ibn KhƒÅqƒÅn, and IsmƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l ibn Is·∏•aq al-QƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (Judge). Whatever book came into the hands of al-JƒÅ·∏•ƒ´·∫ì, he read it from cover to cover, while al-Fat·∏• carried a book in his slipper and if he left the presence of Caliph al-Mutawakkil to relieve himself or to pray, he read the book as he walked and returned to his seat. As for IsmƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l ibn Is·∏•aq, whenever I went in to him there was in his hand a book which he was reading, or else he was turning over some books so as to choose one of them to read.

In the 2005‚Äì06 season, the club finished 5th in the Scottish Premiership. In their second season, they slipped to relegation. In 2012‚Äì13 season the club finished 8th in the National League, the second tier of club rugby, after a late season run of good results. The club happened to be in the Edinburgh District set up but is not in Edinburgh. On the fringes of the Scottish Borders, it is in South Lanarkshire.

Despite the name, \\"Currie\\" RFC is actually based in the neighbouring suburb of Balerno, and they play at Malleny Park. Currently the club run three senior sides, along with the Colts and youth rugby ages group teams. History Previous logo until 2017 The foundation of the club was initially started by six individuals; Bob Kirkwood, Jack Hogg, Roger Mclaren, Tom Chandler, David Bisset & Alex Galbraith . Having discussed the formation of a team in a local bar called the Weavers Knowe. From these discussions followed the idea to form a full rugby club in the local area. The 'six' were joined by Gordon Stewart, and given the necessary backing and, more importantly, use of the facilities at Currie High School, by the Headmaster, Ronnie Paul. Together the group sent out posters and leaflets around the Currie, Balerno and Juniper Green area calling on all interested to attend an open meeting at Curriehill School in April 1970 to 'discuss the formation of a local Rugby Club'. On the given evening 35 individuals attended and it was agreed to form a club to be called Currie Rugby Football Club, with the aim of promoting and developing the game of rugby within the area for the benefit of the sport and the community. The club officially formed in April 1970 and in October that year a team was fielded to play Gala Wanderers at Gala. For the very first game the club played in jerseys borrowed from Boroughmuir. By January 1971 they were fielding two XVs and the following season a third occasionally appeared. In the season 1973‚Äì74 the SRU decided to formalise the then unofficial championship and bring in a league structure, which gave Currie the entry to Edinburgh District League, Division II. Progress and promotion followed in 1976‚Äì77. The club was promoted from the District League into the National League during the 1979‚Äì80 season, where the Club would go undefeated and scored over 1,000 points. Successive promotion to Division 6 came the next year and following league reconstruction the club was in Division 5 by the start of the 1981‚Äì82 season. The rise of the club would continue with them winning promotion in 1982‚Äì83, 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87 to arrive in Division 2 of the National League. In 1989‚Äì90 Currie completed a remarkable rise through the leagues by finishing second in Division 2 and were promoted to Division 1 alongside Edinburgh Wanders. The club remained in the top division of Scottish Rugby until 1995 where league reconstruction saw them along with five other teams demoted into the Division 2. However, the club would bounce back the following year to win Division 2 outright regained promotion back to Division I, alongside Jed-Forest. The club have remained in the top tier of the National League ever since. In 2006‚Äì07 season Currie secured their first Division 1 championship with victory over Heriots at Goldenacre, beating Glasgow Hawks to the league title. It completed the fasted ever journey from club formation to League success in the history of Scottish Rugby. They would repeat this in 2009‚Äì10 beating Ayr to the title. In 2017, they rebranded as the Currie Chieftains.

Home matches are played at Inverleith; this was the venue for Scotland's home games between 1899 and 1925, during which time the first matches against France and New Zealand were played. History The club took on its present form following the merger of Stewart's College FP and Melville College FP in 1973 when the club became known as Stewart's Melville FP RFC. As the name suggests, many of the players in the club's history were former pupils of the Stewart's Melville College (formed in a merger of Daniel Stewart's College and Melville College) in Edinburgh. This remains the case today, although the club is now 'open' and welcomes players who did not attend the school. The 1st XV were coached by Grant MacKenzie, a P.E. teacher who worked at the school, and who died in 2008. In June 2014 the club resolved at an AGM to shorten the name to Stewart's Melville RFC. The club currently run three XVs on a regular basis. The 1st and 2nd XVs both play in competitive national leagues, with the 2nd XV currently in the second division of the reserve leagues.

History The centre is situated on what was originally Van Dyk's parent's chicken farm, which they acquired in 1950. Due to her compassionate nature, Ann soon had a collection of stray and injured animals on the farm. Then, in October 1968, a local farmer offered her two cheetah cubs, which she accepted. However, the cubs had been acquired without the necessary permits and, when they enquired about obtaining these permits, the cubs were confiscated and sent to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa in Pretoria. Meanwhile, the Zoo had already established a successful captive breeding programme, but further expansion was limited due to the lack of land available in its urban setting. Consequently, they had been considering acquiring a more rural breeding site. Ann and her eldest brother, Godfrey, thus offered to the Zoo management the use of their facilities for captive breeding programmes. This offer was accepted and the centre officially opened on 16 April 1971. Ann van Dyk received the gold medal Other breeding programmes Cape vulture at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre Subsequent to its cheetah breeding programme, the centre also established successful breeding programmes for several other rare and endangered species, including: * Wild dog * Brown hyena * Suni * Duiker * Cape vulture * Riverine rabbit Notable achievements The centre first achieved international recognition for bringing the cheetah back from the brink of extinction - it was largely due to the centre that the cheetah was removed from the endangered species list of the South African Red Data Book for Terrestrial Mammals in 1986. Its success can be seen from the fact that, since its inception, over 600 cheetah cubs have been born at the centre, which is a dramatic increase from the period when the total cheetah population of South Africa was estimated at only 700. In 2009, it was estimated that 800 cheetah cubs have been bred so far. In addition to its cheetah breeding success, the centre has also had other notable successes: * The first breeder of the rare king cheetah. As a result, it was proved that the king cheetah was not a separate species but genetically identical to the true cheetah, but only with a variation of coat pattern and colouring. * The breeding and release of captive-born African wild dog packs (southern Africa's most endangered carnivore), into a natural habitat. * A breeding nucleus of the highly endangered riverine rabbit has been donated to the Karoo National Park, a natural habitat of the species. * A breeding nucleus of the Suni antelope was donated to the Kruger National Park as a resulting of the centre's highly successful Suni breeding programme. Between 1975 and 2005, 242 litters were born with a total of 785 cubs. In a study done by Bertschinger, H. J., Meltzer, D. J. A., & Van Dyk, A.

The music of the song was composed by Sergio Ortega and the text written by Quilapay√∫n. The song was composed and recorded in June 1973.  History  The song was initially composed as an anthem for the popular unity government, reflecting the spirit behind the mass mobilization of working-class people who in 1970 had elected Salvador Allende for the socialist transformation of Chile. During Allende's campaign El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido was a frequent slogan.Corval√°n, Luis (2003) El gobierno de Salvador Allende, pp.111-2Wessel, G√ºnther (2002) Los Allende: con ardiente paciencia por un mundo mejor, pp.102-3 The song was interpreted and recorded by a number of music groups shortly after it was composed and performed publicly by Sergio Ortega and Quilapay√∫n. New Chilean Song music ensembles such as Vientos del Pueblo, Inti-illimani among others, made successful recordings of the song that filled the airways and the backgrounds of political rallies. After the U.S.-backed September 11, 1973 Chilean coup the song became the anthem of the Chilean resistance against the Pinochet regime, both within Chile and among the community of Chilean exiles and their political allies abroad. However, it was especially after Pinochet's September 1973 coup that the Chilean group Inti-Illimani made it famous around the world, after they published the song in the album La Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena. During the course of time the song has been used in various protests around the world, most of which have no direct connection to the Chilean coup or Latin America. The lyrics have been adapted or translated into many languages.  Versions  *In a more militant version, the phrase El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido is changed in the last verse to El pueblo armado jam√°s ser√° aplastado ‚Äî \\"The people armed will never be crushed\\". *In Portugal, especially from 1974 to 1977, pro-democracy, populist, centrist and left-wing groups (especially communists) sang a song called Portugal Ressuscitado (Resurrected Portugal), written by Ary dos Santos and sung by Fernando Tordo and an accompanying chorus. The song was recorded immediately after the Carnation RevolutionFernando Tordo - Wikip√©dia, a enciclop√©dia livre with the famous encore Agora o Povo Unido nunca mais ser√° vencido (Now the People United will never more be defeated). The song, though, had only very small similarities with the tune of the Chilean song during most of its structure except during the similar encore, and no lyrical similarity besides the spirit of popular struggle and the similar catchphrase/slogan. The song and the slogan are still quite popular and part of Portuguese collective memory.O Povo est√° desunido, por isso √© facilmente vencido...Segunda-feira, 16 de Julho de 2007, Est√° completamente apanhado!, Tubar√£o blogRecanto das Letras, Cenas de Um Sonho, 09/02/2009 06h54 comment *In Iran, the melody was used for a revolutionary song with Persian lyrics, entitled \\"Barpakhiz\\" (in English \\"Arise\\"), with encore !ÿ®ÿ± Ÿæÿß ÿÆ€åÿ≤ÿå ÿßÿ≤ ÿ¨ÿß ⁄©ŸÜÿå ÿ®ŸÜÿß€å ⁄©ÿßÿÆ ÿØÿ¥ŸÖŸÜ (Pronounced as Barpakhiz, az ja kan, banaye kakh-e doshman, Meaning: Arise, Demolish the Foundations of the Enemy's Palace!) by the Iranian leftist revolutionaries during the Revolution against the monarchy in 1979.

Hegesias (; fl. 290 BC) of Cyrene was a Cyrenaic philosopher. He argued that eudaimonia (happiness) is impossible to achieve, and that the goal of life should be the avoidance of pain and sorrow. Conventional values such as wealth, poverty, freedom, and slavery are all indifferent and produce no more pleasure than pain. Cicero claims that Hegesias wrote a book called ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÅœÑŒµœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ (Death by Starvation), which persuaded so many people that death is more desirable than life that Hegesias was banned from teaching in Alexandria. It has been thought by some that Hegesias was influenced by Buddhist teachings. Life Diogenes La√´rtius describes Hegesias as the pupil of Paraebates, who was a pupil of Epitimedes, who was a pupil of Antipater of Cyrene, who was a pupil of Aristippus (c. 435 ‚Äì c. 360 BC). He was the fellow-student of Anniceris, but he differed from Anniceris by presenting the system which Anniceris softened and improved in its most nihilistic form. Philosophy Hegesias followed Aristippus in considering pleasure as the goal of life; but, the view which he took of human life was more pessimistic. Happiness, he said, could not be the goal of life, because it is not attainable, and therefore concluded that the wise person's only goal should be to become free from pain and sorrow. Since, too, every person is self-sufficient, all external goods were rejected as not being true sources of pleasure. > Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many > sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled > when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we > cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness > eludes our grasp. Moreover, that both life and death are desirable. They > also say that there is nothing naturally pleasant or unpleasant, but that > owing to want, or rarity, or satiety, some people are pleased and some > vexed; and that wealth and poverty have no influence at all on pleasure, for > that rich people are not affected by pleasure in a different manner from > poor people. In the same way they say that slavery and freedom are things > indifferent, if measured by the standard of pleasure, and nobility and > baseness of birth, and glory and infamy. They add that, for the foolish > person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of > indifference; and that the wise person will do everything for his own sake; > for that he will not consider any one else of equal importance with himself; > and he will see that if he were to obtain ever such great advantages from > any one else, they would not be equal to what he could himself bestow. Hence the sage ought to regard nothing but himself; action is quite indifferent; and if action, so also is life, which, therefore, is in no way more desirable than death. > The wise person would not be so much absorbed in the pursuit of what is > good, as in the attempt to avoid what is bad, considering the chief good to > be living free from all trouble and pain: and that this end was attained > best by those who looked upon the efficient causes of pleasure as > indifferent. None of this, however, is as strong as the testimony of Cicero,Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones i. 34 who claims that Hegesias wrote a book called Death by Starvation (), in which a man who has resolved to starve himself is introduced as representing to his friends that death is actually more to be desired than life, and that the gloomy descriptions of human misery which this work contained were so overpowering that they inspired many people to kill themselves, in consequence of which the author received the surname of Death- persuader (Peisithanatos). This book was published at Alexandria, where he was, in consequence, forbidden to teach by king Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285-246 BC). =Indian connection= Buddhist proselytism at the time of king Ashoka (260‚Äì218 BC) according to the Edicts of Ashoka. Cyrene coin around the time of Hegesias, struck under Ophellas as Ptolemaic governor. Circa 322-313 BC. √Ü 19mm (8.14 gm). Horse running right; star above / NIKWNOS, six-spoked wheel. The philosophy of the Cyrenaics around the time of Hegesias of Cyrene evolved in a way that had similarities with Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and also Buddhism. The rulers of Cyrene around the time Hegesias flourished were Ophellas and then Magas, as governors of the Ptolemaic king of Egypt Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and from 276 BC Magas as independent king. Both Ptolemy and Magas are claimed to have been recipients of Buddhist missionaries from the Indian king Ashoka according to the latter's Edicts. Ashoka claimed in his rock edicts No13: The philosophy of Hegesias displays striking similarities with the tenets of Buddhism, in particular the Four Noble Truths and the concept of Dukkha or \\"suffering\\". It is therefore sometimes thought that Hegesias may have been directly influenced by Buddhist teachings through contacts with the alleged missionaries sent to his rulers in the 3rd century BC.

The main wars are detailed below. Gothic War (249‚Äì253) Map of the invasions 250-1 (Goths under Cniva against the Roman Empire) The War was probably instigated after emperor Decius' predecessor Philip the Arab had refused to continue payments of annual subsidies to the tribes of the region initiated by Emperor Maximinus Thrax in 238 while they were starving.Southern, Pat. The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine, Routledge, 2001. p. 347. The Goths were led by King Cniva who had crossed the Danube in 249 or 250 with two armies. Cniva's main column of 70,000 unsuccessfully attacked Novae and were then defeated by Decius at the Battle of Nicopolis ad Istrum before moving on to Augusta Traiana pursued by Decius where at the Battle of Beroe they defeated him and looted the city. Decius was forced to withdraw his army north to Oescus leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and move on to Philippopolis (Thracia) (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria).Barbarian Invasions in the Roman Provinces of Lower Moesia and Thrace in the mid- Third Century and the Coin Hoards from that Period, Varbin VaRBanoV, https://www.academia.edu/4234478/Barbarian_Invasions_in_the_Roman_Provinces_of_Lower_Moesia_and_Thrace_in_the_mid- _Third_Century_and_the_Coin_Hoards_from_that_Period._In_The_Lower_Danube_Roman_Limes_1st-6th_c._AD_Sofia_2012._ Another army of about 20,000 besieged Marcianopolis without success. Then they also headed south to besiege Philippopolis. The Battle of Philippopolis was fought in 250 or 251 and after a long siege of the city the Goths were victorious. King Cniva subsequently allied himself with the town commander and governor of Thrace, Titus Julius Priscus, to take on the Roman Emperor Decius. The Battle of Abritus of 251 resulted at which Decius and his son Herennius Etruscus were killed. Gothic War (267‚Äì269) Map of the invasions 267-9 (Goths and Scythians against the Roman Empire) During the \\"Crisis of the third century\\" when the Empire almost collapsed, the greatest Gothic invasion so far occurred in 268. The Goths' seaborne allies, the Heruli, supplied a fleet carrying huge armies along the coast of the Black Sea where they ravaged coastal territories in Thrace and Macedonia. Other huge forces crossed the Danube in Moesia. An invasion of Goths into the province of Pannonia was also threatening disaster. In 268, Emperor Gallienus won some important initial victories at land and sea, but it was his successor Claudius II who finally defeated the invaders at the Battle of Naissus in 268 or 269, one of the bloodiest battles of the 3rd century. The invaders incurred thirty to fifty thousand dead. Gothic War (367‚Äì369) (Thervingi against the Eastern Roman Empire) The Gothic king Ermanaric of a powerful kingdom north of the Danube from the Euxine to the Baltic Sea,Gibbon, Ibid. p. 890, 891 had engaged to supply the usurper Procopius with troops for the struggle against Valens. The Gothic army, reportedly numbering 30,000 men, arrived too late to help Procopius, but nevertheless invaded Thrace and began plundering the farms and vineyards of the province.Gibbon, Ibid. p. 892 Valens, marching north after defeating Procopius, surrounded them with a superior force and forced them to surrender. Emperor Valens‚Äô War with the Goths During 367-369 June 2016 DOI10.18503/1992-0431-2016-2-52-145-151 Sergey V. Yartsev In the spring of 367, Valens crossed the Danube and attacked the Visigoths under Athanaric. The Goths fled into the Carpathian Mountains, and the campaign ended with no decisive conclusion. The following spring, a Danube flood prevented Valens from crossing; instead he had his troops construct fortifications. In 369, Valens crossed again, from Noviodunum, and by devastating the country forced Athanaric to attack him. Valens was victorious, and Athanaric received Ermanaric's permission to conclude a truce. Athanaric pleaded for treaty terms and Valens gladly obliged. The treaty seems to have largely cut off relations between Goths and Romans, confining trade and the exchange of troops for tribute.Gibbon, Ibid. p. 893, 894 Gothic War (376‚Äì382) (Greuthungi and Thervingi against the Eastern Roman Empire) Between about 376 and 382 the Gothic War against the Eastern Roman Empire, and in particular the Battle of Adrianople, is commonly seen as important in the history of the Roman Empire, the first of a series of events over the next century that would see the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, although its ultimate importance to the Empire's eventual fall is still debated.Heather, 2005, p. 146.Wolfram, 1997, pp. 85‚Äì86. Gothic War (401‚Äì403) (Visigoths against the Western Roman Empire) In 401 Alaric invaded Italy, but he was defeated by Stilicho at Pollentia (modern Pollenza) on April6, 402. A second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the Battle of Verona, though Alaric forced the Roman Senate to pay a large subsidy to the Visigoths, and devastated Greece. Later, Alaric led the Sack of Rome (410). Gothic War (458) (Visigoths under Theodoric II against the Western Roman Empire under Majorian) In late 458 Majorian entered Septimania (now southern France) to attack Theodoric and reclaim the province for the empire. Majorian defeated Theodoric at the Battle of Arelate, forcing him to abandon Septimania and withdraw west to Aquitania. Under the new treaty with the Romans, the Visigoths had to relinquish their recent conquests in Hispania and return to federate status. Gothic War (461‚Äì476) (Visigoths under Theodoric II, then Euric, against the Western Roman Empire) Gothic War (535‚Äì554) (Ostrogoths against the Eastern Roman Empire under Justinian I) The Gothic War between the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman) during the reign of Emperor Justinian I and the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy took place from 535 until 554 in the Italian peninsula, Dalmatia, Sardinia, Sicily and Corsica. Historians commonly divide the war into two phases * From 535 to 540: ending with the fall of the Ostrogothic capital Ravenna and the apparent reconquest of Italy by the Byzantines. * From 540/541 to 553: a Gothic revival under Totila, suppressed only after a long struggle by the Byzantine general Narses, who also repelled an invasion in 554 by the Franks and Alamanni. In 554 Justinian promulgated the Pragmatic sanction which prescribed Italy's new government. Later, the Byzantines found themselves incapable of resisting an invasion by the Lombards in 568, which resulted in Constantinople permanently losing control over large parts of the Italian peninsula.

In preservation, it has carried the names 3rd (Volunteer) Battalion The Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment and The Sherwood Forester, though it never carried either of these in service.  Service  5231 was built by Armstrong-Whitworth in 1936 for the London, Midland & Scottish Railway. It spent most of its early career at Patricroft shed, working mainly to North Wales and Leeds. After nationalisation in 1948, it was renumbered 45231 by British Railways. 45231 was transferred to Northampton in October 1954, but was only officially there for a month -- such allocation changes were often only carried out on paper -- and then transferred to Aston, where it remained for nine years. 45231 was officially transferred to Rugby in February 1963, but was moved a short time later (July) to Chester. It stayed at Chester until closure of Chester shed in April 1967 when 45231 was then transferred to Speke Junction and finally Carnforth, where 45231 lasted until the last day of steam on BR in August 1968. It was sold by BR directly into preservation and was restored at Carnforth to LMS livery. This locomotive was one of a total of 842 with four of its class having the following names: 45154 Lanarkshire Yeomanry, 45156 Ayrshire Yeomanry, 45157 The Glasgow Highlander, and 45158 The Glasgow Yeomanry.  Preservation  Fort William station running around after hauling The Jacobite from Mallaig. After being initially preserved at Carnforth, 5231 became associated with the preserved Great Central Railway (GCR) in Leicestershire. In 1973, it hauled the official opening train between Loughborough and Quorn. Never having carried a name in BR service, the locomotive was nonetheless named 3rd (Volunteer) Battalion The Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment at Quorn on 9 May 1976. It was taken out of service the following year for an overhaul. 5231 was overhauled in Cornwall, and was complete in 1988, when it returned to the GCR. It was then moved to the Nene Valley Railway from 1989 until 1993, when it returned to the GCR for the filming of Shadowlands. 5231 was sold to the GCR in late 1996, who repainted it in BR lined black in 1997. It also acquired a new set of nameplates, this time more simply The Sherwood Forester. A very similar name was carried by LMS Royal Scot Class (4)6112 Sherwood Forester. 45231 emerged from an overhaul in 2005 and shortly after it was moved by road to the Mid Hants Railway. It eventually undertook a proving run on Sun 26 Jun from Alton to Fratton before entering mainline service later in the year. 45231 returned to traffic in 2013 after another major overhaul was carried out at Carnforth MPD. In March 2015, 45231 paid a visit to the Llangollen Railway to attend the Steel Steam & Stars IV gala which was running over 2 weekends from Fri 6 to Sun 8 Mar & Fri 13 to Sun 15 March. Due to the railway not being connected to the national network, it had to be moved by road from Carnforth and the entrance to the yard at Llangollen was very tight. During the first weekend of the gala, the locomotive was failed with cylinder problems and was not able to take part in the remainder of the gala, with the engine returning to Carnforth shortly after the gala finished. The locomotive was, until May 2015, owned by Bert Hitchen and after his death, the locomotive was taken into the care of the Hitchen family who looked after the engine until November 2015, when Jeremy Hosking purchased the locomotive from the Hitchen family. 45231 is currently based at Crewe Diesel TMD alongside a number of other mainline certified locomotives to help with charter trains. Its current mainline certificate expires in 2020 with the boiler certificate running out in 2023.  Fame in Preservation  45231 was used in the 40th anniversary special of the Fifteen Guinea Special on 10 August 2008. It worked alongside fellow class engine 45407 when they double headed the train from Carlisle back as far as Blackburn. 45231 then worked the train alone back to Liverpool Lime Street via Wigan. 2013 marked the 45th anniversary of the end of regular steam on British Railways in August 1968 and, because 11 August was on a Sunday, it was fitting that the special was to run on the exact day 45 years after the 1968 run. 45231 was one of the chosen engines to work two special one-off railtours in August. The first trip was on Wednesday 7 August, working one of Statesman Rail's Fellsman trains which was renamed for the occasion \\"The Fifteen Guinea Fellsman\\", which also had the 1T57 headboard fitted alongside the regular Fellsman headboard. It ran in double-headed form with sister engine 44932 from Lancaster to Carlisle and back via the Settle- Carlisle line both ways. Then on the Sunday of the same week, 11 August (the final day of regular steam on BR in 1968), 45231 was given the honour of double heading once again with sister 44932, but this time acting as pilot engine, and it carried the 1T57 Headboard for the occasion. Also for the trip, its \\"Sherwood Forester\\" nameplates were removed as the majority of Black 5s in BR days, apart from five, did not have nameplates fitted. 45231 & 44932 worked the Carlisle to Manchester via Hellifield and Darwen leg of the Railway Touring Company's \\"Fifteen Guinea Special\\" 45th anniversary train. Other engines that played roles in this special were a third sibling engine no 45305 (allocated to the original train in 1968 but replaced by 45110) which worked from Liverpool to Manchester and return via Warrington Central and 70013 Oliver Cromwell which worked the Manchester to Carlisle leg via Hellifield.  TPWS Isolation Incident  On 2 October 2015, The Sherwood Forester was working a West Coast Railways (WCR) special through Doncaster when it was noticed that its Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) had been isolated by the footplate crew. Previously, isolation of TPWS on a WCR operated locomotive had been a factor in the 2015 Wootton Bassett SPAD incident and the resultant suspension of WCRC's access to the network. As a result, in November 2015 a further prohibition notice was issued to WCRC by the Office of Rail & Road, suspending further steam services operated by them.

Glucose is then exported from the cell via glucose transporter membrane proteins. This catalysis completes the final step in gluconeogenesis and therefore plays a key role in the homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucose 6-phosphatase is a complex of multiple component proteins, including transporters for G6P, glucose, and phosphate. The main phosphatase function is performed by the glucose 6-phosphatase catalytic subunit. In humans, there are three isozymes of the catalytic subunit: glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ±, encoded by G6PC; IGRP, encoded by G6PC2; and glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤, encoded by G6PC3. Glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± and glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ are both functional phosphohydrolases, and have similar active site structure, topology, mechanism of action, and kinetic properties with respect to G6P hydrolysis. In contrast, IGRP has almost no hydrolase activity, and may play a different role in stimulating pancreatic insulin secretion. pdb 1IDQ) pdb 1IDQ) pdb 1IDQ) Structure and function Although a clear consensus has not been reached, a large number of scientists adhere to a substrate-transport model to account for the catalytic properties of glucose 6-phosphatase. In this model, glucose 6-phosphatase has a low degree of selectivity. The transfer of the glucose 6-phosphate is carried out by a transporter protein (T1) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains structures allowing the exit of the phosphate group (T2) and glucose (T3). Glucose 6-phosphatase consists of 357 amino acids, and is anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by nine transmembrane helices. Its N-terminal and active site are found on the lumen side of the ER and its C-terminus projects into the cytoplasm. Due to its tight association to the ER, the exact structure of glucose 6-phosphatase remains unknown. However, sequence alignment has shown that glucose 6-phosphatase is structurally similar to the active site of the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase found in Curvularia inaequalis. Based on pH kinetic studies of glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± catalysis, it was proposed that the hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate was completed via a covalent phosphohistidine glucose 6-phosphate intermediate. The active site of glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± was initially identified by the presence of a conserved phosphate signature motif usually found in lipid phosphatases, acid phosphatases, and vanadium haloperoxidases. Essential residues in the active site of vanadium haloperoxidases include: Lys353, Arg360, Arg490, His404, and His496. Corresponding residues in the active site of glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± include Arg170 and Arg83, which donate hydrogen ions to the phosphate, stabilizing the transition state, His119, which provides a proton to the dephosphorylated oxygen attached to glucose, and His176, which completes a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate to form a covalently bound phosphoryl enzyme intermediate. Within the Vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase, Lys353 was found to stabilize the phosphate in the transition state. However, the corresponding residue in glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± (Lys76) resides within the ER membrane and its function, if any, is currently undetermined. With the exception of Lys76, these residues are all located on the luminal side of the ER membrane. Glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ is a ubiquitously expressed, 346-amino acid membrane protein that shares 36% sequence identity with glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ±. Within the glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ enzyme, sequence alignments predict that its active site contains His167, His114, and Arg79. Similar to that of the glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± active site, His167 is the residue that provides the nucleophilic attack, and His114, and Arg79 are the hydrogen donors. Glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ is also localized in the ER membrane, although its orientation is unknown. Mechanism The hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate begins with a nucleophilic attack on the sugar-bound phosphate by His176 resulting in the formation of a phosphohistidine bond and the degradation of a carbonyl. A Negatively charged oxygen then transfers its electrons reforming a carbonyl and breaking its bond with glucose. The negatively charged glucose-bound oxygen is then protonated by His119 forming a free glucose. The phospho-intermediate produced by the reaction between His176 and the phosphate group is then broken by a hydrophilic attack; after the addition of another hydroxide and the decomposition of a carbonyl, the carbonyl is reformed kicking off the electrons originally donated by the His176 residue thereby creating a free phosphate group and completing the hydrolysis. File:Sdfh.gif Expression Genes coding for the enzyme are primarily expressed in the liver, in the kidney cortex and (to a lesser extent) in the Œ≤-cells of the pancreatic islets and intestinal mucosa (especially during times of starvation). According to Surholt and Newsholme, Glc 6-Pase is present in a wide variety of muscles across the animal kingdom, albeit at very low concentrations. Thus, the glycogen that muscles store is not usually available for the rest of the body's cells because glucose 6-phosphate cannot cross the sarcolemma unless it is dephosphorylated. The enzyme plays an important role during periods of fasting and when glucose levels are low. It has been shown that starvation and diabetes induces a two- to threefold increase in glucose 6-phosphatase activity in the liver. Glc 6-Pase activity also increases dramatically at birth when an organism becomes independent of the mothers source of glucose. The human Glc 6-Pase gene contains five exons spanning approximately 125.5 kb DNA located on chromosome 17q21. Clinical significance Mutations of the glucose 6-phosphatase system, to be specific the glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± subunit (glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ±), glucose 6-transporter (G6PT), and glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ (glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ or G6PC3) subunits lead to deficiencies in the maintenance of interprandial glucose homeostasis and neutrophil function and homeostasis. Mutations in both glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ± and G6PT lead to glycogen storage disease type I (GSD 1, von Gierke's disease). To be specific, mutations in the glucose-6-phosphatase-Œ± lead to Glycogen Storage Disease Type-1a, which is characterized by accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys, resulting in hepatomegaly and renomegaly. GSD-1a constitutes approximately 80% of GSD-1 cases that present clinically. Absence of G6PT leads to GSD-1b (GSD-1b), which is characterized by the lack of a G6PT and represents 20% of the cases that present clinically. Breakdown of the various constituents of glucose 6-phosphatase system deficiency The specific cause of the GSD-1a stems from nonsense mutations, insertions/deletions with or without a shift in the reading frame, or splice site mutations that occur at the genetic level. The missense mutations affect the two large luminal loops and transmembrane helices of glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ±, abolishing or greatly reducing activity of the enzyme. The specific cause of GSD-1b stems from \\"severe\\" mutations such as splice site mutations, frame-shifting mutations, and substitutions of a highly conserved residue that completely destroyed G6PT activity. These mutations lead to the prevalence of GSD-1 by preventing the transport of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into the luminal portion of the ER and also inhibiting the conversion of G6P into glucose to be used by the cell. The third type of glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency, glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ deficiency, is characterized by a congenital neutropenia syndrome in which neutrophils exhibit enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, increased apoptosis, impaired energy homeostasis, and impaired functionality. It can also lead to cardiac and urogenital malformations. This third class of deficiency is also affected by a G6PT deficiency as glucose-6-phosphatase-Œ≤ also lies within the ER lumen and thus can lead to similar symptoms of glucose-6-phosphatase-Œ≤ deficiency be associated with GSD-1b. Furthermore, recent studies have elucidated this area of similarity between both deficiencies and have shown that aberrant glycosylation occurs in both deficiencies. The neutrophil glycosylation has a profound effect on neutrophil activity and thus may also be classified as a congenital glycosylation disorder as well. The major function of glucose 6-phosphatase-Œ≤ has been determined to provide recycled glucose to the cytoplasm of neutrophils in order maintain normal function. Disruption of the glucose to G6P ratio due to significant decrease intracellular glucose levels cause significant disruption of glycolysis and HMS. Unless countered by uptake of extracellular glucose this deficiency leads to neutrophil dysfunction. Vanadium compounds such as vanadyl sulfate have been shown to inhibit the enzyme, and thus increase the insulin sensitivity in vivo in diabetics, as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, which may have potential therapeutic implications  See also  * Hexokinase * G6PC * G6PC2 * G6PC3 Notes Molecular graphics images were produced using UCSF Chimera.

The engagement, largely uneventful, took place on 17 December 1941, south-east of Malta, in the Gulf of Sirte. In the following days, two Royal Navy forces based at Malta ran into an Italian minefield off Tripoli and two British battleships were disabled by Italian manned torpedoes at Alexandria. By the end of December, the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean had shifted in favour of the Italian Fleet. Background The British Eighth Army and the Axis armies in North Africa were engaged in battles resulting from Operation Crusader, which had been fought between 18 November and 4 December. Its aim was to defeat the Afrika Korps and relieve the siege of Tobruk. This had been achieved and Axis forces were conducting a fighting retreat; by 13 December, they were holding a defensive line at Gazala, east of Benghazi.Greene & Massignani pp.196‚Äì204 The Axis were desperate to supply their forces, intending to transport stores to Tripoli, their main port in Libya and Benghazi, the port closest to the front line. The island garrison of Malta was under siege and the British wanted to supply their forces on the island. Prelude =Axis convoys M41 and M42= The Italians were preparing to send M41, a convoy of eight ships, to Africa on 13 December 1941. That morning, their previous supply attempt, two fast cruisers carrying fuel to Tripoli, had failed when both ships were sunk at the Battle of Cape Bon by a force of destroyers en route to Alexandria. Convoy M41 consisted of eight merchant ships in three groups, with a close escort of five destroyers and a distant cover force of the battleships, and , four destroyers and two torpedo boats. Soon after sailing on 13 December, a group of M41 was attacked by the British submarine and two ships were sunk; later that day two ships collided and had to return to base, while the distant cover force was sighted by the submarine and Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed and forced to return to port. Supermarina the Italian navy high command, rattled by these losses and a report that a British force of two battleships was at sea, ordered the ships to return to await reinforcement but the \\"force of two battleships\\" was a decoy operation by the minelayer .Grove pp.72‚Äì74 On 16 December, the four-ship Italian convoy, renamed M42, left Taranto, picking up escorts along the way. The close escort was provided by seven destroyers and a torpedo boat; by the time they reached Sicily they were also accompanied by a close cover force, comprising the battleship , three light cruisers and three destroyers. The distant covering force consisted of the battleships Littorio, and , two cruisers and 10 destroyers. = Allied convoy = The British planned to run supplies to Malta using the fast merchant ship Breconshire, covered by a force of cruisers and destroyers, while the destroyers from the Cape Bon engagement, would proceed to Alexandria from Malta covered by Force K and Force B from Malta on 15 December. The British force was depleted when the light cruiser was torpedoed and sunk by , just before midnight on 14 December.Brown pp. 54‚Äì55 U-557 was accidentally sunk less than 48 hours later, by the Italian torpedo boat Orione.Blair pp. 400, 736 On 15 December, Breconshire sailed from Alexandria escorted by three cruisers and eight destroyers under Rear-Admiral Philip Vian in . On 16 December, the four destroyers of 4th Flotilla (Commander G. Stokes in ) left Malta, covered by Force K (Captain W. G. \\"Bill\\" Agnew in ), two cruisers and two destroyers. Thirty Italian warships were escorting four cargo ships. The two British groups were also at sea and steaming toward each other; the opposing forces were likely to cross each other's tracks east of Malta on 18 December. Battle On 17 December, an Italian reconnaissance aircraft spotted the British west-bound formation near Sidi Barrani, apparently proceeding from Alexandria to intercept the Italian convoy. The British convoy was shadowed by Axis aeroplanes and attacked during the afternoon but no hits were scored and Agnew and Stokes met the west-bound convoy. By late afternoon the Italian fleet was close by and spotter planes from the battleships had made contact with the British convoy, but the planes misidentified Breconshire as a battleship.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940-1943, p. 342. At 17:42, the fleets sighted each other; Admiral Angelo Iachino‚Äîcommander of the Italian forces‚Äîmoved to intercept to defend his convoy. Vian also wished to avoid combat, so with the British giving ground and the Italians pursuing with caution, the British were easily able to avoid an engagement. Just after sunset, an air attack on the British ships caused them to return fire with their anti-aircraft guns, allowing the Italian naval force to spot them. Iachino took in the distant covering force and opened fire at about , well out of range of the British guns. Vian immediately laid smoke and moved to the attack while Breconshire moved away, escorted by the destroyers and . Lacking radar and mindful of their defeat in the night action at the Battle of Cape Matapan, the Italians wished to avoid night combat. The Italians fired for only 15 minutes before disengaging and returning westward to cover convoy M42. suffered the loss of one seaman and some damage due to a near-miss either from an shell, possibly fired by the Italian cruiser or by shell splinters fired by Andrea Doria and Giulio Cesare, knocking down wireless aerials and holing the hull, superstructure and ship's boats. According to Italian sources, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) destroyer was also damaged by near-misses from the Italian destroyer Maestrale.Bragadin, p. 149 British reports tell of other warships punctured by splinters.O¬¥Hara (2009), p. 158 Aftermath =Minefield off Tripoli= After dark, Vian to return with Stokes to Alexandria, leaving Agnew to bring Breconshire to Malta, joined by Force B, one cruiser (the other was under repair) and two destroyers. Breconshire and her escorts arrived in Malta at 15:00 on 18 December. At midday, the Italian force also split up and three ships headed for Tripoli, accompanied by the close cover force, while the German supply ship Ankara, headed for Benghazi. The distant cover force remained on station in the Gulf of Sidra until evening, before heading back to base. The British had now realised that the Italians had a convoy in the area; Vian searched for it without success as he returned to Alexandria. In the afternoon, the position of the Tripoli group was established; a cruiser and two destroyers of Force B and two cruisers and two destroyers of Force K (Captain O'Conor, on the cruiser ) sortied at 18:00 to intercept. The force ran into a minefield off Tripoli, in the early hours of 19 December. The minefield took the British by surprise as the water-depth was , which they had thought was too deep for mines. Neptune struck four mines and sank, the destroyer struck a mine and was scuttled the following day. The cruisers Aurora and were badly damaged but were able to return to Malta. About 830 Allied seamen, many of them New Zealanders from Neptune, lost their lives in the disaster. The Malta Strike Force, which had been such an active threat to Axis shipping to Libya during most of 1941, was much reduced in its effectiveness and was later forced to withdraw to Gibraltar.Bartimeus p.195 =Attack on Alexandria= While steaming back to Alexandria along with Vian's force, destroyer reported an apparently successful depth-charge attack on an unidentified submarine.Bartimeus p.190 The only axis submarine off Alexandria was the Italian , which was carrying a group of six Italian frogmen commandos, including Luigi Durand De La Penne, equipped with manned torpedoes. Shortly after Vian's force arrived in Alexandria, on the night of 18 December, the Italians penetrated the harbour and attacked the fleet. Jervis was damaged, a large Norwegian tanker disabled and the battleships and were severely damaged. This was a strategic change of fortune against the Allies whose effects were felt in the Mediterranean for several months. Results Both sides achieved their strategic objectives; the British got supplies through to Malta and the Axis got their ships through to Tripoli and Benghazi, although Benghazi fell to the Eighth Army five days later, on 24 December.

Set in a vast chemical plant, during a brutal terrorist plot, the game follows the actions of the six playable characters; three Special Forces members, a security guard, a secretary, and a cameraman. Set over twelve hours, the feel of the game, storywise, is similar in style to the TV series 24. Without Warning was developer Circle Studio's only video game, before the company began focusing on DVD games as opposed to console games. Despite relatively high expectations during development, given the developers' previous work on the Tomb Raider series, upon release, it received generally negative feedback by most game critics. Most complaints centered on the glitchy AI and numerous other technical inadequacies, coupled with a poor storyline and characters. Gameplay Gameplay of Without Warning varies depending on which character is being played. In the case of the Special Forces members and the security guard, gameplay is generally fast-paced, as is often the case with arcade- style shooters. While the game features a dedicated cover system, there is little emphasis on tactical combat, with the best approach often being simply to eliminate all enemies as quickly as possible. Despite the core gameplay of the four characters being largely alike, they all have small differences between them. These involve exclusive objectives for each character, making their gameplay differ slightly from each other. There are also minor differences between the weapons of each character, which in turn affects the gameplay of each as well. The remaining two characters rely far more on stealth over action. The secretary has only the option to stun enemies either with pepper spray or a fire extinguisher, rather than killing them outright. This is often largely ineffective, and as such, generally the secretary must proceed throughout the chemical plant without alerting the terrorists. The gameplay for the cameraman is largely the same, although with this character, the player has the option to attempt to kill terrorists with a gun. A more notable difference, however, is that the cameraman is required to film various activities committed throughout the chemical plant by the terrorists using his camera, exposing himself to danger. Plot The story begins with a Special Forces unit being briefed on a terrorist takeover of a chemical plant, led by a man known as Derbec. The Special Forces unit, consisting of veteran Kyle Rivers, rookie Jack Hooper, bomb expert Ed Reagan, and two others, soon prepares to infiltrate the plant. Elsewhere, news cameraman Ben Harrison begins to head to the chemical plant as well, via helicopter. Inside the plant, secretary Tanya Shaw and security guard Dave Wilson quickly comprehend the situation, both managing to evade the terrorists before they can kill them or take them as hostages. Upon reaching the chemical plant, the two minor Special Forces members are killed in a terrorist ambush, and the remaining three are separated from each other. They quickly continue forward through the plant. Meanwhile, Dave soon finds a colleague and friend of his shot dead within the plant. Vowing revenge, he decides to eliminate the terrorists throughout the facility. Elsewhere, Tanya tries to sneak out of the chemical plant, successfully managing to reach a large courtyard. She signals to the helicopter carrying Ben, in hope of being rescued, but as it approaches her, it is shot down by a terrorist. It is, however, revealed that Ben has managed to survive the crash. More concerned about winning the Pulitzer prize as opposed to his own safety, Ben's obsession pushes him throughout the chemical plant, filming the activities of the terrorists with his camera, rather than trying to escape. With the Special Forces unit soon discovering that numerous sections of the chemical plant are rigged to blow, Ed begins to defuse them, while Jack starts rewiring electrical boxes throughout the plant to allow the team access to all areas. Meanwhile, Kyle continues to try and regain control of the plant. Eventually, Ed succumbs to a bomb as he fails to defuse it in time. With the bomb expert dead, the task of defusing the bombs is given to Jack. Tanya eventually manages to escape the plant without harm, while elsewhere, as Dave continues to repel the terrorists, he is injured by a grenade. Unable to move, the terrorists are about to finish him off when Kyle reaches him and fends them off. Still wounded, however, Dave has no choice but to stay where he is as Kyle leaves him to continue through the plant. Eventually, it is revealed that Derbec's reason for taking over the plant are simply about revenge, and that he had intended to blow up the plant from the beginning. With this new insight, Jack races against time to defuse the bombs before the terrorists finish planting them and detonate them, while Kyle continues to hunt down Derbec. With Ben satisfied with the footage he has collected, including footage showing Derbec's current whereabouts, he progresses to a computer in order to upload them to the Internet and show them to the world. Just as he is about confirm his upload, he is discovered by a terrorist, who subsequently holds him at gunpoint. Briefly considering his options, Ben soon opts to confirm his upload as opposed to surrendering, resulting in his death. With Ben's footage now showing all over the world, Kyle heads over to where Derbec was reported to have been last seen. However, he is eventually injured in ambush. Unable to fight, he is approached by Derbec, who has come out of hiding now that the threat of Kyle is over. Kyle remains strong-willed against the terrorist leader, but Derbec soon shoots him in the head. Having disarmed the bomb threat, Jack decides to go after Derbec. Despite heavy resistance from what's left of Derbec's terrorists, he manages to eliminate them all and confront Derbec. Jack wins the ensuing gunfight, and with the terrorist threat finally over, Jack extracts himself and Dave out of the chemical plant, where aid is waiting for them outside.

It was originally released in 1978, and in 2005 was the fifth Schulze album reissued by Revisited Records. On X Schulze attempted to execute a concept album of six \\"musical biographies\\" evoking contemporary or historical intellectuals with an influence on Schulze: Friedrich Nietzsche, Georg Trakl, Frank Herbert, Friedemann Bach, Ludwig II. von Bayern, and Heinrich von Kleist. (In Ludwig II. von Bayern Schulze uses a theme borrowed from the third movement of Vivaldi's Concerto No. 11 in D minor (RV565) for 2 violins, cello and strings.) The work is from the classic era of Berlin School. For two of the tracks, \\"Friedemann Bach\\" and \\"Ludwig II. von Bayern\\" (as well as the first few minutes of \\"Heinrich von Kleist\\") Schulze recorded a modest string orchestra and looped them on tape. He had done this in 1972 on his first solo album, Irrlicht, but this time he did not filter the orchestra beyond recognition. The mixture of classical music and unearthly electronic sounds gives X a much more organic sound than anything Schulze's contemporaries were doing at the time, such as Jean Michel Jarre's Equinoxe.

He was a prominent member of the House of Eggenberg and gained the title of Duke of Krumau.  Biography  Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg may only have been of simple parentage and had a Protestant upbringing, but by his own means, he succeeded in becoming one of the most influential Catholic princes in the Holy Roman Empire within just a few decades, outshining even his successful cousin, Ruprecht von Eggenberg. His career, however, developed too quickly and too successfully for it to go unnoticed and unenvied. Contemporaries and historians have had differing opinions regarding Eggenberg's character: seeing him as a man ... who is successful at everything he does, a fellow of good fortune, with a reputation of being completely loyal to the Emperor, highly gifted and reliable, but also a corrupt and slippery customer. Both contemporaries and historians are, however, in agreement about his brilliant diplomatic talent, his personal charm and cleverness, and his extraordinary manner of dealing with people. Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg was born in June 1568 in Graz and had a Protestant upbringing. However, little is known about his childhood and youth. In 1583, he traveled to T√ºbingen, the heartland of German Protestantism, to study at the renowned Protestant university, T√ºbinger Stift, where he received a profound education. A famous associate of Hans Ulrich's, Johannes Kepler, also received a first-rate education at the T√ºbinger Stift and went on to write his first work, Mysterium Cosmographicum, while teaching in Graz. The intellectual dimensions of this education were to later form the basis of the complex programmatic orientations of his new residence, Schloss Eggenberg. After completing his studies, he embarked on the Grand Tour, a long educational journey undertaken by young noblemen of the period, which took him through the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy. After the death of his father in 1594, he returned to Graz to take over the safeguarding and administration of his estate and then soon began his career at the Court of Archduke Ferdinand in Graz. To be able to serve at court, he had had to convert to the Catholic faith and subsequently also supported the strict counter-reformatory policies of the Archduke. Hans Ulrich's influence became ever stronger at the Inner Austrian court due to interventions by the Archduchess Maria of Bavaria, Ferdinand's mother. Although ten years his senior, Eggenberg soon became Ferdinand's closest friend and confidant, a relationship that was to last all his life. With Eggenberg's help, Archduke Ferdinand was elected Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation in 1619. In his positions as the President of the Geheimrat (Privy Council) and Lord Chamberlain to his new Emperor, Hans Ulrich, the son of a merchant family from Graz, had risen to become one of the most significant and influential statesmen of his time during the period of the Thirty Years' War. Being something akin to a prime minister according to contemporary political understanding,Die F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren. 1965, p. 90. it is said that between the years of 1619 to 1634, Ferdinand II never made one single significant political decision without seeking the advice of his friend Hans Ulrich,Schloss Eggenberg. 2006, p. 43. who remained loyal to him throughout the whole of this highly confusing and turbulent period and also throughout the rest of his life. Eggenberg Palace, built 1625-35, entry portal with the Eggenberg arms The grateful Emperor rewarded his loyal adviser by bestowing on him the highest honors and ranks of the realm. In 1598, his cousin Ruprecht von Eggenberg and the entire Eggenberg family, including Hans Ulrich, were elevated into the Freiherrnstand (Baron's Estate).Die F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren. 1965, p. 44. In 1620, King Philip III of Spain named Hans Ulrich a Knight of the Golden Fleece. In 1623, Hans Ulrich received a promotion into the Reichsf√ºrstenstand, and the Eggenbergs were from then on of princely rank.Die F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren. 1965, p. 91. By 1628, Hans Ulrich was also named Duke of Krumau. Hans Ulrich reached the pinnacle of his career in 1625 when he was made Gubernator (Governor) of Inner Austria. From this point on, he ruled \\"in the name of the Emperor\\" the Inner Austrian Patrimonial Lands with absolute power comparable only to an archdukeDie F√ºrsten und Freiherren zu Eggenberg und ihre Vorfahren. 1965, p. 95. in political, legal and military matters. He was the only non-Habsburg governor to have ever been awarded and exercised such a position. He was largely responsible for the return to imperial service of Albrecht von Wallenstein, and retired from public life after Wallenstein's assassination. His office also prompted him to commission the conversion of the medieval family castle on the western edge of Graz into a new and glorious residence, Schloss Eggenberg, to appropriately represent his new status.Schloss Eggenberg. 2006, p. 85. Unfortunately, he died of severe gout in October 1634, before the palace was completed. Alongside his four daughters, Hans Ulrich also produced a male heir to the Eggenberg dynasty, Johann Anton I, who succeeded in attaining a position even his illustrious father had failed to attain: a seat among the princes of the empire in the Reichstag. Seal of Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg As an imperial minister, Hans Ulrich had skilfully succeeded in guiding his master on the throne despite facing numerous dangers and constant upheavals during these times of great change. He slowly and consistently worked on his ideas of a united \\"empire\\", which he saw as a strengthened central imperial power, at the expense of the feudal interests of the old noble families and the desire for autonomy of the princes of the realm. This way, he became one of the major architects of the absolutist Habsburg state, which was to dominate and shape the century to come. In Austria, Hans Ulrich has left a historical legacy behind. His masterpiece, Schloss Eggenberg, was the main motif on one of the most famous silver collectors coins: the 10 euro Eggenberg Palace coin minted on 10 September 2002. On 1 August 2010, UNESCO expanded the registry listing of the City of Graz - Historic Centre to include Schloss Eggenberg among the World Cultural Heritage Sites.

It is also used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint. Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as random decisions. For example, during the 1973 oil crisis, Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even. The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people. Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their surname in alphabetical order, a non-random yet an arbitrary method‚Äîat least in cases where surnames are irrelevant. Philosophy Arbitrary actions are closely related to teleology, the study of purpose. Actions lacking a telos, a goal, are necessarily arbitrary. With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike. Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of arbitrary may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose (such as the examples above for the purposes of establishing discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations). Nihilism is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that every choice is arbitrary.Magnus, Bernd (1971). \\"Nihilism, Reason, and \\"The Good\\".\\" The Review of Metaphysics. 25 (2):292-310. According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made. Many brands of theism, the belief in a deity or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that nothing is arbitrary. In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that. Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose. This is somewhat related to the argument from design‚Äîthe argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe. Arbitrariness is also related to ethics, the philosophy of decision-making. Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary. Rationalism holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well. All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one \\"feels\\" what is right. Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general. In semiotics, the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, Saussure introduced the notion of arbitrariness according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or signifier), and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or signified) as a mental concept or real object. Linguistics The principle of semiotic arbitrariness refers to the idea that social convention is what imbues meaning to a given semiosis (any activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the production of meaning) or sign. Mathematics A logical symbol is a fundamental concept in logic, tokens of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. In mathematics, arbitrary corresponds to the term \\"any\\" and the universal quantifier \\\\forall, as in an arbitrary division of a set or an arbitrary permutation of a sequence. Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases, but that one may select any available choice and the statement will still hold. For example, one might say that: :\\"Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an even number.\\" Even further, the implication of the use of \\"arbitrary\\" is that generality will hold‚Äîeven if an opponent were to choose the item in question. In which case, arbitrary can be regarded as synonymous to worst-case.Tel, G√©rard (2000). Introduction to distributed algorithms. Cambridge University Press. p. 245. Law Arbitrary comes from the Latin arbitrarius, the source of arbiter; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.Online Etymology Dictionary: \\"'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‚Äòcapricious‚Äô (1646) and ‚Äòdespotic‚Äô (1642).‚Äù An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by law.Curtis, Thomas. The London Encyclopaedia, page 565 (1829): ‚ÄúArbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.‚Äù In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the constitution. Article 9 of the Swiss Federal Constitution theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation. The Federal Authorities of the Swiss Confederation. The US Supreme Court has overturned laws for having \\"no rational basis.\\" A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as refugee roulette. Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines arbitrariness as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any \\"actions contrary to the order presented by a law\\".

She‚Äôs considered as an artist of the ‚ÄúGeneration of 1927‚Äù within the Spanish avant- garde movement. Biography Mallo was the fourth daughter of fourteen children born to Justo G√≥mez Mallo (Customs Corps Official and native of Madrid) and Mar√≠a del Pilar Gonz√°lez Lorenzo (of Galician descent), born in Viveiro, Galicia, on 5 January 1902. She is the older sister of sculptor Cristino Mallo (born in Tui in 1905). Early Years When she was a young girl, Mallo would alternate between living with parents and her aunt (Juliana Lastres Carrer) and uncle (Ramiro Gonzalez Lorenzo). While living with her aunt and uncle at a young age, she felt inspired to create and express herself through artwork. After the birth of one of her brothers, the family moved to Avil√©s, where they remained from 1913-1922. In 1922 at age 20, Mallo‚Äôs family moved to Madrid. There, she began to study at the San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts, where she stayed until 1926. ^2. In Madrid she met artists, writers, and scientists from the Spanish Generation ‚Äô27 like Salvador Dal√≠, Concha M√©ndez, Ernesto Gim√©nez Caballero, Gregorio Prieto, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Margarita Manso, Luis Bu√±uel, Mar√≠a Zambrano, and Rafael Alberti, with whom she maintained a relationship until he met Mar√≠a Teresa Le√≥n. She went on to form a group of women from the Generation of ‚Äô27 known as ‚ÄúLas sin sombrero‚Äù (‚ÄúThose without hats‚Äù). ^5 In particular, she was friends with Concha M√©ndez and Josefina Canarias. During the 1920‚Äôs, Mallo also worked on numerous literary publications and produced several books. ^2 Author Ortega y Gasset recognized her paintings in 1928 and organized her first exhibit of the Revista de occidente, which was very successful, ^4 praised for its originality and freshness. It displayed ten oil paintings representing towns full of sun, bullfighters and women from Madrid, as well as colored prints of machinery, sports, and cinema from the beginning of the century. The exhibit was a starting point from which Mallo was judged for her work and not her gender. During this time, Mallo‚Äôs paintings followed the theme of new objectivity or magic realism, theorized by Franz Roh in his book Magic Realism in 1925. According to biographer Shirley Mangini, \\"Although historians of Spanish avant-garde art locate the origins of the movement in the activities of Salvador Dal√≠, Luis Bu√±uel, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, and another student at the Residencia, Jos√© Bello, Mallo's artistic vision was an important catalyst in the Spanish avant-garde movement.\\" Her paintings of the 1920s represent urban entertainments and sports, composed in complex overlapping arrangements that express the dynamism of modern life. These works, such as La Verbena (The Festival) of 1927, combine sharply defined, smoothly modeled forms with bright colors. The Thirties and the Second Spanish Republic Mallo‚Äôs work became more surrealistic in the early 1930s, including geometric visual language and themes that ranged from fruits to agricultural structures as well as creating ceramic disks with themes of fish and bulls. Mallo collaborated intensely with Rafael Alberti starting in 1931. In those years she painted the series Cloacas (Sewers) y Campanarios (Belfries). Her first exhibit in Paris took place in the Pierre Loeb Gallery in 1932. There she began her surrealist stage. She returned to Madrid in 1933 and actively participated in the Society of Iberic Artists. This was the beginning of a period in which Mallo‚Äôs interests emphasized geometric order and nature‚Äôs intricacies. In that same year, Mallo, committed to the Second Spanish Republic, started teaching as a drawing professor at the Institute of Ar√©valo, in the School Institute of Madrid, and at the Ceramics School of Madrid, for which she designed a series of dishes that no longer exist, and where she learned mathematic and geometric concepts to use in ceramics. She frequently spent time with Miguel Hern√°ndez, with whom she maintained a romantic relationship. They also planned the drama Los hijos de la piedra (The sons and the stone) together, which was inspired by the events of Casas Viejas. From 1936, she began her constructive age, while still exhibiting with surrealist painters in London and Barcelona. She participated as a teacher in the Pedagogical Missions, which brought her closer to her homeland, Galicia, which after a few months was surprised by the Spanish Civil War. In May 1936 her third individual exhibit took place, organized by ADLAN in the Center of Studies and Information of the Construction in the Career of Saint Jer√≥nimo of Madrid with a series of sixteen paintings from Cloacas y Campanarios, the series of twelve works from Arquitecturas minerales y vegetales (Mineral and vegetable architectures), and sixteen drawings from Instrucciones rurales (Rural instructions), which was published in 1949 in the Clan Library with a prologue from Jean Cassou. She then had an exhibit with √Ångel Planells of international surrealism in London‚Äôs New Burlington Galleries. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Mallo fled to Portugal. All of her ceramic work from this time was destroyed in the war. Later, Gabriela Mistral, who at the time was ambassador of Chile in Portugal, helped Mallo move to Buenos Aires, where she received an invitation by the Friends of Art Association to give a series of conferences about a popular theme in Spanish art, ‚ÄúHistorical process in the way of the plastic arts,‚Äù in Montevideo and later in Buenos Aires. Exile When the Spanish Civil War erupted, Mallo went into exile in Argentina. In Argentina, Mallo quickly received acknowledgement through her collaboration with the avant-garde magazine Sur, in which Borges also participated. This was an age in her life that she dedicated to travel, living between Uruguay and Buenos Aires to design, paint, and ultimately to create. She also held exhibits in Paris, Brazil and New York. Her first work there continued the path she initiated with Sorpresa del trigo (Wheat surprise) with works like Arquitectura humana (Human Architecture), Canto de espigas (Wheat ears), and Mensaje del mar (Message from the Sea). In the series Las M√°scaras (The Masks), Mallo was directly inspired by the syncretic cults of the Americas. She found herself in this moment with her friend Alfonso Reyes, ambassador to Mexico in Argentina, with whom she would remain until 1938, the year in which she returned to Mexico. On 2 August 1938, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca‚Äôs Cantata en la tumba (Cantata in the tomb) premiered with Alfonso Reyes and music by Jaume Pahissa and scenography by Mallo. In 1939 she traveled to Santiago, Chile, where she was invited to speak in several conferences. From her time in Buenos Aires, the Museum of Drawing and Illustration now treasures a collection of two of Mallo‚Äôs temperas on paper representing half-real and half-fantastical animals. At 36, she published the book Lo popular en la pl√°stica espa√±ola a trav√©s de mi obra (What is popular in Spanish art because of my work) (1939) and began to paint portraits of women, whose style is a precursor to pop art in the United States. In 1942 the book Maruja Mallo was published with a prologue by Ram√≥n G√≥mez de la Serna. Between 1945 and 1957, Mallo had a dark period; her public appearances and exhibits were rarer. In 1945, she went to Chile and traveled along the Vi√±a del Mar and the Isla de Pascua (Easter Island), together with Pablo Neruda, looking for inspiration for a request for a mural for a theater in Los Angeles from Buenos Aires, which was inaugurated in October the same year. On 11 October 1948, Mallo left Argentina and moved to New York. In March 1950 she exhibited in the Galerie Silvangi in Paris and, in 1959, in the Bonino gallery in Buenos Aires. Finally, she traveled from New York to Madrid to return to Spain in 1962, after 25 years of exile. Return to Spain In October 1962, Mallo completed an exhibit in the Mediterranean gallery. In Madrid in the 1980s, Mallo painted many amazing works in her geometric style, like Acr√≥batas (Acrobats) and Protozoarios (Protazoa). It was not until recently that Mallo was even slightly mentioned in Spanish texts on art and cultural history. Instead of being acknowledged for her artistic work, during exile she was remembered for instances in her life that did not matter: Affairs, scandalous behavior, and riding into church on a bicycle during mass. However, eventually the respect her work was given in Argentina followed into Spain, and she was even asked to speak about her own art, and the evolution of western art. It is said that \\"Mallo [would] shock her contemporaries with her avant-garde art, she would cause distress among them because she refused to conform to any of the rules the patriarchy attempted to impose on women.\\" 6 February 1995, Mallo died in Madrid at 93 years old. Art Influence In a biography by Shirley Mangini, the author notes that \\"it is significant that Mallo's early memories were of street fairs, since they are the subject of her first major series of paintings, Las Verbenas. \\"Mallo's art was influenced by when she first saw the Pacific Ocean. The era of intense political, social, cultural and economic change in which Mallo grew up also inspired her artwork.It caused her to display a new language that celebrates the female body and sexuality. Her goal was to present women as active members of society and not just muses of sexuality, beauty, and objects. Mallo also began using gender references in her paintings as she painted androgynous figures and large mythical females that signaled her freedom from the male-dominated artistic world of Madrid. Awards and Recognition In 1979, Mallo began pictorial age with Los moradores del vacio (The dwellers of the void). She was already 77, but still had the freshness and vitality that was present in all of her life. In the 80s was offered various exhibits and awards: * The Medal of Gold for honor in the Fine Arts, known as Minister of Culture in 1982 * The Award for Plastic Arts in Madrid, 1982 * In 1990 she received the Gold Medal for Community in Madrid and in 1991 the Galician Medal * In 1992, at 90 years old, one of her exhibits was celebrated in the Guillermo de Osma de Madrid gallery, which showed, for the first time, the series of paintings from her exile in America * In 1993 a retrospective exhibit was held in Santiago de Compostela that inaugurated the new Gallego Center for Contemporary Art. Later, the exhibit was moved to the Buenos Aires Fine Arts Museum. * In 2010 the House of Vigo Arts organized an anthological exhibit in conjunction with the San Fernando Academy of Fine Arts * For the first time since 1948, Mallo's work was exhibited in New York as Maruja Mallo: Paintings 1926- 1952 in 2018 from 26 September ‚Äì 1 December at Ortuzar Projects project space in Tribeca, New York. * Mallo's artwork can be found at the Museo Nacional Centro De Arte Reina Sofia which is Spain's national museum of 20th-century art. Homages In Viveiro, Mallo's hometown, a permanent museum concentrated on the studies of her work was established. Also, an avenue was named after her in the Madrid district of Hortaleza. Streets with Mallo‚Äôs name can also be found in cities like Almer√≠a, Estepona, M√©rida, Boadilla del Monte, Guadalajara, and the Castle of San Juan. In 2017, the Gallegas Day of the Arts was dedicated to Maruja Mallo, granted by the Royal Gallegan Academy of Fine Arts.

He was a leading figure in entomology during his lifetime and the founder of insect paleontology in America. In addition to fossil insects, he was an authority on butterflies (Lepidoptera) and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Biography Scudder was born on April 13, 1837 in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Charles Scudder and Sarah Lathrop (Coit) Scudder. His father was a successful merchant and both parents had Puritan roots dating back to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1620s. He was raised in a strict Calvinist Congregational household.Leach (2013) One of his younger brothers, Horace Scudder became a noted author and editor of the Atlantic Monthly.Cockerell (1911) Scudder attended Boston Latin School and then enrolled in Williams College in 1853 at the age of sixteen. He studied with naturalist Paul Chadbourne and geologist Ebenezer Emmons. Under their influence, Scudder developed an interest in natural history, especially entomology. He became an ardent collector of butterflies in the nearby Berkshire Hills.Mallis (1971) By the age of nineteen Scudder was committed to pursuing a career studying insects.Mayor (1919) Scudder graduated from Williams in 1847 at the head of his class. He then entered the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard to study under Louis Agassiz, the most influential scientist in America at the time. After studying with Agassiz for four years he received a B.S. degree in 1862 and then continued to work for Agassiz for another two years. Around this time Darwin's theory of evolution was strongly debated in American scientific circles. Agassiz remained a staunch opponent of evolution while Scudder, after initially siding with Agassiz view came gradually to accept Darwin's theory and build it into his entomological work.Sorensen (1995), pp. 198-204 Scudder became a leading figure in American entomology and was especially noted for his work with grasshoppers (Orthoptera), butterflies (Lepidoptera), and insect paleontology.Smithsonian Although he made significant contributions in all these areas, many of his contemporaries felt Scudder was most notable for his study of grasshoppers. He was a world authority on Orthoptera classification, biology, and distribution. In 1862 he wrote his first paper on the topic, describing 115 new species.Essig (1931) During his career he wrote 180 papers on grasshoppers and described 106 genera and 630 species. Willis Blatchley said ‚Äúto him [Scudder] more than to all his predecessors and contemporaries combined is due our present knowledge of the Orthoptera.‚ÄùComplete Dictionary of Scientific Biography (2008) In 1889 Scudder completed his monumental treatise, Butterflies of the Eastern United States and Canada incorporating thirty years of work on the physiology, life history, distribution and classification of butterflies. This publication cemented his reputation as a leading lepidopterist of his day and remained a standard and influential work for many years.Sterling (1997) In addition to numerous scientific papers, Scudder also wrote several popular accounts of butterflies for the general public. Fossil butterfly, Prodryas persephone, described by Scudder in 1878 In 1865 Scudder wrote his first paper on fossil insects, Devonian Insects of New Brunswick. After the Civil War the extensive explorations of the US Geological Survey led to the discovery of many fossil insects. From 1886 to 1892 Scudder was employed as the staff paleontologist to analyze and publish these findings for the USGS. His extensive work was summarized in The Fossil Insects of North America (two volumes, 1890) and in 1891 he prepared a valuable index of the fossil insects of the world. Scudder eventually described more than 1100 new species of fossil insects and wrote 122 papers on the subject. Beginning in 1862, Scudder had a long association with the Boston Society of Natural History where he served in various roles including recording secretary, librarian, custodian, vice president (1874-1880), and president (1880-1887). He also worked as an assistant librarian at Harvard from 1879 to 1882 and held the office of librarian for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His interest in librarianship and bibliography led him to compile and publish in 1879 a catalog of scientific serials of all countries from 1633 to 1876. He also published Nomenclator Zoologicus (1882‚Äì1884), a seminal and comprehensive list of all generic names in zoology, including insects. In other contributions Scudder was co-founder of the Cambridge Entomological Club and its journal Psyche (1874); General Secretary of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1875) (Vice-President (1894).); cofounder, editor and guide of the Appalachian Mountain Club (1878);Leach, William (2013) Butterfly People Pantheon Books pg 48 first editor of Science magazine (1883‚Äì1885); and United States Geological Survey Paleontologist (1886‚Äì1892). In 1867 Scudder married Ethelinda Jane Blatchford who died in 1872. Their only son, Gardner, was close to his father and accompanied him on many of his field trips. Gardner died of tuberculosis in 1896. At about the same time Scudder first showed signs of Parkinson's disease and by 1902 his disability forced him to retire. He gifted his personal insect collections to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard and his library to the Boston Society of Natural History. He died in Boston on May 17, 1911 after several years of seclusion. Works Scudder was a prolific writer, publishing 791 papers between 1858 and 1902. His primary focus was the descriptive taxonomy of insects and insect fossils. He also wrote about insect biogeography and paleobiogeography, insect behavior, ontogeny and phylogeny, insect songs, evolution, and insect biology. In addition to his scientific works, Scudder also wrote several popular books and articles on butterflies. Some of his more notable titles include: * Nomenclator Zoologicus (1862) * Butterflies: Their Structure, Changes, and Life Histories (1881) * Butterflies of the Eastern United States and Canada (1889) * The Fossil Insects of North America (two volumes, 1890) * Index to the Known Fossil Insects of the World (1891) * Tertiary Rhynchophorous Coleoptera of the United States (1893) * The Life of a Butterfly (1893) * Frail Children of the Air: Excursions into the World of Butterflies (1895) * Revision of the Orthopteran Group Melanopli (1897) * Everyday Butterflies (1899) * Catalogue of the Described Orthoptera of the United States and Canada (1900) * Adephagous and Clavicorn Coleoptera from the Tertiary Deposits at Florissant, Colorado (1900) * Index to North American Orthoptera (1901) Notes Additional References    External links * Samuel Hubbard Scudder Open Library * The writings of Samuel Hubbard Scudder (1879) by George Dimmock * A classed and annotated bibliography of fossil insects (1890) by S.H.

His father, a schoolmaster and teacher of music, undertook his son's early education, which the boy continued under various masters until 1802, when he became the pupil of the celebrated Abb√© G. J.

To his connection with this artist and with his fellow pupils, more perhaps than to his own merits, G√§nsbacher's permanent place in the history of music is due; for it was during his second stay with Vogler, then (1810) living at Darmstadt, that he became acquainted with Weber and Meyerbeer, and the close friendship which sprang up among the three young musicians, and was dissolved by death only, has become celebrated in the history of their art. But G√§nsbacher was himself by no means without merit. In 1823-24, he was one of the 50 composers who composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli for Vaterl√§ndischer K√ºnstlerverein. He creditably filled the responsible and difficult post of director of the music at St. Stephen's Cathedral, from 1823 until his death in Vienna; and his compositions show high gifts and accomplishment. They consist chiefly of church music, 17 masses, besides litanies, motets, offertories, etc., being among the number.

Background The historic borders of Lancashire.Vision of Britain - Ancient county boundaries Local government Lancashire shown in red, with two unitary authorities in ceremonial Lancashire orange.Vision of Britain - Shire county boundaries The Friends of Real Lancashire are concerned to promote what they view as, the true boundaries of the county, namely those of the County Palatine of Lancaster. The current local government boundary of Lancashire was established in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.Elcock, H., Local Government, (1994)Barlow, I., Metropolitan Government, (1991) Lancashire saw more upheaval from this Act than most counties, having most of its population transferred to the new counties: Manchester and the rest of south east Lancashire became part of Greater Manchester; Liverpool and the rest of south west Lancashire became part of Merseyside; Furness became part of Cumbria; and Warrington and Widnes became part of Cheshire.Arnold-Baker, C., Local Government Act 1972,(1973) According to the FORL website, in 1974 \\"the Government at that time stated that the \\"new counties\\" were administrative areas only, and that the boundaries of traditional counties such as Lancashire had not been changed. Unfortunately, the media refer to these administrative areas all too frequently and ignore the fact that places such as Barrow-in- Furness, Liverpool, Manchester, Warrington, etc. are still in Lancashire.\\" The Friends of Real Lancashire The boundary changesKingdom, J., Local Government and Politics in Britain, (1991) were not intended to affect loyalties but they caused concern in some areasHer Majesty's Stationery Office, Aspects of Britain: Local Government, (1996) and in practice it is the new boundariesBryne, T., Local Government in Britain, (1994) which are now shown on maps and marked by road signs. They have also been widely adopted by the media as geographical designations, despite that many within the new counties continue to regard themselves as Lancastrians. The historic county boundaries continue to be used as the basis for organisations such as the Duchy of Lancaster, Lancashire County Cricket Club and Lancashire County Football Association (although its area overlaps with the Liverpool and Manchester Football Associations, both of which predate their corresponding metropolitan counties). The area under the control of Lancashire County Council, or shire county, became even smaller in 1998 when Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen became unitary authorities.UK-SI 1996-1868. - The Lancashire (Boroughs of Blackburn and Blackpool) (Structural Change) Order 1996 Although they remain part of the ceremonial county, they are often no longer mapped as part of Lancashire and \\"Welcome to Lancashire\\" road signs have been placed on their boundaries with the shire county. The group counts at least nine MPs (Jake Berry, Gordon Birtwistle, Simon Danczuk, Nigel Evans, Lindsay Hoyle, John Leech, David Nuttall, John Pugh and Ben Wallace) amongst its supporters and has been mentioned in Hansard. It has received limited support within local government,South Lakeland District Council - Minutes of meeting of the Policy and Resources Committee held on 26 September 1995 and its campaign has also mentioned in the local press.Lake District News - Atkinson, D., Changing boundaries prompt timely research!, (2004) Lancashire Life magazine identifies itself as an enthusiastic supporter of the group and continues to cover the historic county area.Lancashire Life magazine Aims FORL has the following aims: *The restoration of the historic boundaries of the Lancashire ceremonial county with the Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire covering everywhere within the historic borders. *Road signs to mark the historic boundaries with Cheshire, Yorkshire, Westmorland and Cumberland. *The historic boundaries to be shown on Ordnance Survey and other maps rather than the current administrative boundaries. The group also campaigns to have public bodies named in accordance with historic rather than contemporary county names e.g. NHS ambulance authority reforms. However, they do not propose any changes to administrative boundaries.\\"Very little needs to be done to undo the damage to this county identity that has occurred since 1974, but unless steps are taken now, we run the risk of losing this very important part of our heritage. You can help by always referring to the geographical county in which you live, not the administrative county.\\" http://forl.co.uk/county_confusion.php Successes FORL's campaign has met with limited success. In 1994 it raised a petition with 30,000 signatures calling \\"for the restoration of Lancashire's historic boundaries\\" ‚Äì the petition requested that the \\"Metropolitan Counties of Merseyside, Greater Manchester and CumbriaCumbria is actually a shire county be abolished and the real and historic county of Lancashire be restored\\". In response to other suggestions of restoring former boundaries, the Government has commented that although it has no plans to restore the historic borders of counties, boundary changes that have occurred need not affect loyalties. The Local Government Commission for England made draft recommendations in as part of a review of the structure of local government in Cumbria that the \\"areas of Barrow-in-Furness Borough Council and South Lakeland District Council formerly in Lancashire should be returned to historic Lancashire for ceremonial and related purposes\\".Local Government Commission for England.

One year later he began to train regularly under the lead of coach. Salnikov trained at Zenit and later at the Armed Forces sports society. Salnikov made his debut in the Olympic games in 1976 in Montreal, at the age of 16. He broke the European record in the 1,500 m, but finished fifth. His long sequence of international victories began at the 1977 European Championship where he won the gold medal in his favorite distance, the 1,500 m. At the 1978 World Championship in Berlin, Salnikov won gold medals in the 400 and 1,500 m, setting a new world record in the 400 meters. One year later he set another world record, in the 800 m, becoming the first person to complete the distance in less than eight minutes. The United States boycotted the 1980 Olympics in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but Salnikov demonstrated that he was far superior to everybody, winning the 1500 m race in 14:58.27 and becoming the first person to swim the distance under 15 minutes. He won two more gold medals, in the 4√ó200 m relay and in the 400 m. At the 1,500 m his target was not just to win the gold, but to break the world record and the 15-minute barrier. During the race, he managed to control his timing by peeking at the clock by the pool side. Salnikov also planned to break the 400 m world record, but failed, and had to settle on the Olympic record.

He is best remembered as the author of \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". Biography Randall was born on January 1, 1839 in Baltimore, Maryland. He was named after Father James A. Ryder S.J., the 20th President of Georgetown University. He is most remembered for writing the poem \\"Maryland, My Maryland,\\" which is also the reason for his being called the \\"Poet Laureate of the Lost Cause\\". It became a war hymn of the Confederacy after the poem's words were set to the tune \\"Lauriger Horatius\\" (the tune of O Tannenbaum) during the Civil War by Jennie Cary, a member of a prominent Maryland and Virginia family. It later became the state song of Maryland.Maryland State Archives (2004). Maryland State Song ‚Äì \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". Randall wrote the poem after learning that his friend Francis X. Ward, of Randallstown, Maryland, was killed by the 6th Massachusetts Militia in the Baltimore Riot of April 19, 1861. The work was first published a week later on April 26, in the New Orleans newspaper The Sunday Delta. After abandoning his studies at Georgetown University, he traveled to South America and the West Indies. Upon his return to the United States he taught English literature at Poydras College in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. It was during this time that he penned \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". Tuberculosis prevented him from enlisting in the Confederate Army. However, he was able to serve with the Confederate States Navy in Wilmington, North Carolina. Though a Marylander by birth, he wrote the poem \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\" while living in Augusta, Georgia. He considered himself a Georgian by adoption.A Standard History of Georgia and Georgians, Volume 3 By Lucian Lamar Knight page 1283 After the Civil War, Randall became a newspaper editor and a correspondent in Washington, D.C., for The Augusta Chronicle. He continued to write poems, although none achieved the popularity of \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". His later poems were deeply religious in nature. He died on January 15, 1908 in Augusta, Georgia, and is buried there in Magnolia Cemetery. Augusta honors him on the Monument to Poets of Georgia along with Fr. Abram Ryan, Sydney Lanier, and Paul Hamilton Hayne, all of whom saw Confederate service.

A software factory applies manufacturing techniques and principles to software development to mimic the benefits of traditional manufacturing. Software factories are generally involved with outsourced software creation. Description In software engineering and enterprise software architecture, a software factory is a software product line that configures extensive tools, processes, and content using a template based on a schema to automate the development and maintenance of variants of an archetypical product by adapting, assembling, and configuring framework-based components. Since coding requires a software engineer (or the parallel in traditional manufacturing, a skilled craftsman) it is eliminated from the process at the application layer, and the software is created by assembling predefined components instead of using traditional IDE's. Traditional coding is left only for creating new components or services. As with traditional manufacturing, the engineering is left to creation of the components and the requirements gathering for the system. The end result of manufacturing in a software factory is a composite application. Purpose Software factory‚Äìbased application development addresses the problem of traditional application development where applications are developed and delivered without taking advantage of the knowledge gained and the assets produced from developing similar applications. Many approaches, such as training, documentation, and frameworks, are used to address this problem; however, using these approaches to consistently apply the valuable knowledge previously gained during development of multiple applications can be an inefficient and error-prone process. Software factories address this problem by encoding proven practices for developing a specific style of application within a package of integrated guidance that is easy for project teams to adopt. Developing applications using a suitable software factory can provide many benefits, such as improved productivity, quality and evolution capability. Components Software factories are unique and therefore contain a unique set of assets designed to help build a specific type of application. In general, most software factories contain interrelated assets of the following types: * Factory Schema: A document that categorizes and summarizes the assets used to build and maintain a system (such as XML documents, models, etc.) in an orderly way, and defines relationships between them. * Reference implementation: Provides an example of a realistic, finished product that the software factory helps developers build. * Architecture guidance and patterns: Help explain application design choices and the motivation for those choices. * How-to topics: Provide procedures and instructions for completing tasks. * Recipes: Automate procedures in How-to topics, either entirely or in specific steps. They can help developers complete routine tasks with minimal input. * Templates: Pre-made application elements with placeholders for arguments. They can be used for creating initial project items. * Designers: Provide information that developers can use to model applications at a higher level of abstraction. * Reusable code: Components that implement common functionality or mechanisms. Integration of reusable code in a software factory reduces the requirements for manually written code and encourages reuse across applications. Product development Building a product using a software factory involves the following activities: * Problem Analysis: Determines whether the product is in the scope of a software factory. The fit determines whether all or some of the product is built with the software factory. * Product Specification: Defines the product requirements by outlining the differences from the product line requirements using a range of product specification mechanisms. * Product Design: Maps the differences in requirements to differences in product line architecture and development process to produce a customized process. * Product Implementation: A range of mechanisms can be used to develop the implementation depending on the extent of the differences. * Product Deployment: Involves creating or reusing default deployment constraints and configuring the required resources necessary to install the executables being deployed. * Product Testing: Involves creating or reusing test assets (such as test cases, data sets, and scripts) and applying instrumentation and measurement tools. Benefits Developing applications using a software factory can provide many benefits when compared to conventional software development approaches. These include the following: * Consistency: Software factories can be used to build multiple instances of a software product line (a set of applications sharing similar features and architecture), making it easier to achieve consistency. This simplifies governance and also lowers training and maintenance costs. * Quality: Using a software factory makes it easier for developers to learn and implement proven practices. Because of the integration of reusable code, developers are able to spend more time working on features that are unique to each application, reducing the likelihood of design flaws and code defects. Applications developed using a software factory can also be verified before deployment, ensuring that factory-specific best practices were followed during development. * Productivity: Many application development activities can be streamlined and automated, such as reusing software assets and generating code from abstractions of the application elements and mechanisms. These benefits can provide value to several different teams in the following ways: =Value for business= Business tasks can be simplified which can significantly increase user productivity. This is achieved through using common and consistent user interfaces that reduce the need for end-user training. Easy deployment of new and updated functionality and flexible user interfaces also allows end users to perform tasks in a way that follows the business workflow. Data quality improvements reduce the need for data exchange between application parts through the ALT+TAB and copy and paste techniques. =Value for architects= Software factories can be used by architects to design applications and systems with improved quality and consistency. This is achieved through the ability to create a partial implementation of a solution that includes only the most critical mechanisms and shared elements. Known as the baseline architecture, this type of implementation can address design and development challenges, expose architectural decisions and mitigate risks early in the development cycle. Software factories also enable the ability to create a consistent and predicable way of developing, packaging, deploying and updating business components to enforce architectural standards independent of business logic. =Value for developers= Developers can use software factories to increase productivity and incur less ramp-up time. This is achieved through creating a high-quality starting point (baseline) for applications which includes code and patterns. This enables projects to begin with a higher level of maturity than traditionally developed applications. Reusable assets, guidance and examples help address common scenarios and challenges and automation of common tasks allows developers to easily apply guidance in consistent ways. Software factories provide a layer of abstraction that hides application complexity and separates concerns, allowing developers to focus on different areas such as business logic, the user interface (UI) or application services without in-depth knowledge of the infrastructure or baseline services. Abstraction of common developer tasks and increased reusability of infrastructure code can help boost productivity and maintainability. =Value for operations= Applications built with software factories result in a consolidation of operational efforts. This provides easier deployment of common business elements and modules, resulting in consistent configuration management across a suite of applications. Applications can be centrally managed with pluggable architecture which allows operations teams to control basic services. Other approaches There are several approaches that represent contrasting views on software factory concepts, ranging from tool oriented to process oriented initiatives. The following approaches cover Japanese, European, and North American initiatives. =Industrialized software organization (Japan)= Under this approach, software produced in the software factory is primarily used for control systems, nuclear reactors, turbines, etc. The main objectives of this approach are quality matched with productivity, ensuring that the increased costs do not weaken competitiveness. There is also the additional objective of creating an environment in which design, programming, testing, installation and maintenance can be performed in a unified manner. The key in improving quality and productivity is the reuse of software. Dominant traits of the organizational design include a determined effort to make operating work routine, simple and repetitive and to standardize work processes. A representative of this approach would be Toshiba's software factory concept, denoting the company's software division and procedures as they were in 1981 and 1987 respectively. =Generic software factory (Europe)= This approach was funded under the Eureka program and called the Eureka Software Factory. Participants in this project are large European companies, computer manufacturers, software houses, research institutes and universities. The aim of this approach is to provide the technology, standards, organizational support and other necessary infrastructures in order for software factories to be constructed and tailored from components marketed by independent suppliers. The objective of this approach is to produce an architecture and framework for integrated development environments. The generic software factory develops components and production environments that are part of software factories together with standards and guidance for software components. =Experience- based component factory (North America)= The experienced-based component factory is developed at the Software Engineering Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The goals of this approach are to \\"understand the software process in a production environment, determine the impact of available technologies and infuse identified/refined methods back into the development process\\". The approach has been to experiment with new technologies in a production environment, extract and apply experiences and data from experiments and to measure the impact with respect to cost, reliability and quality. This approach puts a heavy emphasis on continuous improvement through understanding the relationship between certain process characteristics and product qualities. The software factory is used to collect data about strengths and weaknesses to set baselines for improvements and to collect experiences to be reused in new projects. =Mature software organization (North America)= Defined by the Capability Maturity Model, this approach intended to create a framework to achieve a predictable, reliable, and self-improving software development process that produces software of high quality. The strategy consists of step-wise improvements in software organization, defining which processes are key in development. The software process and the software product quality are predictable because they are kept within measurable limits. History * The first company to adopt this term was Hitachi in 1969 with its Hitachi Software Works. Later, other companies such as System Development Corporation in 1975, *NEC, Toshiba and Fujitsu in 1976 and 1977 followed the same organizational approach. Cusumano suggests that there are six phases for software factories: *Basic organization and management structure (mid-1960s to early 1970s) *Technology tailoring and standardization (early 1970s to early 1980s) *Process mechanization and support (late 1970s) *Process refinement and extension (early 1980s) *Integrated and flexible automation (mid-1980s) *Incremental product / variety improvement (late 1980s) See also * Software Factory (Microsoft .NET) * Software Product Line * Software Lifecycle Processes * Software engineering * Systems engineering * Software development process * Factorette * Automatic programming * Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) * Model Driven Engineering (MDE) References External links * Harvard Business Review Wipro Technologies: The Factory Model * Outsourcing Without Offshoring Is Aim of ‚ÄòSoftware Factory‚Äô By P.

Her debut manga, it appeared as a serial in the booklets of Avex Trax's Pure Trance techno compilation CD series. It was later collected into a bound volume by East Press and published in 1998. Last Gasp published an English- language translation of Pure Trance in July 2005; the edition was produced by jaPRESS.  Plot  Pure Trance takes place in the future, after World War III, which left the surface of the earth inhospitable to life. The humans able to escape underground now live underneath a dome in Tokyo, Japan, while those unable to become creatures resembling brains with eyes and a spine. The people living underground survive on Pure Trance, nutritional capsules which have caused overeating in females to become a serious issue. The plot of Pure Trance follows Kaori Suzuki, a kind and good-natured nurse at Overeaters Treatment Center 102, run by the drug-addicted and violently abusive director Keiko Yamazaki. Though normally docile in spite of the director's terrible treatment, Kaori lashes out after three expectant mothers die due to a lethal combination of medicines administered by the director. The director subsequently imprisons Kaori and subjects her to constant torture, and creates artificial nurses Umeko and Takeko to replace the human nurses working at the center. Meanwhile, the deceased women's fetuses are raised in an artificial womb and grow into healthy children‚Äî Yuriko, who is very strong and intelligent; shy and dainty Rika; and twins Miki and Yuki, who possess magical powers. The children are raised by robot nurse Kiyomi and Aiko, head of the children's ward, but are constantly tormented by the two artificial nurses. When Aiko stands up to them one day, the director brutally chokes her to death and decides to take the children for herself to use as experiments. With the help of Kiyomi, Kaori escapes to the surface with the children via a ventilation shaft, but not before Kiyomi sacrifices herself, leaving only her robotic head at the entrance. The head is later found by Professor Kajiwara, who restores an amnesiac Kiyomi into a new robotic body, naming her B-ko. On the surface, the group encounters Seiko, a popular idol singer who went missing years ago and who has adapted to the wilderness of the surface. Seiko leads the group to an abandoned park and educates them on the flora and fauna. Underground, the director is furious at Kaori and the children's escape, and has her security guard Kimiko and the two artificial nurses pursue them on the surface, much to their chagrin. After several years of living on the surface, Kaori's health deteriorates as she cannot stomach real food, only Pure Trance, whereas the children thrive and grow into adults. While the children are out tripping on hallucinogenic mushrooms one day, Kimiko and the nurses encounter Seiko, who unwittingly leads them to Kaori, whom they capture and take back to the director. When the children return home, the twins use their powers to locate Kaori, but unfortunately witness the director poisoning her to death. The incident leaves them very weak and their hair turns white. Meanwhile, a hole develops in the dilapidated dome covering Tokyo, and plants and animals from the surface begin creeping into the underground. A research team is formed by Professor Kajiwara to explore and determine the habitability of the surface. The children, saddened by Kaori's death and frightened by the explorers, hide in the ruins of a love motel. The director however has a nightmare about the children and a mysterious dark haired woman, and upon waking forces Kimiko and the artificial nurses to venture once more to the surface, this time to kill the children. Rika, who is popular among the brain creatures of the surface, gets pregnant from one of her boyfriends, while the twins have a vision that they will die soon and Rika will die in childbirth. They suggest combining their powers with Yuriko, and perform a ritual that transfers their souls into her body. Rika gives birth to a daughter, Yuka, but dies in the process and becomes one of the brain creatures. At Center 102, a patient spots a bird that flies in through the window and eats it, causing her to recover from her overeating illness quickly. The few remaining human nurses utilize this information to create a cheap and effective cure for overeating, causing the center to be shut down and the director to be arrested. They then open a successful pachinko parlor in the building. With the director gone, Kimiko becomes a female wrestling star while the artificial nurses are taken in at a nurse themed hostess bar. Deconstruction of the dome over Tokyo begins and real food as well as the integration of the brain creatures and the various plants and animals become mainstream. Yuriko raises Yuka and teaches her to hunt on the surface. She grows up suddenly by shedding her skin and emerging as a mature woman. The pair are found by the dome deconstruction team, and come under the care of Professor Kajiwara and B-ko. The artificial nurses become spontaneously pregnant and are rushed to a hospital. While walking around the city, Yuriko and Yuka spot the prison where the director is held, and Yuka‚Äîthe dark haired woman from the directors nightmare‚Äîpromptly kills her, right as the artificial nurses give birth to baby girls that resemble the director. Development Pure Trance is manga artist Junko Mizuno's first major manga; previously, she had self-published a dojinshi, MINA animal DX, of which she printed only fifty copies of one black-and-white issue in 1996. Her work in the Japanese popular culture magazine H caught the attention of record label Avex Trax, which placed advertisements in the magazine. Mizuno explained: \\"They asked me to write a manga to appear with a series of CD compilations called Pure Trance that were introducing techno music to Japan. He wanted something like techno itself, a mixture of futuristic and primitive things.\\" She drew inspiration for Pure Trance from Akira. Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Junko Mizuno, Pure Trance appeared as a serial in the CD booklets of Avex Trax's eponymous techno-compilation series, from May 8, 1996, to January 14, 1998. It was compiled into a bound volume and published by East Press in 1998. Last Gasp licensed Pure Trance for an English-language translation in North America, and published it in 2005. =Other= KidRobot released a series of merchandise based on Pure Trance, including clothing and vinyl figures. Reception Paul Gravett listed Pure Trance on his recommended reading list. Jason Thompson, in Manga: The Complete Guide (2007), gave Pure Trance 3.5 of 4 stars, praising it as a combination of Russ Meyer's work and a science-fiction film from the 1970s. Writing that Mizuno drew influence from manga artist Osamu Tezuka, he praised the art as \\"dense and delirious\\". In a retrospective review of Mizuno's work, Thompson wrote that the \\"trippy, grindhouse\\" narrative contained \\"weak\\" places and had a tendency to wander; he compared the plot to an apocalyptic film from the 1970s. From March 13 to June 14, 2009, Pure Trance appeared at an exhibit by the Japan Society in New York, Krazy! The Delirious World of Anime + Manga + Video Games. Critical reaction to the manga was positive. In his review of the exhibit, Ken Johnson of The New York Times highlighted Pure Trance as an example of \\"impressive\\" \\"draftsmanship, design and imagination\\" in a manga. Writing for About.com, Evan Minto wrote that Pure Trance was on display as an example of \\"the evolution of the 'manga-style' that is now so synonymous with the medium\\", because of \\"its creation of 'hybrid forms' based on traditional manga style, Lolita fashions, and even pornography.\\" Another guest reviewer for About.com, Scott VonSchilling expressed his happiness that one of Mizuno's works was on the display; according to him, Mizuno's works, which have an American cult following, are very recognizable: \\"Her mash-up of the ultra-cute with dirty and grotesque imagery catches your eye and hooks you in. It initially looks like family-friendly kiddie-fare, but viewers quickly realize that it's some of the most adult material on display.\\" References ;General * ;Specific External links * Category:1996 manga Category:Last Gasp titles Category:Post-apocalyptic anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Sh≈çjo manga ","title":"Pure Trance"},{"id":"3019908","text":"Donna de Varona Pinto (born April 26, 1947), n√©e Donna Elizabeth de Varona, is an American former competition swimmer, activist, and television sportscaster. Biography =Swimming career= In 1960, de Varona qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team at age 13. She already held the world record in her signature event, the 400-meter individual medley, but the event would not be added to the Olympic schedule until the 1964 Olympics. At the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, De Varona swam for the U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the women's 4√ó100 freestyle relay, but she did not receive a gold medal because she did not swim in the event final. Four years later at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, after she was well on her way to setting a career total of eighteen world best times and world records, she won the gold medal in the women's 400-meter individual medley. She defeated the second- place finisher by a margin of six seconds and set an Olympic record. She also earned a second gold medal as a member of the world-record-setting U.S. team in the 4√ó100-meter freestyle relay. De Varona graced the covers of Sports Illustrated, Look and Life magazines. In 1964, the Associated Press and United Press International voted de Varona the \\"most outstanding woman athlete in the world.\\" De Varona retired from swimming and began her career in the male- dominated world of sports broadcasting. =Professional life= At the age of 17, she appeared on ABC's Wide World of Sports, becoming the youngest and one of the first women sportscasters for a national network. Her groundbreaking career has earned her an Emmy, two Gracies and the opportunity to cover a wide variety of sports events including 17 winter and summer Olympic games. In 2006, she was inducted into the Museum of Television & Radio's first class of fifty \\"She Made It\\" pioneers in media. While de Varona continued to pursue her television career, she also began her work in Washington D.C. as an activist for sports and fitness opportunities for America's youth. Since her retirement from competitions in 1965, she has served five terms on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and has been appointed to Presidential Commissions under presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Bush. A consultant to the United States Senate, de Varona took a leave of absence from her pioneering television career to help with the passage of the 1978 Amateur Sports Act which restructured how Olympic sports are governed in the United States. Subsequently, she was called back to the Senate to consult on amendments to the landmark Olympic legislation and eventually worked to promote and safeguard Title IX of the Equal Education Amendments Act which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational institution receiving Federal funding. Named a special advisor to President Clinton's Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, de Varona helped with the establishment and funding for both the United States Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti- Doping Agency, which are entrusted with eradicating the use of illegal substances to enhance performance in sports. A promoter of women in sport, in the mid-1970s, she joined Billie Jean King in establishing the Women's Sports Foundation. She served as the first President (1979‚Äì1984) and subsequently, became the chairman and Honorary Trustee for the Foundation. Under de Varona's leadership, the Women's Sport Foundation initiated the Hall of Fame Dinner (now the Annual Salute to Women in Sports Awards Dinner), Travel and Training Grants, research projects, a toll-free telephone number and annual visits to Washington, D.C., to educate Congress about Title IX and the importance of providing sport and physical activity opportunities on an equitable basis to both men and women. Over the years, the Foundation has raised more than $30 million to support its programs. From 1997 to 1999, de Varona chaired the organizing committee for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. Recognized as the most successful women's sporting event in history, de Varona, a U.S. Olympic Hall of Famer, is a recipient of the Olympic Order, the highest honor presented by the International Olympic Committee. In 1999, Sports Illustrated for Women ranked her on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Athletes.\\" She has also been awarded five honorary doctorates and in 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Honors Committee awarded her the Theodore Roosevelt Award. In 2000, de Varona sued ABC Sports for $50 million, saying she was fired because of her sex and age. She filed the lawsuit after working at ABC for over 30 years. The suit was dropped in 2002 when ABC Sports rehired de Varona as an ABC & ESPN liaison for domestic and international sports, plus on-air work for certain events. She said \\"Filing was the hardest thing I'd ever done. I'd been associated with ABC since I was 14, when I was swimming, and I grew from commentator to producer to adviser to Roone Arledge\\", the first president of ABC Sports.https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/sports/plus- tv-sports-de-varona-ends-suit-against-abc.html de Varona in 2012 In the fall of 2007, de Varona completed a documentary as a host, writer, and producer. This was done in observation of the 35th anniversary of Title IX, which was the legislation that outlawed discrimination in school programs, including sports. The CSTV documentary, which won a Cine Golden Eagle Award, focused on the impact of Title IX and how one recipient of a sports scholarship in America has been influential in changing attitudes and customs in the Middle East as well as within the International Olympic Committee. The program featured Morocco's Minister of Sports, Nawal El Moutawakel, who in 1984 became the first Muslim and African woman to win an Olympic gold medal, and in 2012 was elected Vice President of the International Olympic Committee. She was inducted to the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an \\"Honor Swimmer\\" in 1969. In 2003, de Varona was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.National Women's Hall of Fame, Donna de Varona She also serves on the distinguished Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC), which recommends subjects who appear on U.S. postage stamps. She is a 1986 graduate of UCLA and the mother of two children: Joanna Pinto and John David Pinto. De Varona serves on the Executive Board of Special Olympics International and is a member of the International Olympic Committee's Women and Sports Commission. She is also a board member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame and serves as an adviser to Jordan's Prince Feisal's Generations for Peace Foundation and Tony Blair's Beyond Sport Initiative. Most recently, de Varona was appointed to the United States Department of State's Empowerment of Girls and Women through Sports Council by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She is also President of DAMAR Productions, a marketing, consulting and events advisory company. She was also the chair of the Athlete Advisory Committee for the 2019 Aurora Games. In 2020, De Varona along with 300+ women signed a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic Association in support of an Idaho law that bans transgender female student athletes from competing in women‚Äôs and girl's sports. =Personal life= In 1986, De Varona graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Her younger sister is actress-director Joanna Kerns, who played Maggie Seaver on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains. She is a member of the 'Champions for Peace' club, a group of more than 90 famous elite created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization placed under the high patronage of H.S.H Prince Albert II.

His distinct color palette, subject matter and technique have been said to bridge the gap between Pop Surrealism and Street Art. Early life Soto was born in Fullerton, California, the eldest of four brothers. His father, Jeffrey worked as an offset printer and was an outdoor enthusiast and taxidermist. His mother, Patricia was a homemaker. Soto grew up in a middle class household where creativity was encouraged. He developed an interest in animals and plants due to his parents‚Äô various outdoor activities- gardening, fishing, falconry and camping. From an early age Soto showed an interest in drawing, painting, and storytelling. As a high school student, Soto began to experiment with various genres and art techniques including painting, photography, ceramics, and filmography. In 1992 and 1993 he was a California Arts Scholar and attended the California State Summer School for the Arts held at CalArts in Valencia. He graduated from Norte Vista High School in 1993. Education Soto attended Riverside City College from 1993 to 1999, and earned an associate degree in Arts. While at RCC, Soto experimented further with art, including works in sculpture, public artworks (graffiti and stenciling), abstract painting, and computer design. In 1999 Soto transferred to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena where he majored in Illustration and minored in Fine Art. That same year, Soto, disillusioned and bored with the state of graffiti art in the late 1990s, took what ended up being a decade long hiatus. He focused instead on both showing his work in local galleries and developing his illustration career. During these years, Soto was inspired by several of his Art Center instructors who were working as successful illustrators as well as showing the same work in galleries. Soto had his first solo exhibit during his last year in college. Potato Stamp Dreams opened at New Image Art Gallery in Los Angeles a few days after the September 11th terrorist attacks. As a student in 2002 Soto began to work in the field of illustration, with work appearing in American Illustration and Communication Arts. Soto graduated with Distinction from Art Center College of Design in April 2002. Influences Soto received his first skateboard as a gift at the age of 9. It was an early introduction to skateboard graphics which were a significant influence. Early on, horror, science fiction, and fantasy movies and television were another influence, in particular Star Wars, Robotech, and Mtv. In college, Soto discovered and was inspired by artists such as Max Ernst, Frida Kahlo, Andy Warhol, Amedio Modigliani, Van Gogh and Paul Cadmus. More recent influences include Soto's contemporaries- Dave Cooper, David Choe, Mario ‚ÄúMars1‚Äù Martinez, the Clayton Brothers and Camille Rose Garcia. Work Jeff Soto, 2006 =Graffiti= In 1989 Soto found a book while looking through the Riverside Downtown Library's art section called Street Art. The book showcased early illegal art in New York as well as hip hop based subway graffiti of the 1970s. Inspired by this book, he began stenciling his ‚ÄúSotofish‚Äù design on walls and signs. The following year he and a friend created a graffiti crew called CIA (Criminally Insane Artists) which attracted several other writers from their high school. Soto adapted the moniker of ‚ÄúKILO‚Äù, \\"TREK\\" as well as ‚ÄúSotofish‚Äù and started to tag, bomb and piece. In 1991 he met the artist Maxx242 and they began painting together. In 1995 they formed Bashers Crew which included members from Riverside, Los Angeles and Long Beach. In 1999 Soto took a break from all aerosol painting, citing health reasons, boredom with the limitations of the spray can and conflict among graffiti writers. Ten years later in London, Soto visited artists D*Face and Word To Mother. Seeing their work in person inspired Soto to begin painting on walls again. Since then, Soto has reconnected with his graffiti roots and painted murals in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Miami, London and Paris. In 2010 he participated in the Underbelly Project, an illegal art gallery beneath the city of New York. In 2011 he completed his largest wall painting to date- \\"Les Chat Terrible\\" in Lyon, France. Soto claims he is not a graffiti writer or street artist, rather he calls himself ‚Äúa muralist with an occasional urge to do some graf‚Äù. =Illustration= In 2002, Soto began working as a freelance illustrator specializing in editorial work. Some of his clients include Entertainment Weekly, Sony Music, Rockstar Games, Saatchi & Saatchi, United Airlines and Disney. His work has adorned magazines, books, albums, and advertisements. Soto created illustrations to be the album art of releases by two post- hardcore bands; Finch's Say Hello To Sunshine in 2005 and Halifax's The Inevitability of a Strange World in 2006. In 2010, Soto began creating gig posters for various bands including Pearl Jam, The Black Keys and Soundgarden. =Fine Art= In 2002, Soto had his first solo exhibit at New Image Art Gallery in Los Angeles. Months later he showed at La Luz de Jesus in Los Angeles. These shows were well received and soon after he was invited to group and solo exhibits throughout the United States. With roots in graffiti as well as traditional painting, Soto continues to show in galleries which feature \\"Street Art\\" and also those which show \\"Pop Surrealism\\".

Brown Bros. & Co. was an investment bank from 1818 until its merger with Harriman Brothers & Company in 1931, to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. History Brown Brothers, an investment bank and trading company, was founded in 1818 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by George Brown and John Brown, sons of former Ulster linen trader Alexander Brown (1764‚Äî1834) who had established a firm in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1825, the third son, James Brown (1791‚Äî1877), opened an affiliate in New York City under the name Brown Brothers and another in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1845. These firms were later merged under the name. James Brown's son, John Crosby Brown (1838‚Äî1909), would be a driving force for growth, making Wall Street in New York the center for operations and seeing the bank become major lenders to the textile, commodities, and transportation industries. In 1931, the firm merged with Harriman Brothers & Company, another Wall Street firm owned by W. Averell Harriman and E. Roland Harriman, to form Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. In 1964, John A. Kouwenhoven, professor of English at Barnard College and the author of The Columbia Historical Portrait of New York, among other works, was hired by Brown Brothers Harriman to identify and amass records of historical value to the firm. His title was Director of the Historical Files, which were to serve, among other purposes, as the research materials for the writing of Partners in Banking, commissioned by the publishers Doubleday & Co. to celebrate the firm's 150th anniversary in 1968. These files are held at the New-York Historical Society. The business records of Brown Brothers & Co. in New York City, including 176 volumes dated 1826-1880, were deposited at The New York Public Library and are almost entirely from the business career of James Brown.

The memoir outlines the life of his father, Romulus Gaita (1922 ‚Äì May 1996). Plot Romulus Gaita fled his hometown of Markovac in 1935 at the age of 13. He worked as a farmer apprentice until he was 17, after which he moved to Austria and eventually migrated to Australia on an assisted passage in 1950 at the age of 28, with his young wife Christine and their four-year-old son Raimond soon after the end of the Second World War. Romulus and his family were transferred to Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre, a camp near Wodonga. Romulus was then sent to Baringhup on the Loddon River, where he met two Romanian brothers Pantelimon (known as Hora) and Mitru. The Gai≈£ƒÉs then moved to a farmhouse called Frogmore, where they lived for the next ten years, and where Raimond spent most of his childhood. Christine did not stay at Frogmore to take on the responsibility as a wife and mother. She had an affair with Mitru and moved to Melbourne to be with him. As a result of the affair, they had two daughters. Mitru committed suicide before the birth of the second child. Christine later also committed suicide. Both the daughters of Christine and Mitru were adopted. Raimond is reminiscent that indeed, Christine may have had a mental illness. After some attempts at farming, Romulus established a business supplying wrought iron furniture, popular at the time, by the way of using the skills he brought from his native country. Romulus had also suffered from a mental illness, requiring admission to a psychiatric hospital. While Romulus was unable to provide care for Raimond, Hora came to live with Raimond and cared for him. To an immense degree, Romulus had recovered from his mental illness and saw Raimond live to adulthood. Romulus later suffered heart problems and eventually died of a heart attack. Themes The story of Romulus, My Father details the struggle of many immigrants during and after the Second World War, and how these adversities were faced and sometimes overcome. It portrays the never dwindling love of Romulus for his son Raimond, in spite of the challenges of being abandoned by his wife and the confusion caused by his mental illness. The major literary themes displayed in relation to belonging are that of: * belonging to family; * belonging to a place; * belonging to a culture; and * the effect of mental illness. Awards and recognition The book was the recipient of the 1998 Nettie Palmer Prize for Non-fiction. It was chosen to be placed on both the Victorian Certificate of Education and New South Wales Higher School Certificate English reading lists, and was examined in both final English exams. Adaptions A film adaptation, Romulus, My Father, was released in 2007, starring Eric Bana, Franka Potente and Kodi Smit-McPhee.

It is in the historic baronies of Armagh and Oneilland West. It had a population of 282 people (116 households) in the 2011 Census. (2001 Census: 285 people) Loughgall was named after a small nearby loch. The village is at the heart of the apple-growing industry and is surrounded by orchards. Along the village's main street is a large set of gates leading to Loughgall Manor. An imposing building, the Manor was once the home of the Cope family who arrived as part of the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century.  History  In 1795, rival sectarian gangs, the Catholic Defenders and Protestant Peep-o'-Day Boys fought a bloody skirmish called the Battle of the Diamond, that left around 30 people dead. The Orange Order was founded in Dan Winter's House, Loughgall following these events. =The Troubles= For more information see The Troubles in Loughgall, which includes a list of incidents in Loughgall during the Troubles that resulted in two or more fatalities. On 8 May 1987, eight members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched a bomb and gun attack on the village's Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) station but were intercepted by a Special Air Service (SAS) unit of twenty-four who were aware of the planned attack. The British Army shot dead all of the IRA attackers; a passing civilian was also killed in the exchange of fire and another civilian injured. The incident is known as the Loughgall ambush.  Places of interest  Loughgall Country Park is set in a 188 hectare estate of open farmland & orchards and includes an 18-hole golf course and coarse fishery. The NI Horticulture and Plant Breeding Station is set in the Loughgall Manor Estate, surrounded by mature woodlands and overlooking the Lough Gall.

In 1947 the estate was purchased from Major-General G.W.R. Templer (later Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer), a descendant of the original owner, by the (then) Ministry of Agriculture.  Sport  It is home to Loughgall Football Club, which plays in the IFA Championship.  Education  *The Cope Primary School *There was also a Roman Catholic primary school located on the Eagralougher Road, just outside Loughgall, but due to lack of funding and low enrolment figures the school closed in June 1996.

Becoming a soldier, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece by Philip II, king of Spain, and was afterwards employed in diplomatic work. Life He was the second son of Philippe II de Cro√ø (1496‚Äì1549) and Anna de Cro√ø (1501‚Äì1539). After the death of his elder brother Charles II de Cro√ø in 1551, he became 3rd Duke of Aarschot, 4th Prince of Chimay and 4th Count of Beaumont. He took part in the troubles in the Netherlands, and in 1563 refused to join William the Silent and others in their efforts to remove Cardinal Granvelle from his post. This attitude, together with Aarschot's devotion to the Roman Catholic Church, which he expressed by showing his delight at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, led Philip of Spain to regard him with still greater favor, which, however, was withdrawn in consequence of Aarschot's ambiguous conduct when welcoming the new governor, John of Austria (Don Juan de Austria), to the Netherlands in 1576. In spite, however, of his being generally distrusted by the inhabitants of the Netherlands, he was appointed governor of the citadel of Antwerp when the Spanish troops withdrew in 1577. After a period of vacillation he deserted Don John towards the end of that year. Philipe de Cro√ø, Duke of Aarschot and other nobles are taken prisoner in the Court of St. Baeffs in Ghent on 28 October 1577. Print from 'The Wars of Nassau' by Baudartius. Jealous of the Prince of Orange, he was then the head of the party which induced the Archduke Matthias (afterwards emperor) to undertake the sovereignty of the Netherlands, and soon afterwards was appointed Stadtholder of Flanders by the state council. A strong party, including the burghers of Ghent, distrusted the new stadtholder and Aarschot, who was taken prisoner during a riot at Ghent, was only released on promising to resign his office. He then sought to regain the favor of Philip of Spain, and having been pardoned by the king in 1580 again shared in the government of the Netherlands; but he refused to serve under the count of Fuentes when he became governor-general in 1594, and retired to Venice, where he died in December 1595.

BBC Radio 2, 21 August 2009. The film is a sequel to the 1965 hit Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. Terry-Thomas appeared as Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the equally dastardly son of Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, which Thomas had played in the earlier film. Some others of the cast from the first film returned, including Gert Fr√∂be and Eric Sykes. Like the earlier film, it was written by Ken Annakin and Jack Davies and directed by Annakin, with music by Ron Goodwin. The title tune is performed by Jimmy Durante. The credits sequence animation was the work of Ronald Searle, who was also featured in Annakin's earlier Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines. Tony Curtis and Susan Hampshire played other contestants in the race; Curtis also starred in the similar period-piece comedy The Great Race (1965) from Warner Bros. The film was originally intended to be called Rome or Bust. The American distributors Paramount Pictures re-titled it Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies to tie it to Annakin's 1965 film; re-editing also meant cuts, up to a half-hour, from the original UK release.Galbraith, Stewart. \\"Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies (Monte Carlo ‚Äì or Bust!).\\" DVD Talk,, 3 June 2008. Retrieved: 13 May 2013. Lobby card for Monte Carlo or Bust! Plot In the 1920s, the Monte Carlo Rally attracts competitors from all over the world. Rivals from Britain, Italy, France and Germany find that their greatest competition comes from the United States in the form of Chester Schofield (Tony Curtis), who had won half of an automobile factory in a poker game with the late father of baronet Sir Cuthbert Ware- Armitage (Terry-Thomas). Ware-Armitage has entered the race in a winner-take- all to exact revenge and win back the lost half of the company. The international cast of characters appear to mirror their national foibles. British Army officers Maj. Digby Dawlish (Peter Cook) and Lieut. Kit Barrington (Dudley Moore), who have entered to preserve the honour of the British Empire, drive an outlandish vehicle festooned with odd inventions. Italian policemen Angelo Pincelli (Walter Chiari) and Marcello Agosti (Lando Buzzanca) seem to be more interested in chasing three French women, led by Doctor Marie-Claude (Mireille Darc). The German entry from overbearing Willi Schickel (Gert Fr√∂be) and Otto Schwartz (Peer Schmidt) turn out to be convicts, driving with stolen gems on board. As the race begins, the contestants find that not only are they in a 1,500-mile battle with each other, but dangerous roads and the elements including a massive avalanche, are just as formidable. Chester and his new co-driver, Betty (Susan Hampshire) end up duelling with Cuthbert. Various misfortunes plague each of the contestants, with Cuthbert, poised to win, being disqualified for cheating, the British Army team blowing up, the Germans being arrested and Chester falling asleep at the wheel. In the end, the Italians are declared the winners and share their winnings with the French women's team to help people injured in the snowslide. Chester does eventually cross the finish line, albeit because Betty and some others have pushed his car.

In September 1965 he announced he would make a follow up to that film set in the early days of automobile racing. Its working title was The Monte Carlo Rally and All That Jazz. He wrote the script with Jack Davies, with whom he had collaborated on Those Magnificent Men. He wanted to re-use some of the old cast, including Terry Thomas, Gert Fr√∂be and Alberto Sordi, plus one American, possibly James Garner. Annaking estimated the film would cost under $6 million. In March 1968 Annakin announced that Tony Curtis would star. The cast would also include Terry Thomas, Gert Fr√∂be, Eric Sykes, Walter Chiari, and Alberto Sordi. Finance was provided by Paramount and filming would take over six months in Rome, Monte Carlo and the Italian and French Alps. \\"I love the international flavor of it\\", said Annakin. =Shooting= Besides the studio work at the Dino De Laurentiis Cinematografica Studios, Rome and Lazio, Italy, principal photography took place from 31 March‚ÄìMay 1968 at a large number of locations: England, Paris, France, Monaco, Monte Carlo, Monte Gelato Falls, Treja River, Italy and √Öre, J√§mtlands l√§n, Sweden. Most of the exotic locations were from the second-unit directors while studio process shots mainly inserted the lead actors into the scenes. Annakin had difficulties working with his American screen idol, Tony Curtis, and considered him, \\"brittle, self-centered and a bully\\".Annakin, Ken. \\"So You Wanna be a Director?\\" Tomahawk Press, 2012. Retrieved: 12 May 2013. Curtis, however, enjoyed his time in Rome, one of the primary filming locations and became romantically linked to his co-star, Susan Hampshire.Curtis and Golenbock 2008, p. 190.

Ex-racer David Watson was in charge of the cars. \\"The automobiles should give me a good 30 percent of the comedy\\", said Annakin. Reception Monte Carlo or Bust! was favourably received by audiences and critics alike. The comparison to Annakin's earlier work, notwithstanding, The New York Times review noted, \\"... the picture is lively and often hilarious, as the drivers hang on for dear life and the old cars honk, collide and careen. There is hardly a turn without a bang-up or a mix-up.\\"Thompson, Howard. \\"Movie review: Monte Carlo or Bust (1969): In their jaunty jalopies; slapstick racing epic opens at Astor; Europe of the 1920s provides setting.\\" The New York Times, 29 May 1969. In the opinion of the writer Matthew Sweet, Peter Cook as Major Dawlish, and Dudley Moore as Lt. Barrington, are the performers who have the humour in the film that survives best. Peter Cook's Major Dawlish is the creator of a series of fairly ludicrous inventions ‚Äì the feeling hovers \\"that it might be all over for Britain.\\"Sweet, Matthew (speaking on). \\"The movie that changed my life'\\", BBC Radio 2, 21 August 2009.

Biography He was born on 29 April 1863, the son of Joseph Bain. He was educated at Westminster School, before going up to Christ Church, Oxford where he distinguished himself as a student of Classics. In 1889, he was elected a fellow of All Souls College. In his youth he was a keen amateur footballer, representing the University against Cambridge between 1883 and 1886; he was also a member of the leading amateur teams of the time, Wanderers and Corinthians. In 1892, he entered the Indian Educational Service, going on to become a professor of History in the Deccan College of Poonah (Pune), in British India, until his retirement in 1919. He died on 3 March 1940. Writings The first of these was A Digit of the Moon (1898),Digit of the Moon on archive.org which Bain claimed was his translation of the eighth part of sixteen of a Sanskrit manuscript given to him by a brahmin. In the story, the king S√∫ryak√°nta falls in love with the wise and beautiful princess Anangar√°g√°, who will marry only the suitor who asks her a question she cannot answer. The king, with his clever friend Rasak√≥sha, sets off to win the hand of the princess. During Bain's life, the argument raged about whether the story was truly a translation or whether Bain had written it himself. While some early reviewers took his statements at face value,Notes and Queries, 24 February 1900, p 158 many did not. A contemporary review said, in part: :Though palpably a pretense, they are graceful fancies, and might as well have appeared for what they really are instead of masquerading as \\"translations\\". No Hindu, unless of this generation and under foreign influence, ever conceived these stories. . . . Moreover, they are of a strict propriety, whereas original Hindu love stories would put Rabelais's ghost to the blush.The Nation, Vol. 81, no. 1096, 31 August 1905, p. 183 The book contains numerous footnotes referring to Sanskrit puns and wordplay that the author claimed to have been unable to render in English. A Digit of the Moon was followed by a number of other stories in the same mode: Syrup of the Bees, Bubbles of the Foam, Essence of the Dusk, Ashes of a God, Mine of Faults, Heifer of the Dawn, and others. As more books appeared, it became clearer that Bain was writing these stories himself, not translating. A review of Bubbles of the Foam in 1912 said: : Yet, despite the beauty of the whole, there is much in the volume that seems non-Indian; in fact, distinctly Occidental. The phraseology lacks in great part the subtle Sanskrit flavor‚Ä¶The Nation, Volume 95, No. 2476, 12 December 1912, p. 564 Significant portions of his book Descent of the Sun were used, often word-for-word and with credit, by Meatball F ulton for his Fourth Tower of Inverness radio series.\\"The Fourth Tower of Inverness\\", radio drama, ZBS Media Before his fantasy series, he also wrote other works, including political works.

Biography Tada made her debut in 1977, when still a high school student, on Shueisha's \\"Deluxe Margaret\\" magazine. Tada's stories belong to the sh≈çjo genre of manga and feature love stories centred on young female characters and their love interests. The storylines include comedic moments and are characterised by essential and sharp drawings. Some of Tada's most popular works are Ai Shite Knight, Itazura na Kiss and Kimi no na wa Debora. Ai Shite Knight portrays the Japanese rock music scene of the early 1980s. The anime series based on Ai Shite Knight was the first ever to feature original songs performed within the episodes. Another of Tada's works, Miihaa Paradise, is also set in the rock 'n' roll world. Itazura na Kiss (Mischievous Kiss) - begun in 1991 and never completed - was by far Tada's most successful work in Japan. It tells the love story between Kotoko and Naoki from high school until after their marriage. The series inspired also an illustrated art book and two novels written by Nori Harata and published in Shueisha's \\"Cobalt\\" series. In 1996 a live action Japanese TV series based on Itazura na Kiss was also produced, starring Aiko Sato as Kotoko and Takashi Kashiwabara as Naoki. In 2005, the series was adapted into a Taiwanese drama under the name of It Started with a Kiss with lead actors Joe Cheng and Ariel Lin, and in 2008 an anime was also released. This series was also adapted into a Korean drama called Playful Kiss with lead actors Kim Hyun-joong and Jung So-min. In 2013, a Japanese adaptation titled Itazura na Kiss - Love in Tokyo, starring Furukawa Yuki as Irie Naoki and Miki Honoka as Aihara Kotoko was released. In 2015, a Thailand adaptation entitled Kiss Me starring Mike D. Angelo as Tenten and Sushar Manaying as Taliw was aired and has steadily earned the attention of fans from around the world.

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has been featured in over five decades of Marvel continuity. Benicio del Toro portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor: The Dark World (2013) in a mid-credits scene, Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Publication history The Collector first appeared in The Avengers #28 (May 1966), and was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck. Fictional character biography Taneleer Tivan is one of the Elders of the Universe and is close to his fellow Elder En Dwi Gast (the Grandmaster). He apparently came to self-awareness billions of years ago, on the planet Cygnus X-1. He is an enormously powerful being who wielded the Power Primordial and, though at first he took the appearance of an old human, his true form is a powerful alien. For millions of years, the Collector lived on an unknown world with his wife and child, spending his days in thought and contemplation. Over three billion years ago, when his wife, Matani Tivan, lost the will to live and relinquished her immortality, the Collector realized he would need a hobby to maintain his own sanity, and began collecting interesting artifacts and life forms from around the universe. Eventually, his obsession reached such heights he collected anything he considered rare or valuable often just for the sake of collecting. As such, he has a wide variety of rare or unique items at his disposal. The Collector also had the power of prophecy, allowing him to foresee the rise of a being powerful enough to pose a threat to the Elders: Thanos. To protect life in the universe, the Collector created a massive museum of countless life forms to keep them safe from Thanos. For a time, he even possessed one of the six Infinity Gems, unaware of its true power, until Thanos took it. At some point over his billions of years of life he came into contact with other beings who, like him, are the sole survivors of the first species in the universe. He often refers to these fellow elders as brothers though they usually only work together if they have a common goal. In the modern era, the Collector eventually traveled to Earth. He captured the Wasp and sought to \\"collect\\" the other Avengers with help from the Beetle, but was defeated by them.The Avengers #28. Marvel Comics. Marvel Comics. He later enslaved Thor, then captured the Wasp and the other Avengers. He restored Goliath's size-change powers, but was then defeated by the Avengers again.The Avengers #51.

In The Incredible Hulk issues #197 (\\"...And Man-Thing makes three!\\") and #198 (\\"The Shangri-La syndrome!\\"), the Collector uses the previously captured Man-Thing and the Glob to capture the Hulk. After capturing the Hulk, the Collector muses on capturing the rest of the original Avengers. The Hulk escapes freeing several of the Collectors exhibits. The newly free exhibits die from old age because they are no longer artificially preserved by the power of the Collector's ship. Man-Thing also escapes disappearing into the Swamp. The Glob remains aboard the ship and though it is not shown, it is suggested that the Glob kills the Collector. The lines from the comic book are \\"What the Glob wants here is quite simple: He wants the Collectors life! The Collector's anguished scream fades long before it can filter through the museum-ships long corridors. For several seconds silence reigns both within the ship and without--\\"The Incredible Hulk vol. 1 #197-198. Marvel Comics. =The Korvac Saga= After Thanos was defeated by Earth's superheroes, the Collector foresaw a second major threat: Korvac the Machine Man, a cyborg monstrosity from the 31st century of a divergent timeline, taking the form of a man named Michael in 20th century New York. The Avengers were also aware of a new threat but did not know his identity. In an attempt to protect them, the Collector added some of them to his collection and was probably planning to enlist their aid, when a second group of Avengers appeared and defeated him in combat.The Avengers vol. 1 #174. Marvel Comics. After the defeat, the Collector remained in seclusion until a human named Peter Tran of Avondale summoned him to Earth. Sensing that his end was at hand, the Collector revealed that having learned of Korvac, he had made his own daughter Carina into a spy and living weapon to use against the Machine Man, imbuing her with the Power Primordial. Just as he was about to tell the heroes who their enemy was, Michael learned of his duplicity and used his cosmic powers to blast the Collector into atoms, proving the prediction of the aged scholar's own end to be correct.The Avengers #172-174.

The Collector also assisted his fellow elders in a plot to kill Galactus and recreate the universe, but he was thwarted by the Silver Surfer and consumed by Galactus.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #3-4, 7, 9, 10. Marvel Comics. Since Death had vowed that the Elders could no longer die, they caused Galactus to have \\"cosmic indigestion\\" until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos.Silver Surfer Vol. 2 #17.

The Collector re-appeared when the Avengers fought Thane Ector and the Brethren, who were noted to have escaped from the Collector's collection. It was then noted later that the Collector had planned all of this, intending the Brethren to lay waste to the Earth so that he could \\"collect\\" the surviving humans. It was at this point he showed his true form to the Avengers and was noted to be very powerful; enough to subdue Thane Ector. The Collector was eventually thwarted by the Avengers, and the Brethren's Uni-Mind.The Avengers #334-339. Marvel Comics. The Collector next used the Collection Agency and the Silver Surfer as pawns to capture a virus that caused insanity.Silver Surfer Vol. 3 #58-61, 64. Marvel Comics. The Collector has become involved with Galactus once again when the latter entity wished to devour one of the worlds that held many of the entities the Collector had taken. Among them were the Starjammers and Wolverine.Wolverine #135. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster later makes a bet with the Collector who sets his team of Defenders (Hulk, Doctor Strange, Namor, and the Silver Surfer) against the Grandmaster's team of Offenders (which comprises the Red Hulk, Baron Mordo, Tiger Shark, and Terrax).Hulk #10 (2009).

Eight months after the events of \\"Secret Wars\\" as part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, the Collector is shown in charge of Battlerealm, the small surviving portion of Battleworld. He engages in a new Contest of Champions with the Grandmaster, with the prize being an ancient cosmic artifact called the Iso-Sphere.Contest of Champions (vol. 2) #1-2. Marvel Comics. When the hammer of the Earth-1610 Thor fell to Asgard after Battleworld had been erased, the Collector took all of the currently-abandoned Asgard into his possession when he found that he was unable to lift the hammer himself. When Thor came to investigate rumors of the hammer's existence, the Collector took Thor prisoner, threatening to kill other aliens in his collection unless Thor would tell him the 'secret' of how to bypass the worthiness enchantment.The Unworthy Thor #2. Marvel Comics. He then encounters Proxima Midnight and Black Swan, who were sent by Thanos to retrieve the hammer. After Odinson, Beta Ray Bill, Odinson's pet goat Toothgnasher and the Helhound Thori escape and battle his army, the Collector tries to recapture Odinson, only for him to break free and grab the hammer.The Unworthy Thor #3-4. Marvel Comics. Odinson chooses not to claim the hammer, but he and Bill are able to channel its power to return Asgard to its true place, simultaneously decimating the Collector's forces, prompting him to kill his last soldier so that he can have the pleasure of destroying something unique.The Unworthy Thor #5. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Collector possesses the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including projecting concussive force beams, and the increasing of his size and mass (and hence physical strength) at will. He also possesses limited shape-changing abilities. His precognitive abilities give him brief visions of alternate future, although he must meditate for long periods to identify the individuals he sees in the vision and its apparent point in time. He has telepathic abilities that enable him to make limited contact with the minds of other Elders. Due to a vow by Death, the Collector and all the Elders cannot die and are effectively immortal. The Collector has a vast knowledge and comprehension of the advanced science and technology of numerous alien worlds, as well as a collection of devices and artifacts from those worlds. His armored battle-suit is made of the alien metal etherion, which amplifies the wearer's strength to superhuman levels, and it has jets that permit flight. He uses various weapons from many time periods and different worlds. Among his arsenal from Earth's past are catapults, Tibetan crystal balls that emit mystical rays, and magic beans that can conjure up warrior giants. He possesses a magic lamp that can summon a four-headed djinn with mystical powers. His \\"boxes\\" are rectangular \\"interdimensional traps\\" that can weaken a victim's strength or sanity. Other weapons include gigantic robot guards, a stun beam, and stasis beams. The Collector also has zoos of alien beasts which he can release to attack his adversaries. Among this is Snake-Eyes, an enormous alien serpent with hypnotic powers. Other items in his collection include the Obedience Potion, with which the Collector can compel a human victim to do his bidding; the Cosmic Viewer, with which he can monitor events on various worlds; a Kymellian translation/control device resembling a flute, with which he can communicate with other living beings; and a time probe enabling him to find and procure artifacts from other time periods. He uses starships holding museums of his collections, a Temporal Assimilator that allows time travel, Persian \\"flying carpets\\" and a \\"flying cape\\" that allowed flight. He formerly possessed the Infinity Gem that could control reality, but he did not understand its power.The Thanos Quest #2 (Nov. 1990). Marvel Comics.

Magnetic resonance angiography is used to generate images of arteries (and less commonly veins) in order to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing), occlusions, aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture) or other abnormalities. MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (the latter exam is often referred to as a \\"run-off\\").  Acquisition  A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures of blood vessels, both arteries and veins, based on flow effects or on contrast (inherent or pharmacologically generated). The most frequently applied MRA methods involve the use intravenous contrast agents, particularly those containing gadolinium to shorten the T1 of blood to about 250 ms, shorter than the T1 of all other tissues (except fat). Short-TR sequences produce bright images of the blood. However, many other techniques for performing MRA exist, and can be classified into two general groups: 'flow-dependent' methods and 'flow-independent' methods. =Flow-dependent angiography= One group of methods for MRA is based on blood flow. Those methods are referred to as flow dependent MRA. They take advantage of the fact that the blood within vessels is flowing to distinguish the vessels from other static tissue. That way, images of the vasculature can be produced. Flow dependent MRA can be divided into different categories: There is phase-contrast MRA (PC-MRA) which utilizes phase differences to distinguish blood from static tissue and time-of-flight MRA (TOF MRA) which exploits that moving spins of the blood experience fewer excitation pulses than static tissue, e.g. when imaging a thin slice. Time-of- flight (TOF) or inflow angiography, uses a short echo time and flow compensation to make flowing blood much brighter than stationary tissue. As flowing blood enters the area being imaged it has seen a limited number of excitation pulses so it is not saturated, this gives it a much higher signal than the saturated stationary tissue. As this method is dependent on flowing blood, areas with slow flow (such as large aneurysms) or flow that is in plane of the image may not be well visualized. This is most commonly used in the head and neck and gives detailed high-resolution images. It is also the most common technique used for routine angiographic evaluation of the intracranial circulation in patients with ischemic stroke. =Phase-contrast MRA= Vastly undersampled Isotropic Projection Reconstruction (VIPR) of a Phase Contrast (PC) MRI sequence of a 56-year-old male with dissections of the celiac artery (upper) and the superior mesenteric artery (lower). Laminar flow is present in the true lumen (closed arrow) and helical flow is present in the false lumen (open arrow). (CC-BY-2.0) Phase-contrast (PC-MRA) can be used to encode the velocity of moving blood in the magnetic resonance signal's phase. The most common method used to encode velocity is the application of a bipolar gradient between the excitation pulse and the readout. A bipolar gradient is formed by two symmetric lobes of equal area. It is created by turning on the magnetic field gradient for some time, and then switching the magnetic field gradient to the opposite direction for the same amount of time. By definition, the total area (0th moment) of a bipolar gradient, G_\\\\text{bip}, is null: : \\\\int G_\\\\text{bip}\\\\, dt = 0 (1) The bipolar gradient can be applied along any axis or combination of axes depending on the direction along which flow is to be measured (e.g. x). \\\\Delta \\\\Phi, the phase accrued during the application of the gradient, is 0 for stationary spins: their phase is unaffected by the application of the bipolar gradient. For spins moving with a constant velocity, v_x, along the direction of the applied bipolar gradient: : \\\\Delta \\\\Phi = \\\\gamma v_x \\\\Delta m_1 (2) The accrued phase is proportional to both v_x and the 1st moment of the bipolar gradient, \\\\Delta m_1, thus providing a means to estimate v_x. \\\\gamma is the Larmor frequency of the imaged spins. To measure \\\\Delta \\\\Phi, of the MRI signal is manipulated by bipolar gradients (varying magnetic fields) that are preset to a maximum expected flow velocity. An image acquisition that is reverse of the bipolar gradient is then acquired and the difference of the two images is calculated. Static tissues such as muscle or bone will subtract out, however moving tissues such as blood will acquire a different phase since it moves constantly through the gradient, thus also giving its speed of the flow. Since phase-contrast can only acquire flow in one direction at a time, 3 separate image acquisitions in all three directions must be computed to give the complete image of flow. Despite the slowness of this method, the strength of the technique is that in addition to imaging flowing blood, quantitative measurements of blood flow can be obtained. =Flow-independent angiography= Whereas most of techniques in MRA rely on contrast agents or flow into blood to generate contrast (Contrast Enhanced techniques), there are also non-contrast enhanced flow-independent methods. These methods, as the name suggests, do not rely on flow, but are instead based on the differences of T1, T2 and chemical shift of the different tissues of the voxel. One of the main advantages of this kind of techniques is that we may image the regions of slow flow often found in patients with vascular diseases more easily. Moreover, non-contrast enhanced methods do not require the administration of additional contrast agent, which have been recently linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography uses injection of MRI contrast agents and is currently the most common method of performing MRA. The contrast medium is injected into a vein, and images are acquired both pre-contrast and during the first pass of the agent through the arteries. By subtraction of these two acquisitions in post- processing, an image is obtained which in principle only shows blood vessels, and not the surrounding tissue. Provided that the timing is correct, this may result in images of very high quality. An alternative is to use a contrast agent that does not, as most agents, leave the vascular system within a few minutes, but remains in the circulation up to an hour (a \\"blood-pool agent\\"). Since longer time is available for image acquisition, higher resolution imaging is possible. A problem, however, is the fact that both arteries and veins are enhanced at the same time if higher resolution images are required. Subtractionless contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography: recent developments in MRA technology have made it possible to create high quality contrast-enhanced MRA images without subtraction of a non-contrast enhanced mask image. This approach has been shown to improve diagnostic quality, because it prevents motion subtraction artifacts as well as an increase of image background noise, both direct results of the image subtraction. An important condition for this approach is to have excellent body fat suppression over large image areas, which is possible by using mDIXON acquisition methods. Traditional MRA suppresses signals originating from body fat during the actual image acquisition, which is a method that is sensitive to small deviations in the magnetic and electromagnetic fields and as a result may show insufficient fat suppression in some areas. mDIXON methods can distinguish and accurately separate image signals created by fat or water. By using the 'water images' for MRA scans, virtually no body fat is seen so that no subtraction masks are needed for high quality MR venograms. Non-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography: Since the injection of contrast agents may be dangerous for patients with poor kidney function, others techniques have been developed, which do not require any injection. These methods are based on the differences of T1, T2 and chemical shift of the different tissues of the voxel. A notable non-enhanced method for flow-independent angiography is balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging which naturally produces high signal from arteries and veins. =2D and 3D acquisitions= 3D rendered MRA to identify an aberrant subclavian artery. For the acquisition of the images two different approaches exist. In general, 2D and 3D images can be acquired. If 3D data is acquired, cross sections at arbitrary view angles can be calculated. Three-dimensional data can also be generated by combining 2D data from different slices, but this approach results in lower quality images at view angles different from the original data acquisition. Furthermore, the 3D data can not only be used to create cross sectional images, but also projections can be calculated from the data. Three-dimensional data acquisition might also be helpful when dealing with complex vessel geometries where blood is flowing in all spatial directions (unfortunately, this case also requires three different flow encodings, one in each spatial direction). Both PC-MRA and TOF-MRA have advantages and disadvantages. PC-MRA has fewer difficulties with slow flow than TOF-MRA and also allows quantitative measurements of flow. PC-MRA shows low sensitivity when imaging pulsating and non-uniform flow. In general, slow blood flow is a major challenge in flow dependent MRA. It causes the differences between the blood signal and the static tissue signal to be small. This either applies to PC-MRA where the phase difference between blood and static tissue is reduced compared to faster flow and to TOF-MRA where the transverse blood magnetization and thus the blood signal are reduced. Contrast agents may be used to increase blood signal ‚Äì this is especially important for very small vessels and vessels with very small flow velocities that normally show accordingly weak signal. Unfortunately, the use of gadolinium-based contrast media can be dangerous if patients suffer from poor renal function. To avoid these complications as well as eliminate the costs of contrast media, non-enhanced methods have been researched recently. =Non-enhanced techniques in development= Flow- independent NEMRA methods are not based on flow, but exploit differences in T1, T2 and chemical shift to distinguish blood from static tissue. Gated subtraction fast spin-echo: An imaging technique that subtracts two fast spin echo sequences acquired at systole and diastole. Arteriography is achieved by subtracting the systolic data, where the arteries appear dark, from the diastolic data set, where the arteries appear bright. Requires the use of electrocardiographic gating. Trade names for this technique include Fresh Blood Imaging (Toshiba), TRANCE (Philips), native SPACE (Siemens) and DeltaFlow (GE). 4D dynamic MR angiography (4D-MRA): The first images, before enhancement, serve as a subtraction mask to extract the vascular tree in the succeeding images. Allows the operator to divide arterial and venous phases of a blood-groove with visualisation of its dynamics. Much less time has been spent researching this method so far in comparison with other methods of MRA. BOLD venography or susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI): This method exploits the susceptibility differences between tissues and uses the phase image to detect these differences. The magnitude and phase data are combined (digitally, by an image-processing program) to produce an enhanced contrast magnitude image which is exquisitely sensitive to venous blood, hemorrhage and iron storage. The imaging of venous blood with SWI is a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique which is why it was (and is sometimes still) referred to as BOLD venography. Due to its sensitivity to venous blood SWI is commonly used in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and for high resolution brain venographies. Similar procedures to flow effect based MRA can be used to image veins. For instance, Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is achieved by exciting a plane inferiorly while signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane, and thus imaging the venous blood which has recently moved from the excited plane. Differences in tissue signals, can also be used for MRA. This method is based on the different signal properties of blood compared to other tissues in the body, independent of MR flow effects. This is most successfully done with balanced pulse sequences such as TrueFISP or bTFE. BOLD can also be used in stroke imaging in order to assess the viability of tissue survival. Artifacts MRA techniques in general are sensitive to turbulent flow, which causes a variety of different magnetized proton spins to lose phase coherence (intra-voxel dephasing phenomenon) and cause a loss of signal. This phenomenon may result in the overestimation of arterial stenosis. Other artifacts observed at MRA include: Phase-contrast MRA: Phase wrapping caused by the under estimation of maximum blood velocity in the image. The fast moving blood about maximum set velocity for phase- contrast MRA gets aliased and the signal wraps from pi to -pi instead making flow information unreliable. This can be avoided by using velocity encoding (VENC) values above the maximum measured velocity. It can also be corrected with the so-called phase-unwrapping. Maxwell terms: caused by the switching of the gradients field in the main field B0. This cause the over magnetic field to be distort and give inaccurate phase information for the flow. Acceleration: accelerating blood flow is not properly encoded by phase- contrast techniques and can lead to errors in quantifying blood flow. Time-of- flight MRA: Saturation artifact due to laminar flow: In many vessels, blood flow is slower near the vessel walls than near the center of the vessel. This causes blood near the vessel walls to become saturated and can reduce the apparent caliber of the vessel. Venetian blind' artifact: Because the technique acquires images in slabs, a non-uniform flip angle across the slab can appear as horizontal stripe in the composed images.  Visualization  Maximum intensity projection of an MRA covering from the aortic arch to just below the circle of Willis Occasionally, MRA directly produces (thick) slices that contain the entire vessel of interest. More commonly, however, the acquisition results in a stack of slices representing a 3D volume in the body. To display this 3D dataset on a 2D device such as a computer monitor, some rendering method has to be used. The most common method is maximum intensity projection (MIP), where the computer simulates rays through the volume and selects the highest value for display on the screen. The resulting images resemble conventional catheter angiography images. If several such projections are combined into a cine loop or QuickTime VR object, the depth impression is improved, and the observer can get a good perception of 3D structure. An alternative to MIP is direct volume rendering where the MR signal is translated to properties like brightness, opacity and color and then used in an optical model.  Clinical use  MRA has been successful in studying many arteries in the body, including cerebral and other vessels in the head and neck, the aorta and its major branches in the thorax and abdomen, the renal arteries, and the arteries in the lower limbs. For the coronary arteries, however, MRA has been less successful than CT angiography or invasive catheter angiography. Most often, the underlying disease is atherosclerosis, but medical conditions like aneurysms or abnormal vascular anatomy can also be diagnosed. An advantage of MRA compared to invasive catheter angiography is the non-invasive character of the examination (no catheters have to be introduced in the body). Another advantage, compared to CT angiography and catheter angiography, is that the patient is not exposed to any ionizing radiation. Also, contrast media used for MRI tend to be less toxic than those used for CT angiography and catheter angiography, with fewer people having any risk of allergy. Also far less is needed to be injected into the patient. The greatest drawbacks of the method are its comparatively high cost and its somewhat limited spatial resolution. The length of time the scans take can also be an issue, with CT being far quicker. It is also ruled out in patients for whom MRI exams may be unsafe (such as having a pacemaker or metal in the eyes or certain surgical clips). MRA procedures for visualizing cranial circulation are no different from the positioning for a normal MRI brain. Immobilization within the head coil will be required. MRA is usually a part of the total MRI brain examination and adds approximately 10 minutes to the normal MRI protocol.

Majali served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Jordanian Armed Forces from 1958 to 1975, as Minister of Defense from 1967 to 1968, and as a member of the Jordanian Senate for 30 years from 1967 to 1997. Born in Ma'an, Majali joined Jordan's Arab Legion in 1932, reportedly gaining a reputation of bravery and canniness. He commanded Jordan's forces against Israel during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Six Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973; and against the Palestine Liberation Organization and Syria during Black September in 1970. During the last 20 years of his life, he resigned from the army and served as Senator in the Jordanian Parliament's upper chamber. Majali is considered to be Jordan's greatest military commander; he was the only Arab commander to inflict military victories against Israelis, Palestinians and Syrians alike. King Hussein's biographer, James Lunt, dubbed Majali the grand seigneur of Karak, and the beau sabreur of the army. Majali is one of few Jordanians, along with the Kings of Jordan, to hold the Field Marshal rank‚Äìthe highest rank in the Jordanian army. Life and career Habis Majali seen with Prime Minister Wasfi Tal during a military parade. Habis Majali walking alongside Queen Alia, 1960s. Majali joined Jordan's Arab Legion in 1932, soon impressing Glubb Pasha. Although he acquired modern skills, Majali maintained his Bedouin √©lan. King Hussein's biographer, James Lunt, dubbed Majali the grand seigneur of Karak and beau sabreur of the army. Habis Pasha was the only Arab commander to win military victories against Israelis, Palestinians and Syrians alike. His \\"baptism of fire\\", according to The Guardian obituary, came during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, when he successfully defended the town of Latrun near Jerusalem against Israeli forces. He managed to secure the West Bank under Glubb Pasha. Majali claimed that he had caught Ariel Sharon in the battle, who was then a young Lieutenant. Sharon, who would later become Israeli prime minister, denied the claim. However, Habis boasted: \\"Sharon is like a grizzly bear, I captured him for 9 days, I healed his wounds and released him due to his insignificance.\\" Few fellow high-ranking Jordanian officers testified in favour of his account. It was Majali who was commander of the Royal Guard when King Abdullah I was assassinated on 20 July 1951 as he was entering the Al Aqsa mosque. Abdullah insisted on speaking to the crowds on his way to the mosque, but Majali thought it was too dangerous and ordered soldiers to surround the King‚Äìangering him. The King moved ahead of his guards, and was shot dead by a Palestinian. King Hussein found Majali valuable after he was responsible for tracking down his Nasserite enemies during the upheavals of the 1950s. Majali was tasked in 1960 with restoring order after Syrian agents had murdered his cousin Prime Minister Hazza' Majali. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Majali was forced during the war to relinquish Jordan's army command to Egypt. He then resigned, but served as defense minister until 1968. Majali was appointed as Chief of Staff of the army in 1970, to supervise the expulsion of Palestinian fedayeen (guerrillas) from Jordan during what became known as Black September. On the Yom Kippor War in 1973, Trevor N. Dupuy, an American historian, later wrote that Israelis were impressed by \\"Jordanian tactical performance, evidencing higher professional standards than the Syrians or the Iraqis\\".

After investigating for a year, MIT fired Van Parijs for research misconduct. Van Parijs admitted to fabricating and falsifying research data in a paper, several unpublished manuscripts, and grant applications. In March 2011, Van Parijs pleaded guilty in a U.S. District Court in Boston to one count of making a false statement on a federal grant application. The government asked Judge Denise Casper for a 6-month jail term because of the seriousness of the fraud, which involved a $2-million grant. After several prominent scientists including Van Parijs' former post-doc supervisor pleading for clemency on his behalf, on 13 June, Van Parijs was finally sentenced six months of home detention with electronic monitoring, plus 400 hours of community service and a payment to MIT of $61,117 - restitution for the already-spent grant money that MIT had to return to the National Institutes of Health . Van Parijs' area of research was in the use of short-interference RNA in studying disease mechanisms, especially in autoimmune diseases. He was studying normal immune cell function and defects in these cells during disease development.

Despite its title, it does not have any connection to No Retreat, No Surrender, as it plots an independent story. The film was originally released as Raging Thunder in the Philippines. Plot In Moc Hoa, Vietnam, a group of prisoners are executed under the watchful eye of General Ty (Hwang Jang Lee). Meanwhile, Scott Wylde (Loren Avedon), an American college student, visits the country to visit his former teacher and best friend Mac Jarvis (Max Thayer), meeting Terry (Cynthia Rothrock), Mac's former lover, in the process. Terry tells Scott that Mac may be in Patpong, a seedy area of Bangkok. Scott leaves the gym and heads for his hotel, where he has dinner with his girlfriend Sulin Nguyen (Patra Wanthivanond). During their date, Sulin's father (Perm Hongsakul) receives a disturbing phone call and leaves his house. In the meantime, a group of thugs crash into Scott's room and kidnap Sulin. Scott fights and kills the two thugs left behind to murder him. At Sulin's house, he finds that her entire family except for her father has been killed. Scott is framed for the murders and drug possession. Despite Mr. Nguyen's pleas, the American consulate suggests sending Scott to Singapore and keeping him detained for three months. He escapes, heading to Patpong. At Patpong, Scott finds Mac at the Super Star bar, arm wrestling with a local man. When Mac wins, his opponent attacks him with a broken bottle, but Scott intervenes. He tells a concerned Mac of his recent problems. When the duo go to dinner at a local marketside area, they are threatened by the kidnappers. They force one of the thugs to tell them where Sulin is located, learning she has been taken to Cambodia. Returning to Mac's private warehouse, an artillery factory, Scott learns that Sulin's father's was a Vietnamese general who, for the sake of his family, stopped a deal with a Soviet militia. Mac is convinced that the Soviets have joined forces with the Vietnamese army and have set up base in Cambodia. Scott decides he must rescue Sulin. The next morning, as they wait for a helicopter, they are ambushed by Thai police. However, Terry comes to aid and they narrowly escape by helicopter. Meanwhile, the leader of the Soviet Army, Yuri (Matthias Hues), has arrived. He challenges a Chinese refugee held with the recent prisoners of war to fight for his freedom. Using his brute strength, he defeats the refugee, yet tells him he is free to leave. As the refugee starts walking away, Yuri shoots and throws him into an alligator pit. He threatens to throw Sulin in the pit as well if her father does not arrive soon. Arriving in Cambodia, Scott, Terry, and Mac contact Colonel Tol Nol (Nirut Sirijunya), an old customer of Mac's. Mac offers artillery in exchange for assistance, but Tol Nol refuses. However, Scott makes a deal on a new tank and Tol Nol accepts under the condition that Terry stays behind. Tol Nol's camp is then bombed, and Scott injures his arm in the process. The trio leave by foot the following day, along the way fending off a Buddhist temple used as a spy base. They skirmish with the Vietnamese army, which kidnaps Terry, and leave believing to have killed Scott and Mac with a rocket launcher. However, Scott and Mac escape the blast. Meanwhile, Mr. Nguyen is murdered by an assassin hiding in a manhole in Bangkok. Later that night, Scott and Mac secretly plant explosives and other weaponry in the Soviet camp. The next morning, as Sulin and Terry are slated to be executed in the alligator pit, Scott and Mac attack the Soviets. They successfully kill all the soldiers except Yuri, who arrives with a machine gun as Scott is heading towards his friends; Terry sacrifices herself to save Scott from being gunned down. Mac attempts to save her and professes his love for her, but she dies from her wounds. Scott distracts Yuri with an arrow to his arm and begins a long one-on-one fight, which ends as Yuri ends up in the alligator pit, where Scott shoots him with a machine gun. He is reunited with Sulin but saddened when he learns Terry has died. Together, Scott, Sulin, and Mac, holding Terry, walk away to the camp. Cast *Loren Avedon as Scott Wylde *Cynthia Rothrock as Terry *Patra Wanthivamod as Sulin Nguyen *Max Thayer as Mac Jarvis *Matthias Hues as Yuri *Nirut Sirichanya as Colonel Tol Nol *Hwang Jang Lee as Ty *Perm Hongsakul as Mr. Nguyen *Chesda Smithsuth as Police Captain *Grisapong Hanviriyakitichai as Pimp *Roy Horan as American Consular *Bunchai Imasarunrak as Head Monk *Opisok Praechaya as Gym Manager *Sanchai Martves as Restaurant Manager *Suang Sosretananant as Arm Wrestler Production This film was originally intended to be a direct sequel to No Retreat, No Surrender, but safety concerns over filming in Cambodian jungles persuaded Jean-Claude Van Damme to back out of the project, and he convinced Kurt McKinney to do the same. The story and characters had to be changed with McKinney's character - Jason Stillwell (a Jeet Kune Do expert taught by the ghost of Bruce Lee) - transformed into Scott Wylde, a Tae Kwon Do expert played by Loren Avedon. Matthias Hues was also cast as the new Russian character. Loren Avedon did not follow Jean Claude's example and stayed on after this film fulfilling his three-picture contract. Matthias Hues had no prior martial arts training. To prepare for the film, producer Roy Horan had Hues train with his martial arts teacher, co-star Hwang Jang-lee. The film is also known as Karate Tiger 2 and Raging Thunder. It was followed by No Retreat, No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers, which again featured Avedon in the lead role but is unrelated in terms of plot and characters. Release The film was released in the Philippines as Raging Thunder by Asia Films on November 5, 1987. In the United States, the film was released on January 27, 1989. DVD release The film has never been released on Region 1 DVD, and as of December 2009, no plans have been announced for a release. It has however been readily available on Region 4 DVD and Region 2 DVD in both Australia and Europe since 2005.

Bailey (born May 21, 1957) is a retired American professional basketball player. A 6'9\\" (2.06 m) forward/center from Rutgers University, he was selected with the 6th pick of the 1979 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. Nicknamed \\"Jammin' James,\\" he spent 9 seasons (1979‚Äì1988) in the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing for the Sonics as well as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets, New York Knicks, and Phoenix Suns. He ended his NBA career with 5,246 total points. While at Rutgers, Bailey was a formidable player, displaying a strong inside presence in addition to possessing great leaping ability. He was famous for his conversion of \\"alley oop\\" passes into slam dunks. The rule allowing dunking was re-instituted in college basketball beginning with the 1976-77 season, Bailey's sophomore year. Bailey's slam dunks were an immediate sensation at Rutgers, and Bailey led the team with 88 dunks as a sophomore. He increased this number to 116 as a junior. However, as a senior, he was met with constant double and triple teaming, and Rutgers' opponents \\"held\\" him to 79 dunks as a senior. The Scarlet Knights advanced to the NCAA basketball Final Four in 1976, Bailey's freshman year, arriving with a 31-0 record. However, they were defeated by Michigan in the national semi finals, and then lost to UCLA in the 3rd place (consolation) game. Bailey is number three on the Rutgers all-time scoring list (2,034 points), and second in career rebounds behind Phil Sellers (1,047). He is also the second leading shot-blocker in Rutgers history behind Roy Hinson. Bailey went on to capture All-America honors from UPI and The Sporting News in 1978. Bailey's #20 jersey was retired by Rutgers in 1993, and he was inducted into the Rutgers Hall of Fame in the same year.

It is situated in the Hundred of Grumbald's Ash. The village extends from Chipping Sodbury in the West to the Cotswold Edge in the East and is on the Cotswold Way. The Badminton Road (A432) winds eastwards towards Badminton, Gloucestershire through the village, up to the Cross Hands junction with the A46, which runs along the top of the Cotswold escarpment from Bath to Stroud. The village lies on an old coaching route, and is much more ancient than its westerly neighbour, Chipping Sodbury: hence the name 'Old' Sodbury.  Name and fort  LIDAR showing the layout of Old Sodbury Camp The name of the village is recorded in Anglo-Saxon (in the dative case) as Soppanbyrig = \\"Soppa's fort\\" and in Domesday Book as Sopeberie. The name may refer to the Iron Age hillfort just to the north-east of the village. The fort, perched on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment, is enclosed on three sides by two parallel earthworks, and is open to the west, commanding an impressive view of the Frome Valley, Severn Vale and the Welsh mountains. The earth walls enclose an area of , and are usually kept mown by the local farmer (the fort is in private hands, but accessible). The fort can be reached by footpath from the A46 road, and through the village from below via the Cotswold Way. The Romans strengthened the fort for use as a camp to support their western frontier. In AD 577 the Saxon army used the fort as a camp before the battle of Dyrham, a few miles to the south. Bishop Milred (743‚Äì755) granted the land at Soppenbyrig to Eanbald, and he to Eastmund, on condition that there was a man in Holy Orders, and worthy of them, in their family, but if otherwise, the lands would pass back to the See of Worcester. In 888 the covenant failed; however, the land was granted to Eadnoth in perpetuity for the rent of 15 shillings, payable to the See of Worcester yearly at Tetbury. In Edward the Confessor's reign, the manor formed part of the estate of Brictric, Earl of Gloucester. King Edward IV camped here in 1471 before attacking the army of Margaret of Anjou at the Battle of Tewkesbury.  Church  The church of St. John the Baptist The Church of Saint John the Baptist is late Norman or Transitional, and is some 900 years old. It has two effigies of knights: one is late 14th century, carved in wood; and the other is dated to 1240, carved in stone, featuring a very large shield. These two are considered to have been lords of the local manor. The church is of late Norman period, and although it has been much enlarged and altered, much of the original work remains. In the nave there is an arcade of Normal columns, there are two Norman windows and the tower is also Norman. In the churchyard at Old Sodbury is a number of old bale-tombs; these were tombs for rich merchants. Some of the gravestones date back to the early 19th century. Just outside the churchyard on the hillside is a topograph (a large stone with an engraving), installed to commemorate the second millennium, that shows Old Sodbury in relation to its geographical surroundings.  Other buildings  The Church of England School There are two primary schools (Old Sodbury CofE Primary School, and the privately run Overndale School), two hotels, and two pubs, The Bell Hotel and The Dog Inn. The village has a petrol station, a football pitch and a playground, but no longer a post office since the round of closures in 2008. The village shop soldiered on in the same premises on the Badminton Road for another three years, but finally closed in 2011. The historic Cross Hands Hotel stands on the North-Eastern corner of the A46 crossroads, and there is a farm shop (Cotswold Edge) opposite the hotel. There is a crenellated tower resembling a rook chess piece on the escarpment immediately above and to the East of the village, visible from the main road. It performs the function of a ventilation shaft (the first of six) for the Chipping Sodbury Tunnel on the main railway line from South Wales, via Bristol Parkway to London Paddington. This line was opened in 1903 as part of the Great Western Railway, which runs through the village and under the hill above it. Trains used to stop at Chipping Sodbury and Badminton stations, which were closed following the Beeching cuts. The nearest station is now Yate on the main line from Bristol Temple Meads to Birmingham, which crosses the former Great Western Railway to the South of Yate. Lyegrove House, one mile east of the village just off the B4040 road to Badminton, is 17th century in origin, altered in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Gothic style Lodge was built in 1835 and designed by Charles Dyer of Bristol. In 1927, the Countess of Westmorland contracted George Herbert Kitchin (1870-1951) to restore the house and lay out the formal gardens. Other examples, of Kitchin's designs are Compton End, Winchester, and Horsley Hall, Gresford.

Bunting began as a revivalist but became dedicated to church order and discipline. He was a popular preacher in numerous cities. He held numerous senior positions as administrator and watched budgets closely. He and his allies centralised power by making the conference the final arbiter of Methodism, and giving it the power to reassign preachers and select district superintendents. He was particularly zealous in the cause of foreign missions. Politically, he was conservative, as were most Methodist leaders of the time. Career Born of humble parentage at Manchester, he was educated at Manchester Grammar School. He had been converted at the age of twelve under the ministry of the Wesleyan Joseph Benson, and, at the age of nineteen, began to preach among the revivalists. He was still a practising revivalist as late as 1802. At Macclesfield, he saw revivals leading to dissension and division, and his views changed fundamentally. From this time onwards Bunting was a exponent of church order and discipline, and an implacable opponent of revivalism. He was received into full Connexion (i.e., becoming an ordained minister) in 1803. He continued to minister for upwards of 57 years in Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, London and elsewhere. In 1835, he was appointed president of the first Wesleyan theological college (at Hoxton), and in this position he succeeded in materially raising the standard of education among Wesleyan ministers. He was four times chosen to be President of the Conference (the ruling body of the Wesleyan Methodist Church), in 1820, 1828, 1836 and 1844, was repeatedly secretary of the Legal Hundred, and for eighteen years was secretary to the Wesleyan Missionary Society. Under him Methodism ceased to be tied to the established Church of England and became wholly separate. He favoured the extension of lay power in committees, and was particularly zealous in the cause of foreign missions. Under Bunting's presidency in 1820 the Resolutions on Pastoral Work or Liverpool Minutes were adopted by the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in Liverpool,Stobart, A., Editorial in Holiness: the Journal of Wesley House Cambridge, Volume 3 (2017) Issue 1 setting out the working principles by which the Methodist leaders present at the conference sought \\"to cultivate more fully the spirit of Christian pastors\\". They were revised by conference in 1885.Liverpool Minutes 1820, ‚ÄòResolutions on Pastoral Work‚Äô, I, found in The Constitutional Practice and Discipline of the Methodist Church, Volume 1, Peterborough: Methodist Publishing House, 1988 Methodist researcher Andrew StobartWesley House Cambridge, Andrew Stobart. Retrieved 2 June 2019 notes that the resolutions were adopted at a time when the recently established Wesleyan Methodist Church was struggling to maintain membership numbers in its early years: the movement had recorded a net loss of 4,688 members during the previous year. Politically, Bunting was conservative: for example, as President of the Conference, he supported the transportation of the Tolpuddle martyrsKent, J. (1977), Methodism and social change in Britain.

He was born in Sukhumi, Georgian SSR, and trained in Sukhumi and later in Tbilisi. Athletics career Saneyev was born in a poor family, with disabled and paralyzed father who died when Saneyev was 15 years old. Saneyev took athletics in 1956, training in the high jump at the Gantiadi boarding school; his first coach was Akop Kerselyan. Six years later Kerselyan advised him to specialize in the triple jump. In 1963 Saneyev finished third in his first All-Union competition ‚Äì Schoolchildrens' Spartakiad The major success came in 1968, when he won at the USSR Championships and at the 1968 Summer Olympics, where on 17 October he set the World Record twice: to 17.23 m and to 17.39 m.World Record Progression ‚Äì Triple Jump. IOC On the same date four years later Saneyev set the World Record once again, now in Sukhumi, to 17.44 m. He won gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics and at the 1976 Summer Olympics and a silver at the 1980 Summer Olympics. He also won at the 1969 European Championships, 1974 European Championships, at the 1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, 1976 and 1977 European Athletics Indoor Championships. Saneyev was the USSR Champion in 1968‚Äì71, 1973‚Äì75 and 1978. 1980 Olympics Saneyev came to the 1980 Olympics hoping for a fourth gold medal, though he understood that several jumpers had better chances for a gold, especially the world record holder Jo√£o Carlos de Oliveira. Soviet Jaak Uudm√§e won the gold medal (17.35 m), followed by Saneyev (17.24 m) and Oliveira (17.22 m). The event was marred by controversial judging. Five out of seven jumps by Ian Campbell were discarded, as well as four jumps by Oliveira; Uudm√§e had two fouls and Saneyev one. All IAAF inspectors were pulled out of the field on the day of the triple jump final and replaced by Soviet staff. Both Campbell and de Oliveira jumped beyond Uudm√§e's leading mark more than once, but all of these jumps were discarded despite protests. The longest Campbell's jumps was ruled a \\"scrape\\" foul: the officials claimed his trailing leg had touched the track during the step phase, though it was unlikely to scrape and jump that far. Saneyev did not contest his foul, though it also fell on his strongest jump. He later noted that the winning jump by Uudm√§e was likely overstepped.–í–∏–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –°–∞–Ω–µ–µ–≤: –æ—Ç –ø—Ä—ã–∂–∫–æ–≤ —è –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª —É–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ. runnersclub.ru (Interview in Russian). 29 June 2015 Retirement Saneyev retired after the 1980 Olympics, and was much congratulated well before that: he was awarded Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1969, Order of Lenin in 1972 and Order of Friendship of Peoples in 1976. At the 1980 Games he was selected as an Olympic torch bearer, though this honor is usually given to retired athletes. In retirement, he headed the USSR jumping team for four years, and later worked at his formative club, Dynamo Tbilisi. In the early 1990s, after the Soviet Union broke up and a civil war started in Georgia, Saneyev lost his job, and moved to Australia with his wife and 15-year-old son. His brief coaching contract soon expired, and Saneyev was about to sell his Olympic medals to feed his family. He reconsidered at the last moment and took odd jobs instead, such as pizza delivery. He finally found a regular job as a physical education teacher at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill, and later as the jumping coach at the New South Wales Institute of Sport.Forrest, Brad. \\"Viktor Saneyev\\".

Life and career The son of a Belgian father and a French mother, Minne studied in Brussels for his secondary school qualification before moving to Paris in 1989. In Paris, Minne studied the dramatic arts, shortly after his career in television began. In 1992, he started working for the French TV programme Matin Bonheur where he worked for five years. Following his departure in 1997, he became both presenter and co-producer of Cercle de minuit on the same channel. For 20 years, his work has constituted an original contribution of major significance in many ways. His demonstrated skill and unparalleled creativity on the field have earned him widespread recognition. His career was marked by a nomination for a 7 d'Or award (equivalent of an Emmy Award in the United States) for Best TV Host in 2000, for his work with Universal Studios. It was the first time in the history of television that a French television presenter was nominated for his work with a major American company. Minne was the French commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest from 1995 to 1997. Having presented Le choix gagnant (1996), Jeux sans fronti√®res (co-hosted with Jean Riffel in 1997) and the final season of Les √âcrans du savoir in 2000, he also has hosted the game show La Cible on France 2.

Geography  = Location = Willebadessen lies on the eastern edge of the Eggegebirge (the southern extension of the Teutoburg Forest) about 25 km southeast of Paderborn, and is crossed by the little river Nethe, which rises in the neighbouring community of Bad Driburg-Neuenheerse, emptying eventually into the Weser near H√∂xter-Godelheim. = Constituent communities = * Altenheerse * Borlinghausen * Eissen * Engar * F√∂lsen * Helmern * Ikenhausen * L√∂wen * Niesen * Peckelsheim * Schweckhausen * Willebadessen * Willegassen  History  = Borlinghausen = Borlinghausen seen from the Eggegebirge Borlinghausen was first mentioned in a document on 8 December 1065 under the name Burchartinchusen in German King, later Emperor, Henry IV's (1050‚Äì1106) time, which was also marked by his \\"Walk to Canossa\\" in 1077. In the aforesaid year, Henry donated to his old teacher, the Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen, a forested lordly estate in the gau of Engern. The document in question laid out the boundaries of the estate in question quite thoroughly, mentioning several local centres, including Burchartinchusen. It is believed that the village's founder was a man named Burchard, since its name would seem to be Old High German for \\"at Burchard's houses\\". Over the centuries, the village has undergone several name changes: Burchartinghusen (1102), Burchardinchuson (1120), Borgardinchusen (1232), Borninghusen (1584), Bornighusen, Borlinghusen, and finally Borlinghausen, locally pronounced \\"Burnechousen\\". Borlinghausen's beginnings were sometime before the first documentary mention, in Saxon times between 500 and 800, at which time it formed the western part of the \\"Mark L√∂wen\\". It was in this time that most places with names ending in ‚Äîhausen came into being. The Mark L√∂wen in turn belonged to the Hessian-Saxon Gau. Giant thousand-year-old oak Emperor Charlemagne conquered the Duchy of Saxony in the years 772 to 804. The Gaue (roughly, regions) that had been in force until then were each placed under a count and were thereafter known as counties (Grafschaften). The Emperor demanded suzerainty over the marches, and the counts' power grew ever greater with their burdens. Charlemagne forced the Saxons, under threat of death, to convert to Christianity and have themselves baptized. For 800 years, Borlinghausen was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn after Count Dodiko of Warburg donated his estate to Bishop Meinwerk of Paderborn about 1000. This only ended with Prussian secularization in 1803. In 1376, a knight from Epe held the Borlinghausen estate as a fief from the Counts of Waldeck. In 1411, after the lordly Spiegel family's Borlinghausen line had died out, the Counts of Waldeck handed the fief to their kin, Gerd von Spiegel zu Peckelsheim, including the village, the castle and the church fief. Wasserschloss Borlinghausen Johann von Spiegel zu Peckelsheim, after his death in 1559, bequeathed his estate to his four sons Georg, Werner, Raban and David. This included Schweckhausen, Borlinghausen, Holtheim and Ikenhausen, as well as farms and other agricultural lands, tithes and other rights in Peckelsheim, Drankhausen, Willegassen, L√∂wen and K√∂rbecke. This bequest was divided among the sons in 1577, and Borlinghausen passed to Werner, who had already taken his father's old position as Hereditary Marshal of the Prince-Bishop of Paderborn. In 1587, Werner ended work on the moat-ringed stately home that was being built in Borlinghausen. He died in 1594 and was succeeded by his son, who had not yet come of age. By 1755, the Hereditary Marshal was Johann Heinrich von Spiegel, who had been in the service of the Duchy of Brunswick, and who in this year founded the local shooting club. He was succeeded in 1789 by his only son Karl Franz Theodor von Spiegel. Under the Treaties of Tilsit on 9 July 1807, Prussia had to cede all its territory west of the Elbe to the French Emperor Napol√©on Bonaparte. Out of this was made, among other entities, the Kingdom of Westphalia, which the Emperor gave his younger brother, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte; Borlinghausen was in this kingdom. The Baron of Spiegel- Borlinghausen became King J√©r√¥me's chamberlain, and his son a captain in his army in 1813. Each community was given a maire, and the Baron was given this post in Borlinghausen, which now belonged to the Canton of Peckelsheim in the District of H√∂xter in the Department of Fulda. After the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig from 16 to 19 October 1813, the French were forced to flee. In 1822, Karl Josef von Spiegel inherited the Borlinghausen Estate and bequeathed it to his only child Marie Louise who wed Franz Karl Freiherr von Elmendorff in 1835. She sold the Borlinghausen Estate four years later to the Protestant banking family Bierbaum from Braunschweig who had lent her 44,000 Thalers seven years earlier so that she could pay her mother and uncle off. This brought an end to the Spiegel overlordship after five centuries. In 1860, Julius Bierbaum sold the Borlinghausen Estate to Oswald Freiherr von Wendt, a former Catholic lieutenant colonel in the Austro-Hungarian Army, who had the Borlinghausen Church of Saint Mary Help of the Christians built. The Baron's coat of arms can still be seen over the entrance ‚Äì three helms. In the First World War, 63 Borlinghausen townsfolk joined the Imperial forces, 22 of them seeing active duty, and 13 of these losing their lives. In the Second World War, 88 Borlinghausen townsfolk joined the Nazi forces, 23 of them losing their lives and 5 going missing in action. In 1965, Borlinghausen celebrated its 900th anniversary of first documentary mention. = Eissen = Between 1001 and 1010 came Eissen's first documentary mention under the name Aieshusun in the Corvey Abbey's donation register. About 1080 a monastery farm was mentioned. Sometime between 1000 and 1100, a stone church consecrated to Saint Liborius was built in Eissen on the initiative of the Bishopric of Paderborn, to which the church was subject. The church became the parish church, with Eissen as the parish. In 1447, Bohemian mercenaries destroyed the village of Sunrike between Eissen and Borgentreich on their retreat from the siege of Soest. In 1632, Eissen, too, along with many other places in the region, was sacked by Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) troops in the Thirty Years' War. In that same war, the Imperial forces along with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and Ottavio Piccolomini moved into winter quarters in the Princely Bishopric of Paderborn, bringing about hunger, illness, pestilence and death to the whole area. Before the war ended, the Warburger Land was once again sacked by Hesse-Kassel troops, and occupied, in 1641-1647. There was also fighting in the area during the Seven Years' War. Furthermore, from 1 December 1758 until Easter 1759, four squadrons of Hessian dragoons were billeted in Eissen and neighbouring places. From autumn 1760 to early summer 1761, 42 people (12% of the population) died from the war's effects. In 1812, two men from Eissen lost their lives in Napol√©on Bonaparte's disastrous Russian campaign after having been impressed into his Grande Arm√©e. Later in the 19th century, one Eissener did not come back from the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and three further men later died, likely from their wounds. On 6 May 1879, a great fire burnt 47 houses down in 20 minutes. The conflagration had been started by a twelve-year-old schoolboy who had been in a goat stall secretly trying a cigar stub that he had found. On 1 October 1876, Eissen was joined to the railway network on the Scherfede-Holzminden line, and was given its own station. In the First World War, 30 Eissen townsfolk lost their lives. In the Second World War, 71 Eissen townsfolk fell. On 1 April 1945, a Wehrmacht infantry company entrenched itself at the southern edge of the village, which drew fire from advancing US troops coming from Hohenwepel. The church and the Kornhaus were thereby heavily damaged and 47 properties were utterly destroyed. The whole of Eissen was damaged, but only two villagers were wounded and none killed. At the end, 14 German and 3 American soldiers had fallen, and 65 Wehrmacht soldiers had become prisoners of war. The rest withdrew along the railway line towards Borgholz. On 2 June 1984, passenger service on this railway line was discontinued, leaving Eissen without rail transport. = L√∂wen = The origin of the name L√∂wen (earlier Lovene) seems to be similar to that of the town of Venlo, namely from Lo or Loh (an old German word for forest) and Venn (marsh or wetland; the word is cognate with the English word fen), describing a boggy wood. This later shifted to L√∂wen ‚Äì German for \\"lions\\" ‚Äì but it seems unlikely that the name has anything to do with the big cats. = Peckelsheim = Peckelsheim had its first documentary mention in Corvey Abbey documents in the 10th century. It was granted town rights on 31 July 1318. The town was burnt down several times by town fires, but always built anew afterwards, even keeping its original town layout today, which can still be seen in the way the streets are arranged Owing to the fires, very few historic buildings are to be found in Peckelsheim.

Formerly, in arms granted in 1908, Mary holding the baby Jesus stood where the Bishop is now. Furthermore, three towers sprouted from the top of the two Gothic doorframes. This coat of arms was based on the town's oldest known seal, from 1318, and the seal itself had been based on one used by the local convent that had founded the town, perhaps explaining its religious theme; Vitus and Mary were the two patron saints. The new arms with the Bishop, and without Mary and the towers, were granted on 17 February 1977. The knobs over the doorways have also been rearranged so that there are now thirteen ‚Äì one for each constituent community.http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/w/willebad.htm  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = Willebadessen lies on highways L828 (Scherfede-Horn Bad Meinberg) and L763 (Kleinenberg-B252). Federal Highway (Bundesstra√üe) B252 also runs right by Peckelsheim and Niesen. Willebadessen also has a railway halt from which trains run two-hourly to Warburg and M√ºnster.

He was a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks when they won the 2001 World Series, and was a member of the Houston Astros when they went to the World Series in 2005. College Springer attended Louisiana State University. Professional career Springer was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 7th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft and signed with the Yankees immediately after the draft in June 1989. On December 6, 1992, Springer was traded by the Yankees with J. T. Snow and Jerry Nielsen to the California Angels for Jim Abbott. On August 15, 1995 he was traded by the Angels with Kevin Flora to the Phillies for Dave Gallagher. In the 1996-97 offseason, he signed with the Houston Astros. In the 1997 MLB expansion draft, Springer was chosen by the Arizona Diamondbacks. On June 23, 1998, he was traded by the Diamondbacks to the Atlanta Braves for Alan Embree. In Atlanta, he picked up the win in game six of the 1999 NLCS, which clinched the pennant for the Braves. After the 1999 season, he signed with the Diamondbacks.

Originally opened in 1893, the station operates as a hub for Intercity services to Dublin and Tralee and commuter services to Mallow, Cobh and Midleton. In 2016, Kent Station was the fifth busiest station in the Republic of Ireland, as well as the busiest outside of Dublin.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/NTA_Rail_Census_Report_2017_FINAL.pdf Background =Name= Bust of Thomas Kent at the station, by sculptor James MacCarthy. The station was originally called Glanmire Road Station, but was renamed after Thomas Kent in 1966 on the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. =History= The station, ca. 1893. The station opened on 2 February 1893 and the current building was built in the same year. The station replaced two earlier stations that served as separate termini for the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;) and Cork & Youghal Railway (C&Y;). The original GS&WR; station, Penrose Quay, was located directly in front of the portal of the tunnel through which the railway into Cork passed, while Cork Summerhill, the original C&Y; terminus was above the tunnel portal. The purpose of the new station was to allow through running of trains after the 1865 takeover of the C&Y; by the GS&WR.; The station is the only one of the six Cork railway stations that still exists today. The station served as a filming location for the 1979 movie The First Great Train Robbery starring Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down. On 24 February 2012, the station briefly shut due to a gas leak. On 18 December 2013, the canopy over platforms 1 and 2 collapsed in high winds; there was damage to one train and one person suffered minor injuries. In February 2014, ‚Ç¨2.8 million was allocated to repair the canopy. =Site improvements= Planning permission was granted by Cork City Council in July 2013 for a new entrance building onto Horgan's Quay and a new bi-directional road linking Railway Street/Alfred Street and Horgan's Quay. The plan also included bus shelters, a car park with 140 spaces and a set-down area accessed from Horgan's Quay for taxis and buses. In February 2014, ‚Ç¨3 million was allocated towards implementing phase one including site works and detailed planning. Work began in summer 2014. In September 2014, Irish Rail submitted a new application for two rather than one entrance building onto the quayside. Planning permission was granted, and Irish Rail put the entrance building project out to tender in early 2015. Construction commenced in summer 2015, and was expected to complete in approximately 12 months. However, works took longer and the entrances were officially opened in November 2017. In parallel, a new road project (for use by buses), commenced in early 2016 with its opening coinciding with the completion of the entrance building contract in November 2017. Bus √âireann now carries passengers from the new entrance to the city centre and beyond. =Engine no. 36= Engine No. 36 An old steam locomotive has been on permanent display at the station since 1950. \\"Engine No. 36\\" dates from 1847 and is on display on a viewing platform in the booking hall. It was restored and moved to its current position by Iarnr√≥d √âireann in 2007. Originally built by Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy of Liverpool at a cost of ¬£1,955, the engine was obtained by the Great Southern and Western Railway to run services from Dublin to Cork. It has a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement, and remained in service until 1874. The engine was displayed at the Cork International Exhibition in 1902, the Railway Centenary Exhibition in 1925, and the bi-centenary of the Royal Dublin Society at Ballsbridge in 1930. Services The station offers direct intercity rail services to Heuston Station and stations in Kerry such as Killarney, Farranfore (for Kerry Airport) and Tralee. Cork Suburban Rail services follow the Cobh and Mallow lines. Since July 2009, a commuter line also operates to Midleton. The station has three terminating platforms, numbered 1 to 3 (in the Cobh direction), and two through platforms, numbered 4 and 5. The only platform not directly accessible from the station concourse, platform 5, is accessed through a subway, unlike most other Irish stations, which use footbridges. Until the mid-1990s, the through platforms were numbered 5 and 6, as there had been a fourth terminating platform adjacent to platform 3; it was removed in 1984. Since December 2005's timetable change, the through platforms tend to get quite congested as commuter trains often come in together, clogging up limited space. Since the reopening of the Cork & Youghal Railway as far as Midleton, increased use has been made of the terminating platforms 1 to 3. There is also a loop line behind platform 5, which used to be used to facilitate moving locomotives from the end of arriving trains to the other end in preparation for departure. This line used to be a double-tracked freight, avoiding the line that enabled goods trains to bypass the passenger station. It is no longer necessary since all services to the station are operated either by railcars or by Mark 4 sets with a driving van trailer. In 2017, the Cork to Dublin reached record usage of 3.15 million passengers, up 6.5% from 2016.

Bruntlett is perhaps best remembered for executing an unassisted triple play, in . Bruntlett won a World Series title with the Philadelphia Phillies, in . That October, he was one of the unexpected heroes of the club's World Championship victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In Game 5, after Pat Burrell doubled, Bruntlett pinch ran for him, with the score tied in the seventh inning; he moved to third, as Shane Victorino grounded out, then scored the winning run, on an RBI-single by Pedro Feliz. Bruntlett also played on the Phillies‚Äô 2009 National League (NL) pennant-winning team, as he had previously done, for the Houston Astros‚Äô NL pennant-winner. In , after becoming a free agent, he spent the season playing for the Minor League Baseball (MiLB) Triple-A affiliates of the Washington Nationals and New York Yankees, respectively. Following the season, Bruntlett retired from active play. Since retiring Bruntlett has turned his attention to dominating amateur golf. In January 2019 he went wire to wire to win the inaugural Figjam tournament, held annually at Bandon Dunes Resort. He followed it up with a victory in the 4th Annual Peter Classic, held in the Truckee, CA area at Old Greenwood, Gray‚Äôs Crossing, Coyote Moon and Edgewood golf courses. He won the tournament with a final four round score of -3 (285). Early life and education Bruntlett was born in Lafayette, Indiana and is a 1996 graduate of William Henry Harrison High School in West Lafayette, Indiana where he was a two-time All-Indiana selection in both baseball and football. He attended Stanford University. During his tenure as a member of the Cardinal, Stanford made three appearances in the College World Series. In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Minor leagues Bruntlett was drafted by the Houston Astros in the 9th Round of the 2000 Amateur Entry Draft. He was assigned to the Martinsville Astros. He quickly progressed through the minor league system and reached the major leagues in 2003 with Houston. Major leagues =Houston Astros= During his first years with the Astros, Bruntlett primarily served as a backup to shortstop Adam Everett but also played second base, third base, and the outfield. His best season was in 2006, hitting .277 in 73 games and posting a .412 batting average as a pinch hitter. On November 7, 2007, Bruntlett was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Brad Lidge for Geoff Geary, Michael Bourn, and Mike Costanzo. =Philadelphia Phillies= 2008 Bruntlett hit .217 with 46 hits, 2 home runs, and 15 RBIs. His biggest mark was left in the post-season. He hit a home run in Game 2 of the World Series followed by a game-winning run in Game 3. Bruntlett would cap off his World Series performance by scoring the series- clinching run in Game 5, allowing the Phillies to win their first World Series since 1980 and second overall. 2009 Bruntlett batting for the Philadelphia Phillies in . Bruntlett performed the fifteenth unassisted triple play of the modern era in the bottom of the ninth inning on August 23, against the New York Mets at Citi Field, when he caught a line drive from Jeff Francoeur, tagged second base to double off Luis Castillo, and tagged Daniel Murphy as he was running to second base. Both Castillo and Murphy had reached base on misplays by Bruntlett.Unassisted triple play seals Phillies' victory Ray Parrillo It was the second game-ending unassisted triple play in Major League Baseball history and the first in the National League, preserving a 9-7 Phillies win. Bruntlett would appear as a fielder in only four additional major league games after this play. Rather than accepting an assignment to Triple-A, Bruntlett was released by the Phillies on November 16. =Final season= 2010 On December 28, 2009, Bruntlett signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. He also received an invitation to Spring Training. He was reassigned at the end of Spring Training to minor league camp. He was released on June 2, 2010.

Historically, there has been a problem of misidentification between Leontius of Byzantium and Leontius of Jerusalem. The first scholar to identify and challenge the ambiguity of the writings that come down to us under the name of \\"Leontius\\" was Friedrich Loofs in 1887, arguing for a single author of the corpus leontianum. That hypothesis influenced scholarship until the publication of Marcel Richard's 1944 article L√©once de J√©rusalem et L√©once de Byzance, which aimed to distinguish two figures among the works which had formerly been attributed to a single person. Since the publication of that article, Richard's conclusions have been accepted by all scholars writing about Leontius. It is therefore Richard who is responsible for establishing the identity of Leontius as an author in his own right. The attribution of various works to one or the other Leontius has been widely accepted. Richard identified Leontius of Jerusalem as the author of Contra Monophysitas and Contra Nestorianos.Both of these works may be found in the Patrologia Graeca under the headings PG 86, 1769-1901 and PG 86, 1399-1768i respectively. To Leontius of Byzantium, on the other hand, he assigned the three books Contra Nestorianos et Eutychianos, the treatise against Severus of Antioch known as Epilysis, the Triginta capita contra Severum, and some other more minor works. The dating of Leontius of Jerusalem's works have recently been questioned by scholars. Richard considered the two Leontii to be contemporaries living during the time of Justinian, and for decades the common opinion of scholars shared this conclusion. Certain more recent scholars, particularly Dirk Krausm√ºller and Carlo Dell'Osso, have broken this consensus and sided towards assigning Leontius of Jerusalem a later date than Leontius of Byzantium. Krausm√ºller has suggested that the original arguments of Loofs were correct in dating the Contra Monophysitas either between the years 568 and 680, or between 580 and 640. Based on more current scholarship and his own conclusions, Krausm√ºller has concluded that Leontius of Jerusalem does not belong to the reign of Justinian, as formerly supposed, but to a later date, as he must have written the Contra Nestorianos in 614 at the earliest. Dell'Osso, judging these arguments favorably, echoes Krausm√ºller's conclusions that Leontius of Jerusalem was a theologian of the seventh century, and based on certain similarities between the writings of this later Leontius and those of Maximus the Confessor (c. 580‚Äì662), assigns them to the same time period.

On 15 July 1974 the coup plotters ousted President Makarios III and replaced him with pro-Enosis (Greek irridentist) nationalist Nikos Sampson as replaced president, only for 2 days. The Sampson regime was described as a puppet state, whose ultimate aim was the annexation of the island by Greece; in the short term, the coupists proclaimed the establishment of the \\"Hellenic Republic of Cyprus\\".Strategic review, Volume 5 (1977), United States Strategic Institute, p. 48.Allcock, John B. Border and territorial disputes (1992), Longman Group, p. 55. The coup was viewed as illegal by the United Nations and violated human rights laws.  Background  The Republic of Cyprus was established in 1960 with the London and Zurich Agreements, and the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots were the two founding communities. However, following constitutional amendments that were proposed by Makarios III and rejected by Turkish Cypriots,Eric Solsten, ed. Cyprus: A Country Study, Library of Congress, Washington, DC, 1991. intercommunal violence erupted throughout the island, the Turkish Cypriot representation in the government ended partially due to forced prevention and partially due to willing withdrawal, and Turkish Cypriots started living in enclaves. Greece had established a national policy of enosis to achieve the island's union with Greece since the 1950s. After 1964, the Greek government tried to control Makarios' policies, and following his unwillingness to obey Athens, attempted to destabilize his government. While the Greek policy shifted to a more cooperative one after 1967, when an extremist military junta took power in Greece, it supported the far-right EOKA-B group against Makarios. Dimitrios Ioannidis, the de facto leader of the junta, believed that Makarios was no longer a true supporter of enosis, and suspected him of being a communist sympathizer. Between 1971 and 1974, five plans were prepared by the Greek government to overthrow Makarios' government.Athanasopulos 2001, p. 152. According to Christopher Hitchens, the CIA had contributed financially to anti-Makarios and anti-communist elements in both Greece and Cyprus.  The coup  The coup was ordered by Dimitrios Ioannidis, the shadow leader of the Greek junta, and Greek officers led the Cypriot National Guard to capture the Presidential Palace in Nicosia. The building was almost entirely burned down. Makarios narrowly escaped death in the attack. He fled the presidential palace from its back door and went to Paphos, where the British managed to retrieve him in the afternoon of 16 July and flew him from Akrotiri to Malta in a Royal Air Force transport plane, and from there to London the next morning. On 19 July, he attended a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York and made a speech, in which he stated that Cyprus was invaded by Greece.UN The Official Record of United Nations Security Council 1780th Meeting (19.07.1974) The newly established regime has been described as an extremist puppet regime of the Greek junta. On 15 July, between 8 am and 9 am, the coup leaders proclaimed their victory on the state channel Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, saying \\"The national guard intervened in order to solve the problematical situation. [...]. Makarios is dead.\\" However, before his flight, Makarios announced that he was alive from a private broadcast in Paphos. The new government heavily censored the press and stopped left-wing newspapers being printed. Only right-wing newspapers Machi, Ethniki and Agon continued publishing, and their style was very propagandistic. Sampson did not openly announce his intention of enosis in the days following the coup, but instead focused on suppressing any support for Makarios and heavy propaganda to vilify his government. In response, Rauf Denkta≈ü, the leader of the Turkish Cypriot Administration, stated that he believed that the events were among Greek Cypriots and called for Turkish Cypriots not to go out, as well as for UNFICYP to take extensive security measures for Turkish Cypriots. The Cypriot National Guard made no attempts to enter the Turkish Cypriot enclaves, but raided Greek and Turkish Cypriot homes alike in mixed villages to confiscate weapons. The Turkish government brought claims that ammunition was being carried to Cyprus by Olympic Air to the attention of UNFICYP. Whether the Turkish Cypriots suffered as a direct result of the coup remains controversial, but Sampson was seen as an untrustworthy figure due to his pro-enosis policies and \\"brutal\\" role against Turkish Cypriots in 1963. Following the coup, the newly established junta started a crackdown on Makarios supporters, resulting in a number of deaths and a \\"significant number\\", according to Frank Hoffmeister, being detained. The number of deaths from the coup remains a disputed issue, as the Republic of Cyprus lists the deaths due to the coup among the missing due to the Turkish invasion. According to Haralambos Athanasopulos, at least 500 Greek Cypriots have been placed on the list of 1617 Greek Cypriot missing people and their deaths blamed on the Turks and Turkish Cypriots. According to Milliyet on 19 July 1974, violent clashes had broken out in Paphos, and even excluding Paphos, the death toll due to Greek Cypriot infighting was about 300 civilians and 30 Greek soldiers, whose bodies were brought to Athens.  Aftermath  In response to the coup, on 20 July 1974 Turkey invaded the island claiming that the action was compliant with the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, taking control of the north and dividing Cyprus along what became known as the Green Line, cutting off about a third of the total territory. Sampson resigned, the military regime that had appointed him collapsed, and Makarios returned. The Turkish Cypriots established an independent government for what they called the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus (TFSC), with Rauf Denkta≈ü as president. In 1983 they would proclaim the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the northern part of the island, which remains a de facto state.A de facto state but not a de jure one; TRNC has been recognised only by itself and by Turkey. Airlines wishing to fly to the TRNC must first land in Turkey and hgen take off again to Northern Cyprus.

Its design drew upon half-tracks imported from France in the 1930s, employing standard components supplied by U.S. truck manufacturers to speed production and reduce costs. The concept was designed, and the pilot models manufactured by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company (before the prototype was officially labeled M2.)Green, p.157 Production by the White Motor Company began in 1940 and was expanded to include Autocar. The M2 was initially intended for use as an artillery tractor, but also found use with reconnaissance units. International Harvester Company built the M9 half-track, a variant of their M5 half track, to fulfill the same purpose. History The half-track design had been evaluated by the US ordnance department using Citro√´n-K√©gresse vehicles. The cavalry branch of the US Army found that their wheeled armored scout cars had trouble in wet terrain due to their high ground pressure. In 1938, the White Motor Company took the Timken rear bogie assembly from a T9 half-track truck and added it to an M3 scout car, creating the T7 half-track car.Zaloga p4 This vehicle was significantly underpowered. When a further requirement came down from US Army artillery units in 1939 for a prime mover to be used as an artillery tractor, a vehicle with an uprated engine was developed, which was designated the half-track scout car T14. By 1940, the vehicle had been standardized as the M2 half-track car. The M2 design was recognized as having the potential for general mechanized infantry use, which spawned the larger bodied M3 half-track. Both the M2 and M3 were ordered into production in late 1940, with M2 contracts let to Autocar, White and Diamond T. The first vehicles were received by the Army in 1941. The M2 was supplied to artillery units as the prime mover and ammunition carrier for the 105mm howitzer, and to armored infantry units for carrying machine gun squads. It was also issued to armored reconnaissance unitsZaloga p4-5 as an interim solution until more specialized vehicles could be fielded. Between 1942 and 1943, both the M2 and M3 would receive a number of modifications to the drive train, engine, and stowage, among other things. Total production of M2 and derivatives by White was about 13,500 units. To meet the needs of Lend-Lease to the Allies, the International Harvester Company produced 3,500 units of the M9. The M9 was the same as the IH-produced M5 but with different internal stowage and apart from using IH mechanical components the M9 was longer than the M2. Use The first M2s were fielded in 1941, and would be used in the Philippines, North Africa, and Europe by the U.S. Army, and around the Pacific by the marines. About 800 M2 and M9 half-tracks were sent to the Soviet Union. Many remaining vehicles initially destined for Lend-Lease were transferred to other U.S. allies, primarily in South America. These vehicles often received a number of upgrades designed at extending service life. Nicaragua's national guard received 10 M2s in 1942, which saw heavy action during the 1978-79 Nicaraguan Revolution. The Argentine Army retired its last upgraded M9 in 2006 and donated them to Bolivia. In 1947, the Finnish heavy vehicle producer Vanajan Autotehdas bought 425 M2 half-track vehicles from the Western Allied surplus stocks located in France and Germany. The vehicles were delivered without armor.Blomberg: Teloilla tai py√∂rill√§. p. 40‚Äì41. Some 359 units were converted into field and forest clearing vehicles, some were scrapped for parts and 60 units were equipped with conventional rear axles and converted into 4√ó4 or 4√ó2 trucks. They were badged as Vanaja VaWh. The last units were sold in 1952.Blomberg: Vihdoinkin kuivilla. p. 49‚Äì50.

The term Plesiadapiformes may still be used for all primates which are not crown primates, but this usage is obviously paraphyletic.

K. Pottekkatt, was an Indian writer of Malayalam literature and a politician from Kerala, India. He was also a great traveller among the Keralites, who wrote many travelogues for the people who have been unintroduced to the outside world. He was the author of nearly sixty books which include ten novels, twenty-four collections of short stories, three anthologies of poems, eighteen travelogues, four plays, a collection of essays and a couple of books based on personal reminiscences. he was a recipient of Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Novel, Sahitya Akademi Award and the Jnanpith Award. His works have been translated into English, Italian, Russian, German and Czech, besides all major Indian languages. Biography A bust of S. K. Pottekkatt facing S. M. Street in Kozhikode (Calicut). S. K. Pottekkatt was born on March 14, 1913, in Calicut (Kozhikode) to Kunjiraman Pottekkat, an English school teacher and his wife, Kittuli. After early schooling at Ganapath School, he matriculated from Zamorin's High School in Calicut in 1929 and passed the intermediate examination from Zamorin's Guruvayurappan College, Calicut in 1934 but could not find a job for three years, a period which he utilised for studying classics from Indian and western literature. In 1937, he joined Calicut Gujarati School as a teacher where he taught for almost three years. He was involved with activities of the Indian National Congress and attended the Tripuri session of 1939 for which he resigned from the job as the school authorities did not allow him to leave of absence. Subsequently, he moved to Bombay and Lucknow where he stayed until 1945, doing many jobs. After returning to Kerala in 1945, he travelled to many parts of India and went on his first overseas tour in 1949 when he visited Africa, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, France and England. In 1952, he again went overseas to visit Ceylon, Malaya, and Indonesia. Pottekkatt married Jayavalli in 1950 and the couple had two sons and two daughters. His wife died in 1980 and two years later, he suffered a paralytic stroke in July 1982, and he died on August 6, 1982, in a private hospital in Calicut.\\"‡¥∏‡¥û‡µç‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥Ø ‡¥é‡¥¥‡µÅ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µÅ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥∞‡¥®‡µç‚Äç!\\". Mathrubhumi. Retrieved 4 March 2019. Literary career and travels Pottekkatt published his first story, Rajaneethi, in the collge magazine of Zamorin's Guruvayurappan College in 1928. Makane Konna Madyam (poem published in Athmavidya Kahalam) and Hindu Muslim Maithri (story published in Deepam) were some of his notable early works. The story \\"Vydyutha Shakthi\\" came in the February 1934 issue of Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly. He wrote his first novel, Naadanpremam, a romantic story set in Mukkam, a small hamlet in Kozhikode district, in 1939 while he was in Bombay and the novel was eventually published in 1941. This was followed by Yavanikakku Pinnil, a short story anthology, and the second novel Vishakanyaka; the latter would receive a prize from the Madras government in 1949. Two travelogues were the next two publications, Kappirikalude Naattil (In the Land of the Negroes) and Innathe Europe (The Europe Today), both based on his first overseas tour. He published Oru Theruvinte Katha in 1960 and his magnum opus, Oru Desathinte Katha, in 1971. Pottekkatt was a writer of strong social commitment and ideals, possessing an individualistic vision. He is reported to be the pioneer of the genre of travelogues in India and its most notable practitioner in Malayalam literature which earned him the moniker, the John Gunther of Malayalam. Poetry anthologies like Sanchariyude Geethangal and Premashilpi, Achan (play), novels like Premashiksha and Moodupadam, short story anthologies such as Nishagandhi, Pulliman and Chandrakatham, travelogues viz. Simhabhoomi, Nile Diary and Pathira Sooryante Nattil as well as memoirs like Ponthakkadukal and Samsarikkunna Diarykurippukal are some of his other major works. His works have been translated into English, Italian, Russian, German and Czech, besides all major Indian languages. An Italian anthology of The Best Short Stories of the World published from Milan in 1971 included his Braanthan Naaya (Mad Dog). A collection of eleven of his short stories in Russian had a sensational sales of one hundred thousand copies in two weeks. His stories have made into feature films in Malayalam; Naadan Premam, Moodupadam, Pulliman and Njavalppazhangal are some of them.  Political career  Pottekkatt on a 2003 India Post stamp Pottekkatt contested twice as independent candidate in elections to Indian Parliament from Thalassery under the banner of the Communist Party of India, the first in 1957 to the 2nd Lok Sabha when he lost to M. K. Jinachandran by 1000 votes and the next in 1962 to the 3rd Lok Sabha when he defeated Sukumar Azhikode by a margin of 66,000 votes; he served out his term until 1967. Awards and honours Oru Theruvinte Katha (The Story of a Street), a novel based on Mittai Theruvu, a popular street in Kozhikode nown for sweetmeat and halvah stalls, received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Novel in 1961. His biographical novel, Oru Desathinte Katha was selected for the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1972. Eight years later, in 1980, the novel earned Pottekkatt the Jnanpith Award, the highest literary jonour in India.Jnanpith Award winners in Malayalam In 1982, the University of Calicut honoured him with the honoris causa degree of the Doctor of Letters. India Post issued a commemorative postal stamp on him in 2003, as a part of their Jnanpith Award Winners.

Breathwork has no proven positive health impact other than promoting relaxation and can cause distress. Description and sub-types Breathwork is a method of breath control that is meant to give rise to altered states of consciousness and to have an effect on physical and mental well-being. Derived from various spiritual and pre-scientific traditions from around the world, it was pioneered in the West by Wilhelm Reich. There are several sub-types of breathwork: * Rebirthing-Breathwork - was devised by Leonard Orr in the 1970s. It is claimed to be capable of releasing suppressed traumatic childhood memories. * Vivation - was created by Jim Leonard and Phil Laut. It claims to improve wellbeing through the use of circular breathing. * Holotropic Breathwork (a trademark) is a practice that uses breathing and other elements to putatively allow access to non-ordinary states of consciousness. It was developed by Stanislav Grof as a successor to his LSD-based psychedelic therapy, following the suppression of legal LSD use in the late 1960s. Following a 1993 report commissioned by the Scottish Charities Office, concerns about the risk that the hyperventilation technique could cause seizure or lead to psychosis in vulnerable people caused the Findhorn Foundation to suspend its breathwork programme.Stephen Castro, Hypocrisy and Dissent within the Findhorn Foundation: Towards a Sociology of a New Age Community (New Media Books, 1996) * Other types - There are many other types of Breathwork which have emerged over the last few decades, including Integrative Breathwork, Transformational Breathwork, Shamanic Breathwork, Conscious Connected Breathing, Radiance Breathwork, Zen Yoga Breathwork and many others. * Other definition - Breathwork (Breath Work, conscious breathing): Multiform \\"healing modality\\" characterized by stylized breathing. Its purported design is to effect physical, emotional, and spiritual change.

It can be thought of as an extension or generalisation of linear programming to handle multiple, normally conflicting objective measures. Each of these measures is given a goal or target value to be achieved. Deviations are measured from these goals both above and below the target. Unwanted deviations from this set of target values are then minimised in an achievement function. This can be a vector or a weighted sum dependent on the goal programming variant used. As satisfaction of the target is deemed to satisfy the decision maker(s), an underlying satisficing philosophy is assumed. Goal programming is used to perform three types of analysis: # Determine the required resources to achieve a desired set of objectives. # Determine the degree of attainment of the goals with the available resources. # Providing the best satisfying solution under a varying amount of resources and priorities of the goals.  History  Goal programming was first used by Charnes, Cooper and Ferguson in 1955,A Charnes, WW Cooper, R Ferguson (1955) Optimal estimation of executive compensation by linear programming, Management Science, 1, 138-151. although the actual name first appeared in a 1961 text by Charnes and Cooper.A Charnes, WW Cooper (1961) Management models and industrial applications of linear programming, Wiley, New York Seminal works by Lee,SM Lee (1972) Goal programming for decision analysis, Auerback, Philadelphia Ignizio,JP Ignizio (1976) Goal programming and extensions, Lexington Books, Lexington, MA.

Schniederjans gives in a bibliography of a large number of pre-1995 articles relating to goal programming,MJ Scniederjans (1995) Goal programming methodology and applications, Kluwer publishers, Boston. and Jones and Tamiz give an annotated bibliography of the period 1990-2000.DF Jones, M Tamiz (2002) Goal programming in the period 1990-2000, in Multiple Criteria Optimization: State of the art annotated bibliographic surveys, M. Ehrgott and X.Gandibleux (Eds.), 129-170. Kluwer A recent textbook by Jones and Tamiz .Jones DF, Tamiz M (2010) Practical Goal Programming, Springer Books. gives a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in goal programming. The first engineering application of goal programming, due to Ignizio in 1962, was the design and placement of the antennas employed on the second stage of the Saturn V. This was used to launch the Apollo space capsule that landed the first men on the moon.  Variants  The initial goal programming formulations ordered the unwanted deviations into a number of priority levels, with the minimisation of a deviation in a higher priority level being infinitely more important than any deviations in lower priority levels. This is known as lexicographic or pre-emptive goal programming. Ignizio gives an algorithm showing how a lexicographic goal programme can be solved as a series of linear programmes. Lexicographic goal programming is used when there exists a clear priority ordering amongst the goals to be achieved. If the decision maker is more interested in direct comparisons of the objectives then weighted or non-pre-emptive goal programming should be used. In this case all the unwanted deviations are multiplied by weights, reflecting their relative importance, and added together as a single sum to form the achievement function. Deviations measured in different units cannot be summed directly due to the phenomenon of incommensurability. Hence each unwanted deviation is multiplied by a normalisation constant to allow direct comparison. Popular choices for normalisation constants are the goal target value of the corresponding objective (hence turning all deviations into percentages) or the range of the corresponding objective (between the best and the worst possible values, hence mapping all deviations onto a zero-one range). For decision makers more interested in obtaining a balance between the competing objectives, Chebyshev goal programming is used. Introduced by Flavell in 1976,RB Flavell (1976) A new goal programming formulation, Omega, 4, 731-732. this variant seeks to minimise the maximum unwanted deviation, rather than the sum of deviations. This utilises the Chebyshev distance metric.  Strengths and weaknesses  A major strength of goal programming is its simplicity and ease of use. This accounts for the large number of goal programming applications in many and diverse fields. Linear goal programmes can be solved using linear programming software as either a single linear programme, or in the case of the lexicographic variant, a series of connected linear programmes. Goal programming can hence handle relatively large numbers of variables, constraints and objectives. A debated weakness is the ability of goal programming to produce solutions that are not Pareto efficient. This violates a fundamental concept of decision theory, that no rational decision maker will knowingly choose a solution that is not Pareto efficient. However, techniques are availableEL Hannan (1980) Non-dominance in goal programming, INFOR, 18, 300-309M Tamiz, SK Mirrazavi, DF Jones (1999) Extensions of Pareto efficiency analysis to integer goal programming, Omega, 27, 179-188. to detect when this occurs and project the solution onto the Pareto efficient solution in an appropriate manner. The setting of appropriate weights in the goal programming model is another area that has caused debate, with some authorsSI Gass (1987) A process for determining priorities and weights for large scale linear goal programmes, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 37, 779-785. suggesting the use of the analytic hierarchy process or interactive methodsBJ White (1996) Developing Products and Their Rhetoric from a Single Hierarchical Model, 1996 Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Society for Technical Communication, 43, 223-224. for this purpose.

Q. Jones, Don Gordon, R. G. Armstrong, Katherine Moffat, and Meshach Taylor. The Beast Within is a very loose adaptation of Edward Levy's 1981 novel of the same name, with the plot centering on a couple's son, who begins exhibiting strange behavior after his 17th birthday. Producer Harvey Bernhard had purchased the rights to Levy's then-unfinished novel based on the title alone, but the resulting screenplay bears little resemblance to the novel as it was still incomplete at the time of production. Principal photography officially began on February 8, 1981, in and around Jackson, Mississippi and concluded on April 10, 1981. It was released theatrically on February 12, 1982; grossing a total of $7.7 million worldwide. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the film's acting, premise while commending its makeup effects. Plot While driving through Mississippi, Caroline and Eli MacCleary get stuck on a deserted road. Eli walks to a service station for help. A creature chained in a cellar breaks free and escapes into the forest. It finds the MacClearys' car and rapes Caroline. Eli and the service station attendant find her lying in the forest. As they drive off, two gunshots are heard. Seventeen years later, their son Michael, conceived as a result of Caroline's rape, has become ill. The family returns to Mississippi looking for information about the man who assaulted Caroline, in case Michael's illness is genetic. They learn about the unsolved murder of a mortician named Lionel Curwin, seventeen years prior. The townspeople, including Judge Curwin and newspaper editor Edwin Curwin, refuse to tell them anything. Eli and Caroline ask Sheriff Bill Poole about Lionel's death. Poole tells them Lionel's corpse was found partially eaten. Seemingly possessed, Michael murders and cannibalizes Edwin Curwin. He stumbles to the home of Amanda Platt and collapses. Amanda calls the police, and Michael is taken to the hospital. Doc Schoonmaker tells Michael's parents that he needs rest. Michael goes to Amanda's house to thank her. They go for a walk in the forest. Amanda tells Michael she is the daughter of Horace Platt, an abusive alcoholic who is Lionel Curwin's cousin. As the teens kiss, Amanda's dog arrives with Edwin's severed arm. They alert the sheriff. Horace arrives and commands Michael to stay away from Amanda. Caroline and Michael return to the hospital, while Eli, Poole, and Schoonmaker search for clues. They uncover a swamp full of human bones with human tooth marks. Schoonmaker thinks one bone belonged to a patient of his who died years ago. The men go to the mortuary and question Dexter Ward, who was Lionel Curwin's apprentice when the woman died. Ward denies that anyone else was buried in her place. After the men leave, Ward calls the judge and demands money in return for silence. He is soon killed by a possessed Michael. At the graveyard, the men discover the woman's coffin is filled with rocks. They return to the mortuary to question Ward but find him dead. Michael, still possessed, finds a man named Tom Laws. Laws converses with the spirit possessing Michael, whom he calls Billy Connors. Assuming direct control of Michael, Connors describes using magic to return as a spirit to punish the Curwin family after his death seventeen years earlier. The next day, the judge tells Poole to investigate the murders. Laws tries to tell Poole that Connors has possessed Michael and is killing people, but Poole dismisses him. Connors kills Laws for talking to Poole. Afraid of his behavior, Michael goes to Amanda and warns her to leave town. While she packs, Connors and Michael struggle to control Michael's body. Michael throws himself from Amanda's window to prevent Connors from killing her. He returns to the hospital and begs to be killed, fearing that Connors will take over and Michael will be unable to stop him. He tells Poole and Eli to go to Lionel Curwin's house and look in the basement. They find a skeleton with a chain wrapped around its leg, which they assume is Connors's remains. At the hospital, Poole, Eli, Caroline, and Schoonmaker witness Michael metamorphoses into a monster as Connors takes control and kills Horace. Everyone flees to the police station. Judge Curwin confesses that Lionel was responsible for Connors's death. After discovering Connors was having an affair with his wife, Lionel killed her and imprisoned Connors in his cellar. He fed Connors corpses stolen from the mortuary until one night, Connors metamorphosed into a monster, broke free, and killed Lionel. He raped Caroline in the woods before being shot by Lionel's relatives, apparently returning to the cellar to die. Connors attacks the police station, kills the judge, and is pursued into the forest. He finds Amanda in a broken-down car and rapes her. When Caroline and Eli find him, he attacks Eli, forcing Caroline to shoot him in the head. It is implied that Connors may have impregnated Amanda, continuing the cycle of his resurrection.

The film itself is very loosely based on the 1981 horror novel of the same name written by Edward Levy. Producer Harvey Bernhard had purchased the rights to Levy's then-unfinished novel based on the title alone. However, when pre-production for the film began, Levy had still not completed the novel due to marital difficulties. As a result, the film's writer Holland was forced to write most of the film's screenplay from scratch, with the final product differing significantly from the novel. Principal photography officially began on February 8, 1981; in and around Jackson, Mississippi. The entire first week of filming was shot at night outdoors. When filming Bibi Besch's rape scene, the actress was required to remain undressed in the cold weather for an extended period of time, and Besch was later rushed to the hospital as a result. Other scenes were shot in Raymond, with hospital scenes filmed at both Jackson Baptist Hospital and the Mississippi State Hospital for the Insane. Filming later concluded on April 10, 1981. Director Mora has stated that United Artists cut several scenes from the film which clarified some of the story's plot details. The film's soundtrack was composed by Les Baxter, who considered it to be one of his finest, in his final feature-length score. In an interview with Tom Weaver, Baxter stated that he later received a letter from the film's producer Bernhard, praising his score for the film. Release The Beast Within was released theatrically in the United States by United Artists on February 12, 1982. It grossed $1,250,000 on its opening weekend with an average of $2,545 making it #10 in box office. The film ended up grossing $7,742,572. =Home media= The film was released on DVD in the United States by MGM Home Entertainment as part of their Midnite Movies line in 2001. This version is currently out of print. It was later released on Blu-ray by Scream Factory on December 17, 2013. Reception The Beast Within received mostly negative reviews upon its release, with many criticizing the film's acting, \\"ridiculous\\" premise, while commending the film's makeup effects. Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave the film a negative review calling it \\"very foolish\\", also criticizing the film's acting. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade C, calling it \\"a frightfully silly and insignificant horror film, whose only virtue is in the makeup.\\" TV Guide panned the film, awarding it a score of 1 / 4 and calling the film's premise \\"outrageous\\"; however, the reviewer stated that the makeup effects used to transform actor Paul Clemens into a monster were effective and that the film's veteran actors lent credibility to the film's weak premise. Patrick Naugle from DVD Verdict gave the film a mixed review stating, \\"The Beast Within won't be to every horror buff's taste. If you're looking for just mindless violence and grizzle and gore, this movie is going to feel like it's a big disappointment. I can't give it a really strong recommendation, but I also can't dismiss it outright. It's got moments that shine and moments that drag. Genre fans may get a kick out of it, for no other reason than seeing a man's head expand to the size of a watermelon\\". Charles Tatum from eFilmCritic.com wrote, \\"It is always sad to see name actors reduced to taking icky gross horror films just to pay a mortgage. Ronny Cox and L.Q. Jones are very good here, and Meshach Taylor looks the same here as he does now, almost twenty years later...hey, that is the creepiest thing about this film\\". Chuck Bowen ofSlant Magazine gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"The Beast Within isn't as bad as its reputation suggests (there's some atmosphere to burn and an impressive gallery of supporting character actors), but it's really only for blossoming cinephiles and horror aficionados looking to finish their essays... Everyone else would be well-advised to mine the sentiment expressed on the film's cover art: Beware.\\" Severed Cinema awarded the film 5/8 stars, stating, \\"Flawed in places by some bad acting and predictable small-town folks, The Beast Within is a tight show with very good production values, and it seriously needs a big release on a good label and not simply double-billed on an MGM DVD\\". HorrorNews.net rated the film a score of 3.5 out of 5, commending the film's atmosphere, acting, and makeup effects, while also noting that the plot made little sense. J.C. Macek III of PopMatters gave the film a mixed 5 out of 10 stars, writing \\"As it stands, The Beast Within is an above-average monster movie with good actors and a sometimes comprehensible plot. All of the answers are there on the screen, even if they are buried. However, horror fan or not, if you‚Äôre watching this three or four times to get every snippet of information from the plot, you‚Äôll probably wonder what better uses of your time you might have employed.\\" Potential remake On August 7, 2014, it was announced that the film's original writer Tom Holland planned to remake the film, feeling that the original film 'never fully captured what he wrote in the script'. As of 2019, no updates regarding the planned remake have occurred.

Chiappone at that time created the civic activist watchdog group called REACT (REsponsible ACTion in Government). As an Independent municipal candidate in 2002 having defeated the Council candidates of his political adversary Bayonne Mayor and Assemblyman of the 31st District Joseph V. Doria, Chiappone was selected by then Jersey City Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham to run on his legislative team in the 31st District. Along with Lou Manzo, Chiappone and Glenn Cunningham defeated Joe Doria's 31st District Democratic team of Joseph V. Doria, L. Harvey Smith and Elba Perez-Cinciarelli in the June 2003 Primary election. Following the death of Glenn Cunningham, Chiappone ran unsuccessfully for Senate against Joseph V. Doria in the Special election to fill the vacancy in November 2004. Chiappone was then defeated in the Democratic Primary in June 2005 by the team of Louis Manzo and Jersey City Superintendent Charles T. Epps, Jr. After once again defeating \\"Team Doria\\" for the non-partisan 2006 Bayonne municipal election for the position of Councilman At-Large, Chiappone aligned himself with the wife of deceased Glenn Cunningham, Sandra Bolden Cunningham, to once again seek state legislative office in the 31st District. Along with running-mate L. Harvey Smith, Chiappone defeated the team of Nicholas Chiaravrolloti and Sheila Moses-Newton for Assembly in the Democratic primary in 2007, thus essentially winning the election as they were running unopposed in the general election.Edge, Wally. \\"Democrats have an 8-1 registration edge in Chiappone's district\\", PolitickerNj, August 26, 2009. Accessed April 25, 2012. Chiappone and Smith were sworn in as Assemblyman in January 2008. Criminal charges and resignation On August 26, 2009, Chiappone and his wife, Diane, were indicted on seven counts, including theft by deception, official misconduct, tampering with public records, falsifying records, conspiracy, and misrepresentation of contributions or expenditures, having allegedly issued over $8,000 in state-issued paychecks to campaign volunteers in 2005, then diverting the money into his personal accounts and his campaign fund, without declaring it on his campaign finance forms.Megerian, Chris. \\"N.J. Assemblyman Anthony Chiappone is charged with campaign finance misconduct\\", The Star-Ledger, August 26, 2009. Accessed April 25, 2012. In spite of the charges against him and calls for his resignation from Governor Jon Corzine and Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts, Chiappone proclaimed his innocence and refused both to resign and to withdraw from his re-election campaign.Friedman, Matt. \\"Chiappone vows innocence as Roberts, Corzine call on him to resign\\", PolitickerNJ, August 26, 2009.

Harvey Smith had been arrested on corruption and money laundering charges one month before Chiappone was charged. Chiappone accepted a plea agreement on June 25, 2010, and subsequently submitted a letter of resignation to Joseph Cryan, Assembly Democratic Leader. Jason O'Donnell, a Democrat in the district, was chosen in July to replace Chiappone and was sworn into the Assembly in September 2010.Clark, Amy Sara. \\"Bayonne Public Safety Director Jason O'Donnell to be sworn in to Assembly replacing Anthony Chiappone\\", The Jersey Journal, September 10, 2010.

(Registration required.) The typical pronunciation of the name is \\"Roadings\\". History The Rodings are believed to be the remnants of a single Anglo-Saxon community known as the Hro√∞ingas, led by Hro√∞a, who sailed up the River Thames and along a tributary in the sixth century and settled in the area. This was one of the tribal areas that were absorbed into the Kingdom of Essex.Andrew Reynolds, Later Anglo-Saxon England (Tempus, 2002, page 67) drawing on S Bassett (ed) The Origin of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms (Leicester, 1989) The River Roding and the villages derived their name from Hro√∞a. The villages are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Rodinges in the Hundred of Dunmow. In the time of Edward the Confessor, it was held by the Abbey of St √Üthelthryth of Ely; however, after the Norman Conquest, part was taken by William de Warenne. Part was also held by the de Veres and de Mandevilles families, who became the Earls of Oxford and Earls of Essex. By the 14th century, the boundaries and names of the villages had become fairly established. Abbess, Beauchamp and Berners Roding now form a single parish in the district of Epping Forest. In the second half of the 19th century The Rodings came part of the Dunmow and Ongar Unions - poor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The parishes were in the rural deaneries of Roding and Ongar, the Archdeaconry of Essex, and the Diocese of St Albans. In 1914 the parishes came under the Diocese of Chelmsford. There were occasionally found Roman remains in the area. Crops grown at the time were chiefly wheat, barley and beans, on a heavy soil with a clay subsoil.Kelly's Directory of Essex 1882 p.245; 1894 p.285; 1902 p.339; 1914 p.477 Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 1,853. Landmarks The area is typified by medieval thatched cottages, timber- framed manor houses and farmhouses. There is a mid-18th century post mill windmill in Aythorpe Roding, the only surviving windmill in the area. There are a number of churches dating from the Norman period; the oldest is St Margaret of Antioch in Margaret Roding, which has a Norman doorway and the tomb of a crusader.

The band is currently based in Oakland, California, and was established in San Diego in 1997. The band has performed in 19 countries.  Members  The group formed in San Diego in 1997, and included Christopher Sprague, Luis Hermosillo, Jimmy LaValle (The Album Leaf), James Lehner, and Stephen Swesey. This line-up recorded all material that was released through 2003, including the albums Spine and Sensory (1999) and Dream Signals in Full Circles (2000). In January 2003, Tristeza played its last concert with Jimmy LaValle as a main member, but he has joined the band occasionally since. During 2004, the band enlisted guitarist Alison Ables and keyboardist Sean Ogilvie to begin writing songs for A Colores (2005). This line-up recorded all material that was released during 2005 and 2006. At the start of 2007, the core of Tristeza (Sprague, Lehner, and Hermosillo) with the assistance of Ogilvie, began collaborating with various musicians around the San Francisco Bay Area, including Camaron Stevens on guitar, and released the Fate Unfolds mini album in 2009.  Production  In 2010, Tristeza recorded their current album Paisajes with Tim Green, who recorded the band's first album. The Spine and Sensory album was recorded at Tim Green's Louder Studios, a basement studio in San Francisco. It took one week to record and mix the album in the Autumn of 1998. Green has since left San Francisco and moved his studio to Grass Valley, California. Dream Signals in Full Circles was recorded and produced in Chicago by Dave Trumfio at Kingsize Soundlabs during the Spring of 2000. The album was recorded and mixed in 10 days. A Colores was recorded during three winter weeks of 2005 at Key Club Recording in Benton Harbor, Michigan by Bill Skibbe and Jessica Ruffins. The album was mixed during the summer of 2005 by Alan Sanderson in San Diego. Paisajes was recorded and mixed Tim Green's Louder Studios in Grass Valley, California in the Winter and Spring of 2010. Tristeza's many other various EPs, singles, tour CDs, demos, DVD, cassettes, etc. were mainly self-recorded by the band, as well by Matt Anderson, Alan Sanderson, Mike Hammel, and Pall Jenkins. Critical reception CMJ New Music Monthly described Tristeza's style in a review of their album, Dream Signals in Full Circles, A typical Tristeza track involves a down-shifted take on emo's rhythmic lopsidedness, beds of washy, behind-the-beat keyboards, and Christopher Sprague's arpeggiated, effect-drenched guitar melodies.

The sixth entry in a seven-film series, the movie features Mickey Rooney, Annette Funicello, Dwayne Hickman, Brian Donlevy, and Beverly Adams. The film features brief, uncredited appearances by Frankie Avalon and includes Buster Keaton in one of his last roles. Synopsis Frankie (Frankie Avalon) goes to Tahiti on Naval Reserve duty. While cavorting with local girls, Frankie realizes that Dee Dee (Annette Funicello) might be disloyal to him. When Frankie seeks help from a witch doctor (Buster Keaton), the witch doctor sends a sea beauty, Cassandra (Beverly Adams), to lure Ricky (Dwayne Hickman), an advertising exec, away from Dee Dee. Upon Cassandra's arrival, the beach turns upside down, as all the surfers fall for her, an executive wants to make her a model, and Eric Von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck) and his motorcycle gang add to the trouble.

Avalon appeared on-screen for about six minutes and interacted only very briefly with Funicello. His small role was attributed to the fact that he was filming another AIP production, 1965's Sergeant Deadhead.Lisanti, Thomas Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959‚Äì1969 McFarland Dwayne Hickman played the male lead, a man trying to woo Funicello's character away from her absent boyfriend. Tommy Kirk was originally announced as the male lead but shortly before filming he was arrested for possession of marijuana, so he was dropped and replaced by Hickman. Mickey Rooney agreed to play a supporting role at $5,000 for one week's work in order to pay off some tax debts. Filming started April 12, 1965, and took 15 days. It was the only film in the series where John Ashley sang lead male vocals. Funicello was pregnant during shooting and was shot mostly wearing blousy tunics or with a prop in front of her (e.g., a bowl of popcorn, a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken). She wrote in her memoirs that her pregnancy and Avalon's absence made this one of her least favorite beach party movies. The film featured the only big screen appearance by The Kingsmen, who performed \\"Give Her Lovin' \\". Elizabeth Montgomery, who at the time was married to the film's director, William Asher, made a cameo appearance in the closing scenes as the witch doctor's daughter, a woman with her own magical powers. Montgomery was instantly recognizable during this period as the star of the hit TV sitcom Bewitched, also directed by Asher, so this small film role was a parody of her TV role. The opening credits were done using clay animation done by Art Clokey, the creator of Gumby. Reception Variety called it a \\"lightweight affair lacking the breeziness and substance of earlier entries.\\" The critic from the Los Angeles Times called the movie a \\"breezy number\\". The New York Times said it was \\"the answer to a moron's prayer.\\" Soundtrack How To Stuff A Wild Bikini, the soundtrack for the film, was released in 1965.

Owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, it is managed with assistance from the Van Cortlandt Park Alliance. The park, the city's third-largest, was named for the Van Cortlandt family, which was prominent in the area during the Dutch and English colonial periods. Van Cortlandt Park's sports facilities include golf courses and several miles of paths for running, as well as facilities for baseball, basketball, cricket, cross-country running, football, horseback riding, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and track and field. The park also contains five major hiking trails and other walking trails. Its natural features include Tibbetts Brook; Van Cortlandt Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Bronx; old-growth forests; and outcrops of Fordham gneiss and Inwood marble. Contained within the park is the Van Cortlandt House Museum, the oldest surviving building in the Bronx, and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course, the oldest public golf course in the country. The land that Van Cortlandt Park now occupies was purchased by Jacobus Van Cortlandt from John Barrett around 1691. His son Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the property, but died before its completion. Later, the land was used during the Revolutionary War when the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers. In 1888, the family property was sold to the City of New York and made into a public parkland. The Van Cortlandt House, which would later be designated as a historic landmark, was converted into a public museum, and new paths were created across the property to make it more passable. In the 1930s, the Robert Moses-directed construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway and Mosholu Parkway fragmented Van Cortlandt Park into its six discontinuous pieces. The last remaining freshwater marsh in New York State, Tibbetts Brook, was dredged and landscaped to accommodate construction, causing large-scale ecological disruption within the park. The 1975 New York City fiscal crisis caused much of the park to fall into disrepair. Gradual improvements began taking place from the late 1980s on including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security. In 2014, the \\"Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan 2034\\" was published, providing a concrete blueprint of the park's proposed redevelopment in the following years.  History  = Settlement and colonization = The forest in what is now Van Cortlandt Park has been around for 17,000 years, since the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. The Wiechquaskeck Lenapes were among the first recorded people to inhabit in the area now referred to as Van Cortlandt Park. They settled in the area around the 14th or 15th centuries. The Lenapes used the geographic features of the area to support their community; for instance, they used the Tibbetts Brook, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, or Hudson River for fishing, and flatland areas for farming. They formed a village named Keskeskick, whose name roughly translates to \\"sharp grass or sedge marsh\\" in the Unami language. The strip of land on the Hudson River's east bank, between the current-day Spuyten Duyvil Creek and Yonkers, was sold to the Dutch West India Company in the early 17th century. Adriaen van der Donck, a Dutch settler, bought the land from the company in 1646. Van der Donck also paid the Indian chief Tacharew, whose tribe used to live on the land, as a friendly gesture. He named the land \\"Colen Donck\\" and built a house upon the land. The house was built between current-day Van Cortlandt Lake and Broadway. It faced south, probably because this was the location of a natural marshland. What is now the parade ground was used by van der Donck for farming. Upon van der Donck's 1655 death, the Indians launched an attack on the colony, now known as the Peach War. This forced the settlers, including van der Donck's widow, to flee to Manhattan. Following the takeover of the New Netherland colony by the British in 1664, the claim to the estate was awarded to Hugh O'Neale, the new husband of van der Donck's widow. Owing to the O'Neales living far away from the land, the claim was awarded to O'Neale's brother-in-law and van der Donck's widow's brother, Elias Doughty, who proceeded to sell off the portions of the property. In 1668, a portion of the land was sold to William Betts, an English turner, and his son-in-law George Tippett, whom Tibbetts Brook would later be named for. This property included the modern park parade grounds. Next, Doughty sold a tract of land, including the current site of the Van Cortlandt House, to Frederick Philipse, Thomas Delavall, and Thomas Lewis. Philipse bought out Delavall's and Lewis's land shares, making the land part of the Philipsburg Manor, which extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the Croton River in modern Westchester County. Philipse's wife died, and he remarried Olof Stevense Van Cortlandt's daughter, herself a widow. Philipse's daughter Eva later married Jacobus Van Cortlandt, who was Mrs. Philipse's brother. alt=One of the park's entrances/exits at the city border The land that Van Cortlandt Park now occupies was acquired by Van Cortlandt from Philipse in the mid-to-late 1690s. In 1699, Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook in order to power a sawmill (and later, a gristmill), creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process. In 1732, Van Cortlandt acquired an additional parcel from the Tippett family. The estate was then passed on to Jacobus's son Frederick Van Cortlandt (1699‚Äì1749) and family in 1739; it was once a vast grain plantation. In 1748, Frederick built the Van Cortlandt House on the former Tippett property, but died before its completion. The Van Cortlandts did not primarily live in that house, instead staying in Manhattan most of the time. A family burial ground was created in 1749, later to be known as \\"Vault Hill.\\" Frederick, who was buried in Vault Hill, had willed the massive home and surrounding lands to his son, James Van Cortlandt (1727‚Äì1787). The Van Cortlandt family land was used during the American Revolution by both the Loyalists and Patriots, owing to James's leadership role early on in the revolution. On May 30, 1775, the New York Provincial Congress placed James on a committee to create a report on whether it was feasible to build a fort near his family's house. British General William Howe made the house his headquarters on November 13, 1776, thus placing it behind British-held ground. The Van Cortlandts wished to stay neutral in the war, however. Later, the grounds were used by Patriot militia leaders Comte de Rochambeau, Marquis de Lafayette, and George Washington. The house itself was Washington's headquarters after his troops were defeated in the 1776 Battle of Long Island. That same year, Augustus Van Cortlandt hid city records under Vault Hill to protect them during the war, turning them over to the new American government after the war. It was in \\"Indian Field,\\" at the present- day intersection of Van Cortlandt Park East and 233rd Street, that the Stockbridge militia was destroyed by the Queen's Rangers, and 38 Indians from the militia were killed in 1778. In 1781, Washington returned to the house to strategize with Rochambeau while their troops waited outside on what is now the Parade Ground and Vault Hill. He later lit campfires outside the house to deceive the British into thinking that his troops were still on the grounds. Washington used the house one final time in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris. The British had just withdrawn their troops from Manhattan, and Washington and George Clinton were getting ready to enter the island, stopping over at the house before doing so. In the 1830s, officials in a rapidly expanding New York City saw a need for a larger water supply. Major David Bates Douglass was appointed to perform engineering studies on the future Old Croton Aqueduct in March 1833. Douglass made estimates for the new aqueduct in 1833‚Äì1834 and John Martineau performed a separate study in 1834. Both found the proposed route, which ran through the present-day park, to be okay. Thus, in 1837, construction started on the Aqueduct, which ran from the Croton River upstate to the New York Public Library Main Branch and Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. The project was built by 3,000‚Äì4,000 laborers who completed the entire aqueduct in five years. The aqueduct's builders constructed a gatehouse. within the present-day park to provide access to the aqueduct's interior. The old aqueduct was supplemented by the New Croton Aqueduct in 1890, which also ran through the park. The Old Croton Aqueduct was in use until 1955, though the part that ran through the park was closed down in 1897 after the new aqueduct was connected to the Jerome Park Reservoir. = Planning = In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted was hired to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted the natural beauty of the Van Cortlandt estate, comparing it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. Around the same time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly pushed for the creation of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. There were objections to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the New Parks Act into law, authorizing the creation of the park system. Legal disputes carried on for years, exacerbated by the fact that Marsh owned land near Van Cortlandt Park in particular. Opponents argued that building a park system would divert funds from more important infrastructure like schools and docks; that everyone in the city, instead of just the property owners near the proposed park, was required to pay taxes to pay for the parks' construction; and that since Marsh was trying to parcel off some of his land to developers, the park's size should be reduced in order to prevent him from profiting off park usage. However, most of this opposition was directed at the construction of Pelham Bay Park, which was then in Westchester. Supporters argued that the parks were for the benefit of all the city's citizens, thus justifying the citywide park tax; that the value of properties near the parks would appreciate greatly over time; that the Commission had only chosen property that could easily be converted into a park; and that Pelham Bay Park would soon be annexed to the city. Ultimately, the parks were established despite the objections of major figures like Mayors William Russell Grace and Abram Hewitt; Comptroller Edward V. Loew; and Assemblymen Henry Bergh and Theodore Roosevelt. Remains of the alt=Remains of the New York and Putnam Railroad's Van Cortlandt Station inside the park In 1880 while the new park was being planned, the New York City & Northern Railroad, later the New York and Putnam Railroad, was built through the center of the park. It had two stops in the Bronx: one inside the park, and another to the south at Kingsbridge. South of Kingsbridge, the railroad merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad. The tracks were used for passenger use until 1958, and were used by freight trains until 1981. A shuttle train was operated by Yonkers Rapid Transit Railway between Kingsbridge and Yonkers. It ran off the main New York and Putnam Railroad line immediately north of the Van Cortlandt station. Service began in March 1888 and ran until 1942 (see ). = Creation = The family property was sold to the City of New York and made into a public parkland in 1888. The majority of the grain fields were converted into a sprawling lawn dubbed the \\"Parade Ground,\\" while the Van Cortlandt House was converted into a public museum. The construction of the Parade Ground required demolition of a few old buildings and cornfields.Index to the Proceedings of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, 1889. The Parade Ground was immediately used by the National Guard for brigade practice, replacing the parade ground of Prospect Park. The ground received unspecified \\"improvements\\" in 1893‚Äì1894. With the city's approval, particularly overgrown areas of the property were made passable. Wide walking paths were built over original walkways, including the thin paths that led to the Van Cortlandt family cemetery, high on the nearby bluffs. \\"Certain lands\\" around the house were then filled in for the purpose of creating a \\"Colonial Garden,\\" which was proposed in 1897. During excavation of the grounds, Indian artifacts and graves were found, corresponding to the old village of Keskeskick. The nine-hole Van Cortlandt Golf Course opened on July 6, 1895, as the country's first and oldest public golf course. The course comprised current holes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14. The first eight holes were easier and less than apart, but the last one had a fairway in length. The ninth hole, which spanned two stone walls and two small brooks, was among the country's hardest holes. Four years after the course opened, the city hired Tom Bendelow, nicknamed the \\"Johnny Appleseed of Golf\\", to expand it to 18 holes. The course added a clubhouse in 1902, which also doubled as an ice- skating house. At first, the park was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was converted to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added fields for polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground, where they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year. The Colonial Garden, designed by landscape architect Samuel Parsons, started construction in 1902 and opened the following June. Besides plants, the garden had rustic wooden bridges and wooden stairs and a \\"handsome fountain and central court.\\" A \\"Shakespeare Garden\\" was also opened that year, with a grand stairway leading down to it. The next year, park officials realized that the Colonial Garden's construction was of poor quality and hard to cultivate. The garden had to be raised , and a nursery needed to be built to transport the plants during the garden's reconstruction. The rustic wooden bridges were to be replaced with stone bridges, while the wooden stairs were to be superseded by stone stairs. Not only did many plants die during the process, but the actual rebuilding was delayed until 1911. Two years later, the Parks Commissioner for the Bronx refused to allocate reconstruction funds because, he stated, the garden looked just fine. Under threat of tearing the garden down, the city had to find money to fill and drain the ground.Mary Haldine to Samuel Parsons, May 11, 1906, Office of Landscape Architect Letters Sent 1902‚Äì1918. Incomplete 5 volumes, Department of Parks. New York City Municipal Archives. The rebuilding contract was awarded in 1909 and completed by 1911. = Early years = Various adjustments were made over succeeding years. A network of roads through the park was built soon after, allowing the construction of picnic areas and hiking trails as well as making the forests more accessible to visitors. A stone memorial was placed at Indian Field in 1906, with a plaque misspelling the name of the Indian chief, Abraham Ninham, as \\"Abraham Nimham.\\" One particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria-borne mosquitoes, which had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners as they believed the wetlands to be \\"unsightly and unsanitary.\\" The marshlands were filled in between 1906 and 1922. The marsh to the southwest of the Van Cortlandt Station was converted to a lake. An \\"outlet sewer\\" under Broadway was built in 1907. From 1903 to 1911, NYC Parks cleaned the Van Cortlandt Lake, removed the original earthen dam, and emptied the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth. A new dam was installed to reform the lake. The former marshland was filled in. During a 1910s excavation for a sewer pipe, stones were unearthed that were suspected to be from the old van der Donck estate. During World War I, the Parade Ground was used to train soldiers. Eight tennis courts opened in 1914 with admission being $1 per person, and owing to the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's immense popularity, the Mosholu Links also opened that year. By 1917, the Parade Ground contained 10 out of the park's baseball diamonds. The park's recreational facilities were quite popular, with more than 10,000 people using them on a busy day.Joseph Hennessy to Mayor Gaynor, May 27, 1912, Departmental Correspondence Received, Parks Department, Papers of William J. Gaynor. 1910‚Äì1913, New York City Municipal Archives. However, during and following World War I, the Parade Ground was used for war training. Until 1926, the baseball fields did not contain backstops, and had to be vacated by July 4 of every year, so the National Guard could use the field.Joseph Hennessy to Mayor Walker, March 19, 1926, Departmental Correspondence Received, Parks Department, 1926. Papers of James J. Walker, New York City Municipal Archives. Van Cortlandt Park, alt=Van Cortlandt Park painting by Oscar Florianus Bluemner, created in 1936 The cross-country running course was inaugurated in 1914. The track started out as a flat path, became hilly, turned onto a \\"little spell of road work,\\" went into the forest, and crossed a water before turning back. A year later, it hosted the Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union's Junior and Senior Cross Country championships.\\"Van Cortlandt Park is Selected for Cross Country Championship,\\" North Side News, November 9, 1915, p. 4 A modified cross-country course opened on November 5, 1921, with runners simply changing direction at the city border. The new course, which started at the original polo fields, did not conflict with either of the golf courses. In 1922, there was a proposal to acquire land for the future Saw Mill River Parkway, which would connect the park to of open space in Westchester when completed. Through the 1930s, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation kept adding new recreational facilities in the park. The Colonial and Shakespeare Gardens had a combined 250,000 flowers by 1931, but both were demolished by the end of the decade due to bad drainage. In 1934, Robert Moses became the New York City Parks Commissioner, and during his 16-year tenure as commissioner, altered almost every aspect of the park. His job partially entailed balancing the needs of area residents, whose numbers had grown in the past decade, with transit users who traveled to the park from the north and south. Moses's development plans in the 1930s called for the construction of the Henry Hudson Parkway and Mosholu Parkway to bisect Van Cortlandt Park and meet at a trumpet interchange about half a mile north of the center, merging into the Saw Mill River Parkway. Due to objections over the construction of roads inside the park, the width of the parkways' lanes was reduced. Tibbetts Brook was dredged and landscaped in 1938 to accommodate construction. Such construction continued until 1955, during which the Major Deegan Expressway (current Interstate 87) was also built, bisecting the Mosholu Parkway. This conflicted with Moses's plans for the park as a \\"rural oasis\\", as highway construction ultimately separated the park into six pieces and demolished most of the remaining marsh in the park. This construction also induced siltation of the brook, leading to further creation of marshes. Moses also made improvements to the park itself, building new walkways, paving dirt roads, creating playgrounds, and installing lights. Baseball, soccer, and cricket fields were added in 1938. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was added in 1939 on the site of a former swamp, and a pool followed in 1970. Moses also landscaped the areas near the Woodlawn and 242nd Street subway stations to attract park visitors from other neighborhoods. During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Moses took aggressive approach to preserving the park's quality. For instance, six mothers were issued court summonses in 1942 after letting their children dig in the park, and two airplane pilots were fined in 1947 for unauthorized airplane landings. Around 1939, the old aqueduct, which was now a popular hiking trail, started becoming a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as a bike path.Box 2639, Parks - 1937-1938-1939-1941, LaGuardia-Personnel Papers, New York City Municipal Archives. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park. = Decline = By the 1960s, large portions of the park, such as Tibbetts Brook, were being polluted by human activity; in addition, the brook now flowed into the Broadway sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake. Pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course, killed fish in the lake. This problem was first noticed in May 1961 when thousands of dead bass, pickerel, catfish, perch, and carp floated up at the edge of the lake. The mass-death of fish was blamed on siltation, Three years later, fish were still being killed by siltation. City investigators took water samples from the lake and found that they contained large amounts of weeds and sediment. About of the lake's surface area was being lost to sedimentation every year. In addition, an algal bloom that caused the lake to be in a low-oxygen condition, endangering plants and animals in and around the lake. \\"Unpleasant odors\\" in the summer also reduced recreational opportunities on the lake, and these conditions combined made it virtually impossible to come into contact with the lake's water without getting sick. By 1976, there was a moratorium on all boating activities on the lake. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course was used as a ski slope during the winters starting in 1961, and up to 3,000 visitors would use the slopes each weekend. By 1964, with the use of artificial snow, it was also possible to ski during warmer days. The seasonal ski slope was closed in the late 1960s when the city decided to allow golfers to use the Van Cortlandt Course during winters. Also in the late 1960s, the city decided to build a series of public pools on the site of the Colonial Garden, consisting of a diving, a swimming, and a wading pool. Construction on the $1.5 million pools started in early 1969 and was completed by 1970. Because of the swampy nature of the ground underneath it, the pools soon began to crackle and set. By 1979, the locker rooms were heavily vandalized and the diving pool had been closed.Rocky terrain in the park The city's fiscal crisis in the 1970s caused the rest of the park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds exacerbated the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests. In 1979, New York City Councilwoman June Eisland released a report on Van Cortlandt Park. The report noted that pollutants from the Major Deegan Expressway were entering Van Cortlandt Lake, and that the park ecosystem was also being harmed by inadequate drainage, soil sterilants that were used on the Putnam Branch tracks, and a fungicide with 8.5% cadmium content that was being sprayed on the golf course. A year later, a private landscaping firm estimated that it would cost $4‚Äì7 million to restore the Van Cortlandt Lake. By this point, the lake was so dirty that a small boat could not float on it, even though the lake was deep. Catfish were the only fish that could survive in the lake water. The city of Yonkers eventually attributed the cause of the Van Cortlandt Lake's pollution to four storm sewers that were found to be illegally connected to Tibbetts Brook upstream. The utter disrepair in the park prompted some informal rules at the park's golf courses. For instance, the Los Angeles Times noted that \\"a player was allowed to drop his ball a club length away if it rolled up against an abandoned auto, or, in one case, a boat. To thwart robbers, besieged golfers quit playing in traditional foursomes and instead ventured forth in football-team-sized units. Some players added an extra club‚Äîa night stick‚Äîor tucked tear gas spray into their golf bags.\\" Years later, one writer recalled that dozens of the course's trees died, and \\"flagsticks were reduced to broken bamboo poles stuck into the ground.\\" Weeds overgrew the course, and golfers would wear long-sleeved shirts to ward off against the city's insufficient mosquito repellents. Homeless squatters moved into the park, while courses fell into disrepair, replaced by dirt tracks and \\"huts and forts\\" built by neighborhood kids. In 1985, the city licensed control of the courses to Los Angeles-based American Golf Corporation for 60 years, leading to their restoration. Other parts of the park also fell into disrepair, such as Vault Hill, whose headstones and crypts were vandalized in the 1960s. As early as 1962, a New York Times reader wrote of vandalism on Vault Hill. A lack of annual maintenance of the park's jogging tracks and bridle paths had caused them to erode and become overgrown at some places. In 1978‚Äì1979, NYC Parks performed a wholesale renovation of the park's eroded and dilapidated bridle paths and jogging tracks. The Parade Ground remained popular, and the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera performed in the field during the summer. However, it too had deteriorated because of intensive use: the grounds' topsoil had eroded away and the sidewalks started to buckle. In 1978, the Perrier Company donated a fitness trail consisting of 12 exercise machines to the park; there were originally supposed to be 18 machines, but the extra six machines were deemed unnecessary. Two shuffleboard courts were also installed in the Parade Grounds the same year, but went unused because of a lack of playing equipment. = Improvements = In response to studies and accounts that showed the bad condition of the lake, the state restored the fish population of the lake in 1978. In 1977, the Bronx Borough Board created a special committee to oversee and develop plans for improving Van Cortlandt Park. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park soon came up with its own suggestions to improve the park. After the parcourse for the parade grounds was approved in 1978, the New York City Department of Parks promised to cooperate on the Van Cortlandt Park improvement plans. The 1979 Eisland plan also detailed suggestions for park improvements. This culminated in the 1980 appointment of a park coordinator who would start devising details of a \\"master plan\\" for the park. In 1985, a study recommended ecological restoration of the lake and forest, which had been overtaken by invasive species introduced during highway construction. Since then, there have been seven plans for restoring natural elements of the park, as well as three plans for park restoration. Gradual improvements began taking place in the late 1980s, including the addition of new pathways, signage, and security, as well as the restoration of playgrounds and other recreational facilities. In January 1988, NYC Parks conducted a study to determine the specific elements of the park that needed restoration. Highway structures were also reconfigured to clean runoff from these structures. An excavation in the 1990s yielded over 2,500 artifacts. The Sachkerah Woods Playground, located at Van Cortlandt Park's southeast corner A new filtration plant costing over $3 billion was built under the park's Mosholu Golf Course and was completed in 2015. The plant, which is bigger than Yankee Stadium, was built after a 1998 lawsuit by the presidential administration of Bill Clinton, which Mayor Rudy Giuliani settled under the condition that the city of New York would build the plant by 2006. The city had been studying possible sites for such a plant for more than 20 years in both the Bronx and Westchester. The plant was needed in order to cut the pollution from the Croton River's watershed, which fed about ten percent of the New York City water system and had been proposed for filtration for the past several decades. One of the plant's other functions would be to reduce the city's dependence on the Catskill Mountains and Delaware River watersheds, which are only minimally filtered. The filtration plant was originally supposed to cost $800 million, but experienced delays and a ballooning cost because of uproars from the local community, which required the city to propose alternate sites for such a plant. To lessen the disruption caused by the plant's construction, in 2010 the city used mitigation funds from the construction of the plant to restore the Parade Ground. The Sachkerah Woods Playground, located at the park's southeast corner near the Mosholu Golf Course, was also built using Croton mitigation funds. The new plant allowed the city to provide greater capacity for its water system. This was especially important since the city was planning to shut off part of an aqueduct from the Delaware River in 2022 or 2023, allowing the completion of a tunnel that would bypass a leaking section of the aqueduct in Newburgh, New York. As part of the \\"Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan 2034\\", critical ecological elements of the park, such as the forest, the rural landscape, and Tibbetts Brook, would be restored, and the brook would be diverted. when the report was written, the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park led to the flooding of recreational areas within the park during heavy rains. The park's paths would also be restored with the addition of three new pedestrian bridges; a playground; four activity centers, of which two would be outdoors and two would be indoors; a skate park; an athletic field; and three basketball courts built within the park. \\"Comfort stations\\" and food concessions would also be added. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course was renovated in 2016. The skate park, new playground, and path improvements were completed in 2020. Geography  At , Van Cortlandt Park is the third-largest park in New York City, behind the Staten Island Greenbelt () and Pelham Bay Park (). It has numerous attractions and features that are both recreational and educational. = Geology = The different parts of Van Cortlandt Park have a varied geology. The Northwest Woods and Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway have a steep terrain dotted with Fordham gneiss, a metamorphic rock that is very hard to weather. The Tibbetts Brook valley is set in Inwood marble, which weathers more easily. The east side of the park near Indian Field contains Yonkers granite, an igneous rock that mixed with Fordham gneiss as a hot magma before later cooling. = Watercourses= Van Cortlandt Park contains the Bronx's largest freshwater lake, the eponymous Van Cortlandt Lake. The lake is deep at various times of year, and has an area of . The lake is used for recreational fishing, as it includes species such as largemouth bass, black crappie, brown bullhead, bluegill, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, common carp, white sucker, and yellow perch. It is fed by Tibbetts Brook, a stream originating in Yonkers, which runs through a series of culverts before draining into the south edge of the lake at approximately West 242nd Street. There are efforts to daylight this south end into the former New York and Putnam Railroad right-of-way that runs through the park as part of the park's faster plan. There is no surviving documentation for the creation of Van Cortlandt Lake. In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a sawmill, creating a mill pond at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a gristmill. The sawmill was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889. The gristmill was destroyed by lightning in 1901. By the time the park was created, Van Cortlandt Lake needed to be cleaned, as cesspools in Yonkers had leaked sewage into Tibbetts Brook, which fed into the lake. A 1903 annual report from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation mentioned that the lake had probably not been cleaned since the mid-18th century, and now contained a layer of \\"refuse and vegetation on top, and an ooze two to three feet deep on the bottom,\\" with qualities more like a \\"semi-bog.\\" Cleaning of the lake started in 1903. The lake's original earthen dam was removed, the lake was emptied, and of deposits were dredged from the lake bed. A new retaining wall was then erected along the lake's eastern shore, and a new dam was installed to reform the lake and to allow future cleaning of the lake without having to dredge it. After the opening of an overflow drain in 1911‚Äì1912, which connected to the sewer under Broadway completed in 1907, Tibbetts Brook was directed into the new sewer, The construction of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course compounded the lake's dirty condition, and by 1912, the lake and brook contained significant sedimentation. Nearby residents also disliked the wetlands near the lake, as they could be used to breed malaria-borne mosquitoes, and were thus seen as \\"unsightly and unsanitary.\\" In 1896, they proposed to fill the wetlands in,\\"Taxpayers Association Meeting\\", New York Advance and Westchester Gazette, December 26, 1896, p. 1 and the infill proposal was funded by the New York City Board of Estimate in 1899. Subsequently, the Parks Department proposed to dredge the swamp and create a lake in its stead,Henry C. Schrader to George B. McClellan, June 25, 1905, Departmental Correspondence Received, Parks Department, 1905, Papers of George B. McClellan, New York City Municipal Archives. but despite this plan receiving $70,000 in funding in 1906, it was deemed \\"not feasible\\" to drain the swamp directly into the Broadway sewer. Another plan to remove the swamps in the park's southwest was approved in 1904. The plan was to build an athletic field in the southwest swamp's place, but all swamp-infill proposals for this sector were rejected in 1917. By 1922, there were of swampland left in the park, and the Parks Department hoped to convert parts of it for some athletic purpose, but this required the New York Central Railroad to raise one of its bridges first so the swampland could be accessed. However, there are no records of that bridge being raised or of the swamp being converted. In its early years, the lake was used for boating, canoeing, curling, and ice skating. By 1899, the lake was used by up to 3,000 skaters on weekdays and 10,000 on weekends. The ice-skating house, shared with the golf course, was added in 1902. By 1935, the lake was used by approximately 20,000 skaters daily.\\"A Perfect Setting for the 'Sport of Kings\\", Bronx Home News, February 7, 1934, p. 1  Wildlife  There are several old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bats, Eastern chipmunks, Eastern gray squirrels, groundhogs, gypsy moths, Eastern cottontail rabbits, striped skunks, North American raccoons, Virginia opossums, white-tailed deer and Eastern coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of butterflies can be found in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss. Its avian population during the winters has exceeded that of either Central or Prospect Parks; a total of 301 bird species have been seen in the park since 1875, when records were first kept. Amphibians present include American bullfrogs, red-backed salamanders, and spring peepers. Also present in and around the park's waterways and wetlands are common snapping turtles and Eastern painted turtles, as well as red-eared sliders that were introduced to the region.  Landmarks and structures  = Trails = There are five major hiking trails in the park. The Putnam Trail (, easy), an unpaved trail, runs north through the woods to the east of this lawn and west of Van Cortlandt Lake, through the golf course and along Tibbetts Brook and the former New York and Putnam Railroad line into Yonkers, where it connects to Westchester County's paved South County Trailway. The rails themselves are overrun with weeds, but they are no longer usable by trains. The remains of the former Van Cortlandt Park station can be seen along the trail. As part of the park's 2034 master plan, NYC Parks undertook a project to pave the entirety of the trail through Van Cortlandt Park as well as a short extension to the south, making it usable for both pedestrians and bicyclists. A construction contract for the paving project was awarded in October 2018 to Grace Industries, and the completion date for this project is August 2020. The Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway (, easy/moderate), was created in 1968 when the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had bought a stretch of the Old Croton Aqueduct, for use as a walking trail. It starts in Van Cortlandt Park as a grass-and-dirt trail and runs north along the route of the old aqueduct. The trail features vestiges of an old, disused brick tunnel that brought water to Manhattan, as well as a gatehouse for the aqueduct. Within the park, the Old Croton Aqueduct trail borders Mosholu Golf Center and Driving Range, as well as the Allen Shandler Recreation Area. Its southern end is cut off by the Major Deegan Expressway in the southwestern end of the park. As part of the Croton Water Filtration Plant project, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was given $200 million to mitigate the effects of constructing the plant. A feasibility study in 2009 found that a bridge near the location of 233rd Street was the most feasible, and would connect the two sections of the trail.See: * * This bridge was deferred over lack of funding in 2014 before planning resumed in 2015. construction of Grand Central Terminalupright=1.1alt=Blocks of stone used for structural stone testingleft The John Kieran Nature Trail (, easy), which connects to the Putnam Trail, opened in 1987 and is named after local writer and naturalist John Kieran. The path features 13 stone pillars, each made of a different variety of stone, that were tested for the facade of Grand Central Terminal during the terminal's construction. The variety eventually chosen was Indiana limestone because it was cheap. The trail hugs the edge of the Van Cortlandt Lake and Tibbetts Brook marsh. The John Muir Trail (, moderate) is the park's only east‚Äìwest trail that connects the three northern forested areas. It was established in 1997. Various species of trees and flowering plants can be seen along the trail, such as northern red oak, sweetgum, and tulips. There is a large, steep hill in the center of the trail. The Cass Gallagher Nature Trail (, moderate/difficult) is the hardest trail in the park. It was given its current name in 1984, named after a local resident who was a fervent advocate of preserving the park's environment. Shaped as a loop, it extends through the rocky forests of the park's northwestern portion. It was once a \\"self-guided interpretive nature trail\\" where hikers could observe natural elements along the trail. Along this trail, there is a \\"thick undergrowth\\" beneath a \\"canopy\\" of deciduous trees that date back centuries. However, logging and forest fires have killed some of these trees. Pioneer species, which inhabit the plots of the forest destroyed by logging and fire, include sumac and black locusts. There is also an outcropping of Fordham gneiss, the last vestige of a giant mountain chain that used to run through this area until the Wisconsin glaciation. The exposed rocks also contain mica and quartz. There have been many sightings of bird species along this trail, such as those of woodpeckers, owls, and pheasants. This trail repeatedly crosses a cross-country trail. A bikeway runs east from the golf course's clubhouse to connect to the Mosholu Parkway bike path. Some trail sections are a part of the East Coast Greenway, a trail system connecting Maine to Florida. = Landmarks = Van Cortlandt House, now a museum The historic house located in the southern part of Van Cortlandt Park was erected by Frederick Van Cortlandt in 1748. This house still stands, making it the oldest surviving building in the Bronx. The estate the house sits on was of major importance during the American Revolution. Troops from both the British and Colonial American armies rested in this house during the time of war. The Van Cortlandt family owned the property until they decided to sell both the house and land to the City of New York in 1886. Ten years later, the house was restored as a museum displaying the culture and lifestyle of 18th-century families. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1967 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1976.Van Courland House National Park ServiceNational Historic Landmark Survey, New York , retrieved June 3, 2007. Near the museum is a 15-mile marker for the old Albany Post Road, which was relocated to its current position in 1934 after the road was rerouted. In 1938, officials at San Francisco's Golden Gate International Exposition gave a walnut tree to the City of New York, who then planted the tree outside the museum in the place of another tree that had died. Vault Hill, the family burial ground, still exists. Located above sea level, it is northeast of the Parade Ground and west of Tibbetts Brook and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course. The Memorial Grove honors Bronxites who served in World War II and the Korean War. It is located by the road to the Van Cortlandt House, close to Broadway.\\"Memorial Grove Tablets (21)\\", 'items BM, BN, file 1501, Municipal Art Commission. Created in 1949, the grove contained a tree and a bronze plaque for each of the 39 soldiers who were memorialized. By the time the grove was renovated in 2011, there were only 18 plaques left. Restoration was completed in 2012. =Other structures= Van Cortlandt Park contains Citywide Nursery, one of three greenhouses operated by NYC Parks. It grows about 200,000 plants each year.  Recreation  The Parade Ground is north of the museum, in the western part of the park. When the park was originally built, there was a law dictating that the Parade Ground should be vacated for National Guard use if required. The field was originally used by the National Guard for brigade practice, but this use was decommissioned by the 1930s, and the land near Broadway was converted to 17 multipurpose baseball, football or soccer fields and two additional fields solely for cricket.History of Sports - Bronx, Box 3574 WPA Records Survey, New York City Municipal Archives. Today, it contains 10 of the borough's 19 total cricket fields and a Gaelic football field. The cricket fields were renovated from 2010 to 2013 for $13 million. During the renovation, the fields were relocated such that they did not overlap with each other or with the soccer and baseball fields. The Parade Ground also has other areas dedicated to various sports, including six baseball fields, four football fields, five soccer fields, and a course for cross-country running. The Rolling Stones commenced their Licks Tour here in 2002, getting into a blimp from the Parade Ground. The park is home to a free public pool, along with numerous playgrounds for children and areas dedicated for barbecuing. The pool was added in 1970, though proposals for such a pool date back to 1907. It was designed by Heery & Heery architects and cost $1.6 million. The pool contains a wading pool, a diving pool, and a Olympic-sized pool. The Van Cortlandt Stadium was built by Parks Commissioner Moses and Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia during the Great Depression, and was funded by Works Progress Administration. It is located north of Van Cortlandt Park South near Broadway in the park's southwest corner.WPA-Division of Operations, Project Folders OP 665-97-2-438 WP-18 Parks Bronx, microfilm reel 8431, National Archives The stadium opened on September 22, 1939, to a day of track events and a football game between Manhattan College and Fordham University. It had 18 tennis courts, five basketball courts, six handball courts, three baseball fields, three football fields (including one in the stadium itself), three horseshoe pitching fields, a running track, and a bowling green, as well as water fountains and lockers. In 1994, Mayor Giuliani funded a $415,000 project for concrete repairs to the stadium, and in 1998, the running track was rebuilt for nearly a million dollars. The park is the former home of the Manhattan College Jaspers college baseball team; in the 2015 season, the Jaspers moved to Dutchess Stadium. upright=1.1 Riverdale Stables, located on of the park, offers horseback riding. In 1934, there were two stables: a larger one east of the Putnam Division near Van Cortlandt Avenue and 242nd Street, and a smaller one to the Van Cortlandt Course clubhouse's east. The Indian Field has baseball and softball fields, a sandbox, picnic tables, tennis courts, horseshoes courts, and shuffleboard courts. The Allen Shandler Recreation Area, renamed from the Holly Park Recreation Area in 1966 after a neighborhood boy who was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the 1960s and died at age 15, has baseball fields, benches, picnic tables, barbecue grills, and a comfort station. Other activities available at the park include basketball, ice skating, and fishing. = Golf = The lake and golf course at sunset; the former alt=View of the lake and golf course The Van Cortlandt Golf Course, which opened on July 6, 1895, with nine holes, is located centrally on the park grounds. Within a year, the course became very crowded and disorganized, with crowds behaving poorly. Rules were set in 1896, with golfers paying caddies 15 cents per round or 25 cents per two rounds. Only caddies with badges could be hired, and bicycles, baby strollers, horse-riding, and horse- drawn carriages were banned from the course. The course was upgraded to 18 holes in 1899, and the grounds gained a new clubhouse by 1902. The new Van Cortlandt Golf Course was supposed to be \\"experimental,\\" and if the course was successful, similar courses would be laid around the country. Other American cities were interested in building such courses. The 1899 Bendelow reconstruction had rebuilt the course so that it now spanned , compared to the of the previous course. The new course was now long, or about . NYC Parks reconfigured the course again the following year so that \\"congestion would be prevented and accidents avoided.\\" Boulders were relocated, greens were enlarged, and hazards were built in order to space out the holes. A clubhouse was added two years later. Plans to extend the clubhouse were rejected in 1917. On July 13, 1905, Isaac Mackie won an Open Tournament at the Van Cortlandt Park course, shooting 152 and holding off joint second-place finishers Willie Anderson and Bernard Nicholls who finished at 157. It was the first ever professional tournament held on a public golf course in the United States. In 1914, a second golf course, the Mosholu Golf Course, opened adjacent to the existing Van Cortlandt Park course. It is located at the southeast end of the park. By the 1930s, both courses were being intensively used, with restaurants located near both clubhouses. Around this time, six holes of the Van Cortlandt course were rebuilt as part of the Henry Hudson Parkway's construction. Due to the Major Deegan Expressway's construction in 1949, there were plans to fill in of the nearby marshlands so new holes could be built. A third of the way into the filling-in project, conservationists and residents called for the rest of the marsh to be preserved. Two greens were eventually placed on the filled-in marshland. In 2002, a First Tee course, for young golfers, opened at the Mosholu course. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course and its attached clubhouse were renovated from 2007 to 2014 for $5 million. Prior to the renovation, there was poor management, dirty grounds, and \\"a proliferation of prostitutes and drug dealers operating much too close for comfort plagued the grounds.\\" The renovation overhauled the course with such improvements as seven new greens and a new drainage system. The clubhouse received an infusion of historic golf artifacts from NYC Parks, including \\"vintage photographs\\" and an exhibit about the history of the golf ball. = Running = Van Cortlandt Park is a popular site for cross-country running, owing to its miles of cinder trails and hills as well as its steep terrain. One legend has it that a cross-country coach thought that Van Cortlandt Park's tracks were too hard and instead went to the New Jersey Meadowlands to train. Its courses are some of the most utilized cross-country courses in the United States. alt=View of the Parade Ground Around the Parade Ground, known to runners as \\"the flats,\\" there is a track that circles for . Another rubber trail and the cross-country trail supplement each other between 241st Street and the city border. Runners on the cross-country course typically run . They start at the Parade Ground and passing through \\"the cowpath,\\" \\"the runners' bridge,\\" Cemetery Hill, and \\"the back hills,\\" using the back hills to turn back at the city border. This trail, built in 1913 out of parts of existing trails, was renovated in 1997 for $2 million, receiving a new layer of asphalt and stone to cover a tangle of \\"muddy ruts and jutting roots and rocks\\" that were breaking runners' ankles. However, by 2013, the trail was starting to show signs of deterioration. The park is used for the Northeast regional championships of the Foot Locker Cross-Country Championships. The cross- country trail is used for the Manhattan College Invitational, one of the largest high school cross-country meets in the nation. In 2006, the USA Cross- Country Championships were held at Van Cortlandt and organized by USATF and New York Road Runners. The tracks are used not only by local high schools, but also for many college races. It is the home course for Fordham University; Iona College; New York University; and Manhattan College, located across the street. The college course is long, crossing the Henry Hudson Parkway at one point. This course was renovated in 1997 for almost $1 million. The 1968 and 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship was hosted by Manhattan College at the park. The events were attended by about 10,000 people, and the championship race was long. In addition, Van Cortlandt is the venue for the annual IC4A or Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America (ICAAAA) cross country championships. =City's only Canadian football game= On December 11, 1909, the Hamilton Tigers and the Ottawa Rough Riders (later of the Canadian Football League), played an exhibition game at Van Cortlandt Park. Sponsored by the New York Herald, the game garnered between 5,000 and 30,000 spectators as Hamilton defeated Ottawa, 11-6. The Canadian Football League's influence in the U.S. did not change after the match, and no subsequent exhibition games were played in the city. However, it was notable for being the first elite Canadian football game to be played in the U.S.  Management  Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park. The earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks. Though NYC Parks owns and operates the park, until 2019 maintenance was handled by two separate nonprofit organizations. Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization founded in 2009, managed educational and cultural programs, and maintains the recreational areas. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, an independent nonprofit established in 1978, provided educational programs and assists in the upkeep of the park's natural areas. However, the two organizations have not had the same amount of funding as similar private organizations who manage parks in wealthier areas of the city. In 2013, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park only raised $416,612‚Äîas opposed to the Central Park Conservancy, which in 2016 had an $81 million endowment to maintain Central Park, or the Four Freedoms Parks Conservancy, which raised $8 million in 2011 alone for the construction of the Four Freedoms Park. In 2019, it was announced that the two organizations would merge that June. The combined organization, the Van Cortlandt Park Alliance, would continue the programming and activities offered by the two organizations.  Transportation  = Roads = Early in the park's history, there were calls for a direct route between Woodlawn and Riverdale. By 1893, with property owners in Woodlawn were calling for such a route. A preliminary plan for the road was submitted to NYC Parks in 1894. The Woodland Path, built in the late 1890s, was linked in 1902 to a new path on the Van Cortlandt Golf Course's eastern perimeter that stretched east to Jerome Avenue. Another road was built in 1902, extending north from West Gun Hill Road to the city line on the park's north side (later Mosholu Avenue; now Mosholu Parkway). It was completed and planted with trees in 1905. A third, road linked Jerome Avenue and East 237th Street to give Woodlawn residents direct access to Jerome Avenue Line streetcars. There were also preparations for a fourth road, which would run north from Mosholu Avenue and then fork into two roads before entering Yonkers. This fourth road, a \\"driveway\\" called Rockwood Drive that ran from Mosholu Avenue to the city line at Yonkers, was completed in 1903. An additional spur from Rockwood Drive diverged from the intersection with Mosholu Avenue, terminating at the train station. A pedestrian passage from Jerome Avenue to Gun Hill Road, opened in 1905, also allowed more direct access into the park from Jerome Avenue. These roads allowed park visitors to access more of the park via automobile, but also had the effect of separating existing amenities, such as the golf course and Parade Ground, from each other. By 1906, increased automotive traffic necessitated the widening of Grand Avenue, which adjoined the golf course. A year later in 1907, NYC Parks wanted permission to build a road from the Yonkers shuttle's Caryl Station to Broadway in order to alleviate traffic there.Proposed Improvements For the Year 1907, For Which Bonds Should Be Issued, Departmental Correspondence Received, Parks Department 1907, Papers of George B. McClellan, New York City Municipal Archives. In addition, Rockwood Drive, needed to be rebuilt. There was also a third proposal to pave a trail along the Old Croton aqueduct, which had already received a coating of fill from the Jerome Park Reservoir five years beforehand. The New York City Board of Estimate received a proposal to connect Manhattan's Riverside Drive to the park in 1909, providing a direct route to the Upper West Side along what is now the Henry Hudson Parkway.\\"For New Auto Highway\\", Bronx Home News, September 30, 1909, p. 1 No new roads were built until 1929. In the NYC Parks annual report for 1912, it was noted that the park's roads \\"stood the strain well,\\" but that constant maintenance was needed to keep the roads in good shape. In 1929, Bronx Borough President Harry Bruckner put forth plans for the Grand Concourse to be extended through the park as part of a proposed parkway system. The extension would go under Van Cortlandt Avenue, Jerome Avenue, and Gun Hill Road, going around Mosholu Avenue before taking the route of the Old Croton Aqueduct until it reached East 233rd Street. It would then turn northwest along Mosholu Avenue, crossing Tibbetts Brook and the Putnam Division before ending at the Saw Mill River Parkway. There was pushback from the New York Park Association, the Regional Plan of New York, environmentalists, city planners, and other figures such as former senator Nathan Straus, Jr.. These parties' opinions on the proposed extension ranged from rerouting it elsewhere to canceling it completely.\\"Former Senator Straus Terms Extension of Concourse Through Park 'Ill-Considered'\\", Bronx Home News, March 17, 1929, p. 4\\"Civic and Art Bodies Protest Use of Park Land for Concourse Extension\\", Bronx Home News, March 20, 1929, p. 1 The New York State Legislature passed a law that would allow the Grand Concourse to be extended through the park.\\"Bill Providing Use of Park Land in Plan To Extend Concourse South Wins Official Favor,\\" Bronx Home News, March 8, 1929, p. 1 Following this, there were calls for Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to veto the bill. Roosevelt vetoed the bill on April 17, 1929.\\"Governor Kills Measure for Extension of Concourse Through Van Cortlandt Park\\", Bronx Home News, April 17, 1929, p. 1 However, there were some influential supporters of the bill, including the Bronx Board of Trade and the Bronx Chamber of Commerce.\\"Governor Kills Measure\\", Bronx Home News, April 17, 1929, p. 1 In 1931 they managed to get the extension built, albeit with a reduction in width from .Thomas J. Donlan to John P. O'Brien, January 16, 1933, Departmental Correspondence Received, Parks, Bronx, Papers of John P. O'Brien, New York City Municipal Archives. By 1934, there was a large system of interconnected bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, Grand, and Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path. The interchange of Henry Hudson, Saw Mill, and Mosholu Parkways in the park Highway construction in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner.\\"New Bronx and Westchester Traffic Link\\", Bronx Home News, January 22, 1934, p. 1. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned as an extension of Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an improvement. Work on the parkway began in 1935.\\"Work on Saw Mill River Parkway Bridge Extension Over Broadway to Begin Monday,\\" Bronx Home News, March 30, 1935, p. 1 Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue within the park was being modified so that it would be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery. World War II halted all highway construction. By the time the war ended, Moses had become a Construction Coordinator for the city, and in 1947, proposed the Major Deegan Expressway through the park. Since community leaders had some objections to the proposal, Moses held a public hearing to discuss it. Opponents of the plan stated that the expressway would carry heavy truck traffic, as opposed to the existing parkways, where trucks were banned. In response, Moses promised to place landscaping on the new expressway so it would fit with the park's character. This revised plan garnered the support of three prominent Bronx politicians. The expressway itself was widely endorsed, but there were five proposed routings for the highway through Van Cortlandt Park, most of which called for using the old Putnam railroad's right-of-way. The city ultimately selected Moses's plan in 1947. The link was projected to cost $30 million at the time (). Environmentalists protested the plan after finding out that this construction would demolish of the marsh. Eventually, all except were preserved, with the remaining 7 acres set aside for the Van Cortlandt golf course (see ). The Major Deegan Expressway was finally opened through the park in 1955. The new expressway ran along the rights-of-way of Grand Avenue and Mosholu Avenue, causing these two roads to be demapped. Since then, there has not been much alteration to the park's roads. , there are five pedestrian crossings over the Major Deegan Expressway, mostly in the northern section. A sixth bridge near 233rd Street was proposed in a 2009 feasibility study, However, in 2014, plans to build the $7.5 million pedestrian bridge were deferred due to a lack of money. The next year, the city announced its intent to begin building the bridge at a cost of $12 million. =Former railroads= The abandoned Putnam Railroad bridge over the Henry Hudson Parkway The New York City & Northern Railroad (later the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad) was built in 1880, effectively separating the park site into two parts. Its two stops in the Bronx were in the park itself, and at Kingsbridge to the south; after Kingsbridge, the railroad merged with the present-day Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad. The line had two tracks between the Hudson Line junction and the Van Cortlandt station, north of which the tracks merged into one. The company foreclosed in 1887, and the line went under the control of the New York and Northern Railroad Company. Beginning in 1888, another railroad, a shuttle service operated by Yonkers Rapid Transit Railway, was built to connect Kingsbridge and Yonkers. It ran off the main New York and Putnam Railroad line immediately north of the Van Cortlandt station. There was an additional stop called Mosholu located in the northwest quadrant of the park site at Mosholu Avenue (now Mosholu Parkway). The Mosholu stop was designated as a request stop, wherein trains only stopped upon a passenger's request. A railroad crossing next to the Putnam Division's Van Cortlandt Station was replaced with an underground pedestrian passageway in 1904 to allow safe pedestrian travel in the park. By 1942, the railroad was already seeing signs of decreased ridership: there were 600 daily riders on the Yonkers branch, down from 2,000 daily riders sixteen years prior. The Interstate Commerce Commission gave New York Central Railroad permission to abandon the branch on November 12, 1942. Subsequently, riders filed a lawsuit to keep the line open, and the federal lawsuit was heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, who ruled in favor of the railroad on June 21, 1943. Nine days later, the railroad abandoned the line. By December 1944, the rails were being removed. The main line also saw fewer riders as the years passed, and on March B, 1958, with daily ridership numbering between 400 and 500 commuters, the New York State Public Service Commission gave its approval for the railroad to stop passenger service on the line. The last day of service was June 1, 1958, and the station was abandoned, the line now only being used for freight. Conrail continued to operate the line for freight use, though by 1979 trains only ran twice a day, and hikers often utilized the underused train tracks. = Modern mass transit = Van Cortlandt Park‚Äì242nd Street station There are two nearby New York City Subway stations. The eastern side of the park is served by Woodlawn (), and the western side by 242nd Street (). The 242nd Street station was part of the first subway line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, running along the current IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line to City Hall and later South Ferry. The station, serving as the line's northern terminal, opened in 1908. The Woodlawn station was built later as part of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line, opening in April 1918 as the line's northern terminus. Bus service is provided by New York City Bus's Bx9, Bx10, Bx16, and Bx34 local routes and its BxM3 and BxM4 express routes. Bee-Line Bus System's 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, and 21 routes also provide service to Westchester.  In popular culture  Van Cortlandt Park appears in the Nero Wolfe detective stories by Rex Stout. It is where the bodies of several murder victims are found - Joan Wellman in Murder by the Book (1951) and Simon Jacobs in Plot It Yourself (1959). The park is also where the climactic scene of the 1944 novella Booby Trap takes place. The guilty Congressman Shattuck kills himself with a hand grenade after Nero Wolfe convinces him there is no chance of escaping justice. In Sol Yurick's 1965 novel The Warriors, the meeting between New York street gangs called by Ismael Rivera, leader of the Delancey Thrones, takes place in Van Cortlandt Park. In the 1979 film adaptation of Yurick's novel, one of the gangs is called \\"The Van Cortlandt Rangers.\\" The park is also the place of many happy memories of Horse Badorties, protagonist of William Kotzwinkle's 1974 book The Fan Man. In Philip Kaufman's 1979 film The Wanderers, a football game between The Wanderers and rivals the Del Bombers occurs at Van Cortlandt Park. However, none of the scenes were filmed in the Bronx. Van Cortlandt Park was referenced in Jos√© Rivera's play Marisol as a place where neo-Nazis burn homeless people alive in the apocalyptic world of the play.

It is a cowboy song, with the singer filling the role of an Old West wagon driver, spurring on his team of mules pulling a delivery wagon. As he goes about his work, the driver mentions the various mail-order goods he is delivering to far-flung customers. \\"Mule Train\\" was originally recorded by Ellis \\"Buz\\" Butler Jr. in 1947. Butler was the original writer of the song along with Fred Glickman. The original recording was released by Buz Butler on Decca Records. The song was featured in the 1950 Republic Western Singing Guns (where it was sung by Vaughn Monroe) and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1950, but lost out to \\"Mona Lisa\\". Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Charting versions Charting versions were recorded by Frankie Laine, Bing Crosby, Tennessee Ernie Ford, and Vaughn Monroe. Frankie Laine and the Muleskinners' version was recorded on October 2, 1949, and released by Mercury Records as catalog number 5345. This version first reached the Billboard chart on November 4, 1949 and lasted 13 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1. Laine's recording of the song was produced by Mitch Miller. It featured a bellowed vocal delivery (like that of a real driver shouting to be heard) and studio-created gimmicks such as whipcracking sound effects. It is often cited as an outstanding early example of studio production techniques. The Bing Crosby version was recorded on October 26, 1949, and released by Decca Records as catalog number 24798.

Harrison Ford also appears (in his uncredited film debut) as a bellhop. Plot Con man Eli Kotch (James Coburn) charms his way into a parole by playing on the emotions of a pretty psychologist (Marian McCargo), but drops her at the first opportunity to move around the country, romancing women and then stealing their possessions, or those of their employers. He's made a down payment on the blueprints to a bank at Los Angeles International Airport, but needs to raise $85,000 to complete the purchase. In Boston, he seduces and marries Inger Knudsen (Camilla Sparv), the secretary of a wealthy elderly woman. Eli sends her to L.A. to set up housekeeping, on the pretext that a songwriter there is interested in his poetry. Meanwhile, he burgles another woman (Rose Marie) to get the final amount of money he needs. Eli heads to L.A., where he begins to assemble his gang (Severn Darden, Aldo Ray and Michael Strong) for the bank robbery, which is timed to take place while the airport is distracted by the arrival of the Premier of the Soviet Union. To keep her occupied, Eli sends Inger to take Polaroid snapshots around L.A., supposedly for a magazine article he is writing. Using costumes stolen from a movie studio, he and one of the gang masquerade as an Australian policeman escorting an extradited prisoner in order to get through airport security, while the other two dress as LAPD policemen to get into the bank, bypass the alarm, and get a bank employee to open the safe. The gang pulls off the heist and makes a successful getaway to Mexico on a plane. Eli has no idea that Inger has been frantically trying to get in touch with him, because she has inherited $7 million from her former employer.

In German it was known as Treisbruck, though this name is no longer used. Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1919) The history of the town is closely tied to the Tresa river crossing, which was first mentioned in 590 by Gregory of Tours. The name of the municipality, and the neighboring, Italian town of Lavena Ponte Tresa, both come from the river. From the Middle Ages until the opening of the Melide dam in 1847, the municipality provided strategically important connections to Italy.

Below the bridge there were fish ponds, which were mostly stocked with eels that belonged to the Bishop of Milan. In the 16th Century the bridge was in the possession of local noble families. Until 1828, it remained the property of the de Stoppani family, and then it was purchased by the Canton. The Canton built a new stone bridge in 1846. The current bridge dates from 1962. At Rocchetta, in the area above the town, lie the ruins of the Comacine masters castle of S. Martino, which was destroyed in the war between Como and Milan (1118‚Äì27). During the Middle Ages, Ponte Tresa enjoyed certain responsibilities and privileges in connection with border control, tolls and upkeep on the bridge. The Duke of Milan granted the village a tax exemption, which was confirmed by the Swiss Confederation in the 15th Century. The village church belong to the parish of Lavena Ponte Tresa until 1821 when it became an independent parish. The church of S. Bernardino dates from the 15th Century, and was renovated in 1972-82.

The points were leased from Rick Ware Racing. =Car No. 55 history= Reed Sorenson in the No. 55 at Martinsville Speedway in 2016 Mike Hillman, who was partnered with Joe Falk and his team was named as a partner for 2016, purchasing equipment from Hillman-Circle Sport LLC. The team returned in Martinsville for their 2016 debut. The number was changed from No. 62 to No. 55 with Reed Sorenson. The team made the race qualifying 40th out of 40 cars. The team would then make the races at both Texas and Bristol due to only 40 cars entered for both races, at Richmond there were 41 cars entered for the race but when qualifying was rained out and the field was set by practice speeds, the 55 team made the race due to being third fastest of the non- charter teams in practice. The 55 was driven by Michael Waltrip at Talladega; his 12th place would remain Robinson's best ever in Cup until the next restrictor plate race. Sorenson drove the next several races before being placed in the No. 98 starting at Pocono, with 98 driver Cole Whitt taking his place at this race and at Michigan, while Cody Ware drove at Sonoma; however, Ware failed to qualify. Sorenson returned at Daytona. Sorenson sat out Watkins Glen as well, with Alex Kennedy running the No. 55. The team has been forced to run many races without sponsorship; however, they did pick up PEAK Antifreeze for Talladega with Waltrip, the World Record Striper Company for Dover, the Sprint Showdown and the Coca-Cola 600 with Sorenson, long-time Robinson sponsor Vydox Plus at Pocono with Whitt, Carport Empire with Ware, and another longtime Robinson partner, Royal Teak Collection, with Sorenson at Daytona. In the second Talladega race, they surprised many by being the fastest in the first round of qualifying, then in the race, went to the garage at the opening laps to get the car ready for racing due to the car being impounded after qualifying. The team got to a bad start in 2017, crashing out and not qualifying for the Daytona 500. After the Daytona 500, Derrike Cope came back to the Cup series to drive the No. 55, starting at Atlanta. The No. 55 team originally planned to run full-time, but skipped three races along the process. The team made its 2018 season debut with driver Joey Gase driving the car at Las Vegas. Reed Sorenson returned to the No. 55 machine at Auto Club. After running 6 more races with Sorenson, one with J.J. Yeley at Martinsville and one with Jeffrey Earnhardt at the Coca-Cola 600, the 55 crew was moved to the No. 7 at Michigan with D.J. Kennington as driver. =Car No. 62 history= Brendan Gaughan's No. 62 car going through inspection at Sonoma in 2015. In 2015, upon the team's return to the Cup Series full-time, Premium began fielding a second car, the No. 62 Chevrolet for Brian Scott and Brendan Gaughan and Reed Sorenson. 62 was the number Gaughan used for the majority of his racing career. The team used the owner's points and equipment of Tommy Baldwin Racing's former No. 36 team, sold to Robinson at the beginning of the year. The No. 62 had collaborative agreements with both TBR and Richard Childress Racing (both Scott and Gaughan were RCR drivers). Scott drove an RCR-prepared car at the Daytona 500 with family sponsor Shore Lodge but crashed in his Budweiser Duel and failed to qualify. Gaughan planned to take over for the rest of the season, though without direct RCR support. Gaughan qualified the next week in Atlanta, finishing 28th. Gaughan would subsequently qualify at Las Vegas, with South Point Hotel and Casino (owned by his father Michael) appearing on the car. Gaughan qualified for the next two races in an unsponsored entry. However, the team then failed to qualify for the next four consecutive races, three of which were supposed to be fully sponsored. Gaughan finally qualified at Talladega with DiaThrive (who originally signed on at Martinsville) sponsoring, but blew a tire and crashed after 90 laps, finishing 40th. Gaughan failed to qualify for the fifth time at Kansas, and again the following race in Charlotte for the Coca-Cola 600. Gaughan was able to make the field at Dover, and made it to the end without incident, finishing 34th. Gaughan would also qualify at Pocono, due to the entry list having only 43 cars, but suffered electrical problems throughout the race and finished 40th. Gaughan failed to qualify at Michigan and Sonoma, but qualified at Daytona (due to cancellation of qualifying) with Vydox Plus (first signed on at Bristol) on the hood, and matched his season best 28th-place finish. After only qualifying for 8 of the first 16 races, and feeling like he could not give the effort to the team he wanted to, Gaughan left the team. Reed Sorenson took over the No. 62 at Kentucky, which qualified for the second week in a row (due to another qualifying rainout) finishing in 36th place. Sorenson failed to qualify at New Hampshire and Indianapolis. Sorenson was reassigned to the No. 98 at Pocono, with Timmy Hill moving over to the No. 62 for this race, which ran as a Ford from the former Phil Parsons Racing stable. The 62 made the show due to the entry list having only 43 cars, and finished 36th. T. J. Bell was entered in the No. 62, once again a Chevy, at Watkins Glen, but failed to qualify. Sorenson returned to the No. 62, once again as a Ford, at Michigan, but failed to qualify again, and also failed to qualify at Bristol. Hill would return to the No. 62 at Darlington, but this time failed to qualify, and failed to qualify the next week at Richmond as well. The No. 62, with Hill, qualified for Chicagoland, snapping a five-race DNQ streak since Pocono, due to a third rained-out qualifying session. Hill finished 41st. Hill made the next race at New Hampshire as well, finishing 36th, and qualified for the third week in a row at Dover, due to the entry list having only 43 cars; he finished 39th. This three-race start streak was broken when Hill failed to qualify at Charlotte. He missed the race again at Kansas. Hill was able to qualify at Talladega, with Royal Teak Collection on the hood for the first time in 2015 (the company had sponsored several races on the No. 98); this was also just the second time the No. 62 had qualified on speed when all cars ran a lap (the first time was with Gaughan at the spring Talladega race). Unfortunately, the car was plagued by electrical issues and finished 41st. Hill qualified at Martinsville, due to the entry list having only 43 cars. Due to Ryan Preece running the No. 98 at Texas, Sorenson returned to the No. 62, but posted the slowest speed and failed to qualify. Hill would run the car at Phoenix, making the field due to the entry list having only 43 cars, but suffered non-terminal engine problems and finished last. Sorenson ran the car at Homestead, but yet again posted the slowest speed and failed to qualify. The No. 62 missed 20 of 36 races and finished 2015 45th in the owners points, lowest among teams that attempted the full schedule and also behind the part- time No. 21 and No. 95 teams. =Car No. 66 history= In 2014, Robinson was involved in a collaboration called Identity Ventures Racing to field the No. 66 LandCastle Title/Royal Teak Toyota for a rotation of Toyota drivers as a Michael Waltrip Racing affiliate, a rotation which including Waltrip himself. Near the end of the season, Robinson took full control of the No. 66 after legal issues with principal partner Nat Hardwick. In 2015, Robinson announced his plan to return to the Cup Series full-time out of his own shop for the first time since 2012, this time under the name Premium Motorsports. Robinson brought over the remaining equipment from Identity Ventures Racing, and also brought over the No. 66 and the associated owner points. The team's driver was announced as Mike Wallace. Wallace ran the Daytona 500 with Crazy Vapors and X8 Energy Gum sponsoring. Wallace raced his way into the Daytona 500, and finished 36th in the race. However, Wallace failed to qualify for the next two races. Wallace was then released in favor of Tanner Berryhill, who took over at Phoenix and applied to be a Rookie of the Year contender. Berryhill also failed to qualify in his only attempt. Wallace was placed on the entry list for Auto Club Speedway, but the team withdrew midweek, with Robinson announcing no current plans for a return due to the qualifying struggles and lack of sponsorship. The team didn't return again until the non-points-paying Sprint All-Star Race's Sprint Showdown with Berryhill. Berryhill failed to win either Showdown segment in the No. 66. The team was later merged with the No. 98. =Car No. 98 history= Whitt's No. 98 at Kentucky Speedway in 2016 In early May 2015, it was reported that Phil Parsons Racing with Mike Curb would be selling their No. 98 team driven by Josh Wise to Premium owner Jay Robinson. Evidence for the change in ownership included the removal of the logos of PPR sponsor Phoenix Construction (owned by former team owner James Finch) from the car prior to the GEICO 500 at Talladega, replaced with Premium sponsor Royal Teak Collections. The ownership change was announced on May 5, the Monday after the race, on the team's Twitter. Premium Motorsports officially took over the No. 98 team at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, with Royal Teak once again sponsoring the car, and Wise remaining as the driver. Dogecoin returned to the 98 car at Sonoma, where the team ran a Chevrolet. Big Red Soda signed on as sponsor for four races beginning at Kentucky in July, where Wise was taken out early in a crash, finishing 43rd. Wise announced the following week that he had left Premium Motorsports, due to differences in opinion about the direction the team was going in comparison to Phil Parsons Racing. This was the second driver that left the team in a span of three days after Brendan Gaughan announced his departure Friday, July 10. Robinson later stated the move was due to sponsorship circumstances. Timmy Hill, part-time driver of Premium's Truck Series entry, drove the No. 98 at New Hampshire and Indianapolis. Hill switched to the No. 62 at Pocono, with Sorenson switching over to the No. 98, which ran as a Chevy at this race. Hill returned to the No. 98 at Watkins Glen, with the car once again running as a Chevy. Hill also ran Michigan and Bristol in the No. 98, before returning to the No. 62 at Darlington, with T. J. Bell running the No. 98. Sorenson returned to the No. 98 at Richmond and ran it again at Chicagoland. Tommy Baldwin Racing leased the No. 98 at New Hampshire in the fall, fielding Ryan Preece. After Sorenson ran the No. 98 for the next several weeks, Premium again leased the owner points, this time to Michael Waltrip Racing at Talladega in the fall, where Waltrip himself drove. Preece then returned to the No. 98, with Premium itself this time, for Martinsville, Texas and Phoenix. TBR again fielded the car for Preece at Homestead-Miami. In 2016, after the merger with the former No. 40 team, Cole Whitt was announced as the new driver of the No. 98, running the full season. The team inherited a charter from the No. 62 (formerly Baldwin's 36) but leased it to HScott Motorsports for 2016, leaving them without a guaranteed starting spot in races under NASCAR's new qualifying system. Whitt missed the Daytona 500 after spinning and breaking his transmission in his Can-Am Duel race. However, due to a shortage of entries for the next 3 races with only 39 cars at Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Fontana, Whitt and the 98 team made all of the races. The team would later miss the race at Richmond due to the field having 41 cars, a qualifying rainout and Whitt's practice speed being the slowest of the Open teams. Whitt bounced back at Talladega, posting an 18th-place finish despite being involved in a last-lap crash. Later, starting at Pocono, Whitt was moved to the No. 55, with Sorenson coming over from that team to field the No. 98 there and at Michigan. Whitt returned to the No. 98 at Sonoma, with Sorenson sitting out the weekend due to Cody Ware running the 55. The next week at Daytona, Whitt posted Premium's best ever finish after coming home 11th. After finishing 21st at Kentucky, Whitt sat out New Hampshire due to sponsorship issues, with Ryan Ellis running the No. 98. Whitt returned at Indianapolis. Timmy Hill drove the car at Dover. Whitt returned at Charlotte, however Whitt was released by the team after Kansas for a lack of sponsorship. Sorenson drove the car at Kansas (Whitt was in No. 55) after that the team skipped some races. Sorenson returned at Phoenix. In 2017 the No. 98 was renumbered to No. 15. Xfinity Series =Car No. 28 history= The 28 at Darlingon in 2006. The No. 28 car made its debut at the 2004 Charter 250. It was sponsored by Yahoo! and driven by Mark Green, who finished 35th in the car. Green piloted the car in six more races that season, before departing for Keith Coleman Racing. Shane Hall drove the car on a limited basis for the rest of the year. Derrike Cope was named the driver for 2005, with sponsorship from Radioshack and Motorola. Cope struggled and was replaced by Shane Hall. Hall only ran on a part-time basis, and did not finish a race. The No. 28 was driven part-time by Hall in 2006. He ran six races and had a best finish of 36th. For 2007, the team acquired the assets of the former Haas CNC Racing Busch team and ran the No. 28 Chevy full-time with Robert Richardson and Blake Bjorklund. Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter originally drove as well, before leaving to concentrate on their Cup rides. Sponsorship came from Checkers/Rally's Drive-In, U.S. Border Patrol, and Affordable Band Instruments during the 2007 racing season. Their best finish came at Montreal where Swedish road ringer Niclas Jonsson started 8th, led 5 laps and finished 12th after briefly contending to win the race. In 2008, Kirk Shelmerdine drove the No. 28 at Daytona with sponsorship from Lilly Trucking of Virginia in a one race deal for Daytona. Brian Keselowski was named the driver of the No. 28 after Daytona, however he was released after Bristol. Kenny Wallace was named the driver of the No. 28 for the rest of the year starting at Nashville with the United States Border Patrol providing sponsorship. He provided the team with its career-best third-place finish at Memphis Motorsports Park and finished sixteenth in points. In 2009, he had two top ten finishes and placed eleventh in points, the team's highest finish. The Border Patrol left at the end of the season, and the team was forced to rotate sponsors for 2010. Wallace left the team for RAB Racing, and Robinson hired Derrike Cope to drive full-time in 2011 with sponsorship from Maxelence. Cope ran all the races except for Iowa, in which Dennis Setzer drove. Cope would finish 20th in points with a best finish of 17th at Road America. J.J. Yeley drove the No. 28 in the 2012 season opener at Daytona. David Green and Cope ran one race each with sponsorship from JPO Absorbents. Kevin Lepage took over the No. 28 car with manufacturer support from Chevrolet. However, the team began to focus on its Cup program with Yeley, and returned at Charlotte with Tony Raines. =Car No. 49 history= Derrike Cope racing the No. 49. JRR made its debut in 2000 at Myrtle Beach Speedway. Rodney Childers was the driver of the No. 49 Southern Marine Chevy, but wrecked after 69 laps. JRR returned to the Busch Series at the 2001 NAPA Auto Parts 300. Fielding a Chevrolet, driver Andy Kirby failed to make the field. Their first start came at the Suncom 200, with A.J. Frank driving. He finished 39th after suffering equipment failure. The team made the next race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, with Carl Long finishing 42nd, followed by Bristol Motor Speedway, where they finished 43rd with Jerry McCart driving, as well finishing 42nd at Texas with Robbie Faggart. Frank returned at Nashville, where he finished 38th after wrecking during the race. At the next race at the NASCAR Subway 300, Kirby finished in 16th, the best finish for the team that year. Other drivers who raced for JRR that year were Joe Bush, Dick Trickle, Phil Bonifield, Brian Tyler, Philip Morris, Brian Weber, and Ken Alexander. The team finished 33rd in owner's points that year. JRR started 2002 by switching to Ford and Kirk Shelmerdine finishing 31st at Daytona. Faggart returned the next week with sponsorship from Rent-A-Wreck, where he finished 35th, and Craig Raudman at Las Vegas, who finished 32nd. Joe Buford took over the next two races, before David Starr took over at Texas. After that, Kirby returned to the team, and ran until the Kroger 300, when he was killed in a motorcycle accident two days after. They made one race with Nick Woodward, then with Dan Pardus. Buford, Troy Cline, and Derrike Cope finished out the year for the team. In 2003, the team hired Bingham to and Cope to share the driving duties 49. Bingham struggled finishing races and soon moved over to the No. 39 team, while Cope would eventually be released. Shane Hall took over for two races, along with Carlos Contreras. At New Hampshire, Tammy Jo Kirk and sponsor Advil signed on. She ran 15 races that season with a best finish of 21st at Pikes Peak. Cope returned to the 49 in 2004, running 30 out of 34 races, and finishing 27th in points. Vahsholtz made one start at Kentucky, where he finished 36th. Kertus Davis in the No. 49 at New Hampshire in 2008. In 2005, JRR hired Steve Grissom to pilot the No. 49 full-time. His best finish was 16th at Talladega. Mara Reyes filled in for him at Aut√≥dromo Hermanos Rodr√≠guez, Mexico City. Steve Grissom ran the season- opening race at Daytona in 2006 until Jorge Goeters (competing for NASCAR Busch Series Rookie of the Year) drove for a few races. Derrike Cope then took over driving duties, sharing the ride with Shane Hall, Steve Grissom, and Jennifer Jo Cobb. Derrike Cope ran three 3 races in the No. 49 in 2007. The No. 49 switched to No. 4 in 2008, after purchasing owners points from Phoenix Racing. Robert Richardson ran eleven races with funding from JVC and Phantom EFX, before Cope took his place for most of the season. In the final races, Patrick Sheltra leased the number and owner's points for his own entry. At the road course events, Phoenix fielded the No. 4 for Landon Cassill, while Cope drove the 49. For the 2009 season, Kertus Davis began the season as the driver of the No. 49 again in 2009 with GetMoreVacations.com as sponsor. After several races, Mark Green returned to the team as driver. During the season, this team ran as a start and park team. In 2010, Green ran both the No. 49 and No. 70 cars for JRR under an agreement with ML Motorsports. This same deal was formed for 2010. Brad Teague ran the No. 49 at Bristol in March. In 2011, this team was entered on occasion, and mostly used to Start and Park which helps fund the primary No. 28 car, with Derrike Cope. =Other teams= The 39 cars were purchased from Robert Yates Racing in 2003, who had repossessed the equipment from Angela's Motorsports. The team's first race was at the Koolerz 300, with Mike McLaughlin driving a fan-supported ride. He qualified fourth, but was involved in a crash late in the race, and finished 29th. Joe Buford and Clint Vahsholtz ran the next two races. Jason White began running the 39 eventually with Three Stooges Beer as the sponsor. Eventually, road racer Chris Bingham was moved to the 39 car after struggling in the 49 car. Following his release, Jamie Mosley and Dana White finished out the year. For the 2004 season Andy Ponstein began the year in the 39 with sponsorship from Yahoo!, but wrecked several times during his tenure and was released. Tina Gordon came on after that, and had a best finish of 26th at Pikes Peak, before she was released. The 39 has not run since. JRR revived its third team in 2008 as the No. 49. Derrike Cope first attempted a race with the car at Mexico City, but failed to qualify. The car next ran at Nashville Superspeedway, when Shane Hall finished last after an early vibration problem. Kertus Davis joined the team at Kentucky and ran the rest of season in No. 49 after leaving his family owned JD Motorsports team, his best finish being 35th. JRR has not run a third car since then. Gander Outdoor Truck Series =Truck No. 15 history= In 2017, the team fielded another Truck Series entry, using the No. 15. Gray Gaulding was signed to drive part-time and began racing at Chicagoland finishing 25th. In 2018, the team expanded to full-time with driver Robby Lyons, who previously drove in a couple races for the team in 2017. Lyons would be replaced by Cup driver Reed Sorenson in a few races midseason, and by JR Heffner for the race at Eldora Speedway. Phil Parsons son Stefan will make his truck series debut at Bristol Motor Speedway. =Truck No. 49 history= In 2015, the team fielded a full-time Truck Series entry, using the No. 94 (inverse of the 49). Wendell Chavous was signed to drive the full season, except the season opener at Daytona where he was not approved to run. Former Truck Series champion Travis Kvapil was hired to drive at Daytona. Kvapil started on the outside pole, but finished 15th after sustaining damage in a wreck. Chavous made his Truck Series debut at Atlanta. The team suffered their first DNQ at Martinsville. Chavous was replaced by Timmy Hill beginning at Dover, though he returned to the team to drive at Eldora, and drove the next three races before being released again. T. J. Bell drove at Mosport, then Hill returned once again, although Wayne Edwards drove a single race at Las Vegas (due to Hill's Cup Series commitments to the team). In 2016, Hill was announced as the full-time driver of the Truck, which switched numbers to Robinson's traditional No. 49. The team later struck a deal with JR Motorsports to loan them the Truck for use with Nick Drake. Edwards also drove in Hill's place at Texas. Spencer Boyd drove at Gateway. Hill returned at Kentucky, but has not run the Truck since and later moved to MBM Motorsports in the Xfinity Series. Drivers of the No. 49 since then have included Edwards, Sorenson, D. J. Kennington and Bryce Napier. In 2017, Wendell Chavous competed full-time in this truck and for NASCAR Rookie of the Year honors. In 2018, Premium Motorsports announced that their Truck Series team would shut down, focusing exclusively on the Cup Series.

ADOX was originally a brand name used by the German company, Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH of Frankfurt am Main, the world's first photographic materials manufacturer. In 1962 the Schleussner family sold its photographic holdings to DuPont, an American company. DuPont used the brand for its subsidiary, Sterling Diagnostic Imaging for X-ray films. In 1999, Sterling was bought by the German company Agfa. Agfa did not use the brand and allowed its registration to lapse in 2003. Fotoimpex of Berlin, Germany, a company founded in 1992 to import photographic films and papers from former eastern Europe immediately registered the brand and today ADOX is a brand of black and white films, photographic papers and photochemistry produced by ADOX Fotowerke GmbH based in Bad Sarrow near Berlin. History =Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH (1860 - 1962)= ADOX was originally a brand name used by the German company, Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH of Frankfurt am Main, the world's first photographic materials manufacturer. The company's founder, Dr. Carl Schleussner, did pioneering work on the wet-collodion process during the early years of photography, and formed his manufacturing company in 1860. Working with the physicist Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, discoverer of X-rays, Dr. Schleussner invented the first X-ray plate. The Schleussner firm began marketing cameras under the ADOX brand name in the first third of the 20th century and, recognizing the growing importance of the brand, renamed itself \\"Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH.\\" In 1952 they introduced a line of very sharp black and white 35 mm films under the ADOX brand. =DuPont & Agfa (1962 - 2003)= In 1962, the Schleussner family sold its photographic holdings to DuPont, an American company. DuPont became owners of the trademark, and registered it in the United States. In the 1970s, Dupont licensed the Adox film technology, but not the trademark, and sold the coating plant with 'dip and dunk' machinery of their film to Fotokemika, Samobor, Croatia (at the time Yugoslavia) in 1972 who continued to produce the traditional black and white films according to the 1950s ADOX formulas under the Efke brand. (See List of discontinued photographic films). The Efke black & white KB (135) and R (120) films in 3 speeds (ISO 25, 50 and 100) were noted for their wide-latitude, smooth grain, great tonality, incredible sharpness and being capable of high contrast results.https://emulsive.org/reviews/film- reviews/efke-film-reviews/film-review-efke-kb-25-35mm-format In particular the slowest speed film KB 25 was laid down as a single layer emulsion. The films were low cost but due to their soft emulsion were prone to scratching during processing as well as quality issues. DuPont kept the Adox trademark, transferring it to a subsidiary, Sterling Diagnostic Imaging, for its Adox brand X-ray films. DuPont still applies it to an industrial chemical, sodium chlorite. In 1999, Sterling was bought by the German company Agfa, and was absorbed into Agfa's Health Sciences unit. In this roundabout way, the Adox photographic trademark once again briefly became German. Agfa did not use the Adox trademark, and the mark was removed from the German Patent Office trademark registry in March, 2003. It was almost immediately revived by companies in Canada, the United States, and Fotoimpex in Germany. =ADOX Fotowerke GmbH (2003 on)= The current rights to the ADOX name were obtained in 2003 by Fotoimpex of Berlin, Germany, a company founded in 1992 to import photographic films and papers from former eastern Europe. In particular they imported the Efke KB films and sold them branded as 'ADOX CHS Art' thus finally re-uniting the ADOX name with the original Schleussner film formula. Fotoimpex established the ADOX Fotowerke GmbH film factory in Bad Sarrow outside Berlin to convert and package their films, papers and chemicals using machinery acquired from the closed AGFA (Leverkusen, Germany) and Forte Photochemical Industry (Hungary) photographic plants. ADOX test-produced a slightly improved version of the original AGFA APX 400 as ADOX Pan 400 during 2010. After Fotokemikas closure in 2012 due to failure of the original film making machinery proving too expensive to repair, Fotoimpex had ADOX CHS II (100 ISO, equivalent to Efke KB 100) black and white film produced using modern cascade coating. This took priority over proposals to re-introduce Agfa APX 400. In February 2015 they purchased/obtained a long lease on the former Ilford Imaging, Switzerland (Ciba Geigy) machine E, medium scale coating line at Marly, Switzerland to coat photographic film and paper. Trial coating for ADOX CHS (II) was undertaken at Marly prior to its re-introduction in 2018. http://www.adox.de/Photo/adox-acquires-ilfords-medium-scale-coating-line/ http://www.lagruyere.ch/2018/01/l%E2%80%99homme-qui-redonne-vie-%C3%A0-la- machine-e-d%E2%80%99ilford.html http://www.adox.de/Photo/chs-100-ii-sheetfilm- available-again/ The plant has also been used for testing the proposed revival of Polywarmtone Paper last produced by Forte in Hungary.https://www.adox.de/Photo/final-polywarmtone-layer-build-up/ ADOX are also (2017-19) doubling the size of the film factory in Bad Sarrow, Germany to add a small coating line using a former AGFA machine as well as space for small scale chemical production and film materials storage.http://www.adox.de/Photo/agfa-coating-table-mooved-into-the-new- building/ Current Products ADOX Fotowerke GmbH produces a range of black and white films, photographic paper and photochemistry. The company has notably resurrected former ADOX films and AGFA films, paper and chemicals including the entire Agfa B&W; chemistry line with the help of its former employees and it now holds the trademark in Europe and USA for the famous (Agfa) Rodinal film developer. It also sells newer more 'eco-friendly products'.

After taking part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, he served in most of the battles of the Napoleonic Wars. During the Hundred Days he took part in both the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo. He went on to be Commander of the troops in Jamaica and in that role established new barracks at Newcastle, Jamaica, high in the mountains. After that he became Governor of Mauritius and, finally, Commander-in-Chief, India, in which role he introduced promotion examinations for officers. Military career Born the son of Lieutenant-Colonel William Gomm (who served in the 46th Foot during the American Revolutionary War and was killed in the attack on Guadeloupe in April 1794) and Mary Alleyne Gomm (n√©e Maynard), Gomm was commissioned as an ensign in the 9th Regiment of Foot on 24 May 1794, at the age of nine, in recognition of the services rendered by his father. Promoted to lieutenant on 14 April 1795, he continued his full-time education at a private school in Woolwich.Heathcote, p. 146 Gomm joined his regiment in 1799 and was deployed to the Netherlands where he fought under the Duke of York and Albany at the Battle of Bergen in September 1799 and at the Battle of Alkmaar in October 1799 during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. He also took part in Sir James Pulteney's expedition to Ferrol in Spain in August 1800 and, having been promoted to captain on 19 July 1803, he joined the Senior Division of the new Royal Military College at High Wycombe. He then served as assistant quartermaster-general under Earl Cathcart at the Battle of Copenhagen in August 1807. Gomm joined Sir Arthur Wellesley's army, again as assistant quartermaster-general, and fought at the Battle of Roli√ßa and the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808 during the Peninsular War. After the Convention of Sintra Gomm returned to Portugal and served on Sir John Moore's staff at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809. Gomm was also on the Earl of Chatham's staff during the disastrous Walcheren Campaign of Autumn 1809. Vanity Fair, 1873 Gomm returned to Portugal in March 1810 and, as a staff officer, took part in the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 and the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro in May 1811 before being promoted to major on 10 October 1811. He went on to fight at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in April 1812 (where he was wounded) and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812 before being promoted to lieutenant colonel on 17 August 1812.Heathcote, p. 147 After that he took part in the Siege of Burgos in September 1812, the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and the Siege of San Sebasti√°n in July 1813 as well as the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813 (where he was wounded again). Following his return to England, he transferred into the Coldstream Guards on 25 July 1814 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815. During the Hundred Days, as a staff officer with the 5th Division, Gomm took part in the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. At Waterloo he rode a charger called \\"George\\", which survived until 1841. He was awarded the Russian Order of St. Anna, 2nd Class on 8 October 1815. He acquired a property at 6 Upper Grosvenor Street in London in 1826. The Battle of Quatre Bras, at which Gomm served as a staff officer, during the Hundred Days Gomm was promoted to colonel on 16 May 1829 and to major-general on 10 January 1837. He became Commander of the troops in Jamaica in 1839 and in that role observed that yellow fever, a major cause of death among the British troops stationed in Jamaica, was far less prevalent in the mountains and he therefore established new barracks at Newcastle, Jamaica, high in the mountains. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Cambridge University in 1842. Gomm was briefly General officer commanding Northern District in early 1842 before being appointed the Governor of Mauritius in June 1842. Promoted to lieutenant-general on 9 November 1846, he was sent out to India in Summer 1849 to become Commander-in-Chief, India arriving only to discover that his appointment had been cancelled in favour of Sir Charles Napier. Gomm was then initially chosen to become Commander-in- chief of the Bombay Army with the local rank of general in September 1850 but, following Napier's resignation as Commander-in-Chief, India, Gomm succeeded him in December 1851. In that role Gomm introduced promotion examinations for officers. Promoted to full general on 20 June 1854, he retired from active service in 1856 and, after advancement to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1859 and after further promotion to field marshal on 1 January 1868, he became Constable of the Tower in October 1872. He also served as honorary colonel of the 13th Regiment of Foot. He died at Brighton in Sussex on 15 March 1875 and was buried at Christ's Church in Rotherhithe. Under his widow's will ¬£15,000 was left to Keble College, Oxford to endow scholarships in his memory. Family In 1817 Gomm married Sophia Penn, great granddaughter of William Penn; following the death of his first wife in 1827 he married Elizabeth Kerr, eldest daughter of Major-General Lord Robert Kerr, who was the son of William Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian, in 1830. He had no children by either marriage. Lady Elizabeth died in 1877, leaving ¬£5000 to the Sir William and Lady Gomm Charity to benefit elderly people in Rotherhithe. This endowed the Lady Elizabeth Memorial Mission Hall and Accident Hospital in Hawkstone Road next to Southwark Park. The former hospital building survives as Lady Gomm House.

Kamusinga is regarded as an academic and extra-curricular giant for its performance in National examinations and Nationwide extra-curricular competitions of field hockey, basketball, Science Congress, drama and music festival competitions over the years. History The school was established by Allan Bradley (a British Native who died aged 90 in February 2000) in 1956 as a transfer unit for Friends School Kaimosi from Kaimosi in Vihiga County. He is remembered by the school by holding an annual intra-school sports tournaments dubbed 'Allan Bradley's Day', held on 18 February of every year. The first Allan Bradley's Day Tournament was on 18 February 2006. The school continues to maintain relations with members of the Allan Bradley family such as Ruth Bradley and Peter Bradley who find possible ways to support the school whenever possible. Peter Bradley-Left (Son of School Founder) with Former School Principal Edwin Namachanja-center The School Administration Block Building Academics =National exam performance= The school produced the best 2006 K.C.S.E. (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education) national candidate Dickens Omanga. Due to scrapping of school rankings nationwide by the Ministry of Education, the ranking of the school is not available since 2018. But based on performance comparison the school boasts production of the highest number of A, A- and B+ grades compared to most schools in the country making it still one of the top schools in the country. In 2011, before ranking was abolished, the school has ranked 12th nationwide. In 2016 it ranked 4th. In 2017 it emerged position 15. =Administration= The school is headed by Alex Kariuki Maina, who took over the helm in January 2018, formerly the Principal of Ololaiser High School in Kajiado County. The school was previously headed by Edwin Namachanja from 2010 to January 2018 who was transferred to Maranda High School in Siaya County. =Notable former staff= In the 60's Nicolas Guy Barnett was a British teaching member of staff between 1960 and 1961, and later became member of parliament of South Dorset between 1962 and 1964 and later Greenwich between 1971 and 1986 in 42nd and 45th Parliament of the United Kingdom.British Library Integrated Catalogue entry: By the Lake.

The ultrasound can be used with just water, but use of a solvent appropriate for the object to be cleaned and the type of soiling present enhances the effect. Cleaning normally lasts between three and six minutes, but can also exceed 20 minutes, depending on which object has to be cleaned. Ultrasonic cleaners are used to clean many different types of objects, including jewelry, scientific samples, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental and surgical instruments, tools, coins, fountain pens, golf clubs, fishing reels, window blinds, firearm components, car fuel injectors, musical instruments, gramophone records, industrial machine parts and electronic equipment. They are used in many jewelry workshops, watchmakers' establishments, electronic repair workshops and scientific labs. History The surface mechanisms of ultrasonic cleaning are well understood, with many works dedicated to this science since the first commercial ultrasonic cleaning equipment appeared in the 1950s, and came into use as relatively inexpensive home appliances in about 1970. Ultrasonic cleaning has been used industrially for decades, particularly to clean small intricate parts, and to accelerate surface treatment processes. Process characteristics Ultrasonic cleaning uses cavitation bubbles induced by high frequency pressure (sound) waves to agitate a liquid. The agitation produces high forces on contaminants adhering to substrates like metals, plastics, glass, rubber, and ceramics. This action also penetrates blind holes, cracks, and recesses. The intention is to thoroughly remove all traces of contamination tightly adhering or embedded onto solid surfaces. Water or solvents can be used, depending on the type of contamination and the workpiece. Contaminants can include dust, dirt, oil, pigments, rust, grease, algae, fungus, bacteria, lime scale, polishing compounds, flux agents, fingerprints, soot wax and mold release agents, biological soil like blood, and so on. Ultrasonic cleaning can be used for a wide range of workpiece shapes, sizes and materials, and may not require the part to be disassembled prior to cleaning.Robert H. Todd, Dell K. Allen, and Leo Alting; Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide Objects must not be allowed to rest on the bottom of the device during the cleaning process, because that will prevent cavitation from taking place on the part of the object not in contact with solvent. Design and operating principle In an ultrasonic cleaner, the object to be cleaned is placed in a chamber containing a suitable solution (in an aqueous or organic solvent, depending on the application). In aqueous cleaners, surfactants (e.g., laundry detergent) are often added to permit dissolution of non-polar compounds such as oils and greases. An ultrasound generating transducer built into the chamber, or lowered into the fluid, produces ultrasonic waves in the fluid by changing size in concert with an electrical signal oscillating at ultrasonic frequency. This creates compression waves in the liquid of the tank which 'tear' the liquid apart, leaving behind many millions of microscopic 'voids'/'partial vacuum bubbles' (cavitation). These bubbles collapse with enormous energy; temperatures and pressures on the order of 5,000 K and 135 MPa are achieved; however, they are so small that they do no more than clean and remove surface dirt and contaminants. The higher the frequency, the smaller the nodes between the cavitation points, which allows for cleaning of more intricate detail. Ultrasonic transducers showing ~20 kHz and ~40 kHz stacks. The active elements (near the top) are two rings of lead zirconate titanate, which are bolted to an aluminium coupling horn. Transducers are usually piezoelectric (e.g. made with lead zirconate titanate (PZT), barium titanate, etc.), but are sometimes magnetostrictive. The often harsh chemicals used as cleaners in many industries are not needed, or used in much lower concentrations, with ultrasonic agitation. Ultrasonics are used for industrial cleaning, and also used in many medical and dental techniques and industrial processes. Cleaning solution Ultrasonic activity (cavitation) helps the solution to do its job; plain water would not normally be effective. The cleaning solution contains ingredients designed to make ultrasonic cleaning more effective. For example, reduction of surface tension increases cavitation levels, so the solution contains a good wetting agent (surfactant). Aqueous cleaning solutions contain detergents, wetting agents and other components, and have a large influence on the cleaning process. Correct composition of the solution is very dependent upon the item cleaned. Solutions are mostly used warm, at about , however, in medical applications it is generally accepted that cleaning should be at temperatures below to prevent protein coagulation. Water-based solutions are more limited in their ability to remove contaminants by chemical action alone than solvent solutions; e.g. for delicate parts covered with thick grease. The effort required to design an effective aqueous-cleaning system for a particular purpose is much greater than for a solvent system. Some machines (which are not unduly large) are integrated with vapour degreasing machines using hydrocarbon cleaning fluids: Three tanks are used in a cascade. The lower tank containing dirty fluid is heated causing the fluid to evaporate. At the top of the machine there is a refrigeration coil. Fluid condenses on the coil and falls into the upper tank. The upper tank eventually overflows and clean fluid runs into the work tank where the cleaning takes place. Purchase price is higher than simpler machines, but such machines are economical in the long run. The same fluid can be reused many times, minimising wastage and pollution. Uses Most hard, non-absorbent materials (metals, plastics, etc.) not chemically attacked by the cleaning fluid are suitable for ultrasonic cleaning. Ideal materials for ultrasonic cleaning include small electronic parts, cables, rods, wires and detailed items, as well as objects made of glass, plastic, aluminium or ceramic. Ultrasonic cleaning does not sterilize the objects being cleaned, because spores and viruses will remain on the objects after cleaning. In medical applications, sterilization normally follows ultrasonic cleaning as a separate step. Industrial ultrasonic cleaners are used in the automotive, sporting, printing, marine, medical, pharmaceutical, electroplating, disk drive components, engineering and weapons industries. Ultrasonic cleaning is used to remove contamination from industrial process equipment such as pipes and heat exchangers. Limitations Ultrasonic cleaning is used widely to remove flux residue from soldered circuit boards. However, some electronic components, notably MEMS devices such as gyroscopes, accelerometers and microphones can become damaged or destroyed by the high intensity vibrations they are subjected to during cleaning. Piezoelectric buzzers can work in reverse and produce voltage, which may pose a danger to their drive circuits.  Safety  It is recommended to avoid using flammable cleaning solutions because ultrasonic cleaners increase temperature even when not equipped with a heater. When the unit is running, inserting your hand into the solution could cause burning due to the temperature; discomfort and skin irritation can also occur.

Parker served in the Virginia House of Delegates and the United States Senate, before later serving on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Early and family life Parker was born at ‚ÄòRock Spring,‚Äô Westmoreland County, Virginia, son of Captain William Harwar Parker and Mary (Sturman) Parker, and grandson of Judge Richard Parker and Elizabeth (Beale) Parker. He studied law under his grandfather Parker at ‚ÄòLawfield,‚Äô his grandfather's residence in Westmoreland County. Career After being admitted to the bar, he practiced in Westmoreland, his native county, which he twice represented in the Virginia House of Delegates, although when he was re-elected the vote contested, and the narrow loser would succeed to the seat in the next election.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia: 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 249, 254 During the War of 1812, Parker served as Lieutenant colonel in the Thirty-fifth Virginia Regiment Militia. As such, he was in charge of the defense of the Northern Neck of Virginia from British incursions. On September 16, 1814, Parker was wounded during the British attack that resulted in the burning of Washington. After the war, Parker returned to private legal practice. The legislature elected him a judge of the general court on July 26, 1817. On December 12, 1836, Virginia legislators elected Judge Parker as the United States Senator from Virginia. A Jacksonian, he filled the vacancy caused by the resignation of Benjamin W. Leigh. Parker would resigned from the Senate on March 13, 1837, to accept a seat on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals (again elected by his former state legislative colleagues). He refused the cabinet office of United States Attorney General offered him by President Van Buren. Death and legacy Parker died on his estate, ‚ÄòSoldier‚Äôs Retreat,‚Äô near Snickersville (now Bluemont, Clarke County), Virginia, September 10, 1840. He was buried alongside his wife, Elizabeth Foushee Parker at Grace Episcopal Church in Berryville, Virginia in the county of Clarke.

Its release continued a critical upswing in Numan's career which began three years earlier with the release of Sacrifice, and which had been boosted by the release of the Random tribute album earlier in 1997. The album followed a loose concept namely that, rather than being opposites, God and the Devil were two sides of the same coin. Each track reflected some aspect of this premise. Unlike Sacrifice, Numan‚Äôs theme in Exile was not so much atheistic as heretical; it did not deny the existence of God but, instead, his proclaimed goodness. Shortly after the album's release, Numan explained: \\"Personally, I don't believe in God at all, but if I'm wrong and there is a God, what kind of god would it be who would give us the world we live in?\\"Sonic Boom Magazine interview The opening number and single, \\"Dominion Day\\", set the album‚Äôs gothic/industrial rock tone, describing how a man's nightmare becomes reality as Christ returns to Earth in scenes suggestive of the Book of Revelation. The tale was set against a wall of synthesizers, drum loops and distorted guitars. \\"Dark\\", which further explored what the composer saw as an incestuous relationship between God and the Devil, became a favourite for movie trailers before being used on the soundtrack of Alex Proyas‚Äô film Dark City. \\"Dead Heaven\\" turned various biblical conceits on their head (Mary is ravaged, rather than revered, by the Three Wise Men) while \\"Absolution\\", a re-recording of a 1995 single, was a bitter reflection on the consequences of unquestioning faith; it had been covered by Amanda Ghost on the Random tribute album. Though not a big chart success Exile scored almost universally positive reviews, a contrast to the situation in Numan‚Äôs early years when he had many hits but was generally condemned by critics. However it further alienated some fans who had been put off by Sacrifice‚Äôs anti-religious undertones. The website www.remindmetosmile.com changed from a tribute page to one openly critical of Numan for being \\"so bold that he feels he can mock God and feel good about it\\". Numan‚Äôs response was: :\\"This sort of reaction always amazes me. Here you have people that genuinely believe that God created this entire bloody universe in just six days, without anybody's help, and yet they seem to think that He needs their help to deal with little me. If God was bothered about me, He would deal with me\\".Chaotic Critiques interview The US edition of Exile included one extra track, a live recording of \\"Down in the Park\\", previously released on the double album Ghost (1987); Numan, who did not approve its inclusion, presumed that his record label did it to link him to Marilyn Manson and other artists who had recently covered the song.Sonic Boom Magazine interview An extended version of Exile, nearly twice as long as the original, was released in 1998. Numan toured the UK and US in support of the album to largely sell-out crowds, a concert recording from this period called Live at Shepherd‚Äôs Bush Empire (US title Live in London) eventually being released in 2004.

They compete in the National Premier Leagues NSW 3 Men's and National Premier Leagues NSW Women‚Äôs, playing their home games at Jensen Oval. History In the 1940s and 1950s the original Bankstown club played at Bankstown Oval and then in the 1960s and 1970s, they played out of a ground at Stacey Street and Gartmore Ave, Bankstown, then known as Bankstown Soccer Centre and now Ruse Park. In 1975, Yagoona Macedonia was created by a Mile Smileski in Yagoona and competed in their first domestic season and their first recorded game by the Bankstown Soccer Federation was against Padstow. As the years passed, so did the players and new faces began to emerge in the ever-growing Macedonian-Australian Sydney-based club. By 1988, the original Bankstown club had become insolvent and there was no elite team in the local area for several years. A consortium of local businessman merged three amateur clubs: Yagoona, Caltex, and Mladost, and purchased Maccabi Hakoah's licence to participate in the New South Wales Division 2, formulating the Bankstown City Sydney Macedonia Soccer Club. Bankstown once again had a team in the NSW State League. The new club had strong support from the local Bankstown and wider Macedonian community in Sydney, and named itself \\"Sydney Macedonia\\". Sydney Macedonia finished 3rd in 1988. In 1989, the club was Champion of Division 2, losing only 3 games all season and received promotion to New South Wales Division 1. They finished 6th in their first year in Division 1. In 1992, Sydney Macedonia played its first game in the top tier of NSW Football since the early 1970s. The following year, the club finished 2nd, however they went on to win the grand final, scoring a goal in the final minute against perennial rival Blacktown City, and were Premiers of 1993. This was the first ever time that Bankstown had its team as champions of the NSW State League. 1994 was the most successful season in the club's history. The team lost only 1 game in the season, winning 16 games in total. They scored 52 goals and conceded 9, and went on to win the grand final and finished as back- to-back (1993 & 1994) Champions. The silverware did not stop there ‚Äì Sydney Macedonia went on to play Sydney Olympic in the 1994 Waratah Cup Final at Marconi Stadium. Sydney Macedonia defeated Sydney Olympic, an NSL team, 2‚Äì1 at a sold out Marconi Stadium. The club had ensured the treble: Premiers, Back to Back Champions, Cup Winners. This still is the most successful accomplishment for football in Bankstown. After the 1994 season, the club reverted to its current name: Bankstown City [Lions] FC. In 2001, Bankstown City won the NSW Winter Super League and were promoted to the NSW Premier League. The club's members financed an upgrade to their home ground at Jensen Oval, which saw the installation of TV Standard lighting and covered seating. In 2004, Bankstown City finished in the top four earning participation in the finals series. They went on to win the NSWPL Grand Final against Belconnen in front of 7500 fans at Marconi Stadium ‚Äì bring back the Championship to Bankstown for the first time in 10 years. In 2005 local junior, former Socceroo and current player Sasho Petrovski re-joined Bankstown when the NSL was disbanded. Bankstown City started the season strongly, and finished the season in first place on the ladder despite losing Petrovski, and Chad Gibson to the A-League midway through the season. Peter Tsekenis took on the role of Player/Coach, and Bankstown City were for the second time in a decade back-to-back Champions, defeating Bonnyrigg White Eagles 3‚Äì1 in the Grand Final in front of 8000 fans at Parramatta Stadium. The 2007 season the first grade finished in second position on the ladder. In the finals, Bankstown City were defeated by Blacktown City in the grand final to the tune of 3:1. While the youth finished in 3rd spot of the club championship, their highest achievement since coming into the competition. In 2008, Bankstown City defeated Sydney Olympic in the Final of the Waratah Cup for the second time. Sadly, Bankstown City were relegated to the NSW Super League (Tier 2) in 2011. In 2013 they complete in revamp National Premier Leagues NSW 2 and suffered a second relegation to NPL NSW 3 Men's in 2017. 2013 was a milestone year for the club with the introduction of Women's teams for the first time. The Women's teams were competitive from the start and secured promotion from the third tier Women's State League to the National Premier League 2 in 2015. In 2017, Bankstown City were crowned Champions of the NPL2 Women's, defeating Sydney Olympic in the Grand Final and earning promotion to the NPL1 Women's for the first time in 2018. The 2018 NPL 1 Women's season saw Bankstown in a relegation battle against Sutherland for the duration of the season, with the Club surviving on the last day. First Grade women finished a respectable 10th out of 12 teams.

It is the largest numbering plan area in the Commonwealth, and extends from the New York state line eastward into Worcester County (only the towns of Hardwick and Warren), while excluding the Franklin County towns of Orange, New Salem, Warwick, and Wendell, which use the overlay of area codes 978 and 351. The most-populous city of area code 413 is Springfield. 413 also includes Chicopee, Northampton, Holyoke, Greenfield, and Amherst (LATA code 126). History Massachusetts was proposed to receive two area codes in the preliminary model of the North American Numbering Plan, the only state in New England to be split between multiple numbering plan areas. Area code 413 was intended for use in Pennsylvania.https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.dcom.telecom/iH4nOd2LM3E/RlG8a0teOX0J;context- place=msg/comp.dcom.telecom/iH4nOd2LM3E/FuUYnq7A6VUJ However, when area codes were finalized, the eastern two-thirds of the state (including Boston and Worcester) was assigned 617, with 413 in the west. Because of the low population density of western Massachusetts, 413 remained in its original configuration even as the eastern portion of the state went from one area code to four from 1988 to 1997.

He was appointed Chair of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in April 2016. He previously served as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee from 2011 to 2016 and Minister of State for Trade and Commerce from 2007 to 2009. Personal life McGuinness was born in Kilkenny and educated in Kilkenny Christian Brothers Secondary School. He holds a Diploma in Business Management. He is married to Margaret Redmond and they have three sons and one daughter. His eldest son Andrew is a Fianna F√°il County Councillor on Kilkenny County Council and served as Mayor from 2014 to 2015. Political career He first entered local politics in 1979 when he won a seat on Kilkenny Borough Council and was a subsequent Mayor of the city from 1996 to 1997.Nealon's Guide to the 30th D√°il & 23rd Seanad, Ed. Stephen Collins, Dublin, 2007 He was the third generation of his family to serve on this council. From 1991 until the abolition of the dual mandate in 2003, he was also member of Kilkenny County Council, where his father, Michael McGuinness, was the longest-serving councillor (1959‚Äì99). He was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il TD for the Carlow‚ÄìKilkenny constituency at the 1997 general election. He was vice-chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee in the 29th D√°il and a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committees for European Affairs, Enterprise and Small Business, Justice, and Women's Rights in the 28th D√°il. In 2007, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for Trade and Commerce. He has subsequently revealed a testy relationship with his senior minister Mary Coughlan, and considerable disagreement with policy in the department. On 22 April 2009, as part of cost- cutting measures due to the Irish financial crisis, the Taoiseach Brian Cowen reduced the number of Ministers of State from 20 to 15. McGuinness was among the seven junior ministers who were not reappointed. On 24 April 2009, he criticised Coughlan and Cowen for their lack of leadership being given to the country. He said: \\"She's not equipped to deal with the complex issues of dealing with enterprise and business within the department. And neither is the department\\". McGuinness' later rejected suggestions he campaigned to undermine Coughlan, when it was revealed that he had hired external PR advice in an effort to enhance his own profile as a Minister of State within the Department. In 2010, a political memoir that he co-wrote with Naoise Nunn, called The House Always Wins, was published by Gill & Macmillan. In the 31st D√°il, McGuinness served as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. He was the Fianna F√°il Spokesperson on Small Business and Regulatory Framework from April 2011 to March 2016. In the 32nd D√°il, McGuinness served as Chair of the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach Committee.

Today there are approximately 650 centers worldwide, directed by Ole Nydahl under the guidance of Trinley Thaye Dorje, one of two claimants to the title of the 17th Karmapa (See Karmapa Controversy).

The exodus of Tibetans made Tibetan Buddhism more accessible to the rest of the world. Many young Westerners on the hippie trail from Europe to India and Nepal came into contact with Tibetan teachers. Beginning with Freda Bedi, in 1960, Westerners began taking refuge in Tibetan Buddhist masters. When Hannah Nydahl and Ole Nydahl were on their honeymoon in the Himalayas in 1968, they became students of Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, and in 1969 took refuge with The 16th Karmapa and became his closest Western students. After meditating and studying Buddhism for three years, the 16th Karmapa asked Ole and Hannah to start meditation centers in his name in the West.Nydahl, Ole \\"Entering The Diamond Way, Tibetan Buddhism Meets the West\\", Blue Dolphin Publishing (1999).

As more became interested more centers were founded and their number increased over time, particularly in Germany and Poland. The individual groups grew steadily. He later traveled to the United States and across South America and Russia, founding more centers. Following the Karmapa Controversy, Karma Kagyu Buddhist centers were obliged to decide whether to accept Orgyen Trinley Dorje, who was recognized by Tai Situ, the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government, or to support Shamar Rinpoche. In the course of the 1990s, while a majority of Kagyu monasteries elected to accept Orgyen Trinley Dorje, most Diamond Way centers under Ole Nydahl accepted Thaye Dorje.1998 Interview with Ole Nydahl Retrieved on 2009-30-01 Diamond Way Buddhism was founded as a legally distinct organization within the Karma Kagyu umbrella in 1993. Until then, the Nydahls had transferred all ownership of the centers they founded to the Karma Kagyu administration. However, it is common for Karma Kagyu lamas to each have their own organization for their students, as each teacher has a different style and approach. For example, Shamarpa has the Bodhipath organization, Chogyam Trungpa had the Vajradhatu, etc. The goals of the Diamond Way organization remain \\"the creation and maintenance of a permanent basis from which to enable both laypeople and achievers to maintain, cultivate and practice Buddhist religion, philosophy and culture in countries that are not originally Buddhist, within the traditional manner of the Diamond Way transmission of the Karma Kagyu lineage\\", Buddhist art, supporting translations of authentic Buddhist text, and funding retreats etc. The \\"spiritual counsel\\" of the organisation is provided by the 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje (India), Kunzing Shamar Rinpoche (India) and Jigme Rinpoche (France).Buddhism Foundation Diamond Way Charter Retrieved on 2009-30-01 Ideals Diamond Way describes itself as an adaptation of the Karma Kagyu tradition to Western culture without Tibetan customs and organisational structures.No Need for Too Much Tradition, lecture by Shamar Rinpoche, Vienna, September 1993 Retrieved on 2009-30-01 Ole Nydahl describes Diamond Way as a lay tradition offering methods for people who have jobs, partners, families and responsibilities. He states \\"...our work is grown on the basis of friendship and trust... since the Diamond Way teachings aim to bring freedom and independence, it is people who already have those qualities who are generally attracted to our centers.\\" He also says he is keen to avoid what were perceived to be the more exotic or ritualistic aspects of Tibetan Buddhism such as pujas sung in Tibetan with Tibetan musical accompaniment. In 1998 Ole Nydahl stated \\"I simply don‚Äôt want gifted and critical people who discover us to step right into the middle of a puja as has happened so often in the past. They then think they have landed with Catholics or some other sect and we won‚Äôt get a second chance to benefit them or their like-minded friends.\\" Instead, most meditation texts (except mantras) are translated and used in European languages.DWB in UK about meditations Retrieved on 2009-30-01 Practices The most important practice in Diamond Way Buddhism is considered to be identification with the teacher and following that to try to sustain the Mahamudra view and bring what is learned in meditation into daily life.Nydahl.

Available online and on YoutubeNydahl, Ole (2008) The Way Things are - A living Approach to Buddhism for today's world. O Books. Diamond Way Buddhism uses a variety of standard Vajrayana meditation methods found within the Karma Kagyu tradition. When the practitioners meet at lectures or for meditation they will typically do the \\"Guru Yoga meditation\\", (Skt. Guru yoga, Tib. Lame Naljor) where the practitioner identifies with the enlightened qualities of the teacher in order to develop these qualities. This is then followed by the \\"Invocation of Black Coat\\", sung in Tibetan. Like other Karma Kagyu practitioners, individuals then usually do a preliminary practice called the ng√∂ndro, consisting of 111,111 repetitions each of 4 different meditations, as given by the 9th Karmapa.Karmapa IX, The Mahamudra, Eliminating the Darkness of Ignorance LTWA. The ng√∂ndro must be completed before practitioners can move on to other practices. In most cases, following completion of ng√∂ndro, students practice a meditation on the Eighth Karmapa, Miky√∂ Dorje, called \\"The Guru Yoga in Four Sessions\\" (Tibetan Tun Shi Lame Naljor). Other practices include a variant of the meditation on Chenrezig (Sanskrit Avalokite≈õvara) composed by the 12th Century siddha Tang Tong Gyalpo and the phowa (transference of consciousness at the time of death).

Young David lived in Saudi Arabia during his father's 1967‚Äì1969 assignment as chief of the US Military Training Mission, headquartered in Dhahran. In this role, the elder Addington (promoted to brigadier general in 1965), was responsible for US training and security assistance programs for the Royal Saudi Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard. During the family's two-year stay in Saudi Arabia, David Addington (then 10 and 11 years old) was a student at the Dhahran Academy on the grounds of the US Consulate. Addington is married to Cynthia Mary Addington; the couple have three children. Previously, Addington had been married to Linda Werling, whom he met while the two were both attending Duke University. Education and career Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in 1992 Addington graduated from Sandia High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1974. He was admitted to United States Naval Academy and attended beginning in Fall 1974, but dropped out during his freshman year. He is a graduate of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University (B.S.F.S., summa cum laude) and holds a J.D. degree (with honors) from Duke University School of Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1981. Addington was an assistant general counsel for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1981 to 1984. From 1984 to 1987 he was counsel for the House committees on intelligence and foreign affairs. He served as a staff attorney on the joint US House‚ÄìSenate committee investigation of the Iran-Contra affair as an assistant to Congressman Bill Broomfield (R-MI). Books and news articles have said that he was one of the principal authors of a controversial minority report issued at the conclusion of the joint committee's investigation, which \\"defended President Reagan by claiming it was 'unconstitutional for Congress to pass laws intruding' on the 'commander in chief.'\\" but in his opening remarks as he testified under subpoena before the House Judiciary Committee, Addington said that he had left the committee's service before the minority report was written and had no role in it. Addington was also a special assistant for legislative affairs to President Ronald Reagan for one year in 1987, before becoming Reagan's deputy assistant. From 1989 to 1992, Addington served as special assistant to Cheney who was then the Secretary of Defense, before being appointed by President George H. W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate as the Department of Defense's general counsel in 1992. In 1993 and 1994, Addington was the Republican staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In 1994 and 1995, he headed a political action committee, the Alliance for American Leadership, set up to support Republican candidates for public office, with a principal focus on being a Presidential exploratory committee for Cheney, as the former Defense Secretary contemplated running for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination. From 1995 to 2001, he worked in private practice, for law firms Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz and Holland & Knight, and the American Trucking Associations. He also provided extensive assistance to Dick Cheney when the latter was chief executive officer of Halliburton Corporation and was in charge of vetting potential Presidential running mates for Texas governor George W. Bush, before he was officially his party's nominee for the White House and surprised many political observers by choosing Cheney himself to be his running mate. On April 13, 2013, Addington was on a list released by the Russian Federation of Americans banned from entering the country over their alleged human rights violations. The list was a direct response to the so-called Magnitsky list revealed by the United States the day before. Addington served as group vice president for research at The Heritage Foundation and as Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Chief Legal Officer at the National Federation of Independent Business. Vice President's office As counsel to the Vice President, Addington's duties involved protecting the legal interests of the Office of the Vice President. Although limited duties have been given under the Constitution, each vice president has a role in association with the president. As chief of staff, Addington supervised the Vice President's staff. In both roles, Addington also provided advice to the White House staff, as he had the additional role of Assistant to the President, as his predecessor Scooter Libby had likewise held. As vice presidential counsel, Addington is known for his focus on the constitutional independence of the Vice President. He tried to protect the inner workings of the Office of the Vice President from investigations by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and private organizations.Walker v. Cheney, 230 F. Supp. 2d 51 (D.D.C. 2002) (GAO); Cheney v. U.S. District Court, 542 U.S. 367 (2004) and In re Cheney, 406 F.3d 723 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Judicial Watch); In re Richard B. Cheney, Vice President, No. 08-5412 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington). After he began working for Cheney, Addington was influential in numerous policy areas. He provided advice and drafted memoranda on many of the most controversial policies of the Bush administration. Addington's influence strongly reflects his hawkish views on US foreign policy, a position he had apparently already committed to as a teenager during the late phase of the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. In his House Judiciary Committee testimony, Addington said that he applied three filters in formulating advice on the War on Terror: (i) comply with the Constitution, (ii) within the law, maximize the President's options, and (iii) ensure legal protection of military and intelligence personnel engaged in counterterrorism activities. Addington has consistently advocated that under the Constitution, the President has substantial and expansive powers as commander-in-chief during wartime, if need be. He is the legal force behind over 750 signing statements that President George W. Bush issued when signing bills passed by Congress, expanding the practice relative to other Presidents. Charlie Savage, the former national legal affairs writer for The Boston Globe who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on signing statements, quotes former associate White House counsel Brad Berenson saying that Addington \\"would dive into a 200-page bill like it was a four-course meal\\" as he crafted the statements. David Addington speaking to Vice President Cheney on September 11, 2001 A declassified CIA congressional briefing memo of February 4, 2003 states \\"The (CIA) General Counsel described the process by which the (enhanced interrogation) techniques were approved by a bevy of lawyers from the NSC, the Vice President‚Äôs office and the Justice Department,\\" which makes it likely that Addington was aware of the coercive methods if not one or more of the \\"torture memos\\" as well, although it is not clear exactly what the CIA memo meant by the word 'approved' as none of the lawyers mentioned was in the chain of command that approves CIA operations and the White House-level lawyers relied on Justice Department legal opinions rather than developing and issuing legal opinions of their own. Press reports have alleged that Addington helped to shape an August 2002 opinion from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that said torture might be justified in some cases, although John Yoo, author of many of the \\"Torture Memos\\", dismissed the notion of Addington's authorship of Department of Justice memos as \\"so erroneous as to be laughable.\\" US Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as Colin Powell's chief of staff when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff‚Äîat the same time Addington was Cheney's personal counsel as Secretary of Defense‚Äîand then later when Powell was Secretary of State, stated in an in-depth interview regarding extraordinary measures taken post 9/11: \\"The man who, to me, brings all of this together more than Cheney himself, because he has one foot in the legal camp‚Äîand I must admit it's a fairly brilliant foot‚Äîand he has one foot in the operator camp, that's David Addington.\\" President Hamid Karzai greeting David Addington in the Presidential Palace in Kabul, 2007 Press reports also state that Addington reportedly took a leading role in pressing for the use of torture (so-called \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\") for interrogations when a delegation of top Bush administration attorneys traveled to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in September 2002 to observe operations there, although Addington said that he could not recall this in his sworn House Judiciary Committee testimony. In congressional testimony, Addington has emphasized that \\"people out in the field, particularly the folks at the CIA, would not have engaged in their conduct and the head of the CIA would not have ordered them to engage in that conduct without knowing that the Attorney General of the United States or his authorized designee, which is what OLC is, has said this is lawful and they relied on that.\\" The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a narrative concerning the Office of Legal Counsel opinions on interrogations on April 17, 2009. The 6,700-page Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture, released in 2016, found the use of torture was both ineffective for gathering intelligence and had damaged America's standing in the world. Some press reports indicate that Addington advocated scaling back the authority of lawyers in the uniformed services; Addington in fact advocated merely that the civilian general counsels of the military departments be recognized as the chief legal officers of those departments. Shortly after September 26, 2002, a Gulfstream jet carrying Addington, Alberto Gonzales, CIA attorney John A. Rizzo, William Haynes II, two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, and the Office of Legal Counsel's Jack Goldsmith flew to Camp Delta to view the facility that held enemy combatants, including Mohammed al-Kahtani, then to Charleston, South Carolina, to view the facility that held enemy combatants, including Jos√© Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia, where they briefly viewed an enemy combatant on a videoscreen display. In November 2006, the German government received a complaint seeking the prosecution of Addington and 15 other current and former US government officials for alleged war crimes. The German Prosecutor General at the Federal Supreme Court declined to initiate proceedings on the complaint. According to Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel from 2003 to 2004, Addington once said that \\"we're one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious court,\\" referring to the secret United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees clandestine wiretapping. Goldsmith also noted that Addington was speaking sarcastically at the time.Goldsmith, Jack. The Terror Presidency. New York: W.W. Norton (2007) Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman writes that Addington was the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office. That area of the building was the site of a fire in December 2007. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell is alleged to have remarked in private, regarding who was responsible for the NSA wiretapping of US citizens without a warrant: \\"It's Addington,\\" and further, that \\"he doesn't care about the Constitution.\\" when speaking with friends at a Washington Redskins game. Jack Goldsmith has written that if Powell indeed made this remark, \\"he was wrong,\\" as Addington and Cheney \\"seemed to care passionately about the Constitution as they understood it.\\" Michael Kirk, director of the PBS Frontline documentary United States of Secrets, also claims that Addington was responsible for authorizing the NSA's mass surveillance program in his capacity as Vice President Dick Cheney's attorney. Further, it is alleged, at least during Cheney's term as Secretary of Defense from 1989‚Äì93, that Addington and Cheney were deeply and eagerly interested in the US Continuity of Operations Plan (CO-OP), to be used in the event of a nuclear attack on the US (and first partially implemented after 9/11/01). This plan is alleged to provide \\"enduring Constitutional government\\" under a \\"paramount unitary executive\\" with \\"cooperation from\\" Congress and the several Courts. This deep and eager interest in the CO-OP was reported by the New Yorker to extend to drills where Cheney spent his nights in a bunker, perhaps that \\"secure undisclosed location\\" which he was said to occupy following 9/11. Apparently Addington has taken this interest to the point where \\"For years, Addington has carried a copy of the US Constitution in his pocket; taped onto the back are photocopies of extra statutes that detail the legal procedures for Presidential succession in times of national emergency...\\" perhaps, even a national emergency that involves the CO-OP. Although press reports state that Addington consistently advocated the expansion of presidential powers and the unitary executive theory, a nearly absolute deference to the executive branch from Congress and the judiciary, Addington stated in his sworn House Judiciary Committee testimony that he intends the term \\"unitary executive\\" to refer to the provision of the Constitution that vests all \\"executive Power\\" in \\"a President\\" rather than in multiple officials or Congress. In a June 26, 2007 letter to Senator John Kerry, Addington asserted that by virtue of Executive Order 12958 as amended in 2003, the Office of the Vice President was exempt from oversight by the National Archives' Information Security Oversight Office for its handling of classified materials, which President George W. Bush confirmed to be the correct interpretation of his revised order. He had previously pushed for elimination of a presidentially-mandated position (as opposed to at the option of the Archivist) of director of the oversight office after a dispute over oversight of classified information. The story was broken after the Chicago Tribune noticed an asterisk in an ISOO report \\"that it contained no information from OVP.\\" Although a federal district judge initially ordered Addington to submit to a deposition in a lawsuit filed to protect Cheney's vice-presidential records from potential destruction under the provisions of the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overruled the federal district judge and held that Addington did not have to submit to the deposition.In re Richard B. Cheney, Vice President, No. 08-5412 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Addington, along with other officials, was mentioned by title in I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby Jr.'s indictment for five felony charges related to the Plame affair, regarding the leak of the identity of a CIA officer, and he testified at the Libby trial.Waas, M., ed., The United States v. I. Lewis Libby, New York: Union Square Press (2007), pp. 174‚Äì95. A PBS Frontline documentary \\"Cheney's Law\\" broadcast on October 16, 2007 detailed Addington's key role in Bush administration policy making, and noted that he declined to be interviewed regarding his thoughts on the limits of executive privilege. On June 26, 2008, Addington appeared to testify under subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee along with former Justice Department attorney John Yoo in a contentious hearing on detainee treatment, interrogation methods and the extent of executive branch authority. This testimony was Addington's only public statement during his eight years as Cheney's vice presidential counsel and chief of staff. Human Rights Watch and The New York Times editorial board have called for the investigation and prosecution of Addington \\"for conspiracy to torture as well as other crimes.\\" Spanish charges considered In March 2009 Baltasar Garz√≥n, a Spanish judge who has considered international war crimes charges against other high-profile figures, considered whether to allow charges made by Gonzalo Boye to be laid against Addington and five other former officials of the George W. Bush Presidency. Judge Garzon did not dismiss the complaint, but instead ordered the complaint assigned by lottery to another judge, who will then decide whether to pursue the complaint or not. Spanish Attorney General C√°ndido Conde-Pumpido \\"strongly criticized\\" the proceedings, labeling them a legal \\"artifice.\\" Conde-Pumpido recommended against prosecution due to lack of material responsibility on the part of the American officials.

Leontius translated and commented upon works of Euripides, Aristotle and Homer including the Odyssey and the Iliad into Latin and was the first professor of Greek in western Europe.  Biography  Calabria still had at this time, several centuries after the Norman conquest of the territory from the Byzantine Empire, a large if not majority Greek-speaking and Eastern Rite Christian population. The process of \\"Latinization\\", adoption of Latin for legal documents, and adoption of Romance-language dialects in popular speech ‚Äî was only definitively completed in the 1500s with the suppression of the Greek Basilian monasteries by Rome. Thus Pilatus is assumed by most scholars to have been an ethnic-Greek Calabrian. But the situation is confused by a famous letter from Petrarch to Boccaccio, in which he complains: It is unclear from this whether Pilatus was holding himself out as being from Greece proper, or Petrarch was unaware of the ethno-linguistic situation in Calabria. It is through this connection with Petrarch and Boccaccio, that the important contribution of Pilatus to the revival of Greek in Western scholarship was effected. He made a bald and almost word for word translation of Homer into Latin prose for Boccaccio, subsequently sent to Petrarch, who owed his introduction to the poet to Pilatus and was anxious to obtain a complete translation. Pilatus also furnished Boccaccio with some of the material for his genealogy of the gods (Genealogia deorum gentilium libri) which was, according to Edward Gibbon: \\"a work, in that age, of stupendous erudition, and which he ostentatiously sprinkled with Greek characters and passages, to excite the wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers.\\" Part 4, Ch. 66 online text Pilatus was killed when lightning struck a ship's mast while he was standing against it, on a voyage from Constantinople.

Early life  Jorge was born Guillermo Santana on 13 June 1951 in Autl√°n, in Jalisco, Mexico. His parents were Josefina and Jose Santana. Jose was a musician. Jorge started playing guitar in San Francisco when he was a teen.  Early career  At a young age Santana joined a rhythm and blues band called \\"The Malibus\\" which later became just \\"Malo.\\"  Later career  He was a member of the San Francisco-based, Latin-rock band Malo, who had a top twenty hit in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Suavecito\\" in 1972. He released two solo albums on Tomato Records, Jorge Santana and It's All About Love, featuring former Malo members. In the mid-1970s he played with the Fania All-Stars. The band, Malo, which means \\"bad\\" in Spanish, played a combination of laid-back fusion of jazz, rock and a variety of forms of Latin music, similar to the sound of Carlos Santana, his brother. The band's debut album, called \\"Malo\\" was released in 1972 and included the song \\"Suavecito\\". The song, which had a smooth, melodic sound, made it to No.18 on the Billboard singles chart, and became a popular song for fans of Latin rock. Malo played together for four years and produced four albums until they broke up and Santana embarked on a solo career and played with the New York-based band the Fania All-Stars. His distinctive guitar was a green Fender Stratocaster, acquired in the 1970s. After a long split, Santana toured with his brother, Carlos. The album Sacred Fire: Live in South America was recorded in Mexico City on this tour, featuring Jorge Santana, who played a personalized orange Paul Reed Smith guitar. In 1994 he recorded an album with his brother and Carlos Santana's nephew, Carlos Hernandez, called Santana Brothers.  Sound  According WBGO radio host, musician and band leader Bobby Sanabria Jorge Santana's sound can be summed up thus: > \\"Picture Blood Sweat & Tears fused with Chicago, fused with Afro-Cuban > rhythms and guitar driven rock. It was Santana on steroids.\\"  Personal life  He died in San Rafael, California of natural causes on 14 May 2020, aged 68. He was survived by his brother Carlos and another brother, Antonio. He also had four sisters: Lety Santana, Laura Porras, Irma Santana, and Maria Vrionis. He was married to Donna with whom he had a son, Anthony and a daughter, Michelle. He also had one grandson.

The former municipality existed from 1838 until 1964 and it encompassed all the lands surrounding the outer part of the large Nordfjorden on both sides of the fjord. Davik was located in parts of the present-day municipalities of Kinn, Bremanger, and Stad. The administrative center of the former municipality was the village of Davik which is located on the southern shore of the Nordfjorden, although some of the municipal services were based out of the village of Bryggja on the north side of the fjord, since that village was the largest village in Davik municipality. Davik Church was the main church for the municipality, and it was located in the village of Davik, in the central part of the municipality. Rugsund Church (in the village of Rugsund) served the western part of the municipality and √Ölfoten Church (in the village of √Ölfoten) served the eastern part of the municipality. Name The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Davik farm (), since the first Davik Church was located there. The first element () means \\"spear\\" and the last element () is identical with the word vik which means \\"inlet\\", so the name appears to be referring to the long, skinny spear-like shape of the local fjord. Historically, the municipal name was spelled Davigen or Davig, using the old spelling forms that have changed over time. History Davik was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1913, the Mettenes farm (population: 3, located on the south shore of the Nordfjorden in extreme eastern Davik) was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Gloppen. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Davik municipality ceased to exist and its territory was divided between the neighboring municipalities of Bremanger, Eid, and Kinn as follows: *The islands of Husev√•g√∏ya, Grind√∏ya, Gangs√∏ya, Ris√∏ya, and all of Davik that was north of the Nordfjorden and east of the village of Lefdal went to the new V√•gs√∏y municipality. The population of this area was 1,216 at the time of the merger. *All of Davik south of the Nordfjorden and all the islands that did not go to Kinn Municipality went to Bremanger Municipality. The population of this area was 1,567 at the time of the merger. *All of Davik north of the Nordfjorden and east of the village of Lefdal (including Lefdal) went to Eid Municipality. The population of this area was 654 at the time of the merger. Government =Municipal council= The municipal council of Davik was made up of 29 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The club's home ground is Bicentennial Park South, located in the suburb of Rockdale, New South Wales. History The Rockdale Ilinden Soccer Club was formed in 1969 by a group of Macedonian Australians who gave the team the name \\"Ilinden\\" which has special meaning for all Macedonians throughout history. The club's first President Simon Zipevski laid the foundations as did the late Vlade Temelkovski who was president in 1978. On the field, the highlights would have to be the grand final wins (of different leagues) in 1984, 2002 and 2006. The 1984 NSW First Division grand final team was coached by Ilija Takac, winning 3‚Äì2 over Inter Monaro at Marconi Stadium and is firmly entrenched in the memories of the Rockdale Ilinden supporters. It took 18 years for Rockdale Ilinden to rejoice another First Grade Grand Final victory. In 2002 the coaching team of Mile Todoroski and Bill Pilovski led the team to an amazing Premiership/Championship double with only 1 loss in 24 games. In the grand final, they would meet the Hajduk Wanderers (who Rockdale defeated 5 goals to 3 just two weeks earlier in the semi final) in very rainy and windy conditions at the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre. The team was captained by Spase Najdoski who scored the only goal in the game which in turn was the winning goal in the grand final in front of a crowd of 3000 at Melita Stadium. Four years later in 2006, Rockdale Ilinden would claim another grand final victory this time over Penrith Nepean United. Rockdale won 1‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 2000 at Melita Stadium. Penrith Nepean United would gain promotion to the New South Wales Premier League as Rockdale's application would be denied by Football NSW due to the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre not meeting specific stadium criteria for the Premier League. The Rockdale Ilinden Soccer Club has been led by a wide array of coaching identities over their history. Some of these coaches were great players in their playing days. Kaz Kulak, Archie Blue, Ilija Takac, Ati Abonyi, Ljubo Gojkovic, Geoff Hoggart, John Fleming (1980s), Ljubo Jancev, Bill Pilovski, Manfred Schaefer, Risto Gojkovski, Rale Rasic, Doug Utjesenovic, Bill Temelkovski, Bill Boskovski, Gerry Gomez (1990s), Mile Todoroski, Ivan Petkovic, Zlatko Nastevski and current coach Mike Grbevski. Mile Todorovski, the 2008 Super League Coach of the Year was announced as the new coach for the 2009 season with all members/guests and players welcoming the announcement. Lee Sterrey, formerly the coach of Marconi Stallions, replaced him for the 2011 Premier League season. Hugo Sanchez was also named as the new Youth League head coach. The Club Committee also announced STOBI Int. as the new supplier of the playing strip and accessories for the 2009 season and beyond. The 2009 Super League season officially began on 15 March 2009 with Rockdale Ilinden drawing 1‚Äì1 with the Northern Tigers at the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre. The club finished the season in first place on the ladder, claiming the Premiership and advancing to the finals. They were, however, eliminated during the preliminary final by the eventual champions Spirit FC 2 goals to nil. On 12 October 2009, Football NSW announced that the Rockdale City Suns would be promoted to the Premier League competition for the 2010 season. The 2013 season saw the appointment of Branko Culina as head coach, along with Ivan Petkovic as his assistant. The 2013 season has been the most successful season since promotion into the NSW Premier League, with the Rockdale City Suns finishing 4th in the regular season, beating Marconi Stallions, Sutherland Sharks and Sydney United on the road to the Grand Final, before going down to eventual winner, Bonnyrigg White Eagles, 1‚Äì0 in front of nearly 6,000 people at Penrith (Centrebet) Stadium. The 2014 season saw the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre hosted the inaugural launch of the Westfield FFA Cup on 24 February. On the field, the Suns finished in 5th place, bowing out to Sydney Olympic 2‚Äì1 in the first week of the finals. In 2015, Rockdale parted ways with Branko Culina after an indifferent start to the NPL NSW season, appointing the experienced player Paul Reid as player/coach. The side finished in 6th place, narrowly missing out on a finals spot. The turn of fortunes since his appointment saw Paul Reid retain the head coach role for the 2016 season, helped by assistant Matthew Ribarovski. In 2016, the club finished the regular season in 4th position before losing their semifinal to Bonnyrigg White Eagles. In 2017, the club finished the regular season in third position and eventually missed out on a grand final position following a penalty shoot-out loss to eventual winners Manly United. The club finished the season in third position in the NPL NSW 1 club championship as a result of its under 18's finishing the regular season in 2nd position, under 20s in 6th position, and first grade finishing in first grade. FFA Cup In 2015, Rockdale City Suns qualified for the Round of 32 of the FFA Cup for the first time - beating Rydalmere Lions, Arncliffe Aurora, Sydney University and Sutherland Sharks, and drawing Perth Soccer Club in the National Round of 32, played at the Ilinden Sports Centre on 5 August 2015. Rockdale came out on top that night in front of over 1,800 supporters, winning 3‚Äì1 with goals to Toufic Alameddine, Dylan Macallister and Marko Jesic. Rockdale then drew the A-League club Melbourne Victory in the Round of 16. The match was moved to Jubilee Oval due to insufficient lighting at Ilinden Sports Centre. On 1 September 2015, an official crowd of 4,165 packed the Western and Southern stands of Jubilee Oval in a match that was broadcast live on Foxtel, with Melbourne Victory eventually coming out on top 3‚Äì2 in a tight match. Rockdale City Suns failed to make the Round of 32 in 2016 or 2017. In 2018, Rockdale City Suns qualified for the Round of 32 again - beating Glebe Wanderers, Bankstown United, Sydney United 58 and Blacktown City. On 1 August 2018, they faced the A-League club Sydney FC (the then FFA Cup holders and Minor Premiers from the previous A-League season) in the Round of 32. Rockdale utilised enhanced lighting to be able to play at Ilinden Sports Centre. The match was broadcast live on Foxtel and a crowd of 4,489 packed into the Ilinden Sports Centre. Although Rockdale scored the first goal, Sydney FC won 4‚Äì2 in the end. Colours and badge The primary club colours of Rockdale Ilinden are red and black with a secondary, less-used colour of white. The Rockdale Ilinden badge has evolved over time from the early years of the club's founding in 1969. The current club badge which has been in use for some 25 years, contains the Vergina Sun, a symobol of the Argead Dynasty, an ancient Macedonian royal house of Dorian Greek provenance, with the centre disc replaced by a traditional black and white soccer ball surrounded by the name of the club. Stadium From its founding in 1969 through to 2009, the Club played their home games at the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre, except during 2001, when the proximity of construction of the M5 East Freeway caused them to relocate their home games to John Crehan Park in Wollongong, New South Wales. The club continued to enjoy considerable support during this time, due in part to the size of the ethnic Macedonian community in the Illawarra Region. In 2008, the club announced that they would be moving 1 km south from the Rockdale Ilinden Sports Centre to Bicentennial Park South in Rockdale. Bicentennial Park South was to be transformed into a new football ground meeting the stadium standards of Football NSW, with new turf laid, an underground irrigation system installed, and a new clubhouse and facilities building constructed. On Saturday, 12 December 2009, the club officially opened its new facilities at Bicentennial Park South. The Ilinden Sports Centre comprises a large modern club house, undercover seating for 1000 spectators, floodlighting to enable night matches to be played, and a state- of-the-art pop-up sprinkler system for the playing field. On Wednesday 7 October, Rockdale City Council announced they would install a synthetic surface at Ilinden Sports centre, with a likely completion date scheduled for the start of the 2017 season. In February 2018, the synthetic playing surface was officially opened, the first of its kind in the St. George area. Youth teams and Juniors occupy the nearby sporting fields of Bicentennial Park East, which adjoins the main ground of the club by a footbridge. In 2017, the Club fielded over 500 registered players in local SGFA competitions. Chairman and coaches The current president of the club is Dennis Loether. The current first grade coach is Steve Zoric, assisted by Jane Talcevski. The current 20s coach is Stamati Glaros, and the 18's coach is Michael Grbevski. The club's technical director is Mr. Matthew Ribarovski. The previous chairman was Paul Goreski.

He was born at Karlberg Castle, Stockholm on 21 March 1833 and died at Fr√∂sundavik near Stockholm on 13 June 1878. He was the son of architect, author and officer Carl St√•l then Colonel, Swedish Corps of Engineers. He matriculated at Uppsala University in 1853, studying medicine and passing the medico-philosophical examination in 1857. He then turned to entomology and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Jena in 1859. The same year he became assistant to Carl Henrik Boheman in the Zoological department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, where, in 1867, he was appointed keeper with the title of professor. He made collecting trips in Sweden and throughout Europe and visited other museums including the collection of Johan Christian Fabricius in Kiel. His study of the Fabrician types resulted in his \\"Hemiptera Fabriciana\\". A significant part of St√•l's work was the study of insects collected from Caffraria, the majority of which were poorly understood at the time. Although St√•l, who was regarded as the world's foremost worker on Hemiptera, published most on this order, he also worked on Orthoptera and to a lesser extent on Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, naming well over 1000 new genera and over 1500 new species over his brief career. In 1869, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Works (selection) * St√•l. 1860. Bidrag till Rio Janeiro-traktens Hemipter-fauna.

Life He had a sound vernacular education, with a smattering of English received in Bombay. At the age of fifteen he entered upon a business career, and its pursuit proved so congenial that by 1827 he had worked his way to a partnership in the firm of Frith, Bomanjee & Co. Banking facilities being then exceedingly scanty, such Parsees as had any capital at command acted as bankers and brokers to the rising English firms. Patel's experience enabled him in a few years to raise the status of his compatriots to the higher level of independent merchants, and he founded in 1844 a business house under the name of Wallace & Co., in which he was himself a partner with the English members of the firm. When he retired in 1858 he had amassed a large competence, and in the following year he established a firm on the same lines under the style of Framjee, Sands & Co., of which the members were some of his sons, together with English partners. It was, however, not so much for his success as a merchant, as for his spirit and liberality as an educationist, reformer and philanthropist, that his name is notable in the annals of western India. He entered on his civic labors in 1837, and in all public movements figured prominently as an accredited representative of his community. As a pioneer of education, both for boys and girls, his example inspired the younger men of his time, like Dadabhai Naoroji, at one time Member of Parliament (MP) for Finsbury Central, and Naoroji Fardoonjee and Sorabjee Shapurjee Bengallee. When Mountstuart Elphinstone, during his governorship, conceived the idea of concentrating the literary and educational activity which had arisen from isolated efforts on the part of men who had themselves been brought into contact with Western culture, among his chief collaborators were Framjee Cowasjee Banajee and Framjee Patel. To their initiative was due the establishment of the Elphinstone Institution, which comprised a high school and, after some years, a college, which continue to hold the foremost rank among the similar academies since established in western India. But Mr Patel's most remarkable public service was performed in connection with the Parsee Law Association, of which he was president. Since their exodus from Persia, the domestic affairs of the Parsees had been in a very unsettled state. Matrimonial obligations and the rights of succession in cases of intestacy had fallen into hopeless confusion, and the adjudication of disputes in relation thereto was effected by certain elders of the community, who had neither the knowledge and help of fixed principles to guide their judgments, nor any authority to enforce their decisions. The case of Ardesir Cursetjee v. Peeroxebai, which came up on appeal before the privy council in England, brought to light the strange fact that even the supreme court of Bombay had no jurisdiction over matrimonial and ecclesiastical disputes among Parsees. This state of lawlessness was recognized by that community as intolerable, and the agitation which ensued thereupon led to the appointment of a commission, of which the distinguished jurist, Sir Joseph Arnould, was the president and Framjee Patel the chief Parsee member. The Parsee Law Association, under the guidance of Patel and Sorabjee Bengallee, rendered invaluable help to the commission, and their joint efforts resulted in the passing by the government of India of the Parsee Marriage and Divorce Act and the Parsee Intestate Succession Act (15 and 21 of 1865). These acts form the charter of matrimonial and ecclesiastical status for the Parsees. At the time of his death in 1894, at the ripe age of nearly ninety years, Framjee Patel was the most revered and best beloved of the distinguished natives of India, having during an eventful public life extending over sixty years worked in co- operation with three generations of the most prominent of his compatriots to better the condition of their country. His family surname refers to the title of Patel, that is, \\"mayor,\\" of Bombay, conferred on its founder for services rendered to the English in 1692.

He is widely known for writing the first complete scientific description of dentistry, Le Chirurgien Dentiste (\\"The Surgeon Dentist\\"), published in 1728. The book described basic oral anatomy and function, signs and symptoms of oral pathology, operative methods for removing decay and restoring teeth, periodontal disease (pyorrhea), orthodontics, replacement of missing teeth, and tooth transplantation. Biography =Early years= Fauchard was born in a very modest home in Saint-Denis-de-Gastines in 1678. In 1693 he joined the French Royal Navy at the age of 15, much to his family's distress, and came under the influence of Alexander Poteleret, a surgeon major, who had spent considerable time studying diseases of the teeth and mouth. During that time, Fauchard learned that sailors who were on long voyages suffered severely from dental ailments, scurvy in particular. Eventually Major Poteleret inspired and encouraged him to read and carefully investigate the findings of his predecessors in the healing arts. He said he wanted to disseminate the knowledge he learned at sea based on actual practice. This idea led Fauchard to become a combat medic as Poteleret's prot√©g√©. =Life as young dentist= Dental needle-nose pliers designed by Fauchard in the late 17th century to use in prosthodontics. Once Fauchard left the navy, he shortly settled down in Angers, where he practiced medicine at the University of Angers Hospital. In Angers, he started much of the revolutionary medical work we know today, and he was the pioneer of scientific oral and maxillofacial surgery. Fauchard often described himself as a \\"Chirurgien Dentiste\\" (surgical dentist), a term very rare at the time as dentists in the 17th century generally extracted decayed teeth rather than treating them. Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was considered a highly skilled surgeon by many of his colleagues at Angers University Hospital. Fauchard made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from watch makers, jewelers and even barbers, that he thought could be used in dentistry. Fauchard introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities. He asserted that sugar derivate acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay, and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth, in the gums, could appear in the later stages of tooth decay. Fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone and those artificially-made dental pieces would be useful as the natural ones. One of this methods stated that the artificial teeth would be held in place by tying them to the remaining solid teeth by pivots, using waxed thread or gold wire. He also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces.

During that time he spent long periods away from home studying and sharing his medical practice with other surgeons across France. In 1718, Fauchard moved to Paris. During his stay in that city, Pierre realized that many medical libraries lacked good textbooks on dentistry and that an encyclopedic teaching book of oral surgery was needed, so he made the decision to write a professional dentist's treatise based on his medical experience. For many months Fauchard gathered as many medical research books as he could, interviewed the many dentists he had met, and reviewed his personal diaries during his years at Angers to write his manual. Finally in 1723, at the age of 45, he completed the first 600-page manuscript for \\"Le Chirurgien Dentiste\\" (roughly translated as \\"The Surgical Dentist\\"). Fauchard sought further feedback from his peers over the next five years, and the manuscript had grown to 783 pages by the time it was published in 1728 in two volumes. The book was well received in the European medical community. A German translation was already available in 1733, an enlarged edition in French was published in 1746, yet an English translation had to await 200 more years to 1946. \\"The surgical dentist\\" Portrait' of the 1728 version of Doctor Fauchard's book, the \\"Surgical dentist\\". The book consisted of 38 chapters in volume 1 and 26 chapters in volume 2. Both volumes contained 42 plates depicting surgical instruments and appliances. Many of the ideas introduced in the book were totally new to dentistry. Pierre Fauchard engraved in his books many of his inventions of instruments made for oral surgery, such as the obturator and the now famous dentist's drill. The drill Fauchard developed was manual and powered by a catgut twisted around a cylinder. He also suggested in his book that oil of cloves and cinnamon be used for pulpitis. Fauchard recommended that human urine be used in the treatment of early stages of caries. A chemical compound that he was not able to identify in urine at the time was ammonia, which was responsible for the \\"beneficial result\\" of urine. Although urine had been used for this purpose since the ancient times to Middle Ages, the treatment met with resistance by many physicians and patients. =Highlights= * Fauchard suggested that the German tooth worm theory was mistaken in its explanation of dental decay. His observations through the microscope showed there was no evidence of worms. * He also said the cause of dental caries was sugar, and people should limit it from their diet. * He disproved theories of spontaneous tooth generation, arguing that the first teeth, which are called milk teeth, separate themselves from their roots. Some dentists at Fauchard's time believed they didn't have roots. * He introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities, and he suggested amalgams like lead, tin and sometimes gold. He also said that teeth should be cleaned periodically by a dentist. * He said that braces should be used to correct the position of teeth, and that children's teeth could be moved more easily and quickly than adults', a result of the size of the teeth roots, according to Fauchard. * He was ahead of his time in medical practice and he described the way the patient should be greeted by the doctor and the position in which the patient should sit. * He recommended that the dentist should stand behind the patient to help them relax, and he introduced the concept of dentist's chair light. * Yet, he recommended that one gargle twice a day with freshly collected urine (\\"..se rinser la bouche tous les matins, & m√™me le soir, avant que de se coucher, avec quelques cuiller√©es de son urine tout nouvellement rendu√´...\\" />Fauchard, Pierre, Le Chirurgien Dentiste, 1746, Vol. 1, Chapter 9, p.167 Late 17th-century surgical instruments made by Pierre Fauchard during his research in oral surgery, (from left to right) a saw, two kinds of forceps, (bottom from left to right) two kinds of files and a gimlet. Final days In his book and all his life Fauchard denounced the quackery and fraud of dental charlatans and their exploitation of patients. Pierre advised his students and friends of the highly injurious techniques used by charlatans and to avoid them. He warned his medical readers that nitric acid and sulfuric acid on teeth to remove tartar used by charlatans were potentially dangerous and explained how to identify their false dental fillings. One of the first physicians to denounce medical malpractice in dentistry, he alleged to a tribunal that many dentists in France did not have a degree or experience. Fauchard became a model for all dentists to come. He died at the age of 83 in Paris on March 22, 1761. Legacy Doctor Fauchard's late 17th century dentist's drill. Fauchard's work influenced many young medical minds in the age of enlightenment in France, Robert Bunon (1702‚Äì1748), a dentist like Fauchard, spent many years of his life in enamel hypoplasia research. Etienne Bourdet (1722‚Äì1789), who is said to be one of France's best dentists after Fauchard, based his work mainly on dental prosthesis (a concept introduced by Pierre), he also improved the way the amalgams were made and was the first physician to do gingivectomy on his patients when required. The American 19th- century dentist Chapin A. Harris often quoted him and said that \\"considering the circumstances and limitations of his time, he will always be remembered as a pioneer and founder of modern dentistry.\\" Although Fauchard's famous dental treatise on dentistry was published in the 18th century, it was not until 1946 when Lilian Lindsay a medical science historian published a translation in the English language. The Pierre Fauchard Academy of dentistry, founded in 1936, was named after him.

He spent his childhood in Duisburg.\\"Biographical overview\\", peterlindbergh.net. Accessed 16 November 2011. As a teenager, he worked as window dresser for the Karstadt and Horten department stores in Duisburg. Coming from a part of Germany close to the Dutch border, North Rhine-Westphalia, he spent summer holidays with his family in the Netherlands on the coast near Noordwijk. The vast beaches and the industrial settings of his hometown Duisburg, influenced his work strongly over the years. In the early 1960s, he moved to Lucerne and months later to Berlin where he enrolled in the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts. He hitchhiked to Arles in the footsteps of his idol, Vincent van Gogh. Lindbergh recalled these years: \\"I preferred actively seeking out van Gogh‚Äôs inspirations, my idol, rather than painting the mandatory portraits and landscapes taught in art schools\\". After several months in Arles, he continued through to Spain and Morocco, a journey which took him two years. Returning to Germany, he studied abstract art at the Kunsthochschule (College of Art) in Krefeld, North Rhine- Westphalia, with G√ºnther C. Kirchberger. Influenced by Joseph Kosuth and the conceptual art movement, he was invited in 1969, before graduating, to present his work at the avant-garde Galerie Denise Ren√©. These works were exhibited in the Objets ludiques exhibition at the Tinguely Museum in Basel in 2014. After moving to D√ºsseldorf in 1971, he turned his attention to photography and worked for two years assisting German photographer Hans Lux, before opening his own studio in 1973. Becoming well known in his native country, he joined the Stern magazine family along with photographers Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin and Hans Feurer.\\"Peter Lindbergh\\", in Photo Box: Bringing the Great Photographers into Focus (London: Thames & Hudson, 2009; ), p.414.Peter Lindbergh: Images of Women\\" (Germany: Snoeck, 2008; ), p.95. Photography In 2014 Lindbergh said: \\"This should be the responsibility of photographers today to free women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection.\\" In 2016, Lindbergh declared that \\"A fashion photographer should contribute to defining the image of the contemporary woman or man in their time, to reflect a certain social or human reality. How surrealistic is today's commercial agenda to retouch all signs of life and of experience, to retouch the very personal truth of the face itself?\\" The journalist Suzy Menkes wrote that \\"Refusing to bow to glossy perfection is Peter Lindbergh's trademark ‚Äì the essence of the images that look into each person's unvarnished soul, however familiar or famous the sitter\\".

Around the same time, Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace featured the new supermodels who had been featured two years earlier in Lindbergh's photographs, for his Fall‚ÄìWinter 1991 fashion show. In a 2008 interview with art historian Charlotte Cotton, he explained: > Using black-and-white photography was really important to creating the > supermodel.

Lindbergh's first book, 10 Women (1996) had sold more than 100,000 copies as of 2008. He twice photographed the Pirelli calendar, in 1996 and 2002. The latter, which used actresses instead of models for the first time, was shot on the back lot of Paramount Studios,Pit Lane News, Pirelli Calendar, Fastdates.com and was described by art critic Germaine Greer as \\"Pirelli's most challenging calendar yet.\\"Germaine Greer, \\"Get your kit on\\" , The Guardian, 13 November 2001 Lindbergh was the first photographer in the fifty- year history of the Pirelli calendar to be invited to photograph it for a third time (for the 2017 edition).

Although the description of Crohn's disease is by far his most famous accomplishment, Crohn had a long career both as a clinician and as a researcher who contributed to modern understanding of many gastrointestinal conditions. __TOC__  Life and work  Crohn received his bachelor's degree from City College of New York in 1902. He received a medical degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1907. Crohn first became an intern at Mount Sinai Hospital, in 1907. He was promoted to head of gastroenterology in 1920, the same year he joined the staff of Columbia University. Working with colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital, Crohn identified fourteen patients whose symptoms and intestinal abnormalities discovered at surgery, while consistent with each other, did not fit any previously identified disease. Crohn, along with Leon Ginzburg and Gordon Oppenheimer, prepared the classic paper describing this new condition. This paper was read at a professional meeting in May 1932 and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 1932. The title of the published paper was \\"Regional Ileitis: A Pathologic and Clinical Entity\\". Crohn's work helped correct the thinking that the ailment was actually a form of tuberculosis rather than an inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's work built on the work of Dr. Kennedy Dalziel of Glasgow into regional enteritis twenty years earlier. Crohn always preferred the medically descriptive terms \\"regional ileitis\\" and \\"regional enteritis\\" to \\"Crohn's disease\\", but he was not able to prevent the appropriation of his name for the disease. Some of Crohn's initial research into the causes of the Crohn's disease was centered around his personal conviction that it was caused by the same pathogen, a bacterium called Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (MAP), responsible for the similar condition that afflicts cattle called Johne's disease. However, he was unable to isolate the pathogen‚Äîmost likely because M. paratuberculosis sheds its cellular wall in humans and takes the form of a spheroplast, making it virtually undetectable under an optical microscope. This theory has resurfaced in recent years and has been lent more credence with the arrival of more sophisticated methods of identifying MAP bacteria. Crohn noted that it can be difficult for physicians to correctly differentiate neuroses from diseases of the organs. He said that all doctors will occasionally mistake diseases of the organs for neuroses or vice versa. For most of his long career, Crohn had a private practice in New York City and was associated chiefly with The Mount Sinai Hospital. At Mount Sinai, he worked with the neurologist Bernard Sachs (1858‚Äì1944). He also spent time working with Jesse Shapiro, M.D., another doctor very involved with Crohn's research. As Dr. Shapiro had been diagnosed with Crohn's himself, he had a born devotion to curing the disease. Crohn soon built a very large and successful practice in gastroenterology, specializing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease. He was elected president of the American Gastroenterological Association in 1932. He received numerous awards and professional honors, wrote extensively for doctors and the general public, and was asked to consult on high-profile patients from all over the US and abroad, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. During his career, Crohn wrote three books, Affections of the Stomach (1927), Understand Your Ulcer (1943), and Regional Ileitis (1947, second edition 1958). He also wrote more than 100 articles for professional journals. When asked why he went into medicine, Crohn said he wanted to help his father, Theodore, who suffered from severe indigestion.  Personal life  Crohn married Lucile Pels in 1912, and had two children, Edward Crohn (1917-2013), a physician, and Ruth Crohn Dickler (1914-2016) a New York City resident, known for her philanthropy. They divorced in 1927. He later married Rose Blumenthal in 1948. In addition to practicing medicine, Crohn enjoyed painting and studying the history of the American Civil War. Crohn's watercolors were frequently displayed in galleries in New Milford, Connecticut. Crohn practiced medicine until he was 90, splitting time in his later years between the Upper East Side of Manhattan and a country home in New Milford, Connecticut. The Burrill B. Crohn Research Foundation was established at Mount Sinai in 1983 with initial funding from Rose Crohn and later his daughter, Ruth Crohn Dickler.  Sources  *Crohn BB, Ginzburg L, Oppenheimer GD.

Despite being surrounded on all sides by higher fells (the Loweswater Fells, the High Stile Ridge and the Grasmoor Group), it stands in isolation. It is surrounded on three sides by a \\"moat\\" of deep marshy land, and on the east side by the lake of Crummock Water. The fell forms a partnership with the lake, running parallel to it, falling sheer into it, and regularly providing the backdrop for pictures of it. Name Mellbreak's name is derived from differing sources: the Celtic \\"moel\\", meaning \\"bare hill\\", and the later Old Norse of the Vikings, \\"brekka\\", which means a hill slope. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Mellbreak and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm. The Loweswater Fells have been compared to the digits of a hand, radiating out south westward from the \\"palm\\" centred on Loweswater village. From the west these are Burnbank Fell, Blake Fell, Gavel Fell, Hen Comb and Mellbreak, the \\"thumb\\". To continue the hand metaphor, the opposing thumb of Mellbreak is the tenuous northern extremity of Starling Dodd, whilst the other Loweswater Fells are satellites of Great Borne. The fell has been likened (by Alfred Wainwright and others) to the shape of an upturned boat, having north and south tops of roughly equal height and a wide flat depression in between. On the eastern side the steep slopes run down directly to the shore of Crummock Water. Low Ling Crag, a rocky projection into the lake, is a continuation of outcrops higher up. Other crags rim the depression between the two tops. The southern boundary is formed by Scale Beck and its tributary Black Beck. Mellbreak has a third much lower top overlooking this steep sided valley, Scale Kott (1,109 ft). At the head of Black Beck is the connection to Starling Dodd, running south west from Scale Knott. This could hardly be considered a ridge in walking terms, since it begins at the foot of an 800 ft scree slope on the northern flank of Starling Dodd. To the west of Mellbreak is the marshy valley of Mosedale, its beck flowing north to Loweswater village. On the other side is the parallel ridge of Hen Comb. The northern end of Mellbreak rises direct from the valley behind the village, precipitous like a sand castle on a flat beach. From this vantage point its steep gabled profile is an arresting sight. The successive rock tiers of White, Dropping and Raven Crags complete the picture. Geology Mellbreak is formed primarily from the laminated mudstone and siltstone of the Kirkstile Formation. There is an intrusion of basalt on the Crummock face and the southern end around Scale Knott exhibit the Buttermere Formation. This is an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone. The rocks of Hen Comb are of the Kirkstile Formation, laminated mudstone and siltstone, often associated with the Skiddaw group.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There are two small trials for iron, one on each side of the fell. Neither penetrates for more than a few feet.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit Although the south top is slightly higher, at 512 m (1,680 ft) it is the north top (509 m, 1,670 ft) that is the better summit, being rocky and situated on the top of the crags that make up the north face of the fell. Both carry substantial cairns, that of the true summit being on grass. The views are good from both summits, a consequence of Mellbreak's isolation and great relative height. The north top brings the Solway Firth into view, but otherwise the differences are mainly confined to the foreground. Grasmoor and Rannerdale Knotts look impressive across the lake, an unexpected glimpse of the Helvellyn range seen behind. Ascents Mellbreak seen from the Kirkstile Inn, in Loweswater village A popular route up the fell is a path from the village of Loweswater, that threads its way between the crags and rocky outcrops on the north side. The north top is then traversed to reach the summit. A variation misses out the north top, following a slanting path southwards along the Mosedale face to the depression. From the shore of Crummock Water an ascent can be made following Pillar Rake, a diagonal breach in the central rim of crag. A direct climb of the south top direct is best achieved from Buttermere village, starting along the Scale Force path before making for Scale Knott.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Marilyns of England Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Allerdale ","title":"Mellbreak"},{"id":"3020503","text":"Nightshade, released in Japan as Kunoichi (\\"Female Ninja\\"), stylized in both regions with the kanji Âøç behind the title, is an action video game for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), developed by Overworks and published by Sega in 2003. It is the 11th game in the Shinobi series and follows the exploits of a female ninja named Hibana. The game is a sequel to the 2002 PS2 game Shinobi.  Story  In Nightshade, the player plays as Hibana, a female counterpart to Shinobis Hotsuma. She is a government-employed ninja tasked with the elimination of members of the Nakatomi Corporation, which has unwittingly unleashed hellspawn upon futuristic Tokyo. She is also ordered to recover the shards of \\"Akujiki\\", the legendary cursed sword that Hotsuma used to seal the hellspawn the last time. = Characters = * : :The main character, Hibana was born to a branch family of the Oboro lineage, but due to being a girl, she was not allowed to vie for leadership of the clan, and was put up for adoption at an early age to a branch of the Oboro. She is a jaded ninja who was abandoned by Jimushi and now works for the government. The government modeled her sword and outfit after Hotsuma's, the main character of the previous game. Hibana also appears in the 3DS crossover role-playing game Project X Zone 2. * : :The Shinobi of Earth and Hibana's former master.

He is attracted to Hibana and wants her to kill him. * : :The Shinobi of Water and the third Shinobi who confronts Hibana. She is Jimushi's new apprentice and is essentially Hibana's replacement. However, she despises Hibana because Jimushi prefers her. * :Voiced by: Toshitsugu Takashina (Alpha, Japanese), Masao Harada (Beta, Japanese), Hiroshi Iida (Final, Japanese), Casey Robertson (English) :The antagonist, a robotic ninja created by the Nakatomi group ordered to work with Jimushi and retrieve pieces of Akujiki. Although a soulless robot, he begins to have his own agenda with each piece of Akujiki he absorbs.  Gameplay  Nightshade's missions are linear, and each one culminates in a battle against a challenging boss opponent. The core of Nightshade's gameplay is hack and slash, with accumulating combos on spawning enemies about the level. Using Hibana's arsenal of a katana (the primary weapon), short daggers (achieve less damage, but score a higher combo multiplier), shuriken (long range projectiles), and various ninjutsu spells, the game challenges the player to achieve as high a score as possible while eliminating the opposing threat. Nightshade also includes aspects of platforming. With Hibana's ability to dash in mid-air, the game requires the player to use this ability to bypass holes and hazards. Game mechanics restrict Hibana to only a double-jump and an air-dash before she falls, requiring the player to strike enemies in mid-flight to stay in the air. By doing this, the player combines accuracy and timing to stay in the air continuously, or fall to their death. If the player has a completed save file from Shinobi then Hotsuma, the protagonist of the previous game, is available as an optional playable character. He differs from Hibana in that he does not use daggers like her and is only able to use Akujiki, the sword he used in the previous game. Hotsuma plays exactly as before with the same arsenal of moves and operates under the same mechanics as he did in the previous game. He must always be finding and defeating enemies to feed their souls to Akujiki, or the cursed sword will devour his soul instead and kill him. Development = Soundtrack = The Nightshade soundtrack is based upon the Japanese techno of the previous iteration, Shinobi. All tracks were produced by Fumie Kumatani, Tomonori Sawada, Keiichi Sugiyama, Yutaka Minobe, Teruhiko Nakagawa, and Masaru Setsumaru of Sega Digital Studio. Nightshade did not see an official soundtrack release until July 2014, where it was released digitally on Amazon Music and iTunes. Reception Nightshade received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one nine and three eights for a total of 33 out of 40.

It is native to the borders of the Pacific, including South and North America, Papua New Guinea and Australasia. It has been introduced elsewhere, including Europe. Species vary in their growth habits, many being vines or shrubs. In some environments, rampant species can become weedy and difficult to eradicate. Description Species of Muehlenbeckia vary considerably in their growth habits; they may be perennials, vinelike, or shrubs. All have rhizomatous roots. Their leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, usually with stalks (petioles), but sometimes stalkless (sessile). The brownish ocrea is short and tubular, soon disintegrating. The inflorescences may be terminal or axillary, and are in the form of spikes or clusters, with at most very short peduncules (flowering stems). Individual flowers have pedicels (stalks). The flowers may be bisexual or unisexual, with sometimes a mixture of staminate, pistillate and bisexual flowers on the same plant. There are five white to greenish white tepals, joined at the base. Staminate flowers have 8 (sometimes 9) stamens and a rudimentary pistil. Pistillate flowers have rudimentary stamens and three spreading styles. The fruit is in the form of a black or dark brown unwinged achene, three-sided to more or less globe-shaped, at least partly enclosed by the persistent tepals. Taxonomy The genus was erected by Carl Meissner in 1841, initially for two species that he distinguished from Coccoloba and Polygonum. The generic name honours Alsatian bryologist Heinrich Gustav M√ºhlenbeck (1798‚Äì1845). Muehlenbeckia is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera Reynoutria and Fallopia s.s., forming the so-called \\"RMF clade\\". =Species= , Plants of the World Online recognized 24 species (see note below): * Muehlenbeckia adpressa (Labill.)

It is a pool-type TRIGA Mark I reactor, built by General Atomics in 1968 and operated since then under licence from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Maximum thermal output is 250 kW. The reactor has over 1,000 visitors each year and serves the Reed College departments of Physics and Chemistry, as well as other departments. Operation RRR is the only research reactor in the world that is owned and operated by an undergraduate educational institution. It is operated and maintained by undergraduate college students under the supervision of a director and operations manager who are members of the college staff. The facility provides scientific irradiation services to a broad community outside the college, but its primary mission is for student initiated research, training, and hands-on education. The Reed Research Reactor is intended to produce thermal neutrons. It is used primarily for neutron activation to produce radioisotopes or analyze composition of material samples. Undergraduate leadership The RRR distinguishes itself from other university research reactors by the fact that it is the only reactor run completely by undergraduate students and serves undergraduate degree programs almost exclusively. In fact, Reed College does not have any nuclear engineering or even any engineering program. The facility is used in research projects, often conducted by the campus itself. As of November 2018, there are approximately 40 students licensed to operate the reactor. In order to obtain such a license, students must attend a year of seminars on nuclear safety followed by an exam administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. When the facilities were visited by ABC's \\"Radioactive Roadtrip\\" Primetime special, the fact that the school had no Engineering program was purported as evidence that university reactors are sometimes kept as more of a status symbol than as a valid research tool. This is a quote from the ABC website: > University Reaction: The reactor is a \\"zero-risk facility,\\" and there is no > plausible way it is a threat, said Edward Hershey, director of public > affairs at Reed College. Although the school has no nuclear engineering > department ‚Äî or any engineering department for that matter ‚Äî chemistry and > physics students use it as a resource. Hershey said the reactor is a > \\"bragging point\\" for Reed. \\"It's just a neat facility,\\" he said. The \\"zero-risk facility\\" comment reflects the reactor design which is a pin- type Low Enriched Uranium natural circulation driven LWR, with a very strong negative temperature coefficient. As such, it is impossible to overheat the reactor, even in the case of a sudden reactivity insertion. Irradiation facilities Irradiation facilities include equipment that is used to place, move, and organize samples that are to be irradiated. =Pneumatic transfer system= The pneumatic transfer system (known colloquially as the \\"rabbit system\\") consists of an irradiation chamber in the outer ring of the core with its associated pump and piping. This allows samples to be transferred in and out of the reactor core very rapidly, while the reactor is at power. Routine use of the pneumatic transfer system involves placing samples into vials, which in turn are placed in special capsules known as ‚Äúrabbits.‚Äù The capsule is loaded into the system in the radiochemistry laboratory next to the reactor and is then transferred pneumatically into the core-irradiation position for a predetermined time. At the end of this period, the sample is transferred back to the receiving terminal, where it is removed for measurement. The transfer time from the core to the terminal is less than seven seconds, making this method of irradiating samples particularly useful for experiments involving radioisotopes with short half-lives. The flux in the core terminal is approximately 5x1012 n/cm2/s when the reactor is at full power. =Rotating specimen rack= The rotating specimen rack (lazy susan) is located in a well on top of the graphite reflector which surrounds the core. The rack consists of a circular array of 40 tubular receptacles. Each receptacle can accommodate two TRIGA-type irradiation tubes, so that up to 80 separate samples may be irradiated at any one time. Vials holding up to ( internal diameter, long) are routinely used in this system. Depending upon its geometry, a sample up to about could be irradiated by joining two vials. Samples are loaded in the specimen rack prior to the start-up of the reactor. The rack automatically rotates during irradiation to ensure each sample receives the same neutron flux. Typically, the rotating rack is used by researchers when longer irradiation times (generally greater than five minutes) are required. The average thermal neutron flux in the rotating rack position is approximately 2√ó1012 n/cm2/s with a cadmium ratio of 6.0 at full power. The specimen rack can also be used for gamma irradiations when the reactor is shut down. The shutdown gamma flux in the specimen rack is approximately 3 R/min. =Central thimble= The central thimble, which is a water-filled irradiation chamber about in diameter, provides the highest available neutron flux, about 1.4x1013 n/cm2/s. However, it holds only one specially positioned irradiation container, containing a cavity in length and in diameter. Another in-core location is available by replacing one of the fuel elements with an irradiation chamber. The chamber fits into a fuel-element position within the core itself. Foil-insertion holes, in diameter, are drilled at various positions through the grid plates. These holes allow inserting special holders containing flux wires into the core, to obtain neutron flux maps of the core. In-pool facilities Near core, in-pool irradiation facilities can be arranged for larger samples. Neutron fluxes will be lower than in the lazy susan and will depend on the sample location.

Stimulation should elicit both a direct and consensual response (response of the opposite eye). The reflex occurs at a rapid rate of 0.1 seconds. The purpose of this reflex is to protect the eyes from foreign bodies and bright lights (the latter known as the optical reflex).\\"eye, human\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD, 2009 The blink reflex also occurs when sounds greater than 40‚Äì60 dB are made.Garde, M.M., & Cowey, A. (2000). Deaf hearing': Unacknowledged detection of auditory stimuli in a patient with cerebral deafness\\". Cortex 36(1), 71‚Äì80. The reflex is mediated by: * the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) sensing the stimulus on the cornea only (afferent fiber). * the temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve (CN VII) initiating the motor response (efferent fiber). * the center (nucleus) is located in the pons of the brainstem. Use of contact lenses may diminish or abolish the testing of this reflex. The optical reflex, on the other hand, is slower and is mediated by the visual cortex, which resides in the occipital lobe of the brain. The reflex is absent in infants under nine months. The examination of the corneal reflex is a part of some neurological exams, particularly when evaluating coma, such as FOUR score. Damage to the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve results in absent corneal reflex when the affected eye is stimulated. Stimulation of one cornea normally has a consensual response, with both eyelids normally closing. Rates When awake, the lids spread the tear secretions over the corneal surface, on a typical basis of 2 to 10 seconds (though this may vary individually). However, blinking is not only dependent on dryness and/or irritation. A brain area, the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia, contains a blinking center that controls blinking. Nonetheless, the external stimuli are still involved. Blinking is linked with the extraocular muscles. Blinking is often concurrent with a shift in gaze, and it is believed that this helps the movement of the eye.

His father (as well as his younger brother) died in 1812. Meanwhile, he read law, possibly with his uncle Joseph Eggleston (1754-1811), a former Revolutionary War soldier from Middlesex County, who then moved to Amelia County, where he became a planter and politician, and the local justice of the peace. Another Revolutionary War soldier uncle who moved to Amelia County was Lt. Richard Tanner Archer. William Segar Archer married and had a daughter, who did not survive him. At his death, he was survived by several sisters, and an illegitimate son.https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Archer_William_Segar_1789-1855#start_entry Career Admitted to the bar in 1810, Archer began a private legal practice in Amelia and neighboring Powhatan Counties. He also operated a plantation in Amelia County using enslaved labor. In the 1820 federal census, John R. Archer (possibly his father, although he had died in 1812) owned 51 enslaved people, and William S. Archer owned 32 slaves.1820 U.S. Federal Census for Amelia County, Virginia, p. 1 of 12 In the 1830 federal census, William S.

One historian reading his speeches considered his political stance undemocratic and noted that, despite his campaigns, Amelia County voters refused to elect him as one of their representatives to the Virginia constitutional conventions in 1829, nor in 1850.encyclopediavirginia Archer won election to the United States House of Representatives to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Pleasants (whom the Virginia General Assembly had elected to the U.S. Senate). He had a conservative, states' rights bent and soon introduced a resolution denying that Congress had the constitutional authority to authorize the Bank of the United States. Archer won reelection in 1820, 1824, 1826, 1828, 1830 and 1832, thus served from 1820 to 1835. In Congress, Archer served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1829 to 1835, before being defeated for reelection in 1834 by Democrat John Winston Jones. In 1824 Archer supported the unsuccessful Presidential candidacy of Virginia-born Democratic Republican William H. Crawford. In the next Presidential election, Archer supported Andrew Jackson, but broke with the Jacksonian Democrats after Jackson high-handedly removed government deposits from the Bank of the United States, and joined the Whig Party, although he did not agree with its leader Henry Clay's support of internal improvement.encyclopediavirginia Whigs gained power in the Virginia General Assembly by 1840, and on the second ballot Archer was elected to the United States Senate over the incumbent, William H. Roane. Archer served one full term from 1841 to 1847. There, he served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations from 1841 to 1845 and of the Committee on Naval Affairs from 1841 to 1843. Issues of territorial expansion and slavery became important during his tenure. Archer supported President Polk's effort to end British claims to the Oregon Territory, but not the annexation of Texas (fearing it would lead to war with Mexico, as happened). Archer also became a key member of the committee who drafted the Missouri Compromise. However, he did not have enough support in the Virginia General Assembly to win reelection.

He is currently signed to NorthernBlues Music, based in Toronto, Ontario. Homans has also earned bachelor's and master's degrees from University of Oregon and Oklahoma State University. Biography Homans was born in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, but has said that he was raised in North Carolina, where he was first exposed to blues music from about the time he was five years old. During childhood, he sang in choirs and glee clubs.\\"Watermelon Slim - Biography.\\" October 13, 2015. Mymusicbase.com, Accessed June 16, 2018. Homans later explained that he first played music in 1958, on a set of bongo drums. A year later, he acquired a harmonica. It took almost a decade before he became sufficiently experienced to take on a professional gig at Middlebury College in Vermont. Homans has been performing since the 1970s and has been linked to several notable blues musicians, including John Lee Hooker, Robert Cray, Champion Jack Dupree, Bonnie Raitt, \\"Country\\" Joe McDonald, and Henry Vestine of Canned Heat. The first recording project to feature Homans was Merry Airbrakes, an album recorded and released on a small label in 1973 after returning from a tour of duty in Vietnam. This song, which he wrote, has been described as \\"furiously anti-war.\\" Homans had become, after his return home, involved with Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and the album had songs with lyrics reflecting drug use, spiritual exploration, and involvement with the emotional cost of fighting \\"enemies.\\" The album, originals of which are now highly collectible, has been re-released. In Vietnam, he contracted an illness that put him in a Cam Ranh Bay military hospital. While convalescing, he started playing a Vietnamese guitar, made with balsa wood and rusty metal strings. His guitar pick was a Zippo cigarette lighter. When he was transferred back to the U.S., he was not allowed to bring his Vietnamese guitar along, so he bought a new American guitar shortly after his arrival and continued to develop this new skill. By 1979, he felt adrift in the Boston area and naively decided to move to Oklahoma, buy some land and earn a living as a farmer. He grew many different crops, from cantaloupes to artichokes, but the farm was never a financial success, merely a sideline. Homans later said that watermelons were the one crop on which never lost money. After Vietnam, Homans spent most of his adult life working for a living as a truck driver, just to make ends meet. According to Oklahoma Magazine, Homans was living on a truck farm in July, 1980, in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma when he first adopted the moniker \\"Watermelon Slim.\\"\\"Watermelon Slim.\\" Oklahoma Magazine 2009. Watermelonslim.com, Accessed June 15, 2018. He never stopped playing music, and hooked up with some professional players in Oregon in 1984. This improved his skills and gave him confidence in his music abilities. Then he went to Europe, intending to establish himself as a soloist. When that attempt failed, he returned to Boston and truck driving. In 1993, he returned to his 'truck patch\\" in Oklahoma, where he has been based ever since. He also formed his supporting band, \\"The Workers.\\"{{efn The Workers were: His more recent music is rooted in the Mississippi Delta style, as he plays his dobro guitar lap- style, lefthanded and backwards, with a slide. While for decades typically an acoustic performer, with The Workers he has concentrated more on playing electric. In 1998, Homans met two Oklahoma State University philosophy professors, Doren Recker and Mike Rhodes, with whom he started a band called \\"Fried Okra Jones\\". This band went through several changes in personnel, including the blues woman Honour Hero Havoc, bass player, and guitarist \\"Texas\\" Ray Isom. In 1999, Homans recorded for the first time since 1973, an EP CD called \\"Fried Okra Jones\\". In 2002, Homans made his first national release for Southern Records, Big Shoes to Fill, produced by his longtime musical colleague from Massachusetts, Chris Stovall Brown, with cousins Kyle and Adam Enevoldsen on drums and bass. A few months later, Homans had a serious heart attack, but bounced back quickly and continued to drive trucks, hauling industrial waste, and in 2003, used his work vacation time to make his first international tour, a solo journey through southern England. In 2004, Homans left this last truck driving job to go on tour with his supporting band, \\"The Workers\\". In 2005, Homans was nominated for the W. C. Handy Award for \\"Best New Artist Debut\\", for his acoustic masterpiece CD, Up Close and Personal, produced by Chris Hardwick. He and his band were also nominated for six more Handy Awards in 2006, in a variety of categories, and for a Maple Blues Award from the Toronto Blues Society for the 2006 album Watermelon Slim and the Workers. In early 2007, this album won in The 6th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album. Watermelon Slim & The Workers were also nominated for Blues Album of the year for The Wheel Man in the 7th annual The Independent Music AwardsIndependent Music Awards. In 2007, Homans made the CD The Wheel Man, which was nominated for another six Blues Music Awards. At the awards ceremony in 2008, Homans and his band won the award for Best Blues Band of 2007, and The Wheel Man was awarded Best Blues CD of 2007. Besides that, Homans won the Maple Blues Award for B.B. King International Entertainer. The Wheel Man also was No. 1 Blues Album in England's Mojo Magazine blues CD poll for the second year in a row. In 2008, The Workers recorded their third CD for Toronto's NorthernBlues record label, No Paid Holidays. Homans was also inducted into the Oklahoma Blues Hall of Fame at this time. In 2009, this CD was nominated for another four Blues Music Awards, for a total of seventeen awards from the Blues Foundation. A few months later, Escape From the Chicken Coop, Homans' first country-and-western CD recorded in Nashville with Paul Franklin, Darrell Scott and other top Nashville session players, was released on NorthernBlues. Future releases will include another Nashville record, reflecting Homans' North Carolina Grand Ole Opry roots, an acoustic duo CD featuring Honour Havoc, and blues CDs with Mississippi bluesmen James \\"Super Chikan\\" Johnson and Robert \\"The Wolfman\\" Belfour. In 1972-3, Homans met country star Bonnie Raitt at one of her performances. Both Raitt and Homans shared the same musical hero, Mississippi Fred McDowell, an established star who had actually been Raitt's teacher. In 1979, Homans dropped in on one of Raitt's shows. The reporter covering the show for the Norman Transcript wrote as much about Homans as he did about the star. Ratio and Homans both attended the unveiling of a Mississippi Blues Trail marker honoring the late McDowell. Later, Homan went alone to McDowell's grave and serenaded his mentor, acknowledging the debt he owed the man who started Watermelon Slim on the road to success. Homans is a graduate of Lenox School for Boys, a boarding school in Lenox, MA. Homans has a bachelor's degree in journalism and history from the University of Oregon, and a master's degree in history from Oklahoma State University. Before dropping out to enlist in the Vietnam War he had attended Middlebury College. He came back home a fervent anti-war activist, and remains a member and supporter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. In February 2019, his album Church Of The Blues reached number 7 in the US Billboard Blues Albums chart. Film work Watermelon Slim's music is featured in the 2009 environmental documentary Tar Creek, which is about the Tar Creek environmental disaster in Oklahoma. Music from Big Shoes to Fill, Up Close & Personal, plus a live version of \\"Oklahoma Blues\\" score this award-winning documentary by writer/director Matt Myers.

Synon also suggested the Klan had been modeled by Irish-American emigrants on the Irish Whiteboys, and argued that the post-1915 KKK was a betrayal of the organisation's original principles. In response, several Sunday Independent readers wrote in, claiming Synon was denying the Klan's racist and terroristic nature, and that Synon's view of Reconstruction was based on the work of the Dunning School (which is no longer accepted by most American historians). Some other readers also expressed offence at the comparison of the Klan to the Whiteboys. Synon responded to the criticism by writing \\"I see that the ignorance of my fellow Irish on these matters remains profound\\". Synon also defended George Wallace after his death, saying Wallace was not a racist. \\"I knew George Wallace... what he was, was a man who supported the American Constitution and the guarantee in that Constitution of the right of the States to sovereignty.\\" Synon stated \\"segregation by race is not racism, any more than the religious segregation in the education of this country is religious bigotry\\".

The picture was filmed in Dublin, and at Ardmore Studios in Bray, Ireland. It was based on the 1933 novel of the same name by Rearden Conner, the son of a Royal Irish Constabulary policeman. The film is set in 1921 Dublin, where the Irish Republican Army battles the Black and Tans, ex-British soldiers sent to suppress the rebels. It stars James Cagney and Don Murray. Also featured are Dana Wynter, Glynis Johns, Sybil Thorndike and Michael Redgrave. Plot Irish-American Kerry O'Shea (Don Murray) is studying at the College of Surgeons in 1921 Dublin, Ireland, during a guerrilla war ‚Äì the Irish War of Independence. Apolitical and sick of killing after fighting in World War I, he is drawn into the struggle between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the British Black and Tans. He and his friend and fellow medical student, Paddy Nolan (Ray McAnally), are caught in the middle of an IRA ambush, and Nolan is shot by the British. Nolan tells O'Shea to fetch Sean Lenihan (James Cagney), one of their professors. Lenihan, it turns out, is also a high-ranking IRA leader known as \\"the Commandant\\". Lenihan removes the bullet, but Nolan dies anyway. Since O'Shea left his textbook (with his name inscribed) at the scene of the ambush, he is now a wanted man. Lenihan takes him to meet his superior, \\"the General\\" (Michael Redgrave), an old comrade-in- arms of O'Shea's father. When O'Shea refuses his invitation to join the IRA, the General arranges for a boat passage out of Ireland. Lenihan takes him to a hideout by the sea, the base of an IRA unit commanded by Chris Noonan (Cyril Cusack). Lenihan is furious to find local barmaid Kitty Brady (Glynis Johns) consorting with the men there. When Liam O'Sullivan (Noel Purcell), a top IRA leader, is wounded escaping from prison, O'Shea agrees to accompany the unit to the rendezvous point to treat him. O'Sullivan is discovered in the boot of the car of aged Lady Fitzhugh (Sybil Thorndike) and killed in a shootout by the British. When the soldiers check the people in the nearby pub (where the IRA men are waiting), Terence O'Brien (Richard Harris) tries to hide a pistol he brought (against Noonan's explicit orders). When it is found, it is O'Shea who is taken away. He is brutally beaten by Colonel Smithson of the Black and Tans (Christopher Rhodes), but refuses to talk. Lenihan leads a raid to rescue him. At that point, O'Shea decides to join the IRA. Lady Fitzhugh is sentenced to prison and goes on a hunger strike. Lenihan kidnaps Jennifer Curtis (Dana Wynter), the widowed daughter of a top British adviser, to try to force a prisoner exchange. Complications ensue when Kerry falls for her. When Kitty gets into trouble, both with Lenihan and the British, she decides to leave Ireland. Lenihan prepares to assassinate Colonel Smithson at the dock. However, he suspects he has been betrayed when Kitty, purely by coincidence, tries to board a ship there. During the ensuing shootout, Lenihan shoots Kitty dead in cold blood. When the men reassemble at a lighthouse, they hear two bits of news. First, Lady Fitzhugh has died. Second, the British have offered a peace treaty. The General is satisfied to have peace, but not Lenihan. When he decides to execute Mrs. Curtis, O'Shea has to stop him. They exchange shots, and Lenihan is killed.

Synthesised Instrumental version People's ensemble \\"Kalyna\\" (Odesa) \\"Shchedryk\\" (, from , \\"Bountiful Evening\\") is a Ukrainian shchedrivka, or New Year's song, known in English as \\"The Little Swallow\\". It was arranged by composer and teacher Mykola Leontovych in 1916, and tells a story of a swallow flying into a household to sing of wealth that will come with the following spring. \\"Shchedryk\\" was originally sung on the night of January 13, New Year's Eve in the Julian Calendar (December 31 Old Style), which is Shchedry Vechir. Early performances of the piece were made by students at Kyiv University., Sean Spurr, Carols.co. \\"Shchedryk\\" was later adapted as an English Christmas carol, \\"Carol of the Bells\\", by Peter J. Wilhousky following a performance of the original song by Alexander Koshetz's Ukrainian National Chorus at Carnegie Hall on October 5, 1921. Wilhousky copyrighted and published his new lyrics (which were not based on the Ukrainian lyrics) in 1936, and the song became popular in the United States and Canada, where it became strongly associated with Christmas. Conceptually, the Ukrainian lyrics of this song meet the definition of a shchedrivka, while the English content of \\"The Little Swallow\\" identifies it as a kolyadka or, in other words, a Christmas carol. Origins and translation Composer Mykola Leontovych The song is based on a traditional folk chant whose language was thought to have magical properties. The original traditional Ukrainian text used a device known as hemiola in the rhythm (alternating the accents within each measure from 3/4 to 6/8 and back again). The chant based on an ostinato four-note pattern within the range of a minor third is thought to be of prehistoric origins and was associated with the coming New Year which in Ukraine before the introduction of Christianity was originally celebrated in April. With the introduction of Christianity to Ukraine, the celebration of the New Year was moved from April to January and the holiday the chant describes became associated with the Feast of Epiphany also known in Ukrainian as Shchedry vechir. The songs sung for this celebration are known as Schedrivky. The original Ukrainian text tells the tale of a swallow flying into a household to proclaim the plentiful and bountiful year that the family will have.\\"Quote from Rice University News The title is derived from the Ukrainian word for \\"bountiful\\". In Ukraine, the song is currently sung on the eve of the Julian New Year (January 13). The four-note melody over a minor third of the chant was used by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych as an ostinato theme in a number of arrangements he made. The arrangement for mixed voice choir a cappella was popularized by the Ukrainian Republic Capella directed by Oleksander Koshetz when it toured the West after 1920. The first of the English language lyrics to \\"Carol of the Bells\\" (a song based on the same melodic ideas) were written in 1936 by Peter Wilhousky of NBC Radio. The song reminded Wilhousky of beautiful ringing bells and he captured that imagery in his lyrics. There is also an English adaptation of the original Ukrainian by Stepan Pasicznyk. Several other variants of English words with the same melody, mostly retaining Wilhousky's bell theme. One of the better- known variants is a 1947 set of lyrics with more explicitly Christian lyrics \\"Ring, Christmas Bells.\\"Nobbman, Dale V. (2000).

From 1948 through 1958, Smalley played for the Chicago Cubs (1948‚Äì1953), Milwaukee Braves (1954) and Philadelphia Phillies (1955‚Äì1958). He batted and threw right-handed. In an 11-season career, Smalley was a .227 hitter with 61 home runs and 305 RBI in 872 games played. Smalley was the father of major league shortstop Roy Smalley III.  Career  Smalley was signed at age 17 by the Cubs as an amateur free agent out of Springfield Catholic High School. He began his professional career in 1944 with the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League, where he batted just .188 in 61 games. After missing the 1945 season due to military service, Smalley was moved down to the Shelby Cubs for the 1946 season. By the end of the year, he was back with the Angels. In 1947, Smalley spent the entire season with the Class A Des Moines Bruins, where he batted .244 in 114 games. =Chicago Cubs= Smalley's 1947 minor league season was impressive enough that in 1948 he was given the starting shortstop job with the major league Cubs, replacing incumbent Lennie Merullo, who was sent to the minors himself for the season. Smalley remained the Cubs' primary shortstop for the remainder of his tenure with the team. Smalley's best season statistically was 1950. He posted career highs in home runs (21), RBI (85), runs (58), hits (128) and doubles (21), including hitting for the cycle on June 28. He struck out a league-leading 114 times. He made 51 errors (the last time a player made at least 50), but he also led National League shortstops in total chances per game, as he had in 1949, and in double plays. Smalley was the last regular shortstop for the Cubs prior to the debut of \\"Mr. Cub\\", Ernie Banks. Smalley appeared in 77 games at short during the 1953 season, more than any other Cubs player. Banks debuted on September 17 and started the last 10 games of the season. In his six seasons with Chicago, Smalley appeared in 661 games, batting .232 with 52 home runs and 242 RBIs. =Milwaukee Braves= Smalley was traded to the Braves in March 1954 for pitcher Dave Cole. He appeared in 25 games for the Braves during the 1954 season, batting .222 with 1 home run and 7 RBIs. =Philadelphia Phillies= In April 1955, the Phillies purchased Smalley's contract. He played for them for the 1955 through 1957 seasons, plus a single game in the 1958 season. In his time with the Phillies, he appeared in a total of 186 games, batting .204 with 8 home runs and 56 RBIs. =Return to the minors= After being released by the Phillies in May 1958, Smalley signed with the St. Louis Cardinals and the spent the season with their Triple AAA club, the Rochester Red Wings. For the 1959 season, Smalley played for the Houston Buffs and the Minneapolis Millers. He played for the Spokane Indians of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization for the 1960 season, after which he retired. Smalley was named manager of the Class C Reno Silver Sox in 1961, and he managed the team to a first-place finish in the California League in his first season. In 1962, the team slipped into a tie for third place, and Smalley was let go; during the season he played in one game, his final professional appearance as a player. Personal life Smalley served a year in the military during World War II. During the 1950 season, he married Jolene Mauch, sister of former teammate Gene Mauch, in Brookline, Massachusetts, while the Cubs were in Boston playing the Braves on August 5. Smalley had played a 13-inning game earlier that day, going 0-for-5. Their son Roy III, born in 1952, went on to play shortstop in the major leagues for several teams from 1975 until 1987, including several years for the Minnesota Twins when Mauch was their manager. Smalley lived in Sahuarita, Arizona, from 2004 until his death in October 2011.

On this particular stela, the formula begins on the first line and reads from right to left The offering formula, also known under transliterated forms of its incipit as the ·∏•tp-·∏è·ªâ- nsw or ·∏•tp-·∏èj-nswt formula was a conventional dedicatory formula found on ancient Egyptian funerary objects, believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members. It is among the most common of all Middle Egyptian texts. Its incipit ·∏•tp-·∏èj-nswt \\"an offering given by the king\\" is followed by the name of a deity and a list of offerings given. The offering formula is usually found carved or painted onto funerary stelae, false doors, coffins, and sometimes other funerary objects. Each person had their own name and titles put into the formula. The offering formula was not a royal prerogative like some of the other religious texts such as the Litany of Re, and was used by anyone who could afford to have one made. Text All ancient Egyptian offering formulas share the same basic structure, but there is a great deal of variety in which deities and offerings are mentioned, and which epithets and titles are used. Below is an example of a typical offering formula: ::M23 t:R4 X8 Q1 D4 nb R11 w O49:t Z1 nTr aA nb U23 b N26:O49 ::D37:f O3 F1:H1 V6 S27 x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t S34:t nTr i m :: n:D28:n i F39:x i i F12 s r:t:z:n A1 Aa11:P8 ::·∏•tp d·ªâ nsw ws·ªâr nb ·∏èdw, n·πØr Íú•Íú£, nb Íú£b·∏èw ::d·ªâ=f prt-·∏´rw t ·∏•nqt, kÍú£w Íú£pdw, ≈°s mn·∏•t ·∏´t nbt nfrt wÍú•bt Íú•n·∏´t n·πØr ·ªâm ::n kÍú£ n ·ªâmÍú£·∏´y s-n-wsrt, mÍú£Íú•-·∏´rw ::\\"An offering given by the king (to) Osiris, the lord of Busiris, the great god, the lord of Abydos.\\" ::\\"That he may give an invocation offering of bread, beer, oxen, birds, alabaster, clothing, and every good and pure thing upon which a god lives.\\" ::\\"For the ka of the revered Senwosret, True of Voice.\\" The offering formula always begins with the phrase: ::M23 t:R4 X8 ::·∏•tp d·ªâ nsw This phrase was in use since Old Egyptian, and literally means \\"an offering given by the king.\\" This dedication does not indicate that the gift was personally given by the king; rather, it identifies the funerary offering as being royally authorized. Because the king was seen as an intermediary between the people of Egypt and the gods, the offering was made in his name. Next the formula names a god of the dead and several of his epithets. Usually the god is Osiris, Anubis, or (rarely) Geb, Wepwawet, or another deity. This part of the formula identifies the local funerary establishment that actually provided the offering; the offering is seen as being under the auspices of that establishment‚Äôs patron deity. The following phrase is a typical invocation of Osiris: ::Q1 D4 nb R11 w O49:t Z1 nTr aA nb U23 b N26:O49 ::ws·ªâr nb ·∏èdw, n·πØr Íú•Íú£, nb Íú£b·∏èw which means \\"Osiris, the lord of Busiris, the great god, the lord of Abydos.\\" There was apparently no set rule about what epithets were used; however, \\"Lord of Busiris,\\" \\"Great God,\\" and \\"Lord of Abydos\\" were very common. Also frequent were: ::nb H6 nb G21 H H N5 ::nb ·ªâmnt nb n·∏•·∏• meaning \\"Lord of the West, Lord of Eternity\\" Anubis is seen less frequently than Osiris, and usually read, ::E15:R4 W17 t nTr O21 D1 N26:f ::·ªânpw, ·∏´nty s·∏• n·πØr tpy ·∏èw=f meaning \\"Anubis, he who is in front of his divine booth, he who is on his mountain.\\" After the list of deities and their titles, the formula proceeds with a list of the prt-·∏´rw, or \\"invocation offerings,\\" of which the spirit of the deceased is called to partake. The list is always preceded by the phrase: ::D37:f O3 or X8 s:n O3 ::d·ªâ=f prt-·∏´rw or d·ªâ=sn prt-·∏´rw which means \\"He (or they, in the second example) give(s) invocation offerings.\\" After this phrase, the list of offerings follows; for example: ::D37:f O3 F1:H1 V6 S27 x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t S34:t nTr i m ::d·ªâ=f prt-·∏´rw t ·∏•nqt, kÍú£w Íú£pdw, ≈°s mn·∏•t ·∏´t nbt nfrt wÍú•bt Íú•n·∏´t n·πØr ·ªâm meaning \\"He gives invocation offerings of bread, beer, oxen, birds, alabaster, clothing, and every good and pure thing upon which a god lives.\\" Sometimes the text at the end of the list is replaced with the phrase: ::x:t nb:t nfr:t wab:t D37:t:D37 p*t:N1 T14 G1 N16:N21*Z1 W25 n:n:t V28 D36:p:N36 S34:t nTr i m ::·∏´t nbt nfrt wÍú•bt ddt pt qmÍú£(t) tÍú£ ·ªânnt ·∏•Íú•p(·ªâ) Íú•n·∏´t n·πØr ·ªâm Meaning \\"Every good and pure thing that the sky gives, the earth creates, the inundation brings, on which the god lives.\\" The last part of the offering formula lists the name and titles of the recipient of the invocation offerings. For example: :: n:D28:n i F39:x i i F12 s r:t:z:n A1 Aa11:P8 ::n kÍú£ n ·ªâmÍú£·∏´y s-n-wsrt, mÍú£Íú•-·∏´rw which means \\"for the ka of the revered Senwosret, True of Voice.\\" See also *Egyptian mythology *Egyptian soul *Ancient Egyptian burial customs *Ancient Egyptian funerary texts References  * External links *O'Brien, Alexandra A., \\"Death in Ancient Egypt\\". *Telford, Mark Patrick, \\"Death And The Afterlife\\".

The design of the modern bassoon owes a great deal to Almenr√§der, who, assisted by the German acoustics researcher Gottfried Weber developed the 17-key bassoon whose range spanned three octaves and a half. Early years Carl Almenr√§der was the son of a teacher: he taught himself to play the bassoon after he was given one when aged just 13. He started out in 1810 playing in a theatre orchestra in Cologne, but he switched to an orchestral position in Frankfurt in 1812 where by 1814 he was also obtaining solo work. He studied composition with Aloys Schmitt, and in 1814 he gave a public performance in Frankfurt of a rondo which he had himself written. Career progress In 1817 Almenr√§der joined the Mainz theatre orchestra as a bassoonist. He was now working seriously on a year-long project to develop a technically improved bassoon featuring moving keys and an improved level of balance across the tonal range. By 1819 he had temporarily down river to Cologne where he joined his brothers in their workshop which focused on producing flutes and clarinets. In 1822 Almenr√§der joined the Court Orchestra of the Dukes of Nassau which was based at Biebrich am Rhein (today a suburb of Wiesbaden), and he was also engaged by the Mainz based music publisher Schott Music to advise on wind instrument production. Bassoon development Almenr√§der's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise in which he described ways of improving intonation, response, and technical ease of playing by means of augmenting and rearranging the keywork; subsequent articles further developed his ideas. Working at the Schott factory gave him the means to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, the results of which were published in Caecilia, Schott's house journal; Almenr√§der continued publishing and building instruments until his death, and Ludwig van Beethoven himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. His own instrument production facility In 1831 Almenr√§der started his own factory along with partner Johann Adam Heckel (1812-1877), producing woodwind instruments. He nevertheless continued to work with Schott as a proof reader, and as a tubing supplier. In 1843 he produced a comprehensive teaching manual for his 17-key bassoon which had a chromatic range of 4 octaves. After Almenr√§der's death in 1846 his business partner, Heckel continued the manufacturing business. Following several further upgrades today's German Almenr√§der-Heckel bassoon comes with between 25 and 27 keys. It has spread far beyond German speaking central Europe, defining during the twentieth century the international standards for the instrument.

Born on Belitung Island, he was nicknamed \\"Amat\\". Aidit was educated in the Dutch colonial system. Biography Aidit was born Achmad Aidit in Tanjung Pandan, Belitung, 30 July 1923. He was the first son of four. His parents were Abdullah Aidit and Mailan. Achmad and his siblings studied at Hollandsche Inlandsch School. In early 1936, Achmad asked his father to continue his study to Batavia. Achmad then attended Middestand Handel School, instead of Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs because the registration had already been closed. Three years he lived in Cempaka Putih at his father colleague. He moved to Senen and lived with his brother Murad who followed in Achmad's footsteps. Unwilling to rely on money sent by their parents, Achmad and Murad tried to earn money themselves. In those times, Achmad was an active as member of Persatuan Timur Muda, under Gerakan Rakyat Indonesia led by Amir Sjarifudin and Adnan Kapau Gani, and later became the chairman. Achmad also changed his name to Dipa Nusantara, which was shortened as D.N. and was often mistaken for Djafar Nawawi, to conceal his descent which was at first, rejected by his father. During the Japanese occupation, in Asrama Menteng 31 D.N. Aidit and his friends received political lectures from Sukarno, Hatta, Amir Sjarifudin, Achmad Subardjo, and Ki Hajar Dewantoro. There, in 1943, Aidit first met M.H. Lukman. They were members of Gerakan Indonesia Merdeka while Aidit as the chairman of political council of the organization and Lukman as his member. In 1944, they were elected as the member of Barisan Pelopor Indonesia, the 100 men who were most loyal to Sukarno. About one year before Indonesian independence, Aidit, M.H. Lukman, Sidik Kertapati, Chalid Rasjidi, and the other young men studied politics at Asrama Kemerdekaan founded by Rear Admiral Maeda and headed by Wikana. In early September 1945, Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia was formed. Aidit was appointed as the chairman of API section Jakarta Raya. On 5 November, Aidit, Alizar Thaib, and the other API member attacked Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger's post but eventually were arrested. They were then exiled to Onrust island. After seven months, Aidit and Lukman were released. One day after released, they went to Yogyakarta to meet Wikana. In Yogyakarta, Aidit and Lukman ran the bimonthly magazine, Bintang Merah. There, they met Njoto, PKI's Banyuwangi representative. In March 1947, Aidit was appointed as chairman of a PKI faction in a KNIP meeting. In early 1948, Aidit, Lukman, and Njoto were assigned to translate The Communist Manifesto into Indonesian. In August, the three became members of the Central Committee, respectively responsible for land affair, agitation and propaganda, and relation to other organizations. The three and Sudisman became members of the new PKI Politburo formed by Musso on 1 September 1948. Aidit was responsible for the labor section of the party. Aidit and Lukman managed to escape to China and Vietnam after PKI position was pressed in Madiun Affair, while Murad claimed that Aidit took shelter in Tanjung Priok. While in hiding, Aidit and Lukman reran Bintang Merah on 15 August 1950. They also published Suara Rakjat two weekly. In January 1951, Njoto joined the latter. After the 1948 affair, the four young members of the Politburo, Aidit, Njoto, Lukman, and Sudisman replaced the old leaders in January 1951 as a result of the fifth congress of the party. Aidit was appointed as the secretary general of the party, which was later renamed as chairman, while Njoto and Lukman as his deputies. PKI led by Aidit was not only based on labor and plantation worker, but also farmer. Though a Marxist, Aidit submitted to Sukarno's Marhaenismlib.monash.edu.au policy and allowed the party to grow without any overt intentions towards power. In return for his support of Sukarno, he rose to the position of Secretary-General of the PKI. Under his administration, the party became the 3rd largest Communist party in the world, behind those of the Soviet Union and China. He set up a number of programs including the Pemuda Rakyat for the youth, and Gerwani, a women's league. During the 1955 general election campaign, Aidit and the PKI drew a large following. In the next decade, the PKI became a leftist rival to conservative elements among the Muslim political parties and the Army. By 1965, the PKI had become the largest political party in Indonesia, and Aidit became bolder in overtures towards power. Sjam claimed that on 12 August 1965 he met Aidit and was instructed to assess the party's power that time. On 2 October, Aidit went to Yogyakarta to meet the regional PKI chairman Sutrisno. After a few hours, Aidit moved to Semarang also to consolidate to the party officials in the region. The meeting concluded that the coup was the Army's internal problem and PKI knew nothing about it. In the afternoon of that day, Aidit went to Boyolali to meet Boyolali regent Suwali who was a PKI member. Aidit then went to Solo to meet the mayor Utomo Ramelan who was also a member. The meeting contradicted the conclusion of the meeting in Semarang. Several Politbiro members including Aidit and M.H. Lukman met in Blitar on 5 October. There Aidit wrote a letter of the PKI view of the coup which was read by Njoto during a cabinet meeting in Bogor. After the attempted coup on 30 September 1965, later officially blamed on the PKI (see Transition to the New Order), Aidit fled to Boyolali, where he was shot on 22 November by pro-government forces led by General Suharto during the bloody 1965/66 anti- communist purge. According to Zulkifli & Hidayat, on 22 November Aidit was arrested by a search group led by Colonel Yasir Hadibroto in a house in Sambeng Village, Solo. In the early morning, Aidit was brought to Boyolali and was summarily executed. Political views According to Ricklefs, Aidit thought that \\"Marxism was a guide to action, not an inflexible dogma\\". Aidit sympathized with Musso's Jalan Baru untuk Republik Indonesia (A New Road for Indonesian Republic), though he stated that the Madiun Affair was just \\"children's games\\". Legacy  Some of his writings were published as The Selected Works of D.N. Aidit (2 vols. Vol. I JPRS-6551; Vol. II JPRS-8886; Washington: US Joint Publications Research Service, 1961). Personal life Aidit married Soetanti in early 1948. Aidit's second son, Ilham, was born on 18 May 1959 in Moscow.

The studios were located in Central London, on the South Bank next to the IBM Building and the Royal National Theatre. The building was set on 2.5 acres of land and was 24 floors high. The London Studios closed on 30 April 2018. Many ITV programmes now come from BBC Studioworks' facility at the former BBC Television Centre, White City, London. The facilities were the main studios for ITV, along with a number of production companies including ITV Studios and Shiver based in Kent House tower, while the studios were home to many entertainment, game and daytime shows. These included Good Morning Britain, The Graham Norton Show, Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and The Jonathan Ross Show. The studios were also used for other programmes from various other channels including BBC Television and Channel 4. ITV Creative, which promotes programmes on the ITV network, was also based at the London Studios. History When LWT succeeded ATV as the London weekend ITV franchisee in 1968, it rented Associated- Rediffusion's old studios at Wembley (later known as The Fountain Studios) while plans for a new studio complex in central London were drawn up. The chosen site stood beside the then new Royal National Theatre on the South Bank of the River Thames. It was bought in 1969, and construction work, awarded to Higgs and Hill, began in 1970. The centre opened for transmission in 1972, though it was not fully operational until 1974. The complex was owned by the pension fund of the National Coal Board and leased by the station. It was originally called The South Bank Television Centre (a name that lasted until the early 1990s) and at the time was the most advanced television centre in Europe. On 28 January 2013 ITV plc finally bought the freehold of the now renamed London Television Centre for ¬£56 million from what had become Coal Pension Properties. On social media, the building is named 'ITV Towers' since the purchase in January 2013. The official name of the building is The London Television Centre (with the studio business branded as 'The London Studios'), that being the logo in reception and around the building. The site closed in April 2018 for demolition. Initially, ITV intended to redevelop the site with three smaller studios, but in October 2018 it announced it would not be returning to the South Bank, and the whole site would be redeveloped into premium housing. In November 2019, it was announced that ITV had reached an agreement to sell The London Studios for ¬£145.6 million to Mitsubishi Estate London. The building =Kent House Tower= Building entrance Kent House is a 24-story tower block, and was home to ITV plc and many production offices including ITV Studios and Shiver Productions. During the 1990s the block was also home to Carlton Television and GMTV. It was seen in the titles of Good Morning Britain and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. The tower housed programme production offices, edit suites, dubbing suites, VTR studio booths and graphic booths. =Main Studio Block= Kent House Tower Sandwiched between Kent House Tower and the River Thames is the main studio block, housing studios 1, 2, 3, 5 & 7, the restaurant, the takeaway bar (prior studio cafe), management offices, edit facilities, make-up and wardrobe. It was designed by London-based architecture practice Elsom Pack & Roberts. =Gabriel's Wharf= On the east side of the site, there is a neighbouring building called Gabriel's Wharf. Previously belonging to Younger's Brewery, this three-storey building was added later to the site as a scenery store. When This Morning moved from Liverpool, the studio 8 was converted from the riverside end of the first storey. This area was on lease from Coin Street Community Builders to ITV until 2018, when they left the premises. =Audiences= Audiences were used in many productions at The London Studios. The audience were instructed to queue to the left hand side of the studios near to the reception entrance and under a cover where they were escorted into one of the studios once security checked. There were two waterproof TV screens with live ITV programmes shown on them. There were several hand-prints displayed in the audience waiting area with hand-prints of presenters including Vernon Kay, Al Murray, Melvyn Bragg, Lorraine Kelly, Paul O'Grady, Graham Norton, Stephen Fry, Fern Britton, Phillip Schofield, Davina McCall, Des Lynam, Fiona Phillips, Eamonn Holmes, Gabby Logan, Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, Ben Elton and Ian McKellen. =Studios= There were a total of nine different studios during the complex's lifespan. By the time of closure there were six. There were weather studios producing the ITV national, and some of the network's regional forecasts at ITN's headquarters in Gray's Inn Road. *Studio 1 ‚Äì ‚Äì The largest studio on the complex. This studio was home to programmes such as All Star Family Fortunes, All Star Mr & Mrs, The Graham Norton Show, Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Text Santa. The studio had a permanent fixed balcony seating area which, along with movable seating, could accommodate audiences of up to 638. This made the studio popular for large audience based shows. Studio 1 was upgraded to HD in December 2009. *Studio 2 ‚Äì ‚Äì The second largest on the complex housed shows such as Piers Morgan's Life Stories, The Alan Titchmarsh Show, Let's Do Lunch with Gino & Mel, Have I Got News for You and It'll Be Alright on the Night. The studio could accommodate large audiences of up to 462. The studio could also be used as a bare shell as the audience seating structure could be moved out. Studio 2 was upgraded to HD in the summer of 2009. *Studio 3 ‚Äì ‚Äì This studio housed daily chatshow Loose Women, political chat show Peston on Sunday and ITV Breakfast programme Lorraine. The studio could accommodate audiences of up to 150. The studio also had an \\"in-the-round\\" seating feature with up to 108 audience capacity, with the presenters and set in the middle with the audiences seated around them. It did briefly become the home of GMTV from July to September 2010 before the launch of Daybreak. This studio then became the home for Daybreak between September 2012 and April 2014. Studio 3 was upgraded to HD in the summer of 2012. *Studio 4 ‚Äì Located in the tower block, LWT‚Äôs in- vision continuity was broadcast from here until out-of-vision continuity was introduced, when studio 4 was closed. It was then converted back to offices. *Studio 5 ‚Äì ‚Äì Based at the bottom of Kent House. This studio was previously used by GMTV from January 1993 to July 2010 (before it temporarily moved to Studio 3), The Big Match from 1972 to 1992 and World of Sport from 1972 to 1985. From April 2014, Good Morning Britain began using this studio. *Studio 6 ‚Äì There has never been a 'Studio 6' on the complex. There is however a bar and restaurant in Gabriel's Wharf next door named 'Studio Six'. *Studio 7 ‚Äì ‚Äì Located in the studio block on the river's bank, this studio presented panoramic views over the London skyline, including St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, through its floor-to-ceiling windows. Studio 7 was home to the London News Network‚Äôs local news bulletins from 1993 until 2004. It was built in 1993 for the newly created London News Network, a company which provided local news for the ITV Network in London. Prior to 1993, LWT, the London weekend ITV franchisee, had produced news bulletins for London on Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays from studio 10, whilst Thames Television had provided its own news during the rest of the week from its own studios. The new partnership between the new London weekday licensee Carlton and LWT meant one news bulletin would be seen all week, London Tonight. After the Carlton and Granada merger to form ITV plc however, LNN was disbanded and Independent Television News took over the contract. London Tonight is now produced in their studios on Grays Inn Road. It was then used as the home of ITV Sport and also for Loose Women, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!, Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, and various specials for Canadian television. ITV's breakfast programme Daybreak used the studio from 6 September 2010 to 31 August 2012. For the launch of Daybreak, the studio was converted to high- definition. It continued to be used by ITV Sport, most recently for its coverage of IPL Cricket on ITV4, as well as use for CBBC's Friday Download. *Studio 8 ‚Äì ‚Äì This studio was located beside the main complex in the building known as Gabriel‚Äôs Wharf. Daytime show This Morning occupied this studio after the show moved to London from Liverpool in 1996. It had three large one-way mirrored windows overlooking the Thames which appeared silver from the outside, restricting people being able to see in from the outside and reducing glare inside. *Studio 9 ‚Äì This small studio was used when ITV2 used in-vision announcers and was located next to studio 7. It was used for the studio's tapeless recording system allowing editors to edit programmes shortly after they were recorded. *Studio 10 ‚Äì Studio 10 was on the 10th floor of the tower and was used for London‚Äôs weekend and Friday evening‚Äôs local news (produced originally by LWT) as well as Crime Monthly before studio 7 was built. This studio was equipped with Phillips cameras and a show entitled Talk TV was output from here for Talk Digital Channel before the studio was converted into offices in 2003. The studio was visible from the South Bank by looking towards the tower with your back facing St. Paul's Cathedral and noting the studio‚Äôs windows (which are slightly blue and clearer in comparison to the other windows). ITV The studios were originally built by the London weekend ITV franchise holder, London Weekend Television (LWT). In 1993 Carlton Television won the London weekday franchise from Thames Television, but unlike Thames, Carlton had no studios or property of its own. Carlton therefore rented space in the tower from 1993 for its own post-production and continuity facilities. The rental agreement continued until 2002, when an agreement was reached for Carlton to be permanently based within space used by LWT; in the intervening years LWT had been taken over by Granada plc, and a close relationship had developed between Granada and Carlton. This led to consolidation within the ITV network and an agreement for the two to work together as ITV London. Since 2002, all the ITV plc-owned regions' continuity before national programmes has been presented from the London Studios, as well as continuity before regional programmes in the following regions: Meridian, Westcountry, HTV West, Anglia, the non-franchise ITV Thames Valley region and since 2006 HTV Wales, although between 2002 and 2006 the Welsh station's continuity was recorded and sent electronically to London. The complex also housed the continuity of ITV plc's digital channels ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV. The site also handled the playout of all the above until 2007, when the service was outsourced to Technicolor Network Services (TNS) (now part of Ericsson). The play-out is now run from Ericsson's broadcast centre in Chiswick. Ericsson now provides network feeds to transmission centres in Leeds (home of the Northern Transmission Centre, which was also originally taken over by TNS as part of the outsourcing deal) and Glasgow (STV). =ITV Studios= In 1994, Granada Group took over LWT and acquired the building. When ITV franchises were permitted to take one another over in the 1990s (which had previously been restricted), Carlton and Granada, between the two companies, eventually owned all the franchises in England and Wales. By the time the two companies merged in 2004, all of Carlton's studios had either been sold, or were surplus to requirements, so were sold soon after. Although the parent companies merged, and are now one (called ITV plc), Granada Television Ltd still exists as a subsidiary of ITV plc, and owns all ITV plc's studios (wholly in Leeds and London, and formerly as a joint venture with BBC Studios & Post Production in Manchester). The studios produced the bulk of original ITV Studios' programmes, but anyone could hire the studios, so the studios were often seen on other channels' programmes.

East Cork stalwarts Cloyne provided the opposition on that occasion. The first half was a close affair which saw Cloyne take a one-point lead at the interval. Na Piarsaigh, however, produced an exceptional second-half display and secured a 0‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì10 victory, with √ì hAilp√≠n finishing as the game's top scorer with five points.

He first appeared on 20 October 1994. Halliwell initially joined the show as part of the Dingle family and was only initially supposed to stay for a few episodes, but has become a key part of the show for over 25 years. Halliwell is currently the second longest serving male cast member. He has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Zak. Some of Zak's storylines have included his wife Nellie (Sandra Gough) divorcing him in 1997, marrying Lisa Clegg (Jane Cox) in 1998, having a daughter, Belle (Emily Mather; Eden Taylor-Draper) in 1998, the death of his son, Butch (Paul Loughran) in 2000, Lisa being raped in 2011, assaulting his son Cain (Jeff Hordley) and leaving him temporarily paralysed in 2011, suffering a mental breakdown also in 2012, trying to control his rebellious daughter, falling in love with and eventually marrying his lodger Joanie Wright (Denise Black). Storylines Zak arrives in the village in October 1994 and immediately challenges old bare-knuckle boxing adversary Ned Glover (Johnny Leeze) to a bare-knuckle fight, which he goes on to lose. Zak's family start a feud with the McAllister family over the death of his son, Ben (Steve Fury), following a fight with Luke McAllister (Noah Huntley) two months earlier. Despite discovering that Ben had a heart defect, the Dingles still blame Luke and force the family, except Luke, to leave the village. He is enraged to discover his daughter, Tina (Jacqueline Pirie) is in a relationship with Luke and attacks him until Tina tells him she is expecting Luke's baby. The truth is revealed when Tina humiliates Luke at the altar and tells him that there is no baby, in revenge for Ben's death. After Luke is killed in a car crash in August 1995, the Dingles and McAllisters put the feud aside. Zak's wife, Nellie (Sandra Gough) attends to her sick father, Jimmy in Ireland but does not return. Lisa Clegg (Jane Cox) enters Zak's life and they begin a relationship, and despite a few hiccups, they eventually marry. Lisa gives birth to a daughter, Belle (Emily Mather) at Christmas 1998, which is a shock as she did not know she was pregnant. Zak's and Lisa's happiness is tested when Nellie (now Maggie Tagney) returns and tries to win Zak back but is unsuccessful. When a bus crashes in the village, Butch is injured and his condition rapidly deteriorates and he dies, leaving Zak devastated at the second death of one of his sons. Fresh trauma comes when Zak learns Lisa worked on the bus's engine before it was roadworthy, leading to Zak blaming her for his son's death for a while but he eventually relents. Zak reveals to Cain (Jeff Hordley) that he is his real father as the result of an affair with Cain's mother, Faith (Gillian Jephcott; Sally Dexter). After some violent words, the two men accept the situation and a bond develops between them. In 2001, Zak discovers he has testicular cancer, confiding in long-time friend Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards), although Seth originally gets the wrong idea. Zak decides to not get treatment but Seth, his son Sam (James Hooton) and nephew Marlon (Mark Charnock) kidnap him and force him to come to his senses, he goes to hospital. As soon as he recovers, domestic harmony is shattered when his elderly mother, Peg (Jeanne Hepple), comes to stay. Zak blames Peg for the death of his father, Jed (Richard Mayes), believing she murdered him but when she reveals that Jed deserted them, they declare a truce. Zak later finds a dying Jed, who tells him of a fortune in Chile. Zak leaves to find the fortune, much to the shock of his family and in his absence, Lisa becomes close to Eddie Hope but realizes she still loves Zak and they reconcile on his return. Zak attacks Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) when he learns he is having an affair with his granddaughter Debbie (Charley Webb). When Debbie gives birth to a daughter, Sarah, Zak and Lisa help Debbie but she gives Sarah to Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor) as she is not ready to be a mother. Zak's youngest son, Sam (James Hooton), returns with his fiance, Alice Wilson (Ursula Holden- Gill) and they are expecting a child. Sam and Alice marry but Alice develops cancer and dies shortly after their son, Samson (Bradley Milnes) is born. Zak and the family rally round to help Sam. Zak strikes up a friendship with Rosemary King (Linda Thorson). He takes her at face value, despite her being devious and manipulative. They get on and she asks him to keep a discreet eye on her son, Grayson Sinclair (Christopher Villiers), and let her know what he is doing. She hires him as gamekeeper at Home Farm and confided family secrets, knowing she could trust him. Rosemary bonds with Belle and pays for her to attend private school but Zak cuts this associate short when he learns Rosemary has been poisoning her daughter-in-law Perdita Hyde-Sinclair (Georgia Slowe). When Cain is viciously attacked in December 2011, Zak is very uncomfortable to the extent he refuses to visit him hospital. He later reveals himself to Cain as his attacker when he discovers Cain is trying to get Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson) falsely imprisoned for the crime. Zak also confesses to Lisa and prepares hand himself in, but Cain keeps his father's involvement in the attack secret, and retracts his statement against Jai. Zak's guilt weighs heavily on him and disappears for long periods of time and begins drinking heavily. He takes Samson (now Sam Hall) poaching one day and accidentally leaves his phone in the van. Lisa and Sam are frantic with worry. Zak and Samson are later found by Megan Macey (Gaynor Faye), who calls Sam and he arrives to collect Samson and warns Zak to stay away from him. A few weeks later, a scan reveals some abnormalities in Zak's body, he is referred to a consultant to have some more scans. At the appointment with the radiologist, the doctor warns Zak that in the abnormalities could be pancreatic cancer, but also could be a simple curable form of the flu. However, an appointment later reveals that Zak does not have pancreatic cancer. Zak begins to act erratically and becomes paranoid, he is told by a vet that his chickens are healthy but in his paranoia and belief that there is something wrong, he kills them. He later starts believing he has cancer again and talks to a doctor about it, the doctor tells him he does not have cancer but Zak refuses to believe it and tells his family that he has cancer. It later becomes apparent that Zak has suffered a nervous breakdown and is later sectioned. On Christmas Day 2015, Belle reveals to Lisa that she'd seen Zak having an affair with their lodger Joanie Wright (Denise Black). Lisa is heartbroken by the news, and her and Zak separate. This separation effectively severs Zak's ties to the rest of the family, who convene at Wishing Well Cottage and decide to \\"excommunicate\\" Zak from the Dingles. Zak and Joanie then move in with the biological grandmother of Joanie's adoptive grandson Kyle, Kerry. Early in 2016, Zak tries to regain the attention of his estranged family, especially after they all begin to act rather out of character. Zak becomes determined to know what's going on, and he pesters Sam and Belle in the village shop to tell him the secret they're supposedly hiding. The two initially try to keep it together, but, pushed to her limit, Belle blurts out that Zak's great-nephew Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) was raped as a child by his father Gordon. Much like the rest of the family, Zak is devastated by the news, and Joanie begins to question his loyalties. After Joanie accepts Zak's proposal of marriage, they quickly plan their wedding and during the stag do put together at The Woolpack, Zak drinks too much and mistakenly calls Joanie 'Lisa' which causes her to panic and get cold feet. On the day of the wedding Zak is upset after thinking that Joanie has jilted him, however she arrives at the church late and they are eventually married. Despite his commitment to Joanie, Zak still remains close to Lisa causing Joanie and him to argue constantly. On Christmas Day, Joanie splits up with Zak due to his unresolved feelings for Lisa and he tried to reconcile with Lisa, who rejects him. When Joanie dies suddenly after being released from prison, Lisa comforts Zak in his grief and she accepts him. Lisa and Zak then get back together and in early 2018 Lisa, Zak and the Dingles protest to save their house from being torn down by Joe Tate. In May 2018 Lisa and Zak's relationship take a turn and Lisa tells Zak she has got a job offer in Scotland and has been called up to work there for a few months. In September it's revealed that Lisa is now travelling overseas and Zak offers to go with her so he leaves. In early 2019, it's revealed that Lisa has a deathly heart condition and hasn't got long left to live. Lisa then tells Charity that Zak can barely cope with the news and that she doesn't want Charity to tell anybody yet. Zak asked Lisa to marry him and after only two days of planning they married on 23 May 2019 in the church. Before the wedding, the Dingle's pigs escaped from their pen and were rounded up by Cain, Belle and Lisa in their wedding outfits causing Lisa's dress to become covered in mud. After the wedding, celebrations were held in the pub and Lisa went home to get changed as she did not want her wedding photos to be of her covered in mud. Zak went to find her and found her asleep on the sofa but when he tried to wake her up he realized that she had died. Casting He arrived with the rest of the Dingle family and along with the family was to \\"run riot through the rural tranquillity and put the muck back into the mix\\". The family where originally supposed to be \\"nothing more than a bit of spot of bother over a couple of episodes\\" but later were kept. In 2003 it was announced Halliwell was to take a break. This led him to comment that he had \\"no axe to grind\\" and it wasn't \\"about salary or storylines\\" and added \\"I love Zak, I love Emmerdale, but I've asked for a spell out to spend some quality time with my family and friends\\". In 2010, Halliwell said that his casting in Emmerdale was \\"the greatest break in my professional life\\". In September 2018 Halliwell had to take five months off from Emmerdale for health reasons, which he later revealed was due to having heart surgery. Halliwell returned to play Zak on 13 May 2019. Halliwell then left again in October 2019 with a storyline where he leaves to help Debbie in Scotland. But is expected to return soon Development ITV describe him as the \\"patriarch\\" of the Dingle family adding he is \\"Ostensibly a scrap dealer and pig farmer\\" although he spends \\"most of his time either doing nothing at all, or dreaming up scams and schemes\\". They also labelled him as occasionally being \\"a violent man\\" who is \\"prone to jealousy, however, he will do anything for a quiet life and a pint in the Woolpack!\\" Halliwell said that Zak was \\"brought in as a violent nutter, then after they introduced the rest of the family, this workshy, loveable rogue started to emerge, and they started writing more comic elements for the Dingles\\". Halliwell described the family saying they are \\"petty thieves\\" and \\"a bit part of the under class of life\\" who \\"still hold those old values that people are more important than money\\". He added that \\"[The Dingles] do strike a chord with a lot of people. Most of us will never be rich, so they can identify with the Dingles much easier than rich characters\\". What's on TV described him as a \\"General dodgy dealer\\" who is an \\"all round wrong 'un\\" and the \\"keeper of the 'Dingle code' ‚Äì which basically means that he makes sure all Dingles live on the wrong side of the law\\". Holy Soap described him as \\"head of the Dingle clan, Zak is the scallywag you can't help but have a soft spot for\\" before adding that he \\"has had several odd jobs over the years, but he tends to fill his coffers by masterminding several dodgy deals with his brother, Shadrach (Andy Devine).\\" Reception At the British Soap Awards in 2002 Halliwell was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of the part and Zak was nominated for Hero for his testicular cancer storyline. In 2007 he was again nominated for Best Actor. In a poll to find the \\"top soap bloke\\" of all time which was run by Loaded, Zak came fourth. The character was selected as one of the \\"top 100 British soap characters\\" by industry experts for a poll to be run by What's on TV, with readers able to vote for their favourite character to discover \\"Who is Soap's greatest Legend?\\" Fellow Emmerdale cast member James Hooton commented that said Steve Halliwell often gets recognised for his alter ego saying \\"Steve can't tie his shoelaces in the street without people noticing. It's the beard\\". A writer from Holy Soap named Zak's most memorable moment as being his introduction into the series; challenging Bernard McAllister to a bare knuckle fight.

Life He was born in Newcastle-on-Tyne. In early life he adopted the views of William Cobbett, and was active in promoting the agitation which resulted in the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. As secretary of the Northern Political Union of Whigs and Radicals he took a prominent part in forwarding the interests of Earl Grey and the reforming party. In 1858-1859, he was a member of the council of the Northern Reform Union; and to the last he was a keen observer of political events. He succeeded his father, George Doubleday, as partner in a firm of soap manufacturers at Newcastle, but devoted his attention rather to literature than to mercantile affairs. On the failure of the firm he obtained the office of registrar of St Andrews parish, Newcastle, a post which he held until appointed secretary to the coal trade. He died at Bulmans Village, Newcastle- on-Tyne in 1870. Works In 1832, published an Essay on Mundane Moral Government, and in 1842 he attacked some of the principles of Malthus in his True Law of Population. He also wrote A Political Life of Sir Robert Peel (London, 1856); A Financial, Statistical and Monetary History of England from 1688 (London, 1847); Matter for Materialists (London, 1870); The Eve of St Mark: a romance of Venice (London, 1857, concerning a Catholic exile in Venice in the late 16th century);XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A‚ÄìK (Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019). and three dramas, The Statue Wife, Diocletian and Caius Marius, in addition to some fishing songs, the folk song The Snows They Melt The Soonest and many contributions to various newspapers and periodicals. His song writing and poetry were generally written as a joint collaboration with his inseparable friend Robert Roxby. For fuller details see under Robert Roxby In 1857 he published an open letter to the Duke of Northumberland about the work of the Ancient Melodies Committee of the Society of Antiquaries; he welcomed their work, but criticised its slow progress. He pointed out, in particular, that the Northumbrian Smallpipes' closed fingering meant that it had a brilliant staccato sound, making it quite unsuitable for playing sentimental airs and waltzes, which was becoming common among some contemporary players. He argued instead that the instrument should be used for playing its traditional repertoire.

Black was born in Chicago, Illinois. He won awards at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival for an 18-minute short subject filmed in 1965 called Skaterdater. It had no dialogue, but used music and sound effects to advance the plot. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. He directed the 1968 cult film Pretty Poison, and subsequently concentrated on directing for television, occasionally directing films such as Private School. Black died of bacterial pneumonia in Santa Barbara, California on July 5, 2014. He was 77. Early life and education Black was born in Chicago on June 30, 1937. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in film from the University of California, Los Angeles. Career Black was under the influence of the French New Wave. \\"I longed to be the American Godard and Truffaut\\", he said. \\"I had the best intentions, but the reality of the American film business kicked in. After I left UCLA, I was determined to storm the Bastille by making my way into the industry with a short film.\\" =Skaterdater= Black wrote and directed the 17-18 minute film, Skaterdater (1965), which had no dialogue and was set in California. The short film was about a group of teenage boy skateboarders as well as the romance between one of them and a girl on a bicycle. Black raised $17,000 to make Skaterdater, which was shot with car and tricycle-mounted cameras. United Artists bought the short film for $50,000. The short film garnered the Palme d'Or for Best Short Film at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film at the 38th Oscar Ceremony (which it lost to Claude Berri's Le Poulet). Skaterdater drew the attention of executives at 20th Century Fox, who hired Black to direct Pretty Poison. \\"I didn‚Äôt begrudge UA the thousands they made from the short,\\" Black commented. \\"It led to 20th Century-Fox giving me the chance to make Pretty Poison, on which I was given fairly free rein.\\" =Pretty Poison= Black's directorial debut was Pretty Poison (1968), a black comedy film which starred Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld. The screenplay was written by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., and was based on the novel, She Let Him Continue (which was also the working title at the time), by Stephen Geller. Perkins plays a paroled arsonist who pretends to be a secret agent to win over a stunning blonde honors student, played by Weld. But despite a well- scrubbed facade, Weld's character is in fact a psychopath, and soon the pair are committing a string of crimes, including homicide. It was Black who decided to cast Perkins in the film: \\"I saw Tony (Perkins) in Neil Simon's The Star-Spangled Girl on Broadway and thought he‚Äôd be ideal. I sent him the script, and he wanted to do it. I then met him for the first time at Joe Allen's after a performance of the play. He had enormous charm and intelligence, the very qualities I wanted to come through in the role he would be playing. I was looking for the young Tony of Friendly Persuasion and Fear Strikes Out, not Psycho, although commentators naturally made the comparison between Norman Bates and the character in Pretty Poison.\\" Black took 30 days to shoot at lush locations around Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1967, with exactly one day in a studio for the scenes in the prison and an office. \\"While I was looking for the location in four states, I came across a lot of factories expelling worse things into rivers than shown in the film\\", Black recalled. During production, Black and Weld reportedly did not get along with each other. She often refused to do what Black demanded of her and would break down and cry. \\"Don‚Äôt talk to me about (Pretty Poison)\\", she said, \\"I couldn‚Äôt bear Noel Black (the director) even speaking to me. When he said 'good morning,' it destroyed my day.\\" Some reviewers panned the film, and when it did poorly at the box office, 20th Century Fox pulled it from theatres. But after other critics rose to the film's defense, the studio soon rereleased it, and it found a cult following. \\"I don‚Äôt mind, especially as Pretty Poison is what people like to call 'a cult classic'\\", said Black. \\"Most of my few other features were done for money. I had two wives and two children to support.\\" Pretty Poison was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Screenplay in 1968. In 1969, Black spoke about his film to students at Boston University. \\"Essentially, we saw it as a story with many comedic elements in a serious framework ‚Äî a kind of black comedy or existential humor of which Dr. Strangelove is a prototype\\", he said. \\"We hoped people would take it on more than one level.\\" The film was released on DVD in 2006 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. \\"Lorenzo Semple Jr.'s screenplay is beautifully worked out, and the director, Noel Black, does a superb job of modulating the film's conflicting elements: the coming-of-age story and the thriller\\", Charles Taylor said in a New York Times review on the occasion of the film's DVD release, in 2006. =Cover Me Babe and Jennifer on My Mind= Black's next film, Cover Me Babe (1970), was about a film student who embraces the avant-garde. The film starred Sam Waterston, Sondra Locke and Robert Forster. Like Pretty Poison, Cover Me Babe was also released by 20th Century Fox. The subsequent film Black directed afterwards was Jennifer on My Mind (1971), and its screenplay was written by Erich Segal, who was known for his novel, Love Story. Both of these films were flops. \\"The gold-plated nail in my career coffin was pounded when, after the box-office failure of Pretty Poison, I accepted a dreadful project, Cover Me Babe, that never should have been made\\", Black remarked. \\"I reckoned that it was better to stay active than to wait for a project I believed in. That was a mistake. It was followed by another mistake, Jennifer on My Mind, one of the dozens of unsuccessful drug pictures at the time.\\" =1970s television work= \\"For five years after the two flops, I devoted myself to writing scripts\\", Black continued. \\"Finally in 1976, I decided to get back into directing through episodic television. The idea of it scared me because I had started in the film business at the top with my own feature.\\" Black went on to write scripts and direct television shows like Kojak and Quincy, M.E. in the mid-1970s. He also directed Ron Howard in an adaptation of Sherwood Anderson's I'm a Fool, which served as a 1977 episode for the PBS series, The American Short Story. He also directed episodes of such other TV series as McCloud, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and Hawaii Five-O. =Marianne/Mirrors, A Man, a Woman, and a Bank and Private School= Black attempted a return to the big screen in 1978 with a voodoo horror film initially titled Marianne. Having suffered editorial meddling and script changes, it remained unreleased for six years, until it reappeared on video six years later under the title Mirrors. The film stars Kitty Winn and Peter Donat. Black officially returned to the big screen with A Man, a Woman, and a Bank (1979), a caper comedy film starring Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams and Paul Mazursky. Roger Ebert on A Man, a Woman and a Bank: \\"Since he made the legendary Pretty Poison in 1968, Black's career has drifted from TV assignments to obscure features and back again. He's never really been able to duplicate the freshness of that first success.\\" The film was distributed by Avco Embassy. Black also directed the sex comedy Private School (1983), starring Phoebe Cates and Matthew Modine. In her review of the film, The New York Times critic Janet Maslin mentioned that Pretty Poison earned Black a footnote in American film history. \\"Private School won‚Äôt warrant another one.\\" =1980s and 90s television work= Black continued his television work by directing television films including: The Golden Honeymoon (1980) and The Hollow Boy (1991) for PBS; The Electric Grandmother (1982) for NBC; The Other Victim (1981), with William Devane, and Promises to Keep (1985), starring Robert Mitchum, for CBS. He also directed episodes of the 1980s version of The Twilight Zone. Unrealized projects =The Adventures of Augie March= Immediately after Pretty Poison, Black co-wrote, with Fred Segal, a screen adaptation of Saul Bellow's The Adventures of Augie March, one of many projects that failed to come to fruition. =Railroad Bill biopic= Black was to have directed a biopic depicting the life of Railroad Bill, with Erich Segal as screenwriter. =Killer= In 1974, there was a vain possibility of making a film called Killer, written by Richard Maltby, for New Line Cinema. =A Change of Seasons= After he saw the film A Man, a Woman, and a Bank, film producer Martin Ransohoff hired Black to direct Shirley MacLaine and Anthony Hopkins in Consenting Adults, later to be titled A Change of Seasons (1980). However, Black had been removed from the film after shooting the first half of it due to creative differences. =Psycho IV= Towards the end of Anthony Perkins' life, he fought long and hard to get Black to direct Psycho IV (1990), but that too was in vain. Personal life and death Black was married twice, to Sandra MacPhail and Catherine Cownie. Both marriages ended in divorce. Black had two children, a daughter Nicole and a son Marco, from his marriage to MacPhail. Marco Black was \\"inspired to join the family business\\" by his father, and he has worked as a unit production manager on CBS's Extant and an assistant director on such films as Old School (2003). On July 5, 2014, Black died in Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, located in Santa Barbara, California, of bacterial pneumonia at the age of 77. He is survived by his two children, as well as his son-in-law Renaud Gonthier, and his five grandchildren: Morgan, Cameron, Sidney, Hayden and John.

The top half of the shield was blue, with a leopard in natural color surmounted by a white five-pointed star. Leopards are a common motif in Somali culture. Official description The Constitution of Somalia describes the coat of arms of the nation as follows:Provisional Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia The emblem of the Federal Republic of Somalia [...] is a blue shield with a gold frame, in the centre of which is a silver-coated, five-pointed star. The shield is surmounted by a decorated emblem with five golden heads, with two lateral ones halved. The shield is borne from the sides by two cheetahs facing each other under the lower point of the shield, along with two palm leaves, which are interlaced with a white ribbon.

It is thought to correspond roughly to the area where the Condrusi lived. The Condrusi were one of the peoples described by Julius Caesar as Germani Cisrhenani. They survived the Roman invasion and lived in what is now eastern Belgium, during the Roman period.  Name  They are mentioned as Condrusos and Condrusi by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, 2:4; 6:32 and as Condurses by Orosius (early 5th c. AD).Orosius. Historiae Adversus Paganos, 6:7:14, entry 1967. The meaning of the name Condrusi is unclear. The prefix is most likely the Gaulish con-/com- ('with, together, as well'), and although the translation of the element -drus- is unknown, it is also generally regarded as Celtic. The Condroz region, attested as Pagus Condrustis on an inscription dated 150‚Äì160 AD,Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, VII:1073 and as pagus Condrustus in medieval documents, is named after the Germanic tribe. Language From their personal and tribal names we know that the Germani cisrhenani were heavily influenced by the Gaulish language.See Neumann 1984. From other information, including the contemporary reports of Julius Caesar and Tacitus, we know that they were also heavily influenced by Germanic peoples on the east of the Rhine river. Whether the Germani cisrhenani in Belgium ever actually spoke a Germanic language is uncertain.See Petrokovits In any case it was claimed by Tacitus that these Germani were the first people called Germani, and that the term Germani as it came to be widely used was not the original meaning. He also said that the descendants of the original Germani in his time were the Tungri.Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, non gentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur. (The Condrusi were one of the peoples living within the civitas of the Tungri.)  Geography  Late medieval Catholic archdeaconries of Condroz (yellow) and Famenne (orange). The Condrusi probably dwelt in the Condroz region, an area of foothills situated northwest of the Ardennes, south and west of the Meuse, southwest of Li√®ge and southeast of Namur. Their territory, like that of the Segni, was located between that of the Treveri and Eburones. At the time of Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), they lived as clients of the Treveri. During the Roman period, the Pagus Condrustis was one of the subdivisions of the civitas Tungrorum, founded ca. 10 BC as a Roman military base. The oldest known definitions of the medieval pagus of Condroz also included the region of neighbouring Famenne. Contrary to the late medieval archdeaconries of Condroz and Fammene, the early medieval pagus Condrustis did not encompass the deaneries of St Remacle, Hanret, or Chimay.  Religion  Viradecthis (also attested under the Celtic form Virodactis) was the protector-goddess of the Condrusi. Assimilated with the Roman deity of childbirth Lucina, she was honoured ca. 200‚Äì250 AD at a sanctuary located in Str√©e (Modave, Condroz),L'Ann√©e √âpigraphique, 1968:311 and by a Condrusian soldier serving in the Roman army at Hadrian's Wall. Tungrian sailors celebrated her cult in Fectio (ca. 150‚Äì250 AD),Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, XIII:8815 and other inscriptions were found further east in the Rhineland (Mogontiacum, K√§lbertshausen, Trebur). Several inscriptions were dedicated to the Matris Cantrusteihiae, which seems to mean \\"mother goddess of the Condrusi (or Condroz)\\".  History  =Caesar= Most of what we know about the Condrusi comes from Julius Caesar's record of his battles in the area, in Gallic Wars. In chapter 2.4 of Caesar's commentaries the Condrusi are specifically listed among the Germani cisrhenani, along with the Eburones, the Caeroesi, and the Paemani. At that time, in 57 BC, they were joining an alliance of Belgic tribes against Caesar. The alliance met with defeat against the Romans at the Battle of the Sabis, but some, including many of the Germani, most notably the Eburones, renewed fighting in 54 BC. Caesar stated that these Germani cisrhenani had crossed the Rhine long ago to take control of the fertile land on the other side. They mixed with the local Belgae, and Caesar noted that neighbouring Belgae claimed to be partly of Germanic descent also. The Germani cisrhenani, who included the Condrusi, kept a distinct identity, and a reputation for military strength, because they were the only Gauls who successfully resisted the Cimbri and Teutones during their migrations in the second century BC.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 2.4 In 4.6 Caesar reports that the Condrusi were under the protection of the Treveri along with the Eburones. How this circumstance came about is not known, but their territories were thereby not invaded by the Usipetes and Tencteri who had lost their own lands to Suebi and then crossed the Rhine into the lands of the Menapii.4.6 In 6.32 the Condrusi are again mentioned as Germani \\"on this side of the Rhine\\" (citra Rhenum), this time along with the Segni (or Segui), as a German tribe claiming not to be involved in the rebellion. Both tribes were reported to live between the Eburones and the Treviri.6.32 =Roman Empire= After their defeat or capitulation, the Germani cisrhenani became part of the civitas Tungrorum in Roman province of Gallia Belgica. But this civitas was eventually split out to become part of Germania Inferior. An inscription from Blatobulgium (an outpost fort of Hadrian's Wall in modern Scotland) dated 150‚Äì160 AD, along with a Roman military diploma giving Condrusus as the ethnic origin of the soldier,Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, XVI:125 show that Gallo-Roman Condrusians served as auxilia within the Roman armies, and could acquire the citizenship at the end of their service. =Middle Ages= The name of the pagus Condrustis survived not only into Roman times but into the Carolingian era also, being mentioned as a pagus or gau in the early Middle Ages. In this way, the name, like many medieval territorial names, has managed to survive down to the present day, at least as a geographical term. The earliest medieval attestation was in 747, in a benefaction made by Carloman, son of Charles Martel, to the Abbey of Stavelot- Malmedy. It was clearly mentioned in the Treaty of Meerssen in 870, where it is called the pagus of Condrust.

Lisa's storylines include being raped by her colleague Derek Benrose (Stephen Bent), becoming a parent in later life, assaulting a police officer, suffering an angina attack, dealing with her daughter's psychosis and discovering that her husband Zak (Steve Halliwell) has fallen in love with their lodger Joanie Wright (Denise Black), which led to their divorce after 18 years of marriage. On 7 May 2018, the character left the village and Emmerdale confirmed Cox was taking a sabbatical from the show. Lisa returned on 8 March 2019, and revealed that she had been diagnosed with amyloidosis. Cox then announced that she had quit her role, and that Lisa would be killed off. Lisa made her final on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 24 May 2019. Cox briefly returned for voiceovers on 6 June 2019 and 15 and 16 October 2020. Storylines Lisa meets Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and they develop feelings for one another. However, Lisa accepts a marriage proposal from Zak's brother Albert Dingle (Bobby Knutt). Lisa's former husband, Barry Clegg (Bernard Wrigley), tries to stop the wedding and Zak declares his love for her. Barry causes the Dingle's barn to explode when he builds a rocket. Despite their problems, Zak and Lisa marry. Various family troubles kept them busy during that year, but Zak and Lisa were surprised when Lisa went out to the barn and went into labour, when Lisa didn't know she was pregnant. The arrival of baby Belle (Emily Mather; later Eden Taylor-Draper) served to deepen Zak and Lisa's marriage, even surviving the nightmare that was Zak's ex-wife Nellie's stay in the village. Lisa was deeply saddened when Zak's son Butch (Paul Loughran) was killed in a bus crash in the village. She even moved out when it was clear Zak blamed her as she'd fixed the brakes on the vehicle before it crashed. After a few months, Zak realised he could not live without Lisa and begged her to move back in. In 2001, tragedy hit again when Zak was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Zak overcame the illness with Lisa's support and repaid his wife by inviting his mother Peg to move in. With Peg around, tensions in the Dingle household reached fever pitch. When she went, everyone was relieved. The family was split again when Zak went off to South America in 2002 in search of the Dingle treasure - without Lisa's blessing. With her husband away, Lisa felt vulnerable - especially with Zak's brother, Shadrach (Andy Devine), coming on to her all the time. In the end, Lisa resorted to violent tactics to make Shadrach back off and was relieved he got the message. Although she enjoyed a few dates with Bob Hope's (Tony Audenshaw) brother Eddie (Nigel Betts), it was clear that Zak was still the man for Lisa - a fact confirmed by his return and their subsequent reunion. Lisa and Zak were shocked to discover that Zak's granddaughter Debbie (Charley Webb) was pregnant and no one was aware of her pregnancy. Lisa felt she had let Debbie down and was determined to give her all the support she needed to bring up baby Sarah. Unfortunately, Debbie couldn't cope with being a mother. She did everything she could to avoid looking after her daughter which infuriated Lisa, causing many rows and this left Lisa at the end of her tether. So when Debbie gave baby Sarah to Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor), who then disappeared, Lisa hit the roof. Unable to bear the sight of Debbie, Lisa was relieved when she departed the Dingle home. More tragedy was to hit the family when Zak's son, Sam (James Hooton), announced his girlfriend Alice Wilson (Ursula Holden-Gill) was pregnant ‚Äì only for that news to be followed by the revelation that Alice had cancer. Lisa proved to be the backbone of the family as everyone tried to prepare Sam for Alice's death and looking after their baby son, Samson, alone. The morning of the competition in Emmerdale 5000th episode, Lisa accidentally knocked out Val Lambert (Charlie Hardwick) by pushing her down some stairs while carrying a big bag of linens. Lisa and Val had been feuding, and Lisa worried Val might have it out for her. Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) tied and gagged Val whilst Lisa was gone, intending to ransom her. Val was fuming at the Dingles until Lisa accidentally let it slip that Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) was planning the wedding for that day. Val and Eric did get married, in front of friends and family. Lisa was relieved when Belle's time at private school came to an end. She went there initially because Rosemary King (Linda Thorson) realised how intelligent Belle was and offered to pay the fees. Anything else, from the uniform to school trips, were to be funded by the Dingles. But when Rosemary left the village, she stopped paying the fees and it was a struggle for Zak and Lisa to pay them. They borrowed a lot of money from Debbie, leading her to get into trouble with Carl King (Tom Lister), who she borrowed the money from. After Zak quit his job at Home Farm, following a row over breakages Matthew King (Matt Healy) insisted Zak pay for, Belle's friends found out that Zak hadn't paid the fees and teased her about it. So, recognising the problem, Zak and Lisa removed her from the private school and re-enrolled her into state school. In April 2009, Lisa's blind cousin, Lizzie Lakely (Kitty McGeever) arrived, and Lisa got her a job working at Sharma & Sharma alongside her. Lisa also managed to create a bond between Debbie and her daughter, Sarah. Andy agreed to let the Dingles see Sarah regularly, and by getting Debbie to visit at the same time as Sarah and play with her, a mother-daughter bond developed. Towards Christmas 2009, Lisa started nude modelling as the Dingles needed the extra cash for Christmas in order to buy Belle a laptop and other presents for family. When Lisa told Zak how tight fisted she thought Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) was, Zak grew suspicious as Lisa had said the money for Belle's laptop came from a work bonus. Lisa was forced to tell Zak the truth. He initially wasn't happy she kept it from him, but he came round. When Eli and Shadrach found out, they kept making wisecracks so Lisa decided to stop due to the lack of support from people round her, after admitting to Zak that she felt good about herself. Also towards Christmas, Lizzie was knocked down in the dark by Zak's great-nephew, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), as he was angry over his discovery that he was gay. She dropped her purse and Lisa was horrified, determined to know who it was. Soon after, Aaron returned Lizzie's purse to her, but refused a reward, as she didn't know who he really was. Later, Lisa accidentally punched a police officer, was arrested, and was sentenced to three months imprisonment. Upon her release in late 2010, Derek Benrose began working at the Sharma Sweet Factory alongside Lisa. They formed a close friendship, and Zak got on well with Derek too, but in January 2011, after agreeing to work overtime with Lisa, Derek took advantage of the fact they were alone and raped Lisa, Lisa faced further heartache in March, when she eventually told the police about her rape and they didn't have enough evidence to pursue a case against Derek. Lisa is furious because of this, but resigns herself to get over it. By the end of 2011, Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) had turned the whole village against himself as his conniving ways had gotten everyone fed up with him. In December 2011, Cain got justice when he was attacked and later found badly beaten on the verge of death. The main suspects in the attack were John Barton (James Thornton) and Jai Sharma (Chris Bisson), who both had reasons for Cain's comeuppance; John's wife Moira Barton (Natalie J. Robb) had an affair with Cain, while Jai and Cain were sworn enemies due to his history with Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). Lisa herself believed it may have been Jai, but it all came to a head in January 2012, after Aaron broke Jai's window; Zak confessed to all that he was Cain's attacker. Lisa was utterly shocked, but stood by her husband while Cain decided not to press charges, but his relationship with the rest of the Dingle clan became strained. In April 2012 Lisa began to notice some changes in Zak; he had been consumed in paranoia over his chickens, and while a vet confirmed they were fine, Zak had them all killed. Alarmed, the family put it down to Zak's cancer returning, but doctors later confirmed Zak was suffering a mental breakdown, and he was sectioned. While Zak was eventually reunited with his family, he still felt guilty over his acts. Chas Dingle's (Lucy Pargeter) boyfriend Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) was sent to prison for the murders of Carl, Alex Moss (Kurtis Stacey) and Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams), but he escaped and took the entire Woolpack hostage, including Zak, who was nearly shot by Cameron when he engaged in a struggle with him. Zak, along with most of The Woolpack (excluding Debbie and Chas), was freed by Cameron, to a relieved (but still worried) Lisa's joy, that her husband had escaped. The duo are later relieved when Debbie and Chas both escape together whilst Cameron is killed after unintentionally electrocuting himself in The Woolpack. A feud between the Dingles and the Andrews family ignited when Belle's boyfriend Sean Spencer (Luke Roskell) was found to have gotten Belle's friend Gemma Andrews (Tendai Rinomhota) pregnant. Lisa forbade Sean from seeing Belle again and forced him out when he visited to try to make amends. In April 2014, tragedy struck as Belle pushed Gemma over during an argument, and the latter banged her head on a stone, causing a brain hemorrhage which proved fatal. The two warring families then made peace after this event, but Belle was consumed by guilt and in July 2014, plead guilty to manslaughter after initially planning to confess to murder, but changed her mind at the insistence of Cain. Belle was sentenced to three months in a young offender's unit and Lisa was distraught. Stress continued to pile on to Lisa throughout the months as Charity's life spiralled out of control when her husband Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) attempted to kill her, and Sam's girlfriend Rachel Breckle (Gemma Oaten) was forced to go into hiding to cover for her, and it all came crashing down in October 2014 when Lisa, after welcoming Belle home against her boss Jai's wishes, was sacked from Sharma & Sharma, and suffered what she believed to be a heart attack as she cried herself home. Lisa's health scare lead to her being diagnosed with angina, and what she suffered was an angina attack. She would have to rest a lot more now, so Zak took up most of the household chores for Lisa's sake. After months of Belle's increasingly wavey and disturbing behaviour, Zak and Lisa discovered she had been hearing Gemma's voice in her head after she almost ran over Zak. This was found to be fueled by a drug addiction introduced to Belle by local teen Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson). They pledged to help her when Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) told the Dingles she knew of Belle's condition, but things went from bad to worse when Katie was found dead and Belle assumed bad events, such as Gemma and Katie's deaths, happened when she was around, and deciding the world would be better without her, almost jumped from the top of a barn roof, but was talked out of it by Harriet Finch (Katherine Dow Blyton), and caught by Cain when she lost her balance. Following this emotional rollercoaster, Belle was sent to an institute to help her problem, though she could not attend Katie's funeral, which upset her greatly. When Belle was released, Lisa was relieved to have all her family reunited. Throughout the summer of 2015, Lisa had vacated Emmerdale to dote on Granny Clegg, who had suffered a fall and needed care. She returned in September to find out that a helicopter had crashed into the village hall during Debbie's failed wedding to Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan). Lisa also introduced Granny Clegg's secret cordial wine recipe to Belle and her new business partner Kirin Kotecha (Adam Fielding). They showcased their opportunistic proposal to Lisa's former boss Jai and went into business, attempting to sell \\"Granny Clegg's Cordial\\" to big-buck supermarkets. However, concern was inevitable to Lisa as she began to suspect Belle and Kirin to be in a more \\"physical\\" relationship, so she had Debbie talk to her about intimate matters. Disgusted, Belle briefly began to drift away from Lisa, to her heartache, but they eventually sorted matters out. It was just Zak they had to watch out for. On Christmas Day 2015, Belle reveals to the family that she had seen Zak and the lodger Joanie Wright (Denise Black) together, making Lisa heartbroken. Zak is then exiled from the family. Lisa's self-esteem drops to an all-time low as a result of the impending dissolution of her marriage, despite the Dingles' especially Belle's, efforts to support her. She is then knocked for six after Cain informs the entire family of a devastating truth; Aaron was raped repeatedly from the age of 8 by his father, Gordon Livesy (Gary Mavers). Lisa finally finds some common ground with Aaron considering the fact they have both been sexually abused. Lisa turns 60, and she is advised by Belle to make a fresh start, so Lisa buys a stunning dress and has herself done up at Bernice Blackstock's (Samantha Giles) beauty salon and she rocks The Woolpack to a very enigmatic Dingle clan. She shocks Belle by telling Zak and Joanie to come to The Woolpack during the party, intending to surprise them. Surprise is a thing that Lisa certainly delivers when she reveals that she has been to see a solicitor, and is divorcing Zak. This effectively ends their 18 year long marriage. Lisa is devastated to learn that Zak and Joanie are getting married. She later has to deal with a fresh family crisis when it's found out that Belle has been having an affair with a married man over twice her age, Dr. Jermaine Bailey (Micah Balfour), who actually treated Lisa for an angina attack not long before the revelation. Initially the family is disgusted with Bailey, and Cain and Zak even try to rough him up, only to be stopped by Lisa, who argues that in this case, the \\"Dingle\\" way of dealing with things won't work this time. The affair seems over, but Belle suddenly reveals she is pregnant with Bailey's baby, which results in him staying in the village after planning to leave due to the collapse of his medical career and marriage. Lisa mediates a reluctant truce between Bailey and the Dingles, and allows him to move into the home. Joanie asks Belle to be her bridesmaid and Lisa encourages an increasingly agitated Belle to do what she feels right, so she accepts Joanie's request, upsetting Lisa. However, Belle brings home the wrong dress from Joanie's hen night, and the day after, Joanie comes to pick it up and discovers it has a huge wine stain. Lisa owns up to it, and agrees to fix it for the wedding, secretly hoping to convince everyone she is fine with the wedding. Joanie has cold feet on her wedding day, but Lisa convinces Joanie that she should marry Zak, as he is in love with her. As Joanie and Zak say their wedding vows, Lisa looks on and is distraught that Zak has chosen to marry another woman. At an angina check up, the receptionist calls for \\"Mrs. Dingle\\" and both Lisa and Joanie answer, when it is Joanie the doctor is looking for. Lisa then makes the decision to change back to her maiden name. The other Dingles are upset by this, believing that Lisa no longer considers them family, and a Dingle meeting is called in The Woolpack. They convince Lisa to keep Dingle as her surname. When Joanie is released from prison, after serving time for assault, Lisa picks her up in her van. When Joanie inquires as to why Lisa is picking her up, Lisa pulls the van over and they discuss Zak. Joanie goes into cardiac arrest in front of Lisa, who informs Zak about Joanie's death. Together, they break the news to the other villagers in The Woolpack. After Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty spikes her drink causing a near-fatal cardiac arrest, Lisa has her arrested, drawing the ire of the Dingles and nearly causing a schism in the family. Lisa ultimately decides life in Emmerdale is no longer enjoyable so she opts to leave for Scotland, where she takes a job as a youth counselor. She briefly returns a few weeks later to clarify to Zak that she still loves him but she cannot stay in the village and be happy. Lisa plans to return to the village when Lachlan White nearly kills Belle in September 2018, but this falls through. Zak goes to stay with Lisa in Scotland in October, later extending the visit into 2019. Lisa summons Charity to Scotland and informs her that she is dying due to amyloidosis, and wants her to write a eulogy for her funeral even though doctors say Lisa still has ample time left. Zak is aware of Lisa's illness and is apparently not coping, so Lisa urges Charity to avoid informing the rest of the Dingles, including Belle, of her condition. Zak asked Lisa to marry him and after only two days of planning they married on 23 May 2019 in the church. Before the wedding, the Dingle's pigs escaped from their pen and were rounded up by Cain, Belle and Lisa in their wedding outfits causing Lisa's dress to become covered in mud. After the wedding, celebrations were held in the pub and Lisa went home to get changed as she did not want her wedding photos to be of her covered in mud. Zak went to find her and found her asleep on the sofa but when he tried to wake her up he realized that she had died. Casting Lisa Clegg was first introduced by producer Mervyn Watson in 1996 who cast Jane Cox for the role. Lisa first appeared in August 1996, as a potential love interest for Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) after his wife Nellie Dingle (Sandra Gough) left to care for her father in Ireland. Jane Cox really loved the idea to play Lisa Clegg in Emmerdale. In an interview shortly after landing the role of Lisa, Jane stated [...] 'I was told that Lisa was a big lady and most comfortable in wellington boots [...] . Jane Cox had originally auditioned for the role of Nellie Dingle. However Mervyn Watson gave the role to Sandra Gough, Cox was pleased she got the part of Lisa Clegg instead because she really enjoyed the character. [...] She's very practical and down to earth. I like the fact that she spends most of the time in a boiler suit but can be sassy.[...] =Departure and brief returns= On 8 March 2019, during a special episode to commemorate International Women's Day, the character returned after a temporary break and told Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) that she had been diagnosed with terminal heart condition amyloidosis. After the episode aired, Cox announced that she had quit Emmerdale after nearly 23 years, and Lisa was killed off on 23 May 2019. Cox made a brief return for a voiceover on 6 June 2019, as each family member read a letter from Lisa. Cox also returned for another voiceover in 2020, as part of Belle Dingle's mental health storyline. The voiceover was broadcast on October 15 and 16, 2020. Reception Cox was nominated in the category of \\"Best Actress\\" at the 2011 British Soap Awards.

Amir was a major leader of the left during the revolution. He was killed in 1948 by Indonesian troops following his involvement in the Madiun Affair. Early life Born into Sumatran aristocracy in the city of Medan, Amir's wealthy background and outstanding intellectual abilities allowed him to enter the most elite schools; he was educated in Haarlem and Leiden in the Netherlands before gaining a law degree in Batavia (now Jakarta). During his time in the Netherlands he studied Eastern and Western philosophy under the tutelage of the Theosophical Society. Amir converted from Islam to Christianity in 1931. Dutch East Indies and Japanese Occupation In the early 1930s, Amir was active in literary and journalist circles, joining the editorial board of the newspaper Panorama, together with Liem Koen Hian, Sanusi Pane and Mohammad Yamin. In mid-1936, together with his colleagues Liem, Pane and Yamin, Amir started another newspaper, Kebangoenan (1936‚Äì1941), which--as with Panorama--was published by Phoa Liong Gie's Siang Po Printing Press. In 1937, towards the end of the Dutch period, Amir led a group of younger Marxists in the establishment of Gerindo ('Indonesian People's Movement'), a radical co-operating party opposed to international fascism as its primary enemy. The Soviet Union‚Äôs Dimitrov doctrine had called for a common front against fascism which helped swell the number of Indonesians taking a cooperative approach with regards to the Dutch colonial administration in an attempt to secure Indonesian independence. Gerindo was one of the more significant cooperative parties in the years leading to World War II whose objectives included a fully Indonesian legislature; It had modest goals in comparison to the Dutch-suppressed radical nationalists led by the likes of Sukarno and Hatta, who Sjarifuddin had met before the War. By 1940, Dutch intelligence suspected him of being involved with the Communist underground. Having watched the increased strength and influence of Imperial Japan, Amir was one of a number of Indonesian leaders who warned against the danger of fascism before the war. Prior to the Netherlands' invasion by Japan's ally Germany, the Netherlands Indies was a major exporter of raw materials to East Asia and to this end, Amir's groups had promoted boycotts against Japan. It is thought that his prominent role in these campaigns prompted the head of Dutch intelligence to provide Amir with 25,000 guilders in March 1942 to organise an underground resistance movement against Japan through his Marxist and nationalist connections. At this point, the Dutch colonial administration was crumbling against the Japanese onslaught and the top Dutch military fled Indonesia for Australia. Upon their occupation of Indonesia, the Japanese enforced total suppression of any opposition to their rule. Most Indonesian leaders obliged either by becoming 'neutral observers' or by actively cooperating. Sjarifuddin was the only prominent Indonesian politician next to Sutan Sjahrir to organize active resistance. The Japanese arrested Sjarifuddin in 1943 and he escaped execution only due to intervention from Sukarno, whose popularity in Indonesia - and hence importance to the war effort - was recognised by the Japanese. Indonesian National Revolution As a cabinet minister, and later prime minister, Amir aligned himself with the generally older group of political leaders who, in establishing Indonesian independence, emphasised the need for diplomacy and the formation of sound political structures. This group struggle contrasted with the alternative and generally younger alternative political leadership advocating struggle; the vying for influence between these two groups was a defining feature of the Indonesian National Revolution. =Socialist Party= In 1945, he was the most widely known and respected Republican politician to consider himself communist. Although Amir had been in contact with the 'illegal' Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he had nothing but disdain for the 'unsophisticated' and unknown Marxists who re-established it in 1935. His closest colleagues from the 'illegal PKI' underground and the pre-war Gerindo formed the Socialist Party of Indonesia (PARSI) on 1 November 1945. At a two- party conference on 16‚Äì17 December it was announced that Amir's PARSI would merge with Sjahrir's political grouping, the Socialist People's Party (PARAS), forming the Socialist Party (PS). The Socialist Party quickly became the strongest pro-government party, especially in Yogyakarta and East Java. The party accepted the argument of Amir and its other leaders that the time was not ripe to implement socialism, rather that international support necessary for independence be sought, and that unruly constituents had to be opposed. The party's westernised leaders showed more faith in Netherlands left-wing forces, than in the revolutionary fervour of the Indonesian people, which became a source of discontent among the party's opponents. = Cabinet minister = ;Information Minister Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 and the proclamation of Indonesian independence two days later, the Republic announced its first ministry on 4 September. The seventeen-member cabinet was composed mostly of 'collaborating' nationalists;Most Indonesian nationalist leaders saw the Japanese Occupation of Indonesia as an opportunity to take advantage of in their pursuit of independence. Their consequent cooperation with the Japanese saw the returning Dutch brand them 'collaborators', and thus illegitimate leaders, in an attempt to undermine support for the newly proclaimed Republic. Amir, appointed as Information Minister, was however, still imprisoned by the Japanese following his 1942-43 anti-Japanese underground activities. Early in the Revolution, Amir worked closely with the first Prime Minister and Sukarno's rival, Sutan Sjahrir; the two played the major role in shaping the arrangements linking the new government of Indonesia with its people remarkably effectively. On 30 October Amir, along with Sukarno and Hatta, was flown into the East Java city of Surabaya by the desperate British caretaker administration. The three were seen as the only Indonesian leaders likely able to quell fighting between Republican and British Indian forces in which the British Brigade were hopelessly outnumbered and facing annihilation. A ceasefire was immediately adhered to, but fighting soon recommenced after confused communications and mistrust between the two sides, leading to the Battle of Surabaya. ;Minister for Defence On 16 October 1945, Sjahrir and Amir took control of the KNIP. and following 11 November transition to parliamentary government, Amir was appointed to a new cabinet with Sjahrir as Prime Minister.President Sukarno accepted a proposal for cabinet to answer to the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) acting as Parliament rather than to the President. This watershed event ushered in the so-called 'liberal' or parliamentary form of government, which prevailed against the Sukarnoist-proposed constitution for twelve years. Leadership was thus handed to a 'modernizing' Western-minded intellectual, who at the time were thought to be the coming leaders of Asia and more palatable to Western ideas of government. When considered against previous forms of government--indigenous Indonesian, Dutch, Japanese and even the first brief Republican government--this was the most revolutionary political change at a national level during the 1945-50 Revolution. ( Described as 'a man even his political adversaries found difficult to hate', he played a key role as Minister of Defence. His position, however, was a source of friction with the TKR and its new commander, Sudirman, who had nominated their own candidate, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono IX. (The Sultan, however, was not eager to contest the position). Amir was a central figure in the government's 'anti-fascist' programme with the army a key target, which caused further frictions. Sjahrir attacked PETA-trained army officers as 'traitors', 'fascists', and 'running dogs' who had cooperated with the Japanese. Amir promoted the Red Army as a model of a citizens' army loyal to the government and holding socialist ideals. On 19 February 1946, Amir inaugurated a socialist and Masyumi politician-dominated 'education staff' for the army. The body appointed fifty-five 'political officers' at the end of May without consulting the army command. These new officers were to educate each TRI unit in the goals of the revolution. He was not, however, able to effectively impose such ideals on unit commanders, particularly as Sudirman and other PETA-trained resented the 'fascist' slur cast on them. The Marxist's overtones of Amir's new military academies conflicted with the popular army view of being above politics and the need to play a unifying role in the national struggle; the army leadership consequently rejected attempts to introduce partisan ideology and alignments. This antagonism between the government and PETA-trained officers, forced Amir to find an armed support base elsewhere. He aligned himself with sympathetic Dutch-educated officers in certain divisions, such as the West Java 'Siliwangi' Division the command of which had been assumed by KNIL Lieutenant A.H. Nasution in May 1946. Another source of support for the new cabinet was the more educated armed pemuda sympathetic to the cabinet's 'anti-fascist' approach. With an engaging personality and persuasive oratory skills, Amir had more time and aptitude than Sjahrir for party building, and he played the main part in wooing these pemuda. = Prime Ministership = A split between Amir's and Prime Minister Sjahrir's supporters rapidly deepened in 1947. There had long been mutual suspicion between Sjahrir and the communists who had returned from the Netherlands in 1946; the fading of the 'anti-fascist' cause made these suspicions more obvious. Sjahrir's preoccupation with diplomasi, his physical isolation in Jakarta from revolution-infused Central Java, and is dislike of mass rallies allowed the more Moscow-inclined Marxists to assume more control in both the PS and Sayap Kiri. By June 1946, Sjahrir's increasing isolation from the coalition encouraged the opposing factions to depose him. This group put their support behind Amir, the alternative PS leader. On 26 June 1947, Amir, along with two other Moscow-inclined Ministers--Abdulmadjid (PS) and Wikana (PESINDO)-- backed by a majority of Sayap Kiri withdrew their support for Sjahrir. Their argument was that Sjahrir had compromised the Republic in his pursuit of diplomasi--the same charge that deposed every revolutionary government--and that in the face of Dutch belligerence, such conciliation seemed futile. Amir courted a broad coalition but hostility from Muslim Masyumi prevented its leader, Dr Sukiman, and pro-Sjahrir 'religious socialists' from previous cabinets from joining the new cabinet. In July 1947, Amir was appointed Prime Minister of the Republic. Other influential Masyumi factions, such as that of Wondoamiseno, provided support. Although Amir's communist allies controlled about 10% of the thirty-four with Amir's Defence Ministry their sole key one, this cabinet was the highest point of orthodox communist influence in the Revolution. Amir succeeded Sutan Sjahrir as Prime Minister Following a backlash over the Renville Agreement, for which Amir received much of the blame, PNI and Masyumi cabinet members resigned in early January 1948. On 23 January, with his support base disappearing, Amir resigned from the prime ministership. President Sukarno subsequently appointed Hatta to head an emergency 'presidential cabinet' directly responsible to the President and not the KNIP. The new cabinet consisted mainly of PNI, Masyumi and non- party members; Amir and the \\"Left Wing\\" were subsequently in opposition. Front Demokrasi Rakyat and the Madiun Affair The \\"Left Wing\\" coalition renamed itself the \\"People's Democratic Front\\" (Front Demokrasi Rakyat) and denounced the \\"Renville Agreement\\", which Amir's government had itself negotiated. In August 1948, Musso, the 1920s leader of the PKI, arrived in Yogyakarta from the Soviet Union. Amir and the leadership of the People's Democratic Front immediately accepted his authority, and Amir admitted membership of the underground PKI since 1935. Adhering to Musso's Stalinist thinking of a single party of the working class, the major leftist parties in the Front dissolved themselves into the PKI. Following industrial action, demonstrations, and subsequent open warfare between PKI and pro-government forces in the Central Java city of Surakarta, on 18 September a group of PKI supporters took over strategic points in the Madiun area. They killed pro- government officers, and announced over radio the formation of a new \\"National Front\\" government. Caught by surprise by the premature coup attempt, Musso, Amir and other PKI leaders rushed to Madiun to take charge. The following day, about 200 pro-PKI and other leftist leaders remaining in Yogyakarta were arrested. Sukarno denounced the Madiun rebels over radio, and called upon Indonesians to rally to himself and Hatta rather than to Musso and his plans for a Soviet-style government. Musso replied on radio that he would fight to the finish, while, the People's Democratic Front in Banten and Sumatra announced they had nothing to do with the rebellion. In the following weeks, pro-government forces, led by the Siliwangi Division, marched on Madiun where there were an estimated 5,000-10,000 pro-PKI soldiers. As the rebels retreated they killed Masyumi and PNI leaders and officials, and in the villages killings took place along santri-abangan lines. On 30 September, the rebels abandoned Madiun, and were pursued by pro-government troops through the countryside. Musso was killed on 31 October trying to escape custody. Amir and 300 rebel soldiers were captured by Siliwangi troops on 1 December. Some 35,000 people were later arrested. It is thought perhaps 8,000 people were killed in the affair. As part of a second major military offensive against the Republic, on 19 December Dutch troops occupied Yogyakarta city and the Republican government was captured, including Sukarno, Hatta, Agus Salim, and Sjahrir. Republican forces withdraw to the countryside beginning full-scale guerrilla war on either side of the van Mook line. Rather than risk their release, the army killed Amir and fifty other leftist prisoners as it withdrew from Yogyakarta that evening.

A strong supporter of the Union cause during the American Civil War, he represented the loyalist faction of Virginia, which was eventually separated into two distinct states. Biography Carlile was born in Winchester, Virginia. He was educated by his mother until he was fourteen years old, when he became salesman in a store, and at the age of seventeen went into business on his own account. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1840, and began practice in Beverly. Entering politics, he joined the Democratic Party. He was selected as a delegate to the Virginia state constitutional convention in 1850. Carlile served in the Virginia State Senate from 1847 to 1851. He joined the new Know Nothing political movement in 1854 and represented Virginia's 11th District in the United States House for one term. Carlile was a delegate from Harrison County to the Virginia secession convention in 1861, voting no on the controversial resolution. He was a leader in the anti-secession movement, and was prominent in the Wheeling Convention of June 1861. On June 13, 1861, at the first session of the Second Wheeling Convention, Carlile authored \\"A Declaration of the People of Virginia.\\" The document pronounced Virginia's Ordinance of Secession illegal because the convention at which it had been drafted had been convened by the General Assembly, not by a referendum. It also called for the reorganization of the government of Virginia, arguing that due to Virginia's decision to secede from the United States, all state government offices had been vacated. The pro-Union Restored Government of Virginia was quickly recognized by President Abraham Lincoln and Congress as the legitimate government of the entire Commonwealth of Virginia, with Wheeling as its provisional capital. He was averse, however, to the formation of a new state out of the bulk of the pro-Union territory of Virginia‚Äîwhat became West Virginia. Carlile was again chosen to Congress in 1861 on a Unionist Party position, but kept his seat in the House of Representatives only from July 4 through July 13, when he was elected as one of two United States Senators representing the Restored Government. He served until 1865. In the Senate, he was uniformly in favor of a strict construction of the Constitution, opposing all measures recognizing that there existed a rebellion of states instead of individuals, and denying the right of Congress to interfere in any way with the slaves (Carlile being a slaveowner himself). He frequently met with Lincoln to try to garner his support for his causes. Following the war, Carlile retired from politics and returned home to resume his law practice. He died in Clarksburg, West Virginia, and was buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery. References and links *John S.

Keane, first performed in Listowel, County Kerry in 1959. Keane chose to use the name \\"Sive\\" for the play in honor of his sister, Shiela, using the Irish-Gaelic form of the name. Plot The story is centred on an eighteen-year-old girl, Sive, who is illegitimate. She lives with her uncle Mike, his wife Mena, and Nanna, who is Mike‚Äôs mother. A local matchmaker, Thomasheen Sean Rua, decides that Sive should marry a man named Se√°n Dota. Se√°n is rich but old and haggard. Thomasheen convinces Mena to organise the marriage of Sive to Se√°n Dota. She and her husband will receive a sum of two hundred pounds as soon as Sive marries him. Mike is originally unwilling to have Sive married to a man so much older than her, but Mena convinces him otherwise. Sive, however, is in love with a young man by the name of Liam Scuab. But Liam is unsuitable as he is related to the man who got Sive's mother pregnant out of marriage, before going to work in England and drowning. Mike, who believes that Sive's father deliberately abandoned her mother upon discovering her pregnancy, refuses permission for Liam to marry Sive, on account of his being related to her father. Sive is distraught but is forced to do the will of her uncle and his wife. Nanna does not approve and would prefer her to marry Liam. Two local tinkers ‚Äî Pats and his son Carthalawn ‚Äî connive together and decide to help Sive escape from Se√°n Dota and marry Liam. They plan to do this by giving a letter (written by Liam Scuab) to Nanna, who will pass it on to Sive. The plot fails, however, when Thomasheen discovers the letter and destroys it. On the night before her marriage Sive disappears and shortly afterward, Liam finds her corpse in a bog hole. He carries the body into the house, announcing to Mena that she is responsible for the death. As Liam cries over the dead body, Se√°n Dota and Thomasheen both leave the room. The play concludes with Pats and his son singing about a maiden who was drowned as she would not be a bride. Performance history After being rejected by the Abbey Theatre, The Listowel Drama Group produced the play. Sive first performed in Christy's Ballroom, Listowel, Co. Kerry. The play was an overall success, but John B. Keane noted that some took offense to the melodramatic content of the play, calling it blasphemous and pornographic based on the appearance of Sive as a young girl. In the first performances of the play, Nora Relihan played Mena Galvin, Margaret Dillon performed as Sive, and John B. Keane himself played Carthalawn. The play is still widely known throughout Ireland, usually being a piece of theatre taught in Irish school systems.

It is about northeast of Accra, and northwest of Lom√©. Part of the Agumatsa sub-range of the West Africa Mountains, its summit is above sea level. The summit of Mount Aduadu () lies to the east of Mount Afadja. \\"Afadja\\" is the name of the mountain whereas the suffix \\"-to\\" in the Ewe language means mountain therefore, it is called \\"Afadja-to\\" by the Ewe people of Ghana and Togo. The correct name would be \\"Mount Afadja\\", as \\"Mount Afadjato\\" would be a repetition of the word \\"mountain\\". Mount Afadja is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the Volta Region of Ghana, welcoming thousands of visitors from around the globe annually. When the Ewe people migrated to the area and saw the mountain it looked like the mound in which water yam is planted, water yam being called \\"Avadze\\" in Ewe. Moreover, there were some creeping plants on the mountain that resembled the water yam plant; they therefore called it \\"Avadze-to\\". Today the word has been palatalized into \\"Afadjato\\". The nearby Tagbo Falls and Wli Falls (the highest in West Africa) are also considered tourist attractions. There are several caves, streams and other waterfalls in the area. The mountains location is very close to the Ghana-Togo border.  History  Mount Afadja is the highest mountain in Ghana with the height of 885 metres and 2,904 ft above sea level. The mountain derives its name from the Ewe Word ‚ÄúAvadzeto‚Äù which means at war with the Bush. 'Afadja' is the name of the mountain whereas 'to' in the Ewe dialect means mountain therefore it is called 'Afadjato' by the indigenes. The correct name would be 'Mount Afadja' as 'Mount Afadjato' will be a repetition of the 'Mountain.' The mountain is located in the Agumatsa Range near the villages of Gbledi and Liati Wote.

It is sometimes referred to as the recorded plat survey system or the recorded map survey system.http://us.practicallaw.com/5-507-1532 Origins of the system The system is the most recent of the three main survey systems. It began to be widely employed in the United States in the 19th century when cities began to expand into the surrounding farmland. The owners of a large tract of land would create a plat and subdivide the tract into a series of smaller lots to be sold to buyers. This subdivision survey plan would then be recorded with an official government record keeper. The officially recorded map then became the legal description of all the lots in the subdivision. The method became widespread after the post World War II expansion into the suburbs when formerly rural areas became heavily populated and large tracts of rural land were divided into smaller lots. Mechanics The system begins with a large tract of land. This large tract is typically defined by one of the earlier survey systems such as metes and bounds or the Public Land Survey System. A subdivision survey is conducted to divide the original tract into smaller lots and a plat map is created. Usually this subdivision survey employs a metes and bounds system to delineate individual lots within the main tract. Each lot on the plat map is assigned an identifier, usually a number or letter. The plat map is then officially recorded with a government entity such as a city engineer or a recorder of deeds. This plan becomes the legal description of all the lots in the subdivision. A mere reference to the individual lot and the map's place of record is all that is required for a proper legal description. Understanding property descriptions The Lot and Block system is perhaps the simplest of the three main survey systems to understand. For a legal description in the Lot and Block system a description must identify: *the individual lot, *the block in which the lot is located, if applicable, *a reference to a platted subdivision or a phase thereof, *a reference to find the cited plat map (i.e., a page and/or volume number), and *a description of the map's place of official recording (e.g., recorded in the files of the County Engineer). The legal description of a property under the Lot and Block system may be something like; Lot 5 of Block 2 of the South Subdivision plat as recorded in Map Book 21, Page 33 at the Recorder of Deeds. Some simple maps may only contain a lot and map number, such as Lot C of the Riverside Subdivision map as recorded in Map Book 12, Page 8 in the office of the City Engineer. The more technical details of the legal description are all contained in the recorded plat map and there is no need to reiterate them in a deed or other legal description. By contrast, a Public Land Survey System legal description of the same property would be something like SW 1/4 SW1/4 NE1/4 SW1/4 SEC 18 T1S R1E. The metes and bounds description may be something like, Beginning at a monument located at the SE corner of the property now or formerly of J.W. Smith; thence north 330 feet to a point; thence east 330 feet to a point; thence south 330 feet to a point, thence west 330 feet to the place of beginning. Other uses A type of the Lot and Block system is frequently used for tax identification purposes in the United States. This designation, often called a Tax Identification Number or Tax Parcel Number, is not directly based on the legal description of the property. The system can be used even if the property is not legally described by the Block and Lot system. A property legally described by a metes and bounds description may still be assigned a Tax Identification Number based on a separate Lot and Block system. In this case, a survey of all parcels in the county or municipality would be combined to create a separate Block and Lot system to identify the properties for taxation purposes. For example, a metes and bounds described parcel may be assigned the Tax Identification Number 14-55-118, which has nothing to do with the legal description of the property recorded in the deed other than its use to create the tax Block and Lot maps. In this case, the first number may be used to indicate the local municipality, the second number indicates the tax map on which the property is recorded, and the third number is the parcel identification number on the indicated map. A similar system might be Tax Identification Number 205-K-33 where \\"205\\" is the map book volume number, \\"K\\" is the individual map, and \\"33\\" is a parcel number.

Stadlen, who was born in Vienna, initially studied piano there with Paul Weingartner and composition with Joseph Marx and Max Springer (1877-1954). He then continued his studies in Berlin between 1929 and 1933 with Leonid Kreutzer (piano) and Josef Greindl (composition). By 1934 he had embarked on a career as concert pianist. Stadlen premiered the Variations for piano, Op. 27 by Webern on 26 October 1937 in Vienna under the direction of the composer.Bailey, Katheryn and Puffett, Kathryn. The Life of Webern (CUP 1998), p 152 (Much later he edited the definitive interpretive edition, published by Universal Edition in 1979).Notes (2nd Series), Vol 37 No 2, December 1980, p 405-406 Stadlen was also the soloist in the German premiere of Schoenberg‚Äôs Piano Concerto at the Darmstadt Summer School on 17 July 1948. After the Anschluss Stadlen left Austria and sought refuge in Britain in 1938. However, two years later he was interned and deported to Australia (between 1940 and 1942). Back in Britain he resumed performance at the National Gallery Concerts organised by Myra Hess, with the Austrian Musicians Group,Norris, Geoffrey. 'Tribute to a critic with a true musician's understanding' in The Daily Telegraph, 7 December 1996 and in regular contemporary music broadcasts with the BBC.For instance, Roberto Gerhard and Egon Wellesz on 26 November 1947. Radio Times issue 1258, 23 November 1947, p 16 Eventually, however, a neurological finger malfunction caused him to give up performing, and he became a music critic, serving the Daily Telegraph for 26 years (the last decade as chief music critic, retiring in 1985). He became increasingly disillusioned with serial music and this was reflected in his criticism of contemporary music.‚ÄòSerialism Reconsidered‚Äô, in The Score No 22 (1958) p 12‚Äì27 Stadlen spent many years trying to track down Beethoven's metronome, an invention which Beethoven had commissioned. It was believed that the weight on his metronome was faulty as some of the speeds written on his pieces seemed incorrect. Peter wished to ascertain the make-up of this weight and to see the correct speeds which Beethoven himself had intended. He finally tracked it down to a small antiques shop only to discover that, although the metronome itself was intact, the weight itself was missing.Stadlen, Peter.

American Mathematical Society Notices, October 2013 Stadlen was a lecturer in music at the University of Reading (1965-9) and visiting fellow of All Souls College, Oxford (1967-8). He was married to the philosopher, political activist and musicologist Hedi Stadlen, with whom he lived in Hampstead. There were two sons: Nicholas (who became a High Court judge) and Godfrey (a civil servant in the Home Office). He died in London.

The park showcases extraordinary rock formations that have been shaped by wind and water erosion. The park was created by presidential decree in 1939 encompassing 4,772 hectares to protect the endemic flora and fauna. The park is characterized by pine and oak forest. The park is one of the few areas in Mexico that are inhabited by black bear. The park is frequented by residents of the state capital city. The area is popular with rock climbers, hikers, and campers; there are 53 km of roads for hiking and mountain biking. Camping including backcountry camping is permitted and there are rental cabins available. Access to the park is by federal highway number 45 that goes from Chihuahua to Ciudad Ju√°rez. History Pe√±√≥n de El Cuadrado rock formation The Cumbres de Majalca National Park was created by the federal government on September 1, 1939. The protected zone encompassed an area of 4,772 hectares (11,790 acres). The park was created to help preserve natural habitat for many species of animals and plants. After the creation of the national park during the mid 20th century, the park underwent a reforestation of different coniferous species. Geography Cumbres de Majalca National Park is located in the central part of the state of Chihuahua near the city of Chihuahua. The park is found in the Sierra de Majalca mountain range a subdivision of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Mountain peaks in the park reach an elevation of 2,600 meters above sea level. The park is part of the dominant Transition Bav√≠cora-Bustillos Transition which is characterized by many small elevated valleys surrounded by volcanic mountains. The mountains in the park are not of notable rank in the state, but the highest peaks in the park are: Cerro Las Escobas, Cerro La Puerta, Cerro Los Alm√≠ceres, and Cerro del Agua. The park is almost completely covered by volcanic rocks that have been shaped into amazing formations by wind and water erosion. Sierra de Majalca is the point of origin of the Sacramento River that flows towards the state capital city. The Sacramento River empties into the Chuv√≠scar River before reaching Chihuahua. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, the park has two different climates. A (BSk) semiarid climate occurs in the lower elevations in the park where temperatures can reach in the summer and temperatures fluctuate largely in the winter from cool to hot. The steppe zones in the park have a rainy season at the end of the summer and few winter snowfalls. A (Cwa) humid subtropical with hot summers and cold winters occur in the higher elevations where temperatures can fall to in the winter and averages 112 days under . During the winter in the higher elevations, snowstorms come frequently increasing in the at the end of the season. Flora and fauna Sierra de Majalca Pine forests are found from the high elevations to the transition zone between the mountains and the steppe. The main species of conifers found in the park are: Pinus leiophylla, Pinus cembroides, Pinus engelmannii, and several species of Abies. The lower elevations have a steppe vegetation with a variety of grasses and small bushes. Several species of Juniperus dot the steppe and the transition zone. The park is part of a fragile ecosystem which includes a few endangered species like: American black bear and cougar. Other mammals that can be found in the park are: white-tailed deer, eastern cottontail, North American porcupine, bobcat, and coyote. There are few reptile species that inhabit the lower elevations mostly small lizards. One known reptilian species is the Northern Mexican Pine Snake, Pituophis deppei jani. The most common avian species observed in the park are: peregrine falcon, golden eagle, wild turkey, common pheasant, Arizona woodpecker, strickland's woodpecker, and ladder-backed woodpecker. image:Quivira- Whitetail-Buck.jpgOdocoileus virginianus image:Black bear large.jpg Ursus americanus image:Arizona Woodpecker.jpg Picoides arizonae image:Porcupine- BioDome.jpg Erethizon dorsatum See also *List of national parks of Mexico * * References External links * ‚àíLL Bean: Cumbres de Majalca National Park * ‚àíMexicoDesconocido.com: Cumbres de Majalca Parques Nacionale * ‚àí MexicoDesconocido.com: Cumbres de Majalca y estado de Chihuahua Category:National parks of Mexico Category:Protected areas of Chihuahua (state) Category:Sierra Madre Occidental Category:Protected areas established in 1939 Category:1939 establishments in Mexico ","title":"Cumbres de Majalca National Park"},{"id":"3020874","text":"St Mary's parish church, Steeple Barton, Oxfordshire, of Sir Philip Constable, 1st Baronet There have been two baronetcies created for persons with the surname Constable, both in the Baronetage of England.

In 1812 he traveled to Russia to join the anti-Napoleonic cause. He fought in the Russian army against the French in the battles of Borodino and Leipzig and was present during the conquest of Paris in 1814.

In 1821, he was promoted to the rank of colonel and served in the general staff of Sweden. He traveled to Bavaria in 1822 on a mission from Prince Oscar to ask for the hand of Josephine of Leuchtenberg on his behalf. In 1824 he was appointed to the equivalent of Swedish ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and served in Istanbul until 1830. L√∂wenhielm detested his assignment to Turkey and considered the time there a waste of years. He nonetheless managed to accomplish a deal with the Ottoman government through which Swedish merchant ships were allowed to pass through the Bosphorus. After his years in Turkey, L√∂wenhielm also worked for some years as a Swedish envoy to the Imperial Court in Vienna. In 1840 L√∂wenhielm married in Vienna Countess Natalie Alexandra von Buxhoeveden (1814-1867), a granddaughter of Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden. This time the marriage was a happy one, and as L√∂wenhielm had inherited a large sum of money from his father he retired from diplomatic duties and settles in V√§rmland on the family estate. He served as County Governor of Gothenburg and Bohus County between 1843 and 1845 and later again served as a military officer.

He served in the Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate when the state was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was a United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat. Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the Fourteenth Amendment, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the Freedmen's Bureau when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 11‚Äì14 Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate. Family and early life Johnston was born in his paternal grandfather's house, \\"Panicello\\", near Abingdon, Virginia. He was the only child of Dr. John Warfield Johnston and Louisa Smith Bowen. His grandfather was Judge Peter Johnston, who had fought under Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee during the Revolutionary War, and his great-grandmother was the sister of Patrick Henry.Warmuth, Images of America: Abingdon Virginia, 34. His mother was the sister of Rees T. Bowen, a Virginia politician, and his paternal uncles included Charles Clement Johnston and General Joseph Eggleston Johnston. His first cousin was U. S. Congressman Henry Bowen. Johnston's ancestry was Scottish, English, Welsh, and Scots-Irish. Johnston attended Abingdon Academy, South Carolina College at Columbia, and the law department of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. He was admitted to the bar in 1839 and commenced practice in Tazewell, Virginia.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress On October 12, 1841, he married Nicketti Buchanan Floyd, the daughter of Governor John Floyd and Letitia Preston, and the sister of Governor John Buchanan Floyd.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 765. His wife was Catholic, having converted when young; Johnston converted after the marriage.Fogarty, Faith in Virginia, 5. In 1859, he moved his family to Abingdon, Virginia, and lived at first on East Main Street. An Abingdon resident noted that \\"it was a delightful home to visit and the young men enjoyed the cordial welcome that they received from the old and the young.\\"Cosby, Remembrances of Abingdon, 8 While there, the family started construction of a new home called \\"Eggleston\\", three miles (5 km) east of town; the family's affectionate name for it was \\"Castle Dusty\\".John Warfield Johnston to Lavalette Johnston, November 6, 1868, John Warfield Johnston Papers, Special Collections Department, Duke University Library, Durham, North Carolina. This is just one of several letters in which he calls their home this. They moved in sometime after August 1860. Johnston and Nicketti Buchanan Floyd had twelve children, one of whom was Dr. George Ben Johnston, prominent physician in Richmond who is credited with the first antiseptic operation performed in Virginia. Both the Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon and the Johnston-Willis Hospital in Richmond are named after him. Early career Johnston & Trigg Law Office on Court Street in downtown Abingdon. Now in possession of the Historical Society of Washington County, Virginia. Johnston served as commonwealth attorney for Tazewell County between 1844 and 1846. In 1846, he was elected to serve the remainder of the 1846‚Äì1847 term in the Virginia Senate, representing Tazewell, Wythe, Grayson, Smyth, Carroll, and Pulaski counties.Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia, 424. He was re- elected for the 1847‚Äì1848 session.Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia, 428. During the Civil War, he held the position of Confederate States receiver, and was also elected as a councilman for the town of Abingdon in 1861.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 648. Not much is known of his activities during the war, but he did send a letter to Brigadier-General John Echols that the Order of Heroes of America, was \\"growing fearfully\\" in southwest Virginia.Official Records, Series IV, V 3, p. 812, 816 This secret order was composed of Union sympathizers. This information was used in conjunction with other reports to request a suspension of habeas corpus so that the military could make arrests. After the war, in 1867, he founded the Villa Maria Academy of the Visitation in Abingdon for the education of girls.Lang, Villa Maria Academy of the Visitation, 1 He was judge of the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery of Virginia in 1869‚Äì1870.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 600. Also around 1869, he formed a law partnership with a young local attorney, and his future son-in-law, Daniel Trigg. In 1872, they set up their offices in a small building near the courthouse which became known as the Johnston-Trigg Law Office.King, Places in Time, Volume One, 58 In November 1868, he wrote a letter to his daughter, which revealed that butter was scarce and that he doubted he would get a supply for the winter, but that \\"when we have spare ribs, sausages & crackilin bread, we can do without butter. The fact is I begin to consider butter a luxury anyhow, that poor people have no business with.\\"John W. Johnston to Lavalette McMullen, November 6, 1868, LS, John W. Johnston Papers, Special Collections, Duke University Senatorial career Virginia by 1869 was essentially a military zone. Gilbert C. Walker was elected as governor in this year and ushered in a moderate conservatism, with Whiggish roots. The new General Assembly ratified the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to end Reconstruction and also elected two people as representatives for the U. S. Senate, including Johnston. He was to serve the unexpired portion of a six- year term that started in March 1865.Senate Journal, January 28, 1870. Johnston received a letter from William Mahone, sent on October 18, 1869, that he must go to Richmond \\"without fail, by the first train. You are Senator.\\"William Mahone to John W. Johnston, October 18, 1869, LS, John W. Johnston Papers, Special Collections, Duke University. Johnston was one of the few Virginia men eligible to hold office: at the time, anyone who had fought for, or served, the former Confederacy was ineligible to hold office under the Fourteenth Amendment until their \\"political disabilities\\" were removed by Congress by a two-thirds vote. Johnston's were removed because word had reached the local Abingdon Freedmen's Bureau officer that he had helped care for an elderly former slave, Peter, who had passed through Abingdon on his way to Charlotte County, Virginia from Mississippi.Johnston, \\"Hunting for His People\\", 6Maddex, The Virginia Conservatives, 87. The Norfolk and Western Railroad passed from Johnston's house, and former slaves used the tracks as a guide to return home from where they had been sold. In the summer of 1865 Johnston aided many with food and shelter, and in August of that year he found Peter near death in a stable near the railroad; Johnston carried him to the house, where he stayed at least a month.Johnston, \\"Hunting for His People\\", 6‚Äì13. When Peter regained enough strength he told his story, which Johnston later wrote down and is now kept with his papers at Duke University. Peter had been a slave of a Mr. Read in Charlotte County, a neighbor of John Randolph. He had been sold (apparently because of Read's debts) to a trader, leaving behind a wife and young daughter to work a cotton field for thirty-five years in Mississippi. When he was freed, Peter walked from Mississippi until he reached Abingdon in his quest to return home.Stevenson, \\"Editor's Foreword\\", 4 Johnston wrote: \\"It was evident to me and my wife that all our care could not rebuild that worn-out body, and that death was near at hand. He weakened rapidly ... His life was weary, toilsome, and full of trouble. But surely the Lord has rewards for such as he, and will give him rest in all eternity, and permit him to see Susy and his Mammy and Daddy.\\"Johnston, \\"Hunting for His People\\", 12 Peter died of tuberculosis.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 4. The Freedmen's Bureau agent wrote to Congressman William Kelley of Pennsylvania requesting the removal of Johnston's disabilities because of his charity. Kelly did so and the bill passed both houses of Congress. Johnston only discovered all of this when he read about the passage of the bill in the newspaper.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 2. =Overview= Johnston went to Washington in December in hopes that Virginia would be readmitted to the Union. It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston was able to take his seat shortly afterward.John W. Johnston to M. B. D. Lane, November 15, 1869, December 3, 1869, December 21, 1869, LS, Abraham Lincoln Library and Museum, Harrogate, Tennessee The delay was due to a Congressional need to pass an act that would allow Virginia representation in the body. When Johnston arrived on January 28 to take his seat, he had some difficulty. George F. Edmunds of Vermont questioned whether he was the right Mr. Johnston and thought a fraud was being perpetrated until Waitman T. Willey of West Virginia vouched for Johnston's identity, allowing his qualification.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 5‚Äì6 Later, he was in the process of signing a document put before him, but without having read it. This was the ironclad oath, that required all white males to swear they had never borne arms against the Union or supported the Confederacy. If the senator sitting next to Johnston, Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, had not noticed, Johnston would likely have been \\"disgraced ... forever in the eyes of the people of Virginia\\".Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 7 The oath had been deemed unconstitutional in 1867, but its use was not effectively ended until 1871. At this time, Johnston was the only senator who had sided with the Confederacy‚Äîall the rest were either Northerners by birth or had been \\"Union men\\". At the time he joined the Senate, the two parties in Virginia were the Conservatives and the Radicals. Johnston was a Conservative, which was an alliance of pre-War Democrats and Whigs. The Democrats had once been bitter rivals of the Whigs and would not join a party of that name, giving rise to the Conservative party. Which direction Johnston would vote in the national arena was unknown, but mattered little because the Senate was overwhelmingly Republican.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 11‚Äì13 There were only 10 Democrats at the time out of 68 senators. There was speculation that Johnston might side with the Republicans and \\"turn traitor to his party and state ... for patronage\\" based on a letter he had written to the new Virginia governor.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 13 These doubts were settled when Johnston declined a formal invitation to join the Republican caucus and went to a joint meeting of House and Senate Democrats; it was declared that \\"a Conservative in Virginia was a democrat in Washington\\". Johnston served from January 26, 1870, to March 4, 1871, and was re-elected on March 15, 1871, for the term beginning March 4, 1871. He was re-elected again in 1877 and served until March 4, 1883. He was a member Committee on Revolutionary Claims, and later served as its chairman during the Forty-fifth and Forty-seventh Congresses. He was also chairman of the Committee on Agriculture during the Forty-sixth Congress. In November 1881, Johnston served on the Committee on Foreign Relations. It is recorded that when Clara Barton's plea to President Chester Arthur to sign the First Geneva Convention (establishing the International Red Cross), Arthur's favorable reply was referred to this committee and Johnston was named as one of the members.Barton, The Red Cross, 72 Political issues =Arlington Memorial controversy= Arlington House from a pre-1861 sketch, published in 1875. On December 13, 1870, Thomas C. McCreery (D) of Kentucky introduced a resolution regarding the Arlington House, the former home of the Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, that brought down a firestorm of objections.Journal of the Senate, December 13, 1870.; Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 14‚Äì23 Arlington House had been captured by Union forces during the Civil War and its grounds were used as a cemetery for 16,000 soldiers by the end of the war. The resolution called for an investigation to establish its ownership and the possibility of returning it to Mrs. Robert E. Lee. In addition, McCreery proposed the government fix up the premises, return any Washington relics discovered, and determine whether a suitable location nearby existed to relocate the dead.Journal of the Senate, December 13, 1870. Johnston described the excitement caused as the most pronounced he would see in his thirteen years in the Senate. It put him in \\"the most painful and embarrassing position of my life\\". and he was vehemently opposed: However, in the course of the speeches opposing the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 24‚Äì25 He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 26 Later, Johnston made a speech on behalf of Mrs. Lee and her Memorial proposal. His first attempt to speak was objected to and he was denied permission.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 41 Near the end of the session, when an unrelated bill was under discussion, Johnston made a motion related to it and then used the opportunity, which was allowed to Senators, to make his speech; this caused \\"great indignation and impatience on the floor\\".Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 42 The Lee family and their advisors desired that the \\"true facts about the sale of Arlington and the nature of her claim to the property, should be placed before the country\\"Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 27 so that, if found in her favor, she could receive compensation and then donate the property to the government.Johnston, Reminiscences of Thirteen Years in the Senate, 30‚Äì31 Eventually the Supreme Court of the United States did find in the family's favor in 1882. =Texas-Pacific Bill= Johnston near the end of his life When Johnston was up for re-election in 1877, he was involved in the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's Texas and Pacific Railway, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill.Woodward, Origins of the New South, 34 Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, \\"... what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line.\\"John W. Johnston to Daniel Trigg, October 23, 1875, LS, John W. Johnston Papers, Special Collections, Duke University William Mahone worked to prevent his re- election.Blake, William Mahone, 146 Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected. The Texas-Pacific Bill remained a bargaining chip in the Compromise of 1877, following the 1876 Presidential election crisis. Later, Johnston gave a speech in 1878 in Congress against the railroad, specifically Bill No. 942, which he viewed as \\"a positive menace to the commercial interests of the South\\". =Funder and Readjuster debate= Another issue that marked Johnston's career was the Funder vs. Readjuster debate. Funders maintained that the state was obligated to pay back its entire pre-War debt, whereas the Readjusters suggested differing, lesser figures, regarding how much was owed.Maddex, The Virginia Conservatives, 233‚Äì238 The controversy culminated in the end of the Conservative Party in Virginia and the formation of the Readjuster Party and the Democratic Party. William Mahone was chosen as head of the Readjusters and they gained control of the state legislature in 1879, but not the governorship.Blake, William Mahone, 182 The legislature then elected Mahone as the successor to Democrat Robert E. Withers in the U. S. Senate.Blake, William Mahone, 183 However, without a sympathetic governor, they could not enact their reforms. Their next chance came in the election of 1881; their aim was to elect a governor, but most importantly to maintain control of the state legislature, since it would elect \\"a successor to the Hon. John W. Johnston ...\\"Blake, William Mahone, 186 Their party succeeded and the legislature elected prominent Readjuster, and Mahone's \\"intimate friend\\", Harrison H. Riddleberger to replace Johnston, eighty-one to forty-nine.Longacre, Fitz Lee, 200; Blake, William Mahone, 189, 216 fn 95 Death and legacy After serving in the Senate, Johnston resumed his legal practice. He died in Richmond, Virginia, on February 27, 1889, aged seventy. He was conscious until his death and was aware that he was dying.Louisa J. Trigg to Lavalette McMullen, February 28, 1889, L, John W. Johnston Papers, Special Collections, Duke University On March 1, his family brought his body from Richmond to Wytheville, where he was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery. On May 11, 1903, a ceremony was held to install the portraits of deceased judges in the Washington County Courthouse. David F. Bailey was the speaker that presented the portrait of Johnston.Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 601‚Äì602 In his speech, he described Johnston: Johnston was outlived by his wife, Nicketti, who died on June 9, 1908, aged eighty-nine.

Baseball Casey Stengel popularized the platoon system as manager of the New York Yankees. In baseball, a platoon is a method of sharing playing time, where two players are selected to play a single defensive position. Usually, one platoon player is right-handed and the other is left- handed. Typically the right-handed half of the platoon is played on days when the opposing starting pitcher is left-handed and the left-handed player is played otherwise. The theory behind this is that generally players hit better against their opposite-handed counterparts, and that in some cases the difference is extreme enough to warrant complementing the player with one of opposite handedness. =Strategy= Right-handed batters have an advantage against left-handed pitchers, as left-handed batters benefit from facing right-handed pitchers. This is because a right-handed pitcher's curveball breaks to the left, from his own point of view, which causes it to cross the plate with its lateral movement away from a right-handed batter but towards a left-handed batter (and vice versa for a left-handed pitcher), and because batters generally find it easier to hit a ball that is over the plate. Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters generally have less experience with left-handed pitchers. A left-handed pitcher may also be brought in to face a switch-hitter who generally bats left-handed, forcing the batter to shift to his less-effective right-handed stance or to take the disadvantages of batting left-handed against a left- handed pitcher. Platooning can be viewed negatively. Players prefer to play every day, and managers, including Walter Alston, feared that sharing playing time could decrease confidence. Mookie Wilson of the New York Mets requested a trade in 1988 after serving in a platoon for three seasons with Lenny Dykstra. =History= The advantage to alternating hitters based on handedness was known from the early days of baseball. Bob Ferguson, in 1871, became baseball's first switch hitter, allowing him to bat left-handed against right- handed pitchers, and right-handed against left-handed pitchers. The first recorded platoon took place in 1887, when the Indianapolis Hoosiers briefly paired the right-handed Gid Gardner and left-handed Tom Brown in center field. In 1906, the Detroit Tigers alternated Boss Schmidt, Jack Warner, and Freddie Payne at catcher for the entire season.James, p. 595 As manager of the Boston Braves, George Stallings employed platoons during the 1914 season, which helped the \\"Miracle\\" Braves win the 1914 World Series. No Braves outfielder reached 400 at-bats during the 1914 season. In 1934 and 1935, Detroit Tigers' manager Mickey Cochrane routinely platooned Gee Walker, a right-handed batter, to spell center fielder Goose Goslin and right fielder Jo-Jo White, who were both left-handed batters. Cochrane, a left-handed batter, also platooned himself behind the plate with Ray Hayworth, a right-handed batter. Also in the 1930s, Bill Terry of the New York Giants platooned center fielders Hank Leiber and Jimmy Ripple. The approach was seldom used in the 1930s, but Casey Stengel, managing the Braves, platooned third basemen Debs Garms and Joe Stripp in 1938. Stengel himself had been platooned as a player by managers John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson. Garms won the National League's batting title in 1940 with the Pittsburgh Pirates as a part-time player under Frankie Frisch. Terms for this strategy included \\"double-batting shift, \\"switch-around players\\", and \\"reversible outfield\\". Tris Speaker referred to his strategy as the \\"triple shift\\", because he employed it at three positions. The term \\"platoon\\" was coined in the late 1940s. Stengel, now managing the New York Yankees, became a well known proponent of the platoon system, and won five consecutive World Series championships from 1949 through 1953 using the strategy. Stengel platooned Bobby Brown, Billy Johnson, and Gil McDougald at third base, Joe Collins and Moose Skowron at first base, and Hank Bauer and Gene Woodling in left field. Harold Rosenthal, writing for the New York Herald, referred to Stengel's strategy as a \\"platoon\\", after the American football concept, and it came to be known as \\"two-platooning\\". Following Stengel's success, other teams began implementing their own platoons. In the late 1970s through early 1980s, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver successfully employed a platoon in left field, using John Lowenstein, Benny Ayala, and Gary Roenicke, using whichever player was performing the best at the time. Weaver also considered other factors, including the opposing pitcher's velocity, and his batters' ability in hitting a fastball. The Orioles continued to platoon at catcher and all three outfield positions in 1983 under Joe Altobelli, as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series, leading other teams to pursue the strategy. Platooning decreased in frequency from the late 1980s through the 1990s, as teams expanded their bullpens to nullify platoon advantages for hitters. However, the use of platoons has increased in recent years. As teams increase their analysis of data, they attempt to put batters and pitchers in situations where they are more likely to succeed. Generally, small market teams, which cannot afford to sign the league's best players to market-value contracts, are most likely to employ platoons. Under manager Bob Melvin, the Athletics have employed many platoons, with Josh Reddick calling Melvin the \\"king of platoons\\". Joe Maddon began to employ platoons as manager of the Tampa Bay Rays. The 2013 World Series champion Boston Red Sox platooned Jonny Gomes and Daniel Nava in left field. After the 2013 season, left-handed relief pitchers Boone Logan and Javier L√≥pez, both considered left-handed specialists because of their ability to limit the effectiveness of left-handed batters, signed multimillion-dollar contracts as free agents. Football Steve Spurrier often used \\"platooning quarterbacks\\". When a football team uses two (or more) quarterbacks to run their offense, rather than the traditional one in football, it is known as \\"platooning quarterbacks\\". This tactic becomes less common the higher the level of football (high school teams are more likely to do it than National Football League teams for example). Quarterbacks may be switched in and out of the game every play, every drive, every quarter, or depending on certain situations. If quarterbacks are switched game to game that is not platooning, that is a \\"quarterback controversy\\" or a simple benching. Using two different quarterbacks allows an offense to use players with different skill sets. One common reason teams platoon quarterbacks is because one player is a good passer and the other a good runner (see for example Stanley Jackson and Joe Germaine of the 1997 Ohio State Buckeyes). Thus defenses have to prepare for two types of quarterback, not just one. It also allows offenses to run a greater variety of plays.

Caton captained both Manchester City and Oxford United and was named as City's Player of the Year in 1982. He made 14 appearances for the England under-21 team. Career =Manchester City= Born in Kirkby, Lancashire, Caton was a centre half who played for and captained England schoolboys before signing for Manchester City as an apprentice in 1978. He was a member of the City team that reached and lost in the 1979 and 1980 FA Youth Cup finals. Caton made his senior debut for City on 18 August 1979 aged 16, and soon became a regular in the City side, playing in the 1981 FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur when still only 18 years old. When Tommy Hutchison put City in the lead it looked as though Caton was on his way to collect a winner's medal, but Tottenham levelled as a result of Hutchison's own goal, a replay was forced and City lost it 3‚Äì2. He reached 100 First Division games on 6 March 1982; at the age of 19 years and 5 months he was the youngest player in Football League history to achieve this feat. He was also named City's Player of the Year for 1981‚Äì82. Caton scored eight goals during his spell at Maine Road, the first one coming in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Nottingham Forest on 13 March 1982, and he scored twice against Arsenal on 4 December 1982. He scored his last goal for City in a 3‚Äì1 win against Shrewsbury Town at Gay Meadow on 5 November 1983. A season after he came close to collecting an FA Cup winner's medal, Caton was looking like a good bet for a Football League First Division title winner's medal as City went top of the league just after Christmas in 1981, but a dismal second half of the season meant they finished mid table and were left without even a UEFA Cup place. The lacklustre form continued into the 1982‚Äì83 season, at the end of which City were beaten 1‚Äì0 at home on the final day of the season by Luton Town, meaning that City were relegated and Luton stayed up. Caton was unwilling to remain at City now they were a Second Division club, and handed in a transfer request, but began the 1983‚Äì84 season still playing for the Citizens and he remained there until December 1983 when he made the move to Arsenal for ¬£500,000. =Arsenal= Caton made his Arsenal debut against West Bromwich Albion on 4 December. However, after playing as a first team regular under the management of Don Howe in his first two years at Arsenal as David O'Leary's partner, he lost his place to Martin Keown and the young Tony Adams during the 1985‚Äì86 season, at the end of which Howe was replaced by George Graham. By February 1987, Caton had scored three goals in 95 appearances for Arsenal, but had not played first-team football in almost a year. =Oxford United= In February 1987, Caton was sold to Oxford United for ¬£160,000. He was named club captain soon after his arrival and helped them avoid relegation from the First Division during his opening months at the Manor Ground. He also missed out on a chance of silverware when Oxford were knocked out in the semifinals of the 1987‚Äì88 League Cup. =Charlton Athletic= He remained at Oxford until 18 November 1988, when he was sold to Charlton Athletic for ¬£100,000 in order to play in the First Division again. Caton stayed with Charlton after their relegation in 1990, but was injured the following January and never played first team football again. He finally announced his retirement in March 1993 having failed to make a full recovery. He had played 57 league games for Charlton, scoring five goals. Personal life Caton was born in Kirkby, Lancashire. He was married to Gill, and had three children. His son Andy also played League football. At the age of 30, a month after he announced his retirement, Caton suddenly died of a heart attack at home in Oxfordshire.

Canteen Boy is a naive, childlike assistant scoutmaster with an acute attention to detail. He is always seen with a full scout's uniform and a canteen around his neck. Canteen Boy is routinely mocked by other characters in the sketch, who are well aware that their jokes will be lost on the character. It appears he lacks self-confidence, such as one time when he was called an idiot he proceeds to call the bully an idiot too, only to say he said nothing when the bully threatens him. His revenge toward these bullies often ties into his skills as an outdoorsman. Canteen Boy is a master at snake-calling, and he enjoys the television show Seaquest. He has also said in passing that he very much admires Cheryl Tiegs. A sketch would often end with either Canteen Boy finding a snake or his tormentors having to run away from a sudden onslaught of snakes. Sandler later stated that there is nothing wrong with Canteen Boy, rather he is \\"someone who has been in the Scouts too long\\". Although the word 'boy' in the character's name suggests he's a child, it has been made clear that Canteen Boy is actually a 27-year-old man who still lives with his mom and is still active in the Boy Scouts. Since he is overage to be an active Scout, he is actually a Scout leader. However this was contradicted in a brief bit where Chris Farley plays a fellow Scout, and it is assumed Farley was meant to be a teenager. The season 19 Valentine's Day episode hosted by Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger had a sketch where Baldwin played Mr. Armstrong, a scoutmaster who made overt sexual advances toward Canteen Boy. NBC received many complaints about the skit, saying that it was homophobic and trivialized pedophilia. Actual molestation did not occur, as Canteen Boy had clearly understood what was happening and was ill at ease with Mr. Armstrong's attitude. The sketch ends with Canteen Boy running off into the woods. The sketch became the subject of Baldwin's monologue the next time he hosted on December 10, 1994. In the VHS Best of Adam Sandler release, a disclaimer is added that explicitly states that Canteen Boy is 27 years old and that the sketch is based on actual events (with some elements added in for dramatic effect). This disclaimer has also been put in the NBC 90-minute rerun, the version shown on the Best of Alec Baldwin DVD, and versions shown on NBC's SNL app as well as on Netflix and Hulu. The 60-minute version shown on some cable channels omit the sketch. Sandler later reworked Canteen Boy by amalgamating him with Cajun Man, another SNL character played by Sandler. Both characters were merged into the protagonist of Sandler's 1998 film The Waterboy.

Its degree over K equals the class number of K and the Galois group of E over K is canonically isomorphic to the ideal class group of K using Frobenius elements for prime ideals in K. In this context, the Hilbert class field of K is not just unramified at the finite places (the classical ideal theoretic interpretation) but also at the infinite places of K. That is, every real embedding of K extends to a real embedding of E (rather than to a complex embedding of E). Examples *If the ring of integers of K is a unique factorization domain, in particular if K = \\\\mathbb{Q} , then K is its own Hilbert class field. *Let K = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-15}) of discriminant -15. The field L = \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{-3}, \\\\sqrt{5}) has discriminant 225=(-15)^2 and so is an everywhere unramified extension of K, and it is abelian. Using the Minkowski bound, one can show that K has class number 2. Hence, its Hilbert class field is L . A non-principal ideal of K is (2,(1+)/2), and in L this becomes the principal ideal ((1+)/2). *To see why ramification at the archimedean primes must be taken into account, consider the real quadratic field K obtained by adjoining the square root of 3 to Q. This field has class number 1 and discriminant 12, but the extension K(i)/K of discriminant 9=32 is unramified at all prime ideals in K, so K admits finite abelian extensions of degree greater than 1 in which all finite primes of K are unramified. This doesn't contradict the Hilbert class field of K being K itself: every proper finite abelian extension of K must ramify at some place, and in the extension K(i)/K there is ramification at the archimedean places: the real embeddings of K extend to complex (rather than real) embeddings of K(i). *By the theory of complex multiplication, the Hilbert class field of an imaginary quadratic field is generated by the value of the elliptic modular function at a generator for the ring of integers (as a Z-module). History The existence of a (narrow) Hilbert class field for a given number field K was conjectured by and proved by Philipp Furtw√§ngler. The existence of the Hilbert class field is a valuable tool in studying the structure of the ideal class group of a given field. Additional properties The Hilbert class field E also satisfies the following: *E is a finite Galois extension of K and [E : K]=hK, where hK is the class number of K. *The ideal class group of K is isomorphic to the Galois group of E over K. *Every ideal of OK extends to a principal ideal of the ring extension OE (principal ideal theorem). *Every prime ideal P of OK decomposes into the product of hK/f prime ideals in OE, where f is the order of [P] in the ideal class group of OK. In fact, E is the unique field satisfying the first, second, and fourth properties. Explicit constructions If K is imaginary quadratic and A is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of K, then adjoining the j-invariant of A to K gives the Hilbert class field.Theorem II.4.1 of Generalizations In class field theory, one studies the ray class field with respect to a given modulus, which is a formal product of prime ideals (including, possibly, archimedean ones). The ray class field is the maximal abelian extension unramified outside the primes dividing the modulus and satisfying a particular ramification condition at the primes dividing the modulus. The Hilbert class field is then the ray class field with respect to the trivial modulus 1. The narrow class field is the ray class field with respect to the modulus consisting of all infinite primes. For example, the argument above shows that \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{3}, i) is the narrow class field of \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{3}) . Notes References  * J. S.

Von Willebrand disease and von Willebrand factor are named after him. He also researched metabolism, obesity and gout, and was one of the first Finnish physicians to use insulin to treat a diabetic coma. Von Willebrand qualified in medicine in 1896 from the University of Helsinki, where he received his Ph.D in 1899. He worked at the University of Helsinki from 1900 until 1930. From 1908 until his retirement in 1933, he was the head of the department of medicine at the Deaconess Hospital in Helsinki, where he also was physician-in-chief from 1922 to 1931. In 1924, Von Willebrand was consulted about a young girl with a bleeding disorder. He described this disorder in 1926, distinguishing it from hemophilia. The disorder was named after him, becoming known as von Willebrand disease. The cause of the disease was later discovered to be a deficiency of a protein, now known as von Willebrand factor, that enables hemostasis. Early life and education Von Willebrand was born on 1 February 1870 in Vaasa, then part of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire. He was the third child of Fredrik Magnus von Willebrand and Signe Estlander. Fredrik had received a military education and later became an engineer. Von Willebrand belonged to a German noble family; his ancestors settled in Finland in the 18th century. Von Willebrand attended Vaasa Lyceum, where he excelled in botany, chemistry and zoology. During this time, he spent his summers collecting botanical, lepidopterological and ornithological specimens, and his winters exploring the Gulf of Bothnia. After obtaining his baccalaureate in 1890, he began his studies at the University of Helsinki, then known as the Imperial Alexander University in Finland. Prior to qualifying as a physician in 1896, he spent the summers of 1894 and 1895 working as a junior physician at a spa on the √Öland Islands. After graduation, Von Willebrand became assistant physician in the department of medicine at the Deaconess Hospital in Helsinki, where Ossian Schauman supervised his doctoral thesis on the changes in hemocyte count after venesection. Von Willebrand's early hematologic investigations also yielded a study on the regeneration of blood in anemia and a description of a method for the staining of blood smears using eosin and methylene blue. He received his Ph.D in 1899 from the University of Helsinki, for the thesis Zur Kenntnis der Blutver√§nderungen nach Aderl√§ssen (\\"Blood Changes after Venesection\\"). Career After the completion of his dissertation in 1899, Von Willebrand was appointed chief physician at a spa in Heinola, and he shifted his interest from hematology to applied physiology. From 1900 to 1906, he lectured anatomy and later physiology at the University of Helsinki. During this period, he researched thermotherapy, particularly the health effects of saunas, and phototherapy, and invented an apparatus for measuring the dermal excretion of carbon dioxide and water. Von Willebrand's interest in internal medicine outweighed his interest in balneology and physical therapy, however, and in 1907 he took up the position of chief physician at a municipal hospital in Helsinki. In 1908, he was appointed docent in internal medicine at the University of Helsinki. Concomitant with this appointment, he succeeded Schauman as head of the department of medicine at the Deaconess Hospital in Helsinki. He also took over the laboratory at the Deaconess Hospital, which was renowned for its hematological services. In this position, he studied metabolism, obesity and gout. In 1912, he developed a method for measuring ketone bodies in urine, and the following year discussed dietetic treatments for diabetes. In 1918, nearly two decades after his last paper of the sort, Von Willebrand resumed his publishing of hematologic works, releasing studies on aplastic, hypochromic and pernicious anaemia. He also published a study regarding heart valve conditions based on data from over 10,000 autopsies performed in Helsinki from 1867 to 1916, and was a pioneer in the use of insulin, describing in 1922 its use in the treatment of diabetic comas. In February 1924, he successfully brought a moribund patient out of a diabetic coma through the application of insulin, using some of the first batch of the hormone ever delivered to Finland. Von Willebrand remained at the University of Helsinki until 1930. He was physician-in-chief of the Deaconess Hospital from 1922 to 1931, and became honorary professor in 1930. He remained head of the Deaconess Hospital's department of medicine until his retirement in 1933. Von Willebrand continued to publish articles after his retirement. On his 75th birthday, he released his last paper, entitled En genetisk blodsykdom blant innbyggerne p√• √Öland (\\"A genetic blood disease amongst the islanders of √Öland\\"). =Von Willebrand disease= In April 1924, Von Willebrand was consulted about Hj√∂rdis Sundblom, a five-year-old girl with a severe bleeding condition. Hj√∂rdis was the ninth of 11 children in a family from F√∂gl√∂, one of the √Öland Islands. She experienced regular bleeding from the nose, lips, gums and skin, as did six of her siblings. Three of her sisters had died due to the condition, and eight years later Hj√∂rdis died due to menorrhagia. Hj√∂rdis was brought to Von Willebrand's laboratory in Helsinki and he did not himself visit F√∂gl√∂, but with the cooperation of a local schoolteacher he mapped the family pedigree. He found that the condition was present in the three previous generations, on both sides of Hj√∂rdis' family. 16 of the 35 women analysed had the condition (to a mild or severe degree), and 7 of the 31 men analysed had the condition (to a slight degree). An analysis of the heredity involved led Von Willebrand to assume the inheritance was dominant, in contrast to hemophilia which was known to be a recessive disorder. The condition also differed from hemophilia in that it affected females at least as often as males. He published a Swedish-language article in 1926 about the disease, titled Heredit√§r pseudohemofili (\\"Hereditary pseudohemophilia\\"). He referenced six previous publications from the years of 1876 to 1922, totalling 19 cases on families with bleeding diatheses. The earlier authors attributed the condition to hemophilia (even in the cases of females) or to thrombopathy, which was discovered shortly before as the cause of what had previously been known as purpura hemorrhagica or Werlhof's disease. Von Willebrand also conducted hematological examinations on Hj√∂rdis and some of her family members. He recorded a normal or slightly reduced number of platelets and an undisturbed clot retraction, unlike Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The bleeding time (Duke) was greatly prolonged, extending to more than 2 hours in some cases, while the clotting time was within the normal range. He concluded that the disease was either a new form of thrombopathy or a condition of the capillary endothelium. Von Willebrand published a German-language version of Heredit√§r pseudohemofili in 1931, which attracted international attention in the disease. Blood samples were sent to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, and to several researchers in Europe, including in Leipzig. J√ºrgens contacted Von Willebrand and together they conducted studies on his patients. They also researched hemorheology, seeking to understand the underlying mechanism of bleeding disorders. In 1933 they co- authored an account of the disease, renaming it \\"constitutional thrombopathy\\". Numerous papers were subsequently published on the disease and it became eponymously known as von Willebrand disease between the late 1930s and the early 1940s. In 1957, it was discovered that von Willebrand disease is caused by a deficiency of a protein in blood plasma that enables hemostasis. The protein was characterised in 1971, and is known as von Willebrand factor. Von Willebrand factor has two functions. Firstly, it is the carrier molecule for factor VIII, the anti-hemophilic factor. Secondly, it promotes the aggregation of platelets and attachment to the vessel wall. In 2011, Jan van Gijn and Joost P. Gijselhart, writing in the Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde, remarked that Von Willebrand was not far wrong when he named the disease \\"hereditary pseudohemophilia\\". Personal life and death In his personal life, Von Willebrand was described as a mild-mannered and modest man. He married Walborg Maria Antell in 1900, and had two daughters. As a member of the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland, he was a supporter of Ossian Schauman's Folkh√§lsan, which promoted social welfare and health care for Swedish-speaking Finns. His research on the bleeding condition of the √Öland islanders was of particular interest to him, as it was a hereditary disorder that affected the Swedish-speaking minority. After his retirement in 1933 he became an avid gardener and a supporter of nature conservation. Von Willebrand died on 12 September 1949, at the age of 79. In 1994, he was commemorated with a stamp issued by the √Öland Islands. The stamp was one in a set of two: the other commemorated Erik Jorpes, known for his pioneering work on heparin.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Tecumseh is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  Namesake  Tecumseh HMCS Tecumseh is named after the Shawnee warrior and chief, who became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal confederacy in the early 19th century. Tecumseh is honoured in Canada as a hero and military commander who played a major role in Canada's successful repulsion of an American invasion in the War of 1812, which, among other things, eventually led to Canada's Confederation in 1867 with the British North America Act. History Calgary's Naval Reserve division was established on 31 March 1923 as the Calgary Half-Company. From 1935-1940 it was known as the Calgary Division until being christened HMCS Tecumseh on 1 November 1941. In 1943, the division moved to its present location on 17 Avenue SW. The Calgary Half-Company of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) poses for a formal portrait in 1938. During the Second World War, over 4,500 personnel enlisted at Tecumseh. Of those 52 were killed in action. Among them was Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray, RCNVR, the only person in the RCN to receive the Victoria Cross. Unlike some Naval Reserve divisions in Canada, Tecumseh survived post-war defence cuts. It has since survived other challenges including the 1968 Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, and a major fire in 1981. Rebuilt since the fire, Tecumseh is a fully modern training facility.alt= Subsequent to rebuilding, Tecumseh became the headquarters of the first female flag officer in the Canadian Navy, Commodore Laraine Orthlieb. In 1992, several members of Tecumseh volunteered for duty in the aftermath of the Gulf War, and two were selected to serve on board . With the arrival of the s, officers from Tecumseh were selected as the commissioning captains of HMC ships , , and . Tecumseh personnel were deployed to combat Manitoba's 1997 flood, provided security at the 1997 APEC meeting in Vancouver, and assisted in the recovery mission following the Swissair Flight 111 crash off Halifax as members of the maritime coastal defence vessel crews assigned to the operation. More recently, Tecumseh personnel have provided support for the G8 Summit in 2002 and participated in Operation Apollo in the Gulf of Oman in 2003. Members of the ship's company now regularly deploy as part of Operation Caribbe, in support of international drug interdiction efforts.http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/operations-canada-north-america- recurring/op-caribbe.page Tecumseh helped mark the centennial of the Canadian Navy in 2010, a significant year in Calgary's military history, with three army reserve units also celebrating 100th anniversaries.The King's Own Calgary Regiment, The Calgary Highlanders, and 14 (Calgary) Service Battalion In 2013, members of HMCS Tecumseh took part in the Nijmegen Marches. The Nijmegen Marches consist of four days of marching through the countryside and crowded streets of towns and villages in the Nijmegen area. Each military participant marches 160 kilometres while wearing standard combat clothing and carrying a military backpack weighing at least 10 kilograms.http://www.forces.gc.ca/en/news/article.page?doc=canadian-armed- forces-participation-in-the-2013-nijmegen-marches/hjiq6l6a Operations HMCS Tecumseh is properly referred to as a ship, as it has been officially christened as Her Majesty's Canadian ship. However, since the ship is part of the reserves it does not operate full time, except for the museum. Rather, most of the operations occur in the evening on weekdays. The primary operations of the ship include a recruitment office, two cadet corps, the Canadian Naval Museum, and the Tecumseh Naval Reserve Band.

Within a few years, it became one of Russia's largest brewery companies. In 2005 it was sold to InBev. Brief details After opening as an American style brewery restaurant in 1998 in St Petersburg, Tinkoff expanded to become Russia's fourth largest independent brewery, opening a 2 million hectoliter state-of-the-art brewery in 2002 in Pushkin near St Petersburg. The company opened several more brewpubs across Russia. By 2005 the company had ten brewpubs, a firm and growing share of the market for premium lager, and was exporting to Europe and America. In July 2005 InBev bought the Pushkin brewery and the Tinkoff brand name for ‚Ç¨167 million. Oleg Tinkov retained the chain of restaurants (located in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Samara, Russia, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Yekaterinburg, Sochi, Almaty and Kazan) which he sold to Mint Capital in 2009. In May 2010, Mint Capital announced it was looking to sell. In late 2010, Mint Capital announced that it sold its interest in Tinkoff Brewery and although no price was announced, it was widely reported that the chain was offered for sale for $1 (and assumption of all debts).

General statement of the class number formula We start with the following data: * is a number field. * , where denotes the number of real embeddings of , and is the number of complex embeddings of . * is the Dedekind zeta function of . * is the class number, the number of elements in the ideal class group of . * is the regulator of . * is the number of roots of unity contained in . * is the discriminant of the extension . Then: :Theorem (Class Number Formula). converges absolutely for and extends to a meromorphic function defined for all complex with only one simple pole at , with residue :: \\\\lim_{s \\\\to 1} (s-1) \\\\zeta_K(s) = \\\\frac{2^{r_1} \\\\cdot(2\\\\pi)^{r_2} \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{Reg}_K \\\\cdot h_K}{w_K \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{D_K}} This is the most general \\"class number formula\\". In particular cases, for example when is a cyclotomic extension of , there are particular and more refined class number formulas. Proof The idea of the proof of the class number formula is most easily seen when K = Q(i). In this case, the ring of integers in K is the Gaussian integers. An elementary manipulation shows that the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 is the average of the coefficients of the Dirichlet series representation of the Dedekind zeta function. The n-th coefficient of the Dirichlet series is essentially the number of representations of n as a sum of two squares of nonnegative integers. So one can compute the residue of the Dedekind zeta function at s = 1 by computing the average number of representations. As in the article on the Gauss circle problem, one can compute this by approximating the number of lattice points inside of a quarter circle centered at the origin, concluding that the residue is one quarter of pi. The proof when K is an arbitrary imaginary quadratic number field is very similar.https://www.math.umass.edu/~weston/oldpapers/cnf.pdf In the general case, by Dirichlet's unit theorem, the group of units in the ring of integers of K is infinite. One can nevertheless reduce the computation of the residue to a lattice point counting problem using the classical theory of real and complex embeddingshttp://planetmath.org/realandcomplexembeddings and approximate the number of lattice points in a region by the volume of the region, to complete the proof. Dirichlet class number formula Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet published a proof of the class number formula for quadratic fields in 1839, but it was stated in the language of quadratic forms rather than classes of ideals. It appears that Gauss already knew this formula in 1801. This exposition follows Davenport. Let d be a fundamental discriminant, and write h(d) for the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms with discriminant d. Let \\\\chi = \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{d}{m}\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) be the Kronecker symbol. Then \\\\chi is a Dirichlet character. Write L(s,\\\\chi) for the Dirichlet L-series based on \\\\chi. For d > 0, let t > 0, u > 0 be the solution to the Pell equation t^2 - d u^2 = 4 for which u is smallest, and write :\\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{1}{2}(t + u \\\\sqrt{d}). (Then Œµ is either a fundamental unit of the real quadratic field \\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\sqrt{d}) or the square of a fundamental unit.) For d < 0, write w for the number of automorphisms of quadratic forms of discriminant d; that is, :w = \\\\begin{cases} 2, & d < -4; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4, & d = -4; \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6, & d = -3. \\\\end{cases} Then Dirichlet showed that :h(d)= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{w \\\\sqrt{d}}{2 \\\\pi} L(1,\\\\chi), & d < 0; \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{\\\\sqrt{d}}{\\\\ln \\\\epsilon} L(1,\\\\chi), & d > 0. \\\\end{cases} This is a special case of Theorem 1 above: for a quadratic field K, the Dedekind zeta function is just \\\\zeta_K(s) = \\\\zeta(s) L(s, \\\\chi), and the residue is L(1,\\\\chi). Dirichlet also showed that the L-series can be written in a finite form, which gives a finite form for the class number. Suppose \\\\chi is primitive with prime conductor q. Then : L(1, \\\\chi) = \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\dfrac{\\\\pi}{q^{3/2}}\\\\sum_{m=1}^{q-1} m \\\\left( \\\\dfrac{m}{q} \\\\right), & q \\\\equiv 3 \\\\mod 4; \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\dfrac{1}{q^{1/2}}\\\\sum_{m=1}^{q-1} \\\\left( \\\\dfrac{m}{q} \\\\right) \\\\ln 2\\\\sin \\\\dfrac{m\\\\pi}{q} , & q \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod 4. \\\\end{cases} Galois extensions of the rationals If K is a Galois extension of Q, the theory of Artin L-functions applies to \\\\zeta_K(s). It has one factor of the Riemann zeta function, which has a pole of residue one, and the quotient is regular at s = 1. This means that the right-hand side of the class number formula can be equated to a left- hand side :Œ† L(1,œÅ)dim œÅ with œÅ running over the classes of irreducible non- trivial complex linear representations of Gal(K/Q) of dimension dim(œÅ). That is according to the standard decomposition of the regular representation. Abelian extensions of the rationals This is the case of the above, with Gal(K/Q) an abelian group, in which all the œÅ can be replaced by Dirichlet characters (via class field theory) for some modulus f called the conductor. Therefore all the L(1) values occur for Dirichlet L-functions, for which there is a classical formula, involving logarithms. By the Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem, all the values required for an analytic class number formula occur already when the cyclotomic fields are considered. In that case there is a further formulation possible, as shown by Kummer. The regulator, a calculation of volume in 'logarithmic space' as divided by the logarithms of the units of the cyclotomic field, can be set against the quantities from the L(1) recognisable as logarithms of cyclotomic units. There result formulae stating that the class number is determined by the index of the cyclotomic units in the whole group of units. In Iwasawa theory, these ideas are further combined with Stickelberger's theorem.

It is a hill station and lies at the base of the great Himalayan mountain range, at an elevation of about Garhwal- Himalaya-Ost, 1:150,000 scale topographic map, prepared in 1992 by Ernst Huber for the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, based on maps of the Survey of India, and is a starting point of various treks into the interior of the range.  Establishment  During a summer festival organized in Munsiyari market in 2013, a proposal for granting Munsiyari the status of Nagar Panchayat (lower level Municipality) was passed by the locals. Gram Panchayats attached to the Munsiyari market had also given their consent for this. On 28 February 2014, the Uttarakhand Cabinet decided to grant Nagar Panchayat status to the towns of Munsiyari, Chaukhutia and Naugaon. Shortly afterwards, the then Chief Minister Harish Rawat made an announcement confirming this move while on a visit to the town. The municipal area was to be created by incorporating 5 Gram Panchayats: Mallaghorpatta, Tallaghorpatta, Bunga, Sarmoli and Jainti. An official notification was issued on 7 October 2014, but due to major opposition by the Gram Sabhas, the Nagar Panchayat could not come into existence. In June 2015, several government officials visited the area and tried to initiate talks with local villagers. After all the talks failed, the notification that allowed the formation of Nagar Panchayat was revoked on 22 August 2016.  Overview  In local parlance, the name 'Munsiyari' refers to a 'place with snow'. Situated on the banks of Goriganga river, it is a fast-growing tourist destination, and mountaineers, glacier enthusiasts, high altitude trekkers and nature lovers commonly use it as their hub or base camp. Munsiyari also falls on the ancient salt route from Tibet and is at the entrance of the Johar Valley, which extends along the path of the Gori Ganga river to its source at the Milam Glacier. It is inhabited mainly by people of a few different caste groups including the Shauka tribe, dalits or Scheduled Castes and people categorized in other general castes comprising Kshatriya's, Pandits with a few Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists. Munsiyari bazaar is a conglomeration of revenue villages and is not categorized as a town. The bazaar area comprises the villages of Malla Ghorpatta and Bunga, while Naya Basti, Sarmoli, Nana Sem, Jainti, Papdi villages form the periphery of the area popularly called Munsiyari. The main bazaar area faces east towards the Himalayan Panchachuli ranges. The upper part of Munsiyari is called Malla Johar, which comprises 14 trans-humant alpine villages, that are seasonally occupied during the months of May to early November.  Economy  Principally subsistence based agriculture and animal husbandry and allied activities. Many families are dependent on forests and natural resources for their livelihoods.Theophilus E, Et Al (2002), A Biodiversity Log And Strategy Input, Document For The Gori River Basin, Western Himalaya Ecoregion District Pithoragarh, Uttaranchal, A Sub-State Process Under The National Biodiversity Strategy And Action Plan India, Foundation For Ecological Security Traditionally medicinal plants have been collected for own use and for trade, however since 2000 there has been a tremendous increase in the extraction of Yarsa-Gombu or Keeda Ghas (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) which has changed the economy and scale of collection from the wild.

Chennai architecture is a confluence of many architectural styles. From ancient Tamil temples built by the Pallavas, to the Indo-Saracenic style (pioneered in Madras) of the colonial era, to 20th- century steel and chrome of skyscrapers. Chennai has a colonial core in the port area, surrounded by progressively newer areas as one travels away from the port, punctuated with old temples, churches and mosques. As of 2014, Chennai city, within its corporation limits covering 426 sq km, has about 625,000 buildings, of which about 35,000 are multi-storied (with four and more floors). Of these, nearly 19,000 are designated as commercial ones. Brief history The European architectural styles, such as Neo-Classical, Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance, were brought to India by European colonists. Chennai, being the first major British settlement in the Indian Subcontinent, witnessed several of the earliest constructions built in these styles. The initial structures were utilitarian warehouses and walled trading posts, giving way to fortified towns along the coastline. Although several European colonists, namely, Portuguese, Danish and French, initially influenced the architectural style of the region, it was chiefly the British who left a lasting impact on the city's architecture succeeding the Mughals in the country. They followed various architectural styles, with Gothic, Imperial, Christian, English Renaissance and Victorian being the essentials. Starting with factories, several types of buildings such as courts, educational institutions, municipal halls, and dak bungalows were built, most of which were ordinary structures built by garrison engineers. Churches and other public buildings displayed a more nuanced architecture. Most of the buildings were adaptations of the buildings designed by leading British architects of that time like Wren, Adam, Nash and others in London and other places. For instance, the Pachaiyappa's Hall in Chennai was modelled on the Athenium Temple of Theseus. Unlike Europe, these buildings were built mostly of brick and stuccoed with lime, with \\"facades\\" sometimes incised to resemble stones. Some later buildings, however, were built with stones. Several churches were built based on London prototypes, with variations as highly original works. The earliest example is the St. Mary's Church in Fort St. George. The Senate House at the University of Madras. The transfer of power to the British Crown from the English East India Company, the rise of Indian nationalism and the introduction of railways marked several milestones in the history of British Colonial Indian architecture. New materials like concrete, glass, wrought and cast iron were being increasingly used in construction, which opened up new architectural possibilities. Native Indian styles were assimilated and adopted in the architecture. All these factors led to the development of Indo-Saracenic architecture towards the end of the 19th century. Victorian in essence, it borrowed heavily from the Islamic style of Mughal and Afghan rulers, and was primarily a hybrid style that combined diverse architectural elements of Hindu and Mughal with gothic cusped arches, domes, spires, tracery, minarets and stained glass. F. S. Growse, Sir Swinton Jacob, R. F. Chisholm and H. Irwin were the pioneers of this style of architecture, of whom the latter two designed several buildings in Chennai. The Chepauk Palace, designed by Paul Benfield, is said to be the first Indo- Saracenic building in India. Other outstanding examples of this style of architecture include the Law Courts, Victoria Memorial Hall, Presidency College and the Senate House of the University of Madras. Styles of architecture Interior of the Connemara Public Library The Government Museum, Egmore, in the Indo-Saracenic style. The Indo-Saracenic style of architecture dominated Chennai's building style just as Gothic style dominated Mumbai's building style, before the advent of Art Deco style. After the Indo-Saracenic, the Art Deco was the next great design movement to impact the city's skyline and it made way for the international and modern styles. Just as Bombay developed an intermediary style that combined both the Gothic and Art Deco, so too did Chennai with a combination of Indo-Saracenic and Art Deco in the University Examination Hall, the Hindu High School and Kingston House (Seetha Kingston School). However, many buildings are either being defaced by modern ornamentation or being completely demolished to make way for new constructions. An example is the Oceanic Hotel which was classic Art Deco and which has since been razed to the ground for an IT park. The language department of the University of Madras is another. =Indo-Saracenic and colonial style= Victoria Public Hall, Chennai In the city, one can notice the British influence in the form of old cathedrals and the mix of Hindu, Islamic and Gothic revival styles that resulted in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. Many of the colonial era buildings are designed in this style. The colonial legacy of Chennai is most apparent in the vicinity of the port. South of the port is Fort St George. The stretch between the fort and the port is occupied mostly by the High Court buildings and several clubs, some of which have existed since the British era. A little south of the fort, across the Cooum River, is the Chepauk cricket stadium, another British staple, dating from 1916. North and west of the port is George Town, where dockyard workers and other manual labourers used to live. George Town is now a bustling commercial centre, but its architecture is significantly different from areas closer to the fort, with narrower roads and tightly packed buildings. Most of the colonial-style buildings are concentrated in the area around the port and Fort St George. The remaining parts of the city consist of primarily modern architecture in concrete, glass and steel. The Chepauk Palace, designed by Paul Benfield, is said to be the first Indo-Saracenic building in India. However, most of the Indo-Saracenic structures in the city were designed by English architects Robert Fellowes Chisholm and Henry Irwin and can be seen across the city, especially in areas such as Esplanade, Chepauk, Anna Salai, Egmore, Guindy, Aminjikarai and Park Town. Prominent structures in the Esplanade region include the Madras High Court (built in 1892), the General Post Office, State Bank of India building, Metropolitan Magistrate Courts, YMCA building, and the Law College. Chepauk area is equally dense with these structures with Senate House and library of the University of Madras, Chepauk Palace, PWD Buildings, Oriental Research Institute and the Victoria Hostel. Southern Railway headquarters, Ripon Building, the Victoria Public Hall, and the Madras Medical College's anatomy block are examples of Indo-Saracenic- style structures found in Park Town. Structures such as Bharat Insurance Building, Agurchand Mansion and the Poombhuhar Showroom are found along the Anna Salai, and Amir Mahal is in Triplicane. Structure found in Guindy include College of Engineering and Old Mowbrays Boat Club. Egmore is dotted with several such structures including the Government Museum, Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Veterinary College, State Archives building, National Art Gallery, and College of Arts and Crafts. St. George's School Chapel and the Southern Railway Offices in Aminjikarai are other examples of the Indo- Saracenic structures in the city. =Art Deco= Art Deco buildings in Parrys Corner A Neo Classical architecture example of Citi Centre Mall In the early 20th century, several major modern institutions such as banking and commerce, railways, press and education were established in the city, mostly through colonial rule. The architecture for these institutions followed the earlier directions of the Neo-Classical and the Indo-Saracenic. The residential architecture was based on the bungalow or the continuous row house prototypes. From 1930s onwards, many buildings in George Town were built in the Art Deco style of architecture. Art Deco, a popular international design movement that flourished between the 1920s and 1940s, was adapted by cities such as Bombay and Madras almost immediately. Although Chennai does not have a uniform art deco skyline like the way Mumbai does, the city has significant pockets that are clearly completely art deco. A long stretch along NSC Bose Road beginning from EID Parry and a similar stretch along the Esplanade used to have several examples of public buildings in the art deco style. Yet another instance is along the stretch of Poonamallee High Road between Chennai Central and Chennai Egmore railway stations. Similarly there are many areas in south Chennai with bungalows designed in similar fashion. Some early examples are the United India building (presently housing LIC) and the Burma Shell building (presently the Chennai House), both built in the 1930s along Esplanade. The Dare House, the most famous landmark at the junction of NSC Bose Road and First Line Beach Road, was built in 1940 as the office of the Parry's company. It is after which the area is named Parry's Corner. These buildings were departures from earlier models in that they were planned without external verandahs and incorporated new technology such as the lift. Cantilevered porches that showcases the potential of concrete are also seen in some structures. Externally, the stylistic devices such as stepped motifs and sweeping curves used in areas like grilles, parapet walls along with vertically proportioned windows impart a coherent appearance. Attempts to Indianise Art Deco also led to elegant, decorative buildings like the Oriental Insurance building of the 1930s. Situated at one of the corners of Armenian Street, it imposes delicately with its chattri (domed pavilion) and projecting ornamented balconies. Such a direction is sometimes termed the 'Indo-Deco'. Art Deco continued into the 1950s too, with the Bombay Mutual building (presently housing LIC) along NSC Bose Road and the South Indian Chamber of Commerce building on Esplanade being built during this period. Art Deco buildings located at road junctions had curvilinear profiles. This approach is sometimes considered a separate style, the Streamline Moderne, inspired by the streamlining of aeroplanes, bullets, ships, and the like, due to principles such as aerodynamics. Apart from the Dare House, other buildings that portraits these characteristics are those along the junctions of Mount Road like the Bharath Insurance building of the 1930s and shops such as the current Bata showroom. Also along Mount Road and adjoining areas are other types of Art Deco buildings, The Hindu office with its stepped form and Connemara Hotel built between 1934 and 1937 are city landmarks. While cinema had come to Chennai in the early 20th century, the later cinema buildings offered yet another platform for the exposition of Art Deco. Casino Theatre and Kamadhenu Theatre of the 1950s stand testimony to this era. The Art Deco house in the city features sweeping porches, stepped corner windows, circular windows and rooms, and projecting staircase areas, with the furniture within the houses having motifs in order to resonate with the larger theme. Houses of the middle and lower income group too aspired towards such expressions as is evident in the City Improvement Trust project of Mambalam and the houses at Gandhinagar. Art Deco continued in the city into the late 1950s, when modernism had started gradually rooting itself. Art Deco served as the base from which modernism took off. =Agraharam architecture= The agraharam architecture Inside an agraharam house Some residential areas like Tiruvallikeni (Triplicane) and Mylapore have several houses dating from the early 20th century, especially those far removed from arterial roads. Known as the Agraharam, this style consists of traditional row houses usually surrounding a temple. Many of them were built in the traditional Tamil style, with four wings surrounding a square courtyard, and tiled sloping roofs. In sharp contrast, the apartment buildings along the larger roads in the same areas were built in 1990 or later. Typically, agraharams can be seen where an entire street is occupied by Brahmins, particularly surrounding a temple. The architecture is distinctive with Madras terraces, country tile roofing, Burma teak rafters and lime plastering. The longish homes consisted of the mudhal kattu (receiving quarters), irandaam kattu (living quarters), moondram kattu (kitchen and backyard) and so on. Most houses had an open to sky space in the centre called the mitham, large platforms lining the outside of the house called the thinnai and a private well in the backyard. The floors were often coated with red oxide and sometimes the roofs had glass tiles to let in light. The agraharam quadrangle seen in Triplicane is around the Parthasarathy Temple and its tank, while that of Mylapore is centred around the Kapaleeshwarar Temple and its tank. About 50 families continue to live in the agraharams in Triplicane. However, many of these houses are being replaced with modern multi-storied apartments, resulting in a reduction in their numbers. Traditional vernacular architecture can be found in some of the Agraharam houses in Mylapore, Triplicane, and Tiruvanmiyur. As of 2018, a team of architects and volunteers has documented traditional vernacular architectural designs of about 50 houses in Mylapore. =Post-Independence= LIC Building, the first skyscraper of Chennai After Independence, the city witnessed a rise in the Modernism style of architecture. The completion of the LIC Building in 1959, the tallest building in the country at that time, marked the transition from lime-and- brick construction to concrete columns in the region. The presence of the weather radar at the Chennai Port, however, prohibited the construction of buildings taller than 60 m around a radius of 10 km. The floor-area ratio (FAR) in the central business district is also 1.5, much less than that of smaller cities of the country. This resulted in the city expanding horizontally, unlike other metropolitan cities where vertical growth is prominent. On the contrary, the peripheral regions, especially on the southern and south-western sides, are experiencing vertical growth with the construction of buildings up to 50 floors. Within the downtown area, the 48-storied Highliving District Tower H remains the tallest building at 161 meters. Notable buildings Chennai Central Station Many historic buildings are still fully functional and host government, business or educational establishments. Chennai is home to the second largest collection of heritage buildings in the country, after Kolkata. =Fort St. George= Built in 1639, Fort St George, used to house the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and Secretariat. Tipu Sultan's cannons decorate the ramparts of the Fort's museum. The Fort has the country's tallest flagstaff at a height of 150 feet. The fort is one of the 163 notified areas (megalithic sites) in the state of Tamil Nadu. =Madras High Court= The Madras High Court is the second largest judicial building in the world next only to the Courts of London. It is a good example of the Indo-Saracenic style and was completed in 1892. Valluvar Kottam from the terrace of the exhibition hall. =Valluvar Kottam= The Valluvar Kottam, constructed in 1976, is an auditorium in memory of the poet-saint Thiruvalluvar. All 1,330 verses of the poet's epic, the Thirukkural, are inscribed on the granite pillars that surround the auditorium. There is a 101-feet high temple chariot structure with a life-size image of the poet in it. The base of the chariot shows in bas-relief the 133 chapters of the Thirukkural. =Railway stations= There are a number of railway stations of interest in Chennai, primarily built throughout the colonial era. These include the Egmore station, the Royapuram station dating from 1856, the Chennai Central station dating from 1873 and the Southern Railway Headquarters built in 1922. =Other interesting buildings= The Government Museum (designed by Henry Irwin and completed in 1896), the Senate House of the Madras University and the College of Engineering, Guindy are some more examples of the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. Other buildings of architectural significance are the Presidency College, built in 1840, the Ripon Building (now housing the Chennai Corporation) dating from 1913, The War Memorial, Vivekanandar Illam, The Museum Theatre and the Ramakrishna Math temple. Adjoining the Governor's residence (Raj Bhavan) at Guindy, there are five mandapams (or memorials) dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, the first Indian Governor General C Rajagopalachari, former Chief Ministers of the state Kamaraj and Bhaktavatsalam and one to Martyrs in general. Urban planning Chennai city is arranged in a grid pattern running north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest. Roads and localities have undergone significant change in the late 20th century. Many areas along the western stretch of the city were planned development efforts, such as Ashok Nagar, KK Nagar and Anna Nagar. Several areas south of the Adyar River, including Kotturpuram, Besant Nagar and Adyar itself, have been developed only since the mid-1960s. Characteristic features of all these localities are their unusually wide roads and Cartesian grid layouts. Many of these places were remote suburbs when they were first developed. Current urban development efforts are concentrated along the southern and western suburbs, largely seeking to benefit from the growing IT corridor in the southeast and the new ring roads in the west. The extent of the city's urban sprawl is indicated by the fact that the area administered by Chennai Corporation is 174 km¬≤, while the total urbanized area is estimated to be over 1,100 km¬≤.
