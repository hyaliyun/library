The company supplies communications and security products and electrical and electronic wire and cable. Anixter is a Fortune 500 company. In 2011, the company had $6.15 billion in revenue, operating in 260 cities in 50 countries. The company operates with three major divisions: Network & Security Solutions, Electrical and Electronic Solutions, and Utility Power Solutions. Aerospace Hardware, once considered the fourth division, was sold by Anixter in 2011 to Greenbriar Equity, which formed Align Aerospace. In 2002 Anixter was named as a Forbes \\"Platinum 400\\" company. In 2013, Fortune ranked Anixter 405 in the Fortune 500 list. On January 13, 2020, Anixter agreed to be acquired by WESCO International for $4.5 billion in cash and WESCO stock. Early history Anixter was started in 1956 by brothers Alan and Bill Anixter. Known originally as Anixter Brothers, the two opened Anixter as a wholesale distribution company that resold cable. The two brothers received a $20,000 loan from their mother to get the business started, and within 10 years grew revenue to $10 million. In 1969, Anixter moved its headquarters to Skokie. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Alan Anixter said he carried a list of acquisitions in his pocket, and by the end of the 1960s, Anixter acquired 19 companies. Anixter went public on the American Stock Exchange in 1967 and expanded to the U.K. in 1972. In 1975, Anixter gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, and by the end of the 1970s it had $268 million in sales and 38 warehouses in the U.S., nine in Canada, three in the U.K. and one in the Netherlands. Telecommunications Era With the breakup of AT&T; in early 1984, Anixter went about hiring executives from phone companies and suppliers and invested heavily in its telecommunications business. Until this time, regional telephone companies had to buy their equipment directly from AT&T;'s Western Electric Company; however, this ruling allowed a business like Anixter's to sell direct to regional telephone companies. By the mid 1980s, telecommunications sales made up 60 to 70 percent of Anixter's business. In 1987, the holding company bought Anixter, which had moved into the data communications business. Itel was led by Samuel Zell, who had become chairman in 1985. In the late 1980s, Anixter created a program called Levels to compare one brand of cable to the other. By the 1990s, the Levels program became industry standard, and in 2003, Anixter sold the Levels program to Underwriters Laboratories. In 1989, Anixter crossed the $1 billion mark in sales. By the 1990s, Itel made Anixter its core operation, and in 1995, Itel changed its name to Anixter. In the 1990s, Anixter continued to expand into different markets. It entered the Mexico market in 1991, Australia in 1992, and Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific in 1993. Anixter entered the South American market in 1995. In the later 1990s and 2000s, Anixter purchased Pacer Electronics, Pentacon, Walters Hexagon, DDI, Infast Group, MFU, Eurofast, Total Supply Solutions, Quality Screw & Nut and Quality Screw de Mexico, World Class Wire & Cable, Sofrasar, CamilleGergen, CLARK Security Products and Jorvex.

On May 16, 1997, both CEOs announced that the boards of directors of both companies had terminated the merger plan because of approval delays by the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and state regulators in Minnesota and Wisconsin.Wisconsin Energy Corp., Northern States Power Co. Agree to Terminate Merger Proceedings, PRNewswire, May 16 They also stated that regulatory agencies were changing their merger policies as they were considering the companies' filing and that further delay would reduce the benefits of the Primergy transaction. The delay already had put the merger five months behind schedule and had reduced earnings for both utilities by a total of US$58 million to that point. In addition, Wisconsin Energy's stock had fallen about 13% since early 1995 when the deal had been announced, while NSP's stock had risen by 6%.

Although mercury was originally used to provide the reflective coating for mirrors, elemental mercury was never used to create tableware. Silvered glass was free-blown, then silvered with a solution containing silver nitrate and grape sugar in solution, heated, then closed. Sealing methods include metal discs covered with a glass round or a cork inserted into the unpolished pontil scar. \\"Mercury\\" silvered glass was produced originally around 1840 until at least 1930 in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), Germany and was also manufactured in England from 1849 to 1855. Edward Varnish and Frederick Hale Thomson patented the technique for silvering glass vessels in 1849. The double walled blanks were furnished by James Powell. The English examples were often cased with a layer of colored glass in jewel tones of ruby red, cobalt blue, amethyst purple and emerald green then cut to silver as illustrated in the photograph. English signatures on silvered glass include E. Varnish & Co. London, Thomson, London and Thomas Lund. Blown glass is made utilizing a long metal blowpipe by the glass blower who shapes and heats the object. The piece is attached to a long, flat-topped iron called a pontil to the end of the piece, with a small piece of molten glass, and the blowpipe is now cracked off. The workman completes the object and then, the pontil rod or \\"punty\\" is cracked off leaving the familiar rough pontil scar. Companies in the United States, including the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, New England Glass Company, Union Glass Co., and the Boston Silver Glass Company, made silvered glass from about 1852‚Äì1880. The New England Glass Company displayed a variety of silvered glass articles including copper wheel engraved goblets, vases and other tableware at the 1853 New Crystal Palace Exhibition. Silvered mercury glass from Bohemia was also decorated with a variety of techniques including painting, enameling, etching, and surface engraving. Silvered \\"mercury\\" glass is considered one of the first true \\"art glass\\" types, that is, glass that was made for display and for its inherent artistic value rather than for utilitarian use. Authentic antique silvered glass pieces are still available in a wide range of decorative items and usually sold as mercury glass. There are many reproductions currently marketed as \\"mercury glass\\", in table form, ornaments and other objects. New \\"mercury glass\\" can be distinguished from antique silvered glass in several ways, including lack of a double wall, and solid bottoms that are different from true antique silvered glass.Pictorial Guide To Silvered Mercury Glass\\"Pictorial Guide To Silvered Mercury Glass,\\" Lytwyn, Diane.

It manufactures lacrosse, soccer, volleyball, and field hockey equipment. It markets its products under its own brand as well as In The Crease for goals and goal accessories. The company was founded by W.H. Brine in 1922 as the W.H. Brine Company. It was privately owned by the Brine family and named Brine, Inc. before it was acquired by New Balance on August 4, 2006. History =Foundation= Brine was founded in 1922 by W.H. Brine as the W.H. Brine Company. It started as a small sports equipment and uniform company. They sold to private schools and regional camps, quickly growing to a major manufacturer of lacrosse and soccer equipment. =1950s= During the 1950s Brine focused on lacrosse. Lacrosse sticks were all wooden at the time and the only company producing them was Chisholm Lacrosse which was located on the St. Regis Reservation, Cornwall Island, Canada. With the encouragement and assistance from A. MacDonald Murphy of Governor Dummer Academy, Ferris Thomsen, coach of Penn and Princeton and Mort LaPointe of Bowdoin College, the Brine family began to explore the possibilities of manufacturing lacrosse sticks. =1960s= Brine started to manufacture soccer balls and equipment in the 1960s. It was the first company to cover the ball with synthetic leather to make it more durable. It was also the first to make a perfectly round bladder and the first to unconditionally guarantee a ball. =1970s= Attempting to make a lacrosse stick that was durable and easy to make, the Brine family experimented with laminated wood, plastic, fiberglass and aluminum but could not find a material that met the performance standards. They continued to experiment and eventually found Surlyn, a DuPont plastic, to have the necessary properties to survive the intensity of lacrosse. Brine then developed a molding technique that was the basic draft shape of the standard in modern sticks. =Cascade= In 1986 Bill Brine left the family's company and founded Cascade, now the largest lacrosse helmet and eyewear company in the world. =Recent years= Brine started an apparel line and a line of volleyball equipment in the 1990s. In 2000, it released a full line of field hockey equipment. Brine began to make lacrosse helmets and eyemasks in 2003. Also in 2003, Brine acquired In The Crease, a lacrosse goal and accessories company based in Penn Yan, New York and in 2004 it began making athletic footwear. On August 4, 2006, New Balance acquired Brine and shortly after that the name was changed to Brine, Corp. from Brine, Inc.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Adenorhinus barbouri, p. 16). Description Atheris barbouri is a small species reaching only in total length (including tail). The head is broad, triangular and distinct from the neck. The snout is short and rounded. The head is covered with small, strongly keeled, imbricate scales. The eyes are prominent, about 1.5 times larger than the distance to the mouth. The nostril is in an extreme forward position and is part of a single nasal scale that touches the preocular scale. The body is moderately slender, while the tail is relatively short, shorter than in the genus Atheris, and not prehensile. The dorsal scales are arranged in 20-23 rows at midbody, and are strongly keeled, except for those in the outermost rows, which are smooth. Ventral scales number 116-122 and are rounded. Subcaudals are 19-23 and are single (undivided). The anal plate is single.U.S. Navy (1965). Poisonous Snakes of the World. Washington, District of Columbia: United States Government Printing Office. 212 pp. The color pattern consists of a brown to blackish brown ground color with a pair of zigzag stripes that run dorsolaterally from the back of the head to the end of the tail. These stripes may form an irregular chain of darker rhombic blotches down the back. The tail may have a faint, black checkering. The belly color is greenish white to olive. Common names Common names for A. barbouri include Uzungwe viper, Barbour's viper, worm-eating viper, Barbour's short-headed viper, and Uzungwe mountain bush viper. Geographic range The geographic range of A. barbouri is extremely limited. It is known only from the Uzungwe and Ukinga mountains of south-central Tanzania. The type locality is \\"Dabaga, Uzungwe Mountains, southeast of Iringa, Tanganyika Territory, altitude \\" (= Udzungwe Mountains, Tanzania). Habitat A terrestrial species, A. barbouri is found in bushes and bamboo undergrowth on mountain slopes at . It would seem that moist forest habitats are preferred, but it has also been found in gardens of tea farms.Spawls S, Howell K, Drewes R, Ashe J (2004). A Field Guide to the Reptiles of East Africa. Waltham, Massachusetts: Academic Press. 543 pp. . Behavior Little is known about the behavior of A. barbouri. It was first thought to be a burrowing species, but this is not likely as it has no obvious morphological adaptations for even a semifossorial life. Feeding It is believed that A. barbouri specializes in eating slugs, earthworms, and other soft-bodied invertebrates, and possibly also frogs. Reproduction Atheris barbouri is apparently oviparous. In February 1930, three females were collected that each contained 10 eggs. The largest egg measured . Venom No information is available regarding the venom of A. barbouri, its composition, its toxicity, or the effects of a bite. No cases of envenomation have been recorded. However, because of the very limited distribution, bites are unlikely to occur. Taxonomy Atheris barbouri was originally described as a member of the genus Atheris (bush vipers). It differs morphologically from the Atheris group, but recent research by Lenk et al. (2001) suggests that it is closely related to the sympatric species, Atheris ceratophora, even though it differs morphologically from all other members of the genus Atheris. Future research will show whether A. barbouri should be moved back to Atheris, or that Atheris ceratophora and A. barbouri should form a separate clade. Atheris barbouri is similar to Montatheris hindii and Proatheris superciliaris, which are also both terrestrial species from monotypic genera, as well as previous members of the Atheris group.

Resident at the Parco della Musica, the orchestra primarily performs its Rome concerts in the Sala Santa Cecilia. History The orchestra was founded in 1908 as the first Italian orchestra to devote itself exclusively to symphonic repertoire. Bernardino Molinari was the orchestra's first music director, serving from 1912 to 1944. Subsequent music directors included Franco Ferrara (1944‚Äì1945), Fernando Previtali (1953‚Äì1973), and Igor Markevitch (1973‚Äì1975). The orchestra was noted for its recordings of Italian opera for the Decca label with such conductors as Tullio Serafin. Thomas Schippers had been named the next music director to succeed Markevitch, but Schippers died in December 1977 before he could formally assume the post. The music directorship of the orchestra remained vacant until 1983, with the advent of Giuseppe Sinopoli as music director. Sinopoli assisted in restoring the fortunes of the orchestra, and expanded the orchestra's repertoire to include Mahler and Bruckner. Leonard Bernstein was the honorary president of the orchestra from 1983 until 1990. Antonio Pappano became the orchestra's music director in 2005. With Pappano, the orchestra has recorded commercially for EMI. Currently, Yuri Temirkanov has the title of honorary conductor of the orchestra.

It was the largest provider of general hospital healthcare services in the United States in terms of number of acute care facilities. CHS affiliates own, operate, or lease 95 hospitals in 16 states. At the close of 2016, it had operated 158 hospitals in 22 states. In August 2015, the company announced plans to spin off 38 hospitals and its management and consulting subsidiary, Quorum Health Resources, into a new publicly traded company called Quorum Health Corporation. The company completed the spinoff of Quorum Health Corporation on April 29, 2016. Quorum owns or leases hospitals across 16 states, primarily in cities or counties with populations of 50,000 or less. It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol: QHC. On October 3, 2016, CHS was removed from the S&P; Midcap 400 and added to the S&P; Smallcap 600. Under CEO Wayne T. Smith, the Company's stock has lost over 76% of its value since the year 2000. Chinese billionaire Tianqiao Chen had a 22.2 percent stake in Community Health Systems in 2017.Becker's Revenue Cycle Management Report (12/11/2017) History =Founding and early years (1985-2010)= E. Thomas Chaney, former executive of Hospital Affiliates, Inc. and David Steffy and Richard Ragsdale, former executives at Hospital Corporation of America spinoff Republic Health Corporation, formed Community Health Systems in 1985. The company made its initial public offering in 1991. In 1996, the company was purchased by private equity firm Forstmann Little & Company. Community Health Systems went public again in 2000. In August 2003, the company acquired Southside Regional Medical Center. On October 10, 2015, the 372-bed Grandview Medical Center began operating in Birmingham, Alabama, replacing Trinity Medical Center. In 2000, Community Health Systems paid $31 million to the United States Department of Justice to settle a review of its billing practices. In 2007, Community Health Systems purchased Plano, Texas- based Triad Hospitals for $6.8 billion, adding nearly 50 hospitals, hospital management and consulting business Quorum Health Resources, and nearly doubling the size of the company. Among the facilities included in the deal was McKenzie-Willamette Hospital in Springfield, Oregon; Trinity Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama; and the seven hospitals of Lutheran Health Network in the Ft. Wayne, Indiana region. In 2010, McKenzie-Willamette's healthcare workers' union, SEIU, Local 49, claimed that workload increases, slashed benefits, and staff reductions had lowered the quality of both patient care and quality of life for employees. The union, in its \\"Profits Before Community\\" campaign against the hospital, continues to highlight that profits have tripled while charitable care and employee benefits have steadily decreased since the hospital moved from a non-profit to a for-profit enterprise under CHS. =Recent developments (2011-present)= In 2011, it was accused by Tenet Healthcare of overbilling Medicare in its aggressive admissions policy compared to its peers. It was subpoenaed by Medicare on its aggressive billing to the Medicare systems. In 2013, Community Health Systems entered into an agreement with Health Management Associates to purchase HMA for about $3.6 billion in cash and stock. The merger was completed in January 2014 and made Community Health Systems the largest for-profit hospital operator at the time, with 206 hospitals in 29 states. The acquisition of HMA brought with it liability for lawsuits and criminal charges of fraudulent claims against Medicare and other federal programs. CHS settled these claims for $262 million in October, 2018. On August 4, 2014, Community Health Systems paid $95.14 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve multiple lawsuits \\"alleging that the company knowingly billed government health care programs for inpatient services that should have been billed as outpatient or observation services.\\" As part of the agreement, Community Health Systems was required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement that required the Company to participate in compliance efforts. It was reported on August 18, 2014 that hackers broke into Community Health System's records system and stole data on 4.5 million patients. These data included names, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, birthdays and telephone numbers. CHS provided all patients whose records were impacted with free identity theft protection. On February 2, 2015, Community Health Systems was required to pay $75 million to settle allegations \\"that they made illegal donations to county governments to reap more federal dollars under a now-discontinued matching program.\\" The allegations were brought about by a former CHS employee in a complaint under the False Claims Act. In October 2015, Community Health Systems paid $13 million to the United States Department of Justice to resolve allegations related to the False Claims Act. After CHS agreed in 2015 to sell Memorial Hospital of Salem County in New Jersey to Prime Healthcare Foundation,\\"Tennessee firm sells South Jersey hospital\\": Philadelphia Business Journal on December 1, 2015, author John George a nonprofit affiliated with Prime Healthcare Services; the sale was approved by New Jersey in early February 2017.Brubaker, Harold. \\"Sale of Memorial Hospital of Salem County approved\\": The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 2, 2017. Accessed April 16, 2017.\\"What's next after N.J. hospital sale gets key approval from state\\": NJ.com on February 2, 2017, author Bill Gallo Jr. On December 6, 2016 a former CFO of a CHS hospital was awarded $1.9 million in a whistleblower lawsuit he filed after he was terminated for refusing to submit false financial documents. In January 2017, a settlement between investors and CHS executives for $60 million was reached. The settlement resolved allegations of \\"breach of fiduciary duty\\" by CHS executives. In March 2017, Quorum's board retained outside counsel in relation to whether Community Health Systems had committed fraud with regards to financial projections for Quorum, and whether any of its current management may have been involved in any possible fraud. In June 2017 Quorum said although the investigation did not produce \\"conclusive evidence\\" of fraud the projections appeared to be incompetent at best. In April‚ÄìJuly 2017, Community Health Systems rejected overtures from key Lutheran Health Network doctors to facilitate sale of its profitable network in CHS to a third party, after assertions of continual lack of re-investment into the network's facilities and staff by CHS management. After those discussions/accusations became public, several key leaders of the affiliated hospitals, Lutheran and Dupont, and the network were fired or resigned. Key prominent local community leaders Chuck Surack and Tom Kelley resigned from the Lutheran Health Network's and hospitals' advisory boards. On March 13, 2018 it was reported that the Company had hired financial advisory firm Lazard to help address long-term debt. In December 2019, Community Health announced that subsidiaries of the company have completed the sale of three Virginia hospitals - Southside Regional Medical Center in Petersburg, Southampton Memorial Hospital in Franklin, and Southern Virginia Regional Medical Center in Emporia, effective on January 1, 2020. On April 27, 2020, Community Health Systems, Inc. (NYSE: CYH) announced that an affiliate of the Company has signed a definitive agreement to sell its majority ownership interest in 84‚Äëbed St. Cloud Regional Medical Center and its associated healthcare operations in St. Cloud, Florida, to a subsidiary of Orlando Health. Orlando Health currently holds minority ownership interest in St. Cloud and will purchase the remaining interest through this transaction.  Regional markets  In its annual Form 10-K filed in 2019, it identified Florida, Texas and Indiana as areas of geographic concentration. The company has owned many hospitals in the South, which did not expand Medicaid and consequently their hospitals may have to provide more uncompensated care.

The fires created by the debris from this explosion burnt down a large section of Northern Lagos, and created a panic that spread to other areas. As people fled the flames, many stumbled into a concealed canal and drowned. The explosion and its aftermath are believed to have killed at least 1,100 people and displaced over 20,000, with many thousands injured or homeless. The government of Nigeria launched an enquiry, which blamed the Nigerian Army for failing to properly maintain the base, or to decommission it when instructed to do so in 2001. Explosion Ikeja Cantonment was a large Nigerian Army living and storage area in the city of Lagos, situated north of the city centre near the districts of Isolo and Onigbongo. In January 2002, the base was being used to store a large quantity of \\"high calibre bombs\\", as well as other sundry explosives. On the afternoon of 27 January, a fire broke out in a street market being held next to the base, which was also home to the families of soldiers. At around 18:00 the fire apparently spread to the base's main munitions store, causing an enormous explosion. This blast killed many of the base staff and their families and immediately destroyed several nearby streets, flying debris starting numerous fires further afield. Tremors from the explosion also collapsed many buildings in the area, trapping people in the ruins and starting new fires from damaged cooking appliances. These tremors were so powerful that windows shattered 15 km away and the blast could be felt more than 50 km inland. Also thrown up by the blast were thousands of as yet unexploded military munitions, which fell in a rain of exploding shells, grenades and bullets casting further destruction across most of the northern section of the city. Thousands of people from Ikeja and neighbouring districts, seeing explosions and fires breaking out, fled their houses in an attempt to leave the affected areas. As the streets became more and more crowded, explosions amid the fleeing crowds from shells falling from the initial explosion created panic. A stampede developed as panicking people fled in all directions, trampling those who fell underfoot. Reports also describe people jumping from burning high-rise buildings and being killed in desperate attempts to cross the busy Ikeja dual carriageway. Effect In central Lagos there is a large canal, which runs from north to south parallel to the Isolo- Oshodi expressway through the centre of the city. It borders a banana plantation, which many refugees thought might be safe from the falling shells and spreading fires. However, the canal separated the plantation from the city and was covered by water hyacinth and thus invisible in the darkness. As the crowd surged towards the plantation, hundreds of panicking people fell into the water. Those on the bottom were crushed by yet more people falling into the waterway, and in the struggling confusion, at least 600 people were killed, many of them children. Many of these bodies drifted down the canal, some being found as far as ten kilometers from the explosion. The affected areas of the city burned through most of the night, with explosions continuing to boil out of the wrecked armoury until the afternoon of 28 January. The emergency services were woefully inadequate to deal with the devastation, as there were not enough fire crews or water points available to cope with the fire, which consequently consumed large parts of the city's northern suburbs. City hospitals were also utterly overwhelmed, many injured going for hours without any medical attention even if they did manage to reach an undamaged medical facility. The military, too, having suffered the loss of many of its Lagos-based personnel in the initial explosion, was not in a position to assume control of the city and did not appear in large numbers until late on 28 January. By the evening of 28 January, most of the fires were under control and people began returning to the city and attempting to find loved ones lost in the stampede. Many of the dead were children, separated from their families in the confusion and subsequently crushed in the crowds that filled the streets and canal. On top of the dead from the canal, several hundred people had died in the city itself: killed by falling munitions, trampled by the crowds, or trapped in the fires. Aftermath The final death toll is hard to compute, although the Red Cross claims that at least 1,000 bodies were recovered and a number of people were reported missing and never found. In addition to the dead, at least 5,000 people were injured in the disaster and over 12,000 left homeless, with entire districts of the city gutted. About 20,000 people had fled the city on the night of the explosion, and the survivors gradually returned over the course of the next week. The Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo arrived in Ikeja on 28 January along with most senior city and national politicians, and he publicly demanded answers from the military as to why such a huge ammunition dump was kept in such a poorly maintained and public location. It later emerged that a small explosion had occurred at the base the previous year, following which the army was advised by city officials to remove or modernise the armoury, but took no action. On the evening of 28 January, George Emdin, the commander of the Ikeja base who had not been present during the explosion, issued a statement: > \\"On behalf of the military, we are sorry, this is an old ammunition depot > with high-calibre bombs ... some efforts were being made in the recent past > to try to improve the storage facility, but this accident happened before > the high authorities could do what was needed\\" This statement provoked fury from the people of Lagos, who claimed that the military was making excuses for their mistakes and that nothing would be done to improve safety at other neglected ammunition dumps, many of which have not been properly maintained since Nigeria gained democracy in 1999 following twenty years of military rule. There were widespread fears in the immediate aftermath of the explosion that it signified the beginning of a military coup, although the government later released a statement ruling out this possibility. Numerous relief agencies, including the Red Cross and Red Crescent, provided aid to the thousands of homeless and lost people in the weeks following the disaster, attempting to reunite at least 2,000 separated or displaced families. People whose homes had survived were evacuated from Ikeja in order that military explosives experts could remove large quantities of unexploded munitions from the area. The evacuees and refugees were housed in temporary accommodation at the Ikeja Police College and the Abalti Barracks Yaba. The recovery process in Ikeja took some years as the rebuilding program was both lengthy and expensive, with many people suffering homelessness and poverty in this period due to the loss of their houses and livelihoods in the fire.

This episode is also known as \\"The Music Master\\" and \\"Music Master\\" and as \\"The Stolen Musicians\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Tim and Graeme are listening to a string quartet in an open-air classical music concert. Bill is also present at the concert, but he is listening to rock music on his radio. Suddenly, some men in dark-coloured suits force the string quartet members to leave the stage. Shocked and disbelieving at what they have just witnessed, the Goodies go home. Both Graeme and Tim are very disappointed. They had been enjoying listening to the classical music, and they check the newspaper for some live classical music elsewhere, but find that all the live music concerts have been replaced by jukebox music. Turning on the television to hear classical music, they find that Moira Anderson is missing -- and they are just in time to see Kenneth McKellar being dragged off stage. The live music television programmes are all being taken over by recorded music. The Goodies decide to investigate what is happening and form their own music group so that they would also be stolen. Bill 'tunes' their piano so that all the notes sound identical. When Graeme complains, Bill 'tunes' the keyboard so that the keyboard will play musical tunes when a person moves his hand up and down the keyboard (Graeme makes him change the keyboard back to normal). The Goodies try various types of music, and various musical instruments (including a piano accordion which stretches to \\"the point of no return\\"). Finally, with Bill playing the guitar, and Graeme programming his computer to play orchestral music, they decide to sing \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" -- Bill is the principal singer, and Graeme and Tim sing harmony -- with Tim receiving help with his harmony in the form of his \\"glee singers\\" (two very pretty girls). At the end of the song, they wait to be kidnapped, and are upset when only Tim's \\"glee singers\\" are stolen; the kidnappers reject them because they \\"ain't good enough.\\" The next step in their plan to be stolen has the Goodies giving a non-stop Woodstock Festival- type concert, in which they perform songs as various types of music groups. After a week of performances which nobody comes to watch, they are about to give up their plan as being hopeless, but unbeknown to them, the Goodies have also been stolen. They are driven to a house in the country, where they discover the identity of the mysterious being behind the kidnappings. Telling the Goodies that he is the Music Master, he explains the reason why the kidnappings occurred. The Goodies are not impressed and Graeme says: \\"You're a loony!\\", to which the Music Master replies proudly: \\"Thank you!\\" Horrified at what they have found, the Goodies plan to right the situation -- however, one of their decisions leads to unexpected and unforeseen consequences for themselves. The Goodies are now enslaved to the Music Master and Bill finally came up with a plan escape by playing the square dance rhythm and get all the musicians out but Rolf Harris and Cilla Black, Gerald and the mobsters chase after the trio as they playing the instruments to get a head start and defeating them, But the Music Master rides over hill with his cannon organs, eventually The Goodies call out the violinists to shoot violin bows as arrows on the defeated Music Master. All musicians shown The Goodies some gratitude and rewarding them girts but When Cilla got out of her prison she perish the trio with her high tone voice. Notes This episode has a sequel -- The Goodies' episode \\"For Those in Peril on the Sea\\" where the Music Master reappears (going by the name \\"Nasty Person\\").

It was one of the largest operations in World War II, involving almost 4,000,000 troops at a time stretched on a long front. During its four-month duration, the eastern bank of the Dnieper was recovered from German forces by five of the Red Army's fronts, which conducted several assault river crossings to establish several lodgements on the western bank. Subsequently, Kiev was liberated in the Battle of Kiev. 2,438 Red Army soldiers were awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union which was more than had been awarded previously since the award's establishment and never again were there so many laureates.  Strategic situation  Following the Battle of Kursk, the Wehrmachts Heer and supporting Luftwaffe forces in the southern Soviet Union were on the defensive in the southern Ukraine. By mid-August, Adolf Hitler understood that the forthcoming Soviet offensive could not be contained on the open steppe and ordered construction of a series of fortifications along the line of the Dnieper river. On the Soviet side, Joseph Stalin was determined to launch a major offensive in Ukraine. The main thrust of the offensive was in a southwesterly direction; the northern flank being largely stabilized, the southern flank rested on the Sea of Azov.  Planning  = Soviet planning = The operation began on 26 August 1943. Divisions started to move on a 1,400-kilometer front that stretched between Smolensk and the Sea of Azov. Overall, the operation would be executed by 36 Combined Arms, four Tank and five Air Armies. 2,650,000 personnel were brought into the ranks for this massive operation. The operation would use 51,000 guns and mortars, 2,400 tanks and 2,850 planes. The Dnieper is the third largest river in Europe, behind only the Volga and the Danube. In its lower part, its width can easily reach three kilometres, and being dammed in several places made it even larger. Moreover, its western shore--the one still to be retaken--was much higher and steeper than the eastern, complicating the offensive even further. In addition, the opposite shore was transformed into a vast complex of defenses and fortifications held by the Wehrmacht. Faced with such a situation, the Soviet commanders had two options. The first would be to give themselves time to regroup their forces, find a weak point or two to exploit (not necessarily in the lower part of the Dnieper), stage a breakthrough and encircle the German defenders far in the rear, rendering the defence line unsupplied and next to useless (very much like the German Panzers bypassed the Maginot line in 1940). This option was supported by Marshal Zhukov and Deputy Chief of Staff A. I. Antonov, who considered the substantial losses after the fierce battle of Kursk. The second option would be to stage a massive assault without waiting, and force the Dnieper on a broad front. This option left no additional time for the German defenders, but would lead to much larger casualties than would a successful deep operation breakthrough. This second option was backed by Stalin due to the concern that the German \\"scorched earth\\" policy might devastate this region if the Red Army did not advance fast enough. Stavka (the Soviet high command) chose the second option. Instead of deep penetration and encirclement, the Soviet intended to make full use of partisan activities to intervene and disrupt Germany's supply route so that the Germans could not effectively send reinforcements or take away Soviet industrial facilities in the region. Stavka also paid high attention to the possible scorched earth activities of German forces with a view to preventing them by a rapid advance. The assault was staged on a 300-kilometer front almost simultaneously. All available means of transport were to be used to transport the attackers to the opposite shore, including small fishing boats and improvised rafts of barrels and trees (like the one in the photograph). The preparation of the crossing equipment was further complicated by the German scorched earth strategy with the total destruction of all boats and raft building material in the area. The crucial issue would obviously be heavy equipment. Without it, the bridgeheads would not stand for long.

Fortifications were erected along the length of the Dnieper. However, there was no hope of completing such an extensive defensive line in the short time available. Therefore, the completion of the \\"Eastern Wall\\" was not uniform in its density and depth of fortifications. Instead, they were concentrated in areas where a Soviet assault-crossing were most likely to be attempted, such as near Kremenchuk, Zaporizhia and Nikopol. Additionally, on 7 September 1943, the SS forces and the Wehrmacht received orders to implement a scorched earth policy, by stripping the areas they had to abandon of anything that could be used by the Soviet war effort.

German opposition was ferocious and the fighting raged for every town and city. The Wehrmacht made extensive use of rear guards, leaving some troops in each city and on each hill, slowing the Soviet offensive. = Progress of the offensive = Soviet soldiers crossing the Dnieper on improvised rafts Three weeks after the start of the offensive, and despite heavy losses on the Soviet side, it became clear that the Germans could not hope to contain the Soviet offensive in the flat, open terrain of the steppes, where the Red Army's numerical strength would prevail. Manstein asked for as many as 12 new divisions in the hope of containing the Soviet offensive ‚Äì but German reserves were perilously thin. On 15 September 1943, Hitler ordered Army Group South to retreat to the Dnieper defence line. The battle for Poltava was especially bitter. The city was heavily fortified and its garrison well prepared. After a few inconclusive days that greatly slowed down the Soviet offensive, Marshal Konev decided to bypass the city and rush towards the Dnieper. After two days of violent urban warfare, the Poltava garrison was overcome. Towards the end of September 1943, Soviet forces reached the lower part of the Dnieper. = Dnieper airborne operation = Ivan Chernyakhovsky and other members of his military council on the eve of the Battle of the Dnieper, 1943 (The following is, largely, a synopsis of an account by GlantzThe History of Soviet Airborne Forces, Chapter 8, Across The Dnieper (September 1943), by David M. Glantz, Cass, 1994. (portions online) with support from an account by Staskov.1943 Dnepr airborne operation: lessons and conclusions Military Thought, July 2003, by Nikolai Viktorovich Staskov. (online) See ref at Army (Soviet Army) under 40th Army entry.) Stavka detached the Central Front's 3rd Tank Army to the Voronezh Front to race the weakening Germans to the Dnieper, to save the wheat crop from the German scorched earth policy, and to achieve strategic or operational river bridgeheads before a German defence could stabilize there. The 3rd Tank Army, plunging headlong, reached the river on the night of 21‚Äì22 September and, on the 23rd, Soviet infantry forces crossed by swimming and by using makeshift rafts to secure small, fragile bridgeheads, opposed only by 120 German Cherkassy flak academy NCO candidates and the hard-pressed 19th Panzer Division Reconnaissance Battalion. Those forces were the only Germans within 60 km of the Dnieper loop. Only a heavy German air attack and a lack of bridging equipment kept Soviet heavy weaponry from crossing and expanding the bridgehead. The Soviets, sensing a critical juncture, ordered a hasty airborne corps assault to increase the size of the bridgehead before the Germans could counterattack. On the 21st, the Voronezh Front's 1st, 3rd and 5th Guards Airborne Brigades got the urgent call to secure, on the 23rd, a bridgehead perimeter 15 to 20 km wide and 30 km deep on the Dnieper loop between Kaniv and Rzhishchev, while Front elements forced the river. The arrival of personnel at the airfields was slow, necessitating, on the 23rd, a one-day delay and omission of 1st Brigade from the plan; consequent mission changes caused near chaos in command channels. Mission change orders finally got down to company commanders, on the 24th, just 15 minutes before their units, not yet provisioned with spades, anti-tank mines, or ponchos for the autumn night frosts, assembled on airfields. Owing to the weather, not all assigned aircraft had arrived at airfields on time (if at all). Further, most flight safety officers disallowed maximum loading of their aircraft. Given fewer aircraft (and lower than expected capacities), the master loading plan, ruined, was abandoned. Many radios and supplies got left behind. In the best case, it would take three lifts to deliver the two brigades. Units (still arriving by the over-taxed rail system), were loaded piecemeal onto returned aircraft, which were slow to refuel owing to the less-than-expected capacities of fuel trucks. Meanwhile, already-arrived troops changed planes, seeking earlier flights. Urgency and the fuel shortage prevented aerial assembly aloft. Most aircraft, as soon as they were loaded and fueled, flew in single file, instead of line abreast, to the dropping points. Assault waves became as intermingled as the units they carried. As corps elements made their flights, troops (half of whom had never jumped, except from training towers) were briefed on drop zones, assembly areas and objectives only poorly understood by platoon commanders still studying new orders. Meanwhile, Soviet aerial photography, suspended for several days by bad weather, had missed the strong reinforcement of the area, early that afternoon. Non-combat cargo pilots ferrying 3rd Brigade through drizzle expected no resistance beyond river pickets but, instead, were met by anti-aircraft fire and starshells from the 19th Panzer Division (only coincidentally transiting the drop zone, and just one of six divisions and other formations ordered, on the 21st, to fill the gap in front of the 3rd Tank Army). Lead aircraft, disgorging paratroopers over Dubari at 1930, came under fire from elements of the 73rd Panzer Grenadier Regiment and division staff of 19th Panzer Division. Some paratroops began returning fire and throwing grenades even before landing; trailing aircraft accelerated, climbed and evaded, dropping wide. Through the night, some pilots avoided starshell-lit drop points entirely, and 13 aircraft returned to airfields without having dropped at all. Intending a 10 by 14 km drop over largely undefended terrain, the Soviets instead achieved a 30 by 90 km drop over the fastest mobile elements of two German corps. On the ground, the Germans used white parachutes as beacons to hunt down and kill disorganized groups and to gather and destroy airdropped supplies. Supply bonfires, glowing embers, and multi-color starshells illuminated the battlefield. Captured documents gave the Germans enough knowledge of Soviet objectives to arrive at most of them before the disorganized paratroops. Back at the Soviet airfields, the fuel shortage allowed only 298 of 500 planned sorties, leaving corps anti-tank guns and 2,017 paratroops undelivered. Of 4,575 men dropped (seventy percent of the planned number, and just 1,525 from 5th Brigade), some 2,300 eventually assembled into 43 ad hoc groups, with missions abandoned as hopeless, and spent most of their time seeking supplies not yet destroyed by the Germans. Others joined with the nine partisan groups operating in the area. About 230 made it over (or out of) the Dnieper to Front units (or were originally dropped there). Most of the rest were almost casually captured that first night or killed the next day (although, on that first night, the 3rd Co, 73rd Panzer Grenadier Regiment, suffered heavy losses while annihilating about 150 paratroopers near Grushevo, some 3 km west of Dubari). The Germans underestimated that 1,500 to 2,000 had dropped; they recorded 901 paratroops captured and killed in the first 24 hours. Thereafter, they largely ignored the Soviet paratroopers, to counterattack and truncate the Dnieper bridgeheads. The Germans deemed their anti-paratrooper operations completed by the 26th, although a modicum of opportunistic actions against garrisons, rail lines, and columns were conducted by remnants up to early November. For a lack of manpower to clear all areas, forests of the region would remain a minor threat. The Germans called the operation a fundamentally sound idea ruined by the dilettantism of planners lacking expert knowledge (but praised individual paratroops for their tenacity, bayonet skills and deft use of broken ground in the sparsely wooded northern region). Stavka deemed this second (and, ultimately, last) corps drop a complete failure; lessons they knew they had already learned from their winter offensive corps drop at Viazma had not stuck. They would never trust themselves to try it again. Soviet 5th Guards Airborne Brigade commander Sidorchuk, withdrawing to the forests south, eventually amassed a brigade-size command, half paratroops, half partisans; he obtained air supply, and assisted the 2nd Ukrainian Front over the Dnieper near Cherkassy to finally link up with Front forces on 15 November. After 13 more days combat, the airborne element was evacuated, ending a harrowing two months. More than sixty percent never returned. = Assault-crossing the Dnieper = Soviet soldiers preparing rafts to cross the Dnieper (the sign reads \\"Onwards to Kiev!\\") The first bridgehead on the Dnieper's western shore was established on 22 September 1943 at the confluence of the Dnieper and Pripyat rivers, in the northern part of the front. On 24 September, another bridgehead was created near Dniprodzerzhynsk, another on 25 September near Dnipropetrovsk and yet another on 28 September near Kremenchuk. By the end of the month, 23 bridgeheads were created on the western side, some of them 10 kilometers wide and 1-2 kilometres deep. The crossing of the Dnieper was extremely difficult. Soldiers used every available floating device to cross the river, under heavy German fire and taking heavy losses. Once across, Soviet troops had to dig themselves into the clay ravines composing the Dnieper's western bank. = Securing the lodgements = Soviet soldiers attacking on a lodgement in October 1943 German troops soon launched heavy counterattacks on almost every bridgehead, hoping to annihilate them before heavy equipment could be transported across the river. For instance, the Borodaevsk lodgement, mentioned by Marshal Konev in his memoirs, came under heavy armored attack and air assault. Bombers attacked both the lodgement and the reinforcements crossing the river. Konev complained at once about a lack of organization of Soviet air support, set up air patrols to prevent bombers from approaching the lodgements and ordered forward more artillery to counter tank attacks from the opposite shore. When Soviet aviation became more organized and hundreds of guns and Katyusha rocket launchers began firing, the situation started to improve and the bridgehead was eventually preserved. Such battles were commonplace on every lodgement. Although all the lodgements were held, losses were terrible ‚Äì at the beginning of October, most divisions were at only 25 to 50% of their nominal strength. = Lower Dnieper Offensive = By mid-October, the forces accumulated on the lower Dnieper bridgeheads were strong enough to stage a first massive attack to definitely secure the river's western shore in the southern part of the front. Therefore, a vigorous attack was staged on the Kremenchuk-Dnipropetrovsk line. Simultaneously, a major diversion was conducted in the south to draw German forces away both from the Lower Dnieper and from Kiev. At the end of the offensive, Soviet forces controlled a bridgehead 300 kilometers wide and up to 80 kilometers deep in some places. In the south, the Crimea was now cut off from the rest of the German forces. Any hope of stopping the Red Army on the Dnieper's east bank was lost.  Outcomes  The Battle of the Dnieper was another defeat for a Wehrmacht that required it to restabilize the front further West. The Red Army, which Hitler hoped to contain at the Dnieper, forced the Wehrmachts defences. Kiev was recaptured and German troops lacked the forces to annihilate Soviet troops on the Lower Dnieper bridgeheads. The west bank was still in German hands for the most part, but both sides knew that it would not last for long. Additionally, the Battle of the Dnieper demonstrated the strength of the Soviet partisan movement. The \\"rail war\\" operation staged during September and October 1943 struck German logistics very hard, creating heavy supply issues. Incidentally, between 28 November and 1 December 1943 the Teheran conference was held between Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Stalin. The Battle of the Dnieper, along with other major offensives staged in 1943, certainly gave Stalin a dominant position for negotiating with his Allies. The Soviet success during this battle created the conditions for the follow-up Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive on the right-bank Ukraine, which was launched on 24 December 1943 from a bridgehead west of Kiev that was secured during this battle.–ì—Ä—ã–ª–µ–≤ –ê.–ù. –î–Ω–µ–ø—Ä-–ö–∞—Ä–ø–∞—Ç—ã-–ö—Ä—ã–º. –û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ–±–µ—Ä–µ–∂–Ω–æ–π –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã –∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º–∞ –≤ 1944 –≥–æ–¥—É. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1970, p. 19.

In it, he talks about his childhood days in a small town called Boniato on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba. The book itself, based on a family emergency, became also an analysis of Cuba's present condition as viewed by Reyes himself. Reyes's method of choosing to write his Cuban memoirs displayed some writing skills for which he has been noted, mainly: # The ability to utilize a wide array of genres in unexpected but highly effective visual ways; # The ability to write biographical themes, such as his Cuban memoirs, which many writers reserve for fictional accounts, such as: stream of consciousness, poetry, and even short- stories in order to explain non-fictional accounts of events. In 2003, Reyes surprised his readership by publishing, among other things, a book of poems titled, My Words Mean Something. Poetry, however, is the genre Reyes returned to with the publication of \\"Day's Night,\\" published in 2014.

The D.H.A. requires significant coursework beyond the masters level and often requires a dissertation or capstone project that contributes to knowledge or practice.  Description  The Doctor of Health Administration is a research degree, and is equivalent to the PhD in Health Administration. The only difference being that the DHA allows for either an applied application approach or a theoretical approach.  History  The Doctor of Health Administration was first introduced in the U.S. in the late 1990s at the Medical University of South Carolina as an advanced professional doctorate in health leadership. Prior to this the only D.H.A. degrees awarded were in Canada and Europe. The American version of this doctoral degree focuses on advanced professional knowledge and applied research in health administration, policy, and leadership. New programs have been instituted at other universities providing substantial amounts of online coursework. Most D.H.A. students are working health professionals who seek doctoral education. Admission to the three year degree typically requires two years of coursework beyond the Masters Degree (i.e. M.H.A., M.P.A., M.S.A., or M.P.H.) and an applied or theoretical dissertation to be completed in the third year.  Program structure  Most D.H.A. programs require about 70 credit hours beyond the master's degree. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3‚Äì5 years of full-time graduate study or 7‚Äì10 years of sustained part-time graduate study.  Purpose  The Doctor of Health Administration program prepares health professionals to become innovative leaders and problem solvers within the healthcare industry. By blending the theoretical with the practical, the coursework of this advanced doctorate of health administration degree program provides students with the holistic knowledge needed to transition into careers that improve and influence healthcare administration systems.

Explaining the pillars  # Self-determination is the concept that, in the words of United States president Woodrow Wilson, No people must be forced under a sovereignty under which it does not wish to live. Transnistria argues that since the majority of today's countries were founded on the principle of self-determination, they too have this moral right. # Transnistria's separate history from Moldova refers to the fact that Transnistria has no historical ties with Moldova and that it was never at any time in its history part of an independent Moldovan state. Traditionally, the Dniester river formed an international border between the two. Transnistria therefore argues that Moldova's claim to Transnistria is not supported by history. # Actual distinctiveness demonstrates that Transnistria has few things in common with Moldova. The majority (61.2% as of 2005\\"–°–û–ö–†–ê–©–ï–ù–ò–ï –ù–ê–°–ï–õ–ï–ù–ò–Ø –ü–†–ò–î–ù–ï–°–¢–†–û–í–¨–Ø\\" ) in Transnistria are Slavs who speak Russian and Ukrainian in contrast to Moldova where most of the population are ethnic Moldovans and speak Moldovan. The two also differ in alphabets, religions, economies, etc. # Reversal of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is the legal argument that the only tie between Moldova and Transnistria was the forced 1940-annexation by the USSR after the outbreak of World War II, but that this annexation was declared null and void by Moldova itself with its 1990 reversal of the legal effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This, argues Transnistria, also voids any claim to territory obtained as a result of the pact as the result of the legal principle of status quo ante bellum.

His current career includes theatre production in London and Australia.  Early life  Walsh completed his education at Xavier College in Melbourne, before studying Pharmacy and Arts at Melbourne University where he was heavily involved in student theatre revues. Radio career  Prior to starring on television Walsh was a disc jockey, on 1260 3SR Shepparton and 3XY Melbourne,http://www.mikewalsh.com.au/bio.htm and a \\"Good Guy\\" on Sydney commercial radio station 2SM. Television career He was the host of The Mike Walsh Show from 1973 until 1985. The enormously popular program won 24 Logies and Walsh the Gold Logie. The program is also renowned for introducing fellow Gold Logie winning personality Jeanne Little in 1974. The Mike Walsh Show became so popular in the midday time slot that eventually it seemed a good idea to move it to a night time format to try to reinvigorate night time variety. The idea was to keep the midday show going but with a new host, and transfer the popularity of the Mike Walsh Show to the night time slot. There was much speculation about who the host of the new midday show would be and it became the ‚Äòwater cooler‚Äô conversation around Australia. The day came when Mike Walsh would announce who the new midday host would be. On his midday show Mike said ‚Äúthere was only one choice for the new host and frankly if he had said no, we wouldn‚Äôt have gone to night time. The host of the midday show for next year will be‚Ä¶.Ray Martin.‚Äù The announcement was greeted with rapturous applause and cheering. Ray Martin was already a very popular 60 Minutes reporter. The Midday Show with Ray Martin ran for 13 years. The nighttime show with Mike Walsh was a failure and was cancelled after a few weeks. He returned to television for a 12-week stint chat and music show on the ABC in 1987. He has the distinction of being the entertainer to win a Gold Logie and Sammy award in the same year. He has 24 Logies, seven Sammys in total. Theatre production He was the Executive Producer of two highly successful musical Nunsense and Anything Goes in Australia. From 2006 Walsh has spent time in Sydney and London producing theatre shows across Australia and on London's West End. This included: * Nunsense (late 1987 to early 1989) toured extensively in Australia * Anything Goes in 1989 * Exit the King (opened March 2009) at Ethel Barrymore Theatre, Broadway * Holding the Man (opened May 2010) at the Trafalgar Studios 1, London * Umbrellas of Cherbourg (opened March 2011) at the Gielgud Theatre, West End * A Chorus Line (opened February 2013) at the London Palladium Theatre In 1977 he purchased Richmond's Regent Theatre, in 1982 built a twin cinema complex in Penrith then purchased two other cinemas and the Avalon. He has been the owner of Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne since 2000, and funded and oversaw its restoration. Walsh also owns the Hayden Orpheum Picture Palace, (purchased 1986) a 1935 art deco six-cinema complex in Cremorne, Sydney which he restored at a cost of $2.5 million, and which features a 1925 Wurlitzer orchestral pipe organ. Mike Walsh Fellowships program From 1996 he has financed the Mike Walsh Fellowships for young performers to hone their skills overseas and in Australia. From 2006 onwards he has provided a $50,000 (originally $30,000) each year for the fellowships. By 2015 this has added up to over $700,000 to more than 90 Fellows. Honours  Walsh was honoured in 1980 with an award of the Order of the British Empire and, in 2016, was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the entertainment industry, and to the performing arts through support for young actors, theatre restoration and production.

Pemphigus was derived from the Greek word pemphix, meaning blister. It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies are formed against desmosomes, components of the skin that function to keep certain layers of skin bound to each other. As desmosomes are attacked, the layers of skin separate and the clinical picture resembles a blister. These blisters are due to acantholysis, or breaking apart of intercellular connections through an autoantibody-mediated response. Over time the condition inevitably progresses without treatment: lesions increase in size and distribution throughout the body, behaving physiologically like a severe burn. Before the advent of modern treatments, mortality for the disease was close to 90%. Today, the mortality rate with treatment is between 5-15% due to the introduction of corticosteroids as primary treatment. Nevertheless, in 1998, pemphigus vulgaris was the fourth most common cause of death due to a skin disorder. The disease mainly affects middle-aged and older adults between 50‚Äì60 years old. There has historically been a higher incidence in women. Signs and symptoms Pemphigus vulgaris Pemphigus vulgaris most commonly presents with oral blisters (buccal and palatine mucosa, especially), but also includes cutaneous blisters. Other mucosal surfaces, the conjunctiva, nose, esophagus, penis, vulva, vagina, cervix, and anus, may also be affected. Flaccid blisters over the skin are frequently seen with sparing of the skin covering the palms and soles. Blisters commonly erode and leave ulcerated lesions and erosions. A positive Nikolsky sign (induction of blistering in normal skin or at the edge of a blister) is indicative of the disease. Severe pain with chewing can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. Pathophysiology Pemphigus is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies directed against both desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 present in desmosomes. Loss of desmosomes results in loss of cohesion between keratinocytes in the epidermis, and a disruption of the barrier function served by intact skin. The process is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction (in which antibodies bind to antigens on the body's own tissues). On histology, the basal keratinocytes are usually still attached to the basement membrane leading to a characteristic appearance called \\"tombstoning\\". Transudative fluid accumulates in between the keratinocytes and the basal layer (suprabasal split), forming a blister and resulting in what is known as a positive Nikolsky's sign. This is a contrasting feature from bullous pemphigoid, which is thought to be due to anti-hemidesmosome antibodies, and where the detachment occurs between the epidermis and dermis (subepidermal bullae). Clinically, pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by extensive flaccid blisters and mucocutaneous erosions. The severity of the disease, as well as the mucosal lesions, is believed to be directly proportional to the levels of desmoglein 3. Milder forms of pemphigus (like foliacious and erythematoses) are more anti-desmoglein 1 heavy. The disease arises most often in middle-aged or older people, usually starting with a blister that ruptures easily. It can also start with blisters in the mouth. The lesions can become quite extensive. Diagnosis Because it is a rare disease, diagnosis is often complicated and takes a long time. Early in the disease patients may have erosions in the mouth or blisters on the skin. These blisters can be itchy or painful. Theoretically, the blisters should demonstrate a positive Nikolsky's sign, in which the skin sloughs off from slight rubbing, but this is not always reliable. The gold standard for diagnosis is a punch biopsy from the area around the lesion that is examined by direct immunofluorescent staining, in which cells are acantholytic, that is, lacking the normal intercellular connections that hold them together. These can also be seen on a Tzanck smear. These cells are basically rounded, nucleated keratinocytes formed due to antibody mediated damage to cell adhesion protein desmoglein. Pemphigus vulgaris is easily confused with impetigo and candidiasis. IgG4 is considered pathogenic. The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for the infections that cause these other conditions, and by a lack of response to antibiotic treatment.  Treatment  Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications have historically been employed to reduce pemphigus symptoms, yet steroids are associated with serious and long-lasting side effects and their use should be limited as much as possible. Intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have also been used with varying degrees of success. An established alternative to steroids are monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, which are increasingly being used as first-line treatment. In summer 2018, the FDA granted full approval to rituximab for this application, following successful fast track evaluation. In numerous case series, many patients achieve remission after one cycle of rituximab. Treatment is more successful if initiated early on in the course of disease, perhaps even at diagnosis. Rituximab treatment combined with monthly IV immunoglobulin infusions has resulted in long-term remission with no recurrence of disease in 10 years after treatment was halted. This was a small trial study of 11 patients with 10 patients followed to completion.  Epidemiology  Pemphigus vulgaris is a relatively rare disease that only affects about 1 to 5 people in 1 million in the United Kingdom, with an incidence of 1-10 cases per 1 million people across the world. There is an estimated prevalence of 30,000-40,000 cases in the United States. Cases of P. vulgaris usually don't develop until after the age of 50 or so. The disease is not contagious which means it cannot be spread from person to person. There is currently no way of knowing who will be affected with P. vulgaris in their life as it is usually not a genetic disorder and is usually triggered later in life by environmental factors. Men and women are both equally affected and the disease has been found to affect people of many different cultures and racial backgrounds, especially Ashkenazi Jews, people of Mediterranean, North Indian and Persian descent. There has been no found difference in the rate of disease when looking at socioeconomic factors as well. If left untreated, 8 of 10 people with the disease die within a year with a cause of death being infection or loss of fluids, which is very common for raw, open sores that are characteristic of P. vulgaris. With treatment, only about 1 in 10 people with the disease die, either from the condition, or side effects of the medicine. An effect of the disease being so rare is that there is not enough evidence to prove that the treatments currently being used are actually as effective as they could be. Doctors are trying to find effective steroid-sparing agents to use in the treatment, to decrease the side effects of long term steroid treatment. The small amount of case numbers make it hard to test statistical significance between the affected and the control groups when testing if these types of systematic treatments are effective. Research Research into using genetically modified T-cells to treat pemphigus vulgaris in mice was reported in 2016. Rituximab indiscriminately attacks all B cells, which reduces the body's ability to control infections. In the experimental treatment, human T cells are genetically engineered to recognize only those B cells that produce antibodies to desmoglein. In PV, autoreactive B cells produce antibodies against Dsg3, disrupting its adhesive function and causing skin blistering. By expressing Dsg3 on their surfaces, the CAAR-T cells lure those B cells in and kill them. The Dsg 3 CAAR-T cells eliminated Dsg3-specific B cells in lab dishes and in mice, the researchers reported at the time. Penn's Aimee Payne, M.D., Ph.D., and Michael Milone, M.D., Ph.D., a co-inventor of Novartis‚Äô CAR-T cancer therapy Kymriah, pioneered the CAAR-T idea and have founded biotech Cabaletta Bio, hoping to bring their therapies through clinical studies to the market. The MuSK-CAAR-T is the second candidate in its pipeline; the company has already received FDA clearance to test its lead project, DSG3-CAAR-T, in patients with mucosal pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and a phase 1 trial is expected to start in 2020.

Life  Vejvanovsky was born in Moravia (Hukvaldy or Hluƒç√≠n) in either 1633 or 1639. He received an education at the Jesuit university in Opava, where he also began composing. Moravia had been devastated during the Thirty Years War and much of it was in desperate need of rebuilding. The Habsburg authorities appointed the influential and ambitious Karl Liechtenstein-Castelcorno as Prince-Bishop of Olomouc who set about to rebuild much of the region. This included building himself a grand palace in Italian Renaissance style with elaborate gardens in the nearby town of Kromeriz and employing a large group of musicians drawn from throughout Europe to play at his court and churches. In the 1650s the job of running and directing this prestigious ensemble fell to Vejvanovsky, who was regularly singled out for praise by the Bishop. As a composer his output is uneven, but in his later works he was able to master most typical idioms of the day. He seems to have struggled with imitative counterpoint and his most compelling pieces are characterised by charming folk idioms and virtuosic brass writing. He composed in a wide variety of genres ranging from large- scale Mass settings and music for special feast days to more intimate sonatas and suites. In addition to his musical responsibilities, he also maintained the Bishop's music library and was the primary copyist of the collection, with his hand appearing in hundreds of manuscripts. His own compositions circulated throughout central Europe, appearing in other Czech collections as well as in Germany and Austria. He seems to have made at least one visit to Austria with the purpose of copying and collecting music and it is largely thanks to Vejvanovsky that so much central-European music from the time is preserved in what is widely regarded as one of the most important collections of late seventeenth century music on the Continent. Vejvanovsky must have been one of the greatest trumpet virtuosos of the age and his numerous compositions attest to his virtuosity. One of his more remarkable talents was the ability to play certain chromatic passages on the trumpet, which is not normally possible on the largely diatonic natural trumpet. Under Vejvanovsky's direction the Bishop's ensemble saw its heyday. Other musicians at court included Philipp Jakob Rittler, Heinrich Biber, and Gottfried Finger, the latter two employing certain characteristics of Vejvanovsky's trumpet writing in their own compositions. He was a contemporary and associate of Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber.

In one he is having sex with Dr. Melfi in her office. In another, a dead fish on a slab speaks to him with Pussy's voice and says he is working for the government and Tony knows it; that is why he passed him over for promotion. As soon as he can, Tony goes with Silvio to Pussy's home. Pretending he is still sick, Tony rushes to the toilet; while the rest are downstairs he searches the bedroom and finds Pussy's wire. Tony says he wants Pussy to see a boat he is thinking of buying, and the three of them drive to it. Paulie is already there. In the cabin Tony asks Pussy when he flipped. After hesitating, he says it was eighteen months ago, less, and he only supplied disinformation; but he admits that he has told them about the crew's current money-earning scam, to do with telephone calling cards. He asks for a drink and Tony permits it; he tells a smutty story and the guys laugh. He goes to the other end of the cabin and while he is asking if he can sit down Tony, then Silvio and Paulie, shoot him dead. Paulie removes his identifying jewelry, and together they bind his bagged body in chains and weights, throw him off the back of the boat, and watch him sink into the ocean. Meadow graduates from high school. At the ceremony, Tony tells Christopher that he is putting him up to become a made man. He also meets Davey whose wife is divorcing him; he is going to work \\"on a ranch out west\\" where there are flights to Las Vegas; his son, who was accepted by Georgetown University, is going to State College instead because of \\"a money pinch\\". Shortly after Janice's departure, Tony and his younger sister Barbara arrive at Livia's home to discuss her permanent living arrangements. Barbara's husband won't allow her to live with them; the retirement home will not have her back. Angrily, Tony gives her two airline tickets with which she and her sister can fly first-class to Tucson, where another sister is living. But the tickets were obtained through the bust-out of Davey's store, and Livia is detained at Newark Airport for possessing stolen airline tickets. FBI agents arrive at Tony's home with a search warrant and he is led away handcuffed in front of Meadow and some of her friends. Her graduation ceremony and party are the next day, but he is released in time for both.

The river's headwaters are in the Palomar Mountain Range and Cleveland National Forest, near Palomar Mountain and the Santa Rosa Mountains. The river mouth, on the Pacific Ocean, is in northern Oceanside. The San Luis Rey River bike path runs along it for its last . The river is over longU.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 16, 2011 and drains . There is little water in the river during most of the year, but it can have very large flows during winter storms. Course The San Luis Rey River rises in two main branches. The mainstem starts east of Rocky Mountain in the Cleveland National Forest and flows generally south-southwest. The West Fork's headwaters rise as a pair of tiny streams, Fry Creek and Iron Springs Creek, just to the north of Palomar Mountain. These two streams combine into the West Fork, which flows southeast through the Mendenhall Valley. The West Fork joins the main stem at Lake Henshaw, a reservoir formed by a dam across the main stem San Luis Rey River. From the base of Henshaw Dam, the river winds west along the foot of the Palomars, followed by California State Route 76. It then bends southwest into a gorge. It leaves the canyon at the wide and spacious Pauma Valley, where it becomes a wash surrounded on both sides by agricultural fields. Potrero and Pauma Creeks enter from the right, then Frey Creek and Agua Tibia Creek as the river travels northwest. The river turns west, passing Pala, flowing through a patchwork of privately owned, government-owned and Native American lands. It then crosses under Interstate 15 and exits the foothills of the mountains near Bonsall. After passing Bonsall the river flows generally southwest, through the city of Oceanside. Although usually dry up to this point the river starts to contain water as it nears the mouth, both from seeps and from tidal activity that forms a lagoon at the mouth of the river. The San Luis Rey empties into the Pacific north of Oceanside, about south of the Santa Margarita River and about north of San Diego. Water resources The dam that forms Lake Henshaw is the only one directly on the river itself. However, tributaries in the river's watershed are extensively dammed. The San Luis Rey River has natural river banks, except for the last where it flows through a earthen channel with levees to prevent stormwater from flooding Oceanside. Urbanization, mining, and agriculture have caused substantial deterioration of water quality in the drainage basin. Since Lake Henshaw is relatively close to the headwaters, it is a source of drinking water. However, the water in the lower reaches of the river is used for groundwater recharge only. A bridge was completed across the river near its mouth in 2009, replacing a small causeway that washed away in storms. History The river was within the homeland of the Luise√±o people, or Pay√≥mkawichum meaning \\"People of the West\\" in the Luise√±o language, for many centuries before Spanish immigrants occupied their ancestral lands. They are a southern tribe of the indigenous peoples of California. The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√† expedition, stopped at the river not far from the coast for two nights on its way north, July 18‚Äì19, 1769. On the return journey to the new pueblo of San Diego, the party again camped near the river on January 22, 1770. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \\"...we descended to a large and beautiful valley, so green that it seemed to us that it had been planted. We crossed it straight to the north and pitched camp near a large pool of water, one of several in the plain. At the extremities or ends of the plain there are two large villages.\\" Mission San Luis Rey de Francia (The Mission of Saint Louis King of France) was founded east of the river in 1798 by padre Ferm√≠n Lasu√©n, becoming the 18th of the 21 Spanish Missions of California. The river took its current name from part of the mission's name. In popular culture The 2010 Rockstar Games release \\"Red Dead Redemption\\" features a river inspired by the San Luis Rey. The \\"San Luis River\\" serves as the border between the Western Border States and Mexico and is one of the hallmarks of the game.

It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Chlo√´ Sevigny, Samantha Mathis, Cara Seymour, Justin Theroux, Guinevere Turner, Reg E. Cathey and Reese Witherspoon. Producer Edward R. Pressman purchased the film rights to the novel in 1992. After discussions with David Cronenberg fell through, Harron was brought on to direct and cast Bale in the lead role. Lionsgate acquired worldwide distribution in 1997 and temporarily replaced Harron and Bale with Oliver Stone as director and Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Patrick Bateman. DiCaprio left in favor of The Beach and Harron and Bale were brought back. American Psycho debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2000, and was released theatrically on April 14, 2000. The film was a financial success and received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for both Bale's performance and the screenplay. It has since developed a cult following. Plot In 1987, wealthy New York investment banker Patrick Bateman‚Äôs life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fianc√©e Evelyn and his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he hates. Bateman describes the material accoutrements of his lifestyle, including his morning exercise, beautification routine, designer wardrobe and expensive furniture. He also discusses his music collection in scholarly detail. Bateman and his associates flaunt their business cards in a display of vanity. Enraged by the superiority of his co- worker Paul Allen's card, Bateman murders a homeless man and his dog. At a Christmas party, Bateman makes plans to have dinner with Allen, who mistakes Bateman for another coworker. Bateman gets Allen drunk and lures him back to his apartment. While playing \\"Hip to Be Square\\", Bateman delivers a monologue to Allen about the artistic merits of the song, then murders Allen with a mirror-polished axe. He disposes of the body, then stages Allen's apartment so that others believe Allen has gone to London. Bateman is later interviewed about Allen's disappearance by private detective Donald Kimball. Bateman takes two prostitutes, who he names Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment and expounds on his opinions of the band Genesis. After they have sex, Bateman brings out instruments he uses for bodily harm. They later leave his apartment evidently bloodied and mistreated. Bateman's colleague Luis Carruthers reveals a new business card. Bateman tries to kill Luis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant, but Luis mistakes the attempt for a sexual advance and declares his love for Bateman, who flees in disgust. After murdering a model, Bateman invites his secretary Jean to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks. When Jean arrives, unbeknownst to her, Bateman holds a nail gun to the back of her head while they chat. When he receives a message from Evelyn on his answering machine, he asks Jean to leave. Kimball meets Bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion in Allen's disappearance. Detective Kimball interviews Bateman again, and while Kimball remains suspicious of Bateman, he reveals that a colleague of Bateman‚Äôs spotted Paul Allen in London, calling into question the entire investigation. Bateman is relieved by the news but is perturbed and begins to doubt himself. Bateman invites Christie and his acquaintance Elizabeth to Allen's apartment for sex, and kills Elizabeth during the act. Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. A naked Bateman chases her and drops a chainsaw on her as she flees down a staircase, killing her. Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn. That night, as he uses an ATM, he sees a cat, and the ATM displays the text \\"feed me a stray cat\\". When he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman confronts him, so he shoots her. A police chase ensues but Bateman kills all four cops. Fleeing to his office, Bateman enters the wrong building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. In an office he believes is his, Bateman calls his lawyer Harold Carnes and frantically leaves a confession regarding the many murders on Carnes' answering machine. The following morning, Bateman visits Allen's apartment, expecting to clean up Allen's remains, but it is vacant and for sale. He pretends to be a potential buyer but the realtor tricks Bateman into revealing that he is not there to buy the apartment. She then cryptically tells him that the apartment does not belong to Paul Allen, before ordering him to leave. While Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues for lunch, a horrified Jean finds detailed drawings of murder and mutilation in Bateman's office journal. Bateman sees Carnes at the restaurant and mentions the phone message he left the prior evening. Carnes mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone confession as a joke. Bateman desperately explains who he is and again confesses the murders, but Carnes rebukes it as impossible, as he recently had dinner with Allen in London. A confused and exhausted Bateman returns to his friends, where they briefly muse on whether Ronald Reagan is a harmless old man or a hidden psychopath, before discussing their dinner reservations yet again. Left with the possibility that no one knows he is a murderer, or that he simply hallucinated the various killings, Bateman's voiceover narration reveals his realization that he will escape the punishment he feels he deserves, and that there has been no catharsis: \\"This confession has meant nothing.\\" Cast Production Producer Edward R. Pressman bought the film rights to Bret Easton Ellis's novel American Psycho in 1992, with Johnny Depp expressing an interest in the lead role. After discussions with Stuart Gordon to direct fell through, David Cronenberg became attached and brought Ellis to adapt the novel into a screenplay. The process was difficult for Ellis, due to Cronenberg's scene constraints and not wanting to use any of Ellis's restaurant or nightclub material from the novel. The script ended with an elaborate musical sequence to Barry Manilow's \\"Daybreak\\" atop the World Trade Center. \\"I'm glad it wasn't shot, but that kind of shows you where I was when I was writing the script,\\" Ellis reflected. \\"I was bored with the material.\\" Cronenberg was still listed as being attached to direct in March 1994, but with a new script by Norman Snider. Pressman appeared at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival to pre-sell distribution rights, but to no avail. Mary Harron replaced Cronenberg as director while writing a new script with Guinevere Turner; their approach to the material and Bateman's character was influenced by Mario Bava's giallo film Hatchet for the Honeymoon, with Bava historian Tim Lucas noting that both films depict their respective protagonists as being motivated by a desire for self-discovery in their killings. Harron cast Christian Bale in a deal on good faith, and attached Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto in supporting roles. Development was looking to move forward following six years of rejection by Hollywood studios when independent Canadian distributor Lionsgate Films acquired worldwide distribution in April 1997. After having waited for a year, Bale and Harron were aiming to begin filming in August 1998 on a $6‚Äì10 million budget, but Lionsgate instead pursued Edward Norton and Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role, arguing Bale was not famous enough. Lionsgate was still hoping to finalize a deal with Harron, while Bale's handshake deal without a pay or play contract was let go. Harron refused to meet with DiCaprio, displeased as she specifically chose Bale and believed DiCaprio's screen presence would have been too boyish for Patrick Bateman. She also believed the actor's reputation as a teen idol following Romeo + Juliet and Titanic would distract from American Psychos production and tone. Lionsgate was planning to increase the production budget to $40 million in the hopes of securing DiCaprio's $21 million asking price. At the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, a press release was issued that DiCaprio had taken the offer, which was quickly rebutted by DiCaprio's manager, Rick Yorn, who claimed the actor had simply expressed interest in the part. Yorn also wanted to make clear that DiCaprio had no knowledge of the development history under Harron and Bale. DiCaprio drafted a shortlist of replacement directors, including Oliver Stone, Danny Boyle, and Martin Scorsese. Working from a new script written by Matthew Markwalder, Stone was brought aboard, whom Harron called \\"probably the single worst single person to do it\\". The director wanted to eliminate the satire from Harron's script, emphasizing the psychological character traits of Patrick Bateman. However, Stone could not agree on the film's direction with DiCaprio, who decided to star in The Beach instead. Bale remained committed, turning down other movie roles and auditions for nine months, confident DiCaprio would depart. Lionsgate made an offer to Ewan McGregor, who turned it down after Bale personally urged him to do so. Harron and Bale were eventually brought back under the agreement that the budget would not exceed $10 million. Bale spent several months working out by himself, and then three hours a day with a trainer during pre-production, to achieve the proper physique for the narcissistic Bateman. Harron claimed Bale struggled with the role until he noticed Tom Cruise in an interview on Late Night with David Letterman, being struck by Cruise's energy and \\"intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes\\". Bale also used Nicolas Cage's performance in Vampire's Kiss as inspiration for this role. Filming began in March 1999 in Toronto, Canada. Marketing As promotion, one could register to receive e-mails \\"from\\" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his therapist. The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by the book's author Bret Easton Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. He discusses such developments as his marriage to (and impending divorce settlement with) his former secretary, Jean, his complete adoration of his son, Patrick Jr., and his efforts to triumph over his business rivals. The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus. However, the film's star, Christian Bale, was not happy with this kind of marketing: \\"My main objection is that some people think it will be me returning those e-mails. I don't like that ... I think the movie stands on its own merits and should attract an audience that can appreciate intelligent satire. It's not a slasher flick, but it's also not American Pie. The marketing should reflect that.\\" Lionsgate spent $50,000 on an online stock market game, Make a Killing with American Psycho, which invited players to invest in films, actors, or musicians using fake Hollywood money. This marketing ploy did little to help the film's box office but the studio's co- president Tom Ortenberg still claimed that it was a success: \\"The aim was to gain exposure and awareness for the picture, and we did that,\\" he said. \\"Lionsgate will make a tidy profit on the picture.\\" Soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was scored by John Cale, with artists such as David Bowie, The Cure, and New Order. The Huey Lewis and the News song \\"Hip to Be Square\\" appears in the film and was initially intended to be on the soundtrack album, but was removed from the album due to lack of publishing rights. As a result, Koch Records was forced to recall approximately 100,000 copies of the album which were destroyed. Koch Records president Bob Frank said, \\"As a result of the violent nature of the film, Huey Lewis's management decided not to give the soundtrack clearance.\\" Lewis' manager Bob Brown claimed that the musician had not seen the film and that \\"we knew nothing about a soundtrack album. They just went ahead and put the cut on there. I think what they're trying to do is drum up publicity for themselves.\\" In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Lewis stated that the violence in the movie played no part in the decision not to allow the song to be included on the soundtrack. He reiterated Bob Brown's earlier denial stating \\"It was in the USA Today and everywhere else. It said, 'Huey Lewis saw the movie and it was so violent that he pulled his tune from the soundtrack.' It was completely made up.\\" In addition, prior to the start of principal photography, Whitney Houston refused to allow the use of her performance of the song \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" in the film; her version was replaced by an easy-listening orchestrated version. AllMusic rated the soundtrack album three out of five stars.

The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) initially gave the film an NC-17 rating for a scene featuring Bateman having a threesome with two prostitutes. The producers excised approximately 18 seconds of footage to obtain an R-rated version of the film. Reception American Psycho debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, where it polarized audiences and critics; some showered the film with praise for its writing and performance from Christian Bale, others with criticism for its violent nature. Upon its theatrical release, the film received positive reviews in crucial publications, including The New York Times which called it a \\"mean and lean horror comedy classic\\". On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 147 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.31/10. The website's critical consensus reads. \\"If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, American Psycho still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"D\\" on an A+ to F scale. It was called the ‚Äúnext Fight Club‚Äù, which Leto also appeared in, by the Guardian. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and regarded Christian Bale as being \\"heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, and that is one mark of a good actor\\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"The difficult truth is that the more viewers can model themselves after protagonist Bateman, the more they can distance themselves from the human reality of the slick violence that fills the screen and take it all as some kind of a cool joke, the more they are likely to enjoy this stillborn, pointless piece of work\\". Newsweek magazine's David Ansen wrote, \\"But after an hour of dissecting the '80s culture of materialism, narcissism and greed, the movie begins to repeat itself. It becomes more grisly and surreal, but not more interesting.\\" In his review for The Village Voice, J. Hoberman wrote, \\"If anything, Bale is too knowing. He eagerly works within the constraints of the quotation marks Harron puts around his performance\\". Rolling Stones Peter Travers wrote, \\"whenever Harron digs beneath the glitzy surface in search of feelings that haven't been desensitized, the horrific and hilarious American Psycho can still strike a raw nerve\\". In a somewhat positive review for Slate magazine, David Edelstein noted the toned-down brutality and sexual content in comparison to the novel and wrote that the moment where Bateman spares his secretary is when \\"this one-dimensional film blossoms like a flower\\". Owen Gleiberman gave the film an \\"A‚àí\\" rating, writing for Entertainment Weekly: \\"By treating the book as raw material for an exuberantly perverse exercise in '80s Nostalgia, [Harron] recasts the go-go years as a template for the casually brainwashing- consumer/fashion/image culture that emerged from them. She has made a movie that is really a parable of today.\\" Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, \\"Harron and co-screenwriter Guinevere Turner do understand the book, and they want their film to be understood as a period comedy of manners\\". Bloody Disgusting ranked the film at No. 19 in its list of the \\"Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade\\", with the article praising \\"Christian Bale's disturbing/darkly hilarious turn as serial killer/Manhattan businessman Patrick Bateman, a role that in hindsight couldn't have been played by any other actor. ... At its best, the film reflects our own narcissism, and the shallow American culture it was spawned from, with piercing effectiveness. Much of the credit for this can go to director Mary Harron, whose off-kilter tendencies are a good complement to Ellis' unique style.\\" Author Ellis said, \\"American Psycho was a book I didn't think needed to be turned into a movie\\", as \\"the medium of film demands answers\\", which would make the book \\"infinitely less interesting\\". He also said that while the book attempted to add ambiguity to the events and to Bateman's reliability as a narrator, the film appeared to make them completely literal before confusing the issue at the very end. On a 2014 appearance on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, Ellis indicated that his feelings towards the film were more mixed than negative; he reiterated his opinion that his conception of Bateman as an unreliable narrator did not make an entirely successful transition from page to screen, adding that Bateman's narration was so unreliable that even he, as the author of the book, didn't know if Bateman was honestly describing events that actually happened or if he was lying or even hallucinating. However, Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel's violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he'd intended, and liked that it gave his novel \\"a second life\\" in introducing it to new readers. Ultimately, Ellis said \\"the movie was okay, the movie was fine. I just didn't think it needed to be made.\\" Home media A special-edition DVD was released on July 21, 2005.http://www.ign.com/movies/american-psycho/dvd-758290 In the U.S., two versions of the film have been released: an R-rated and unrated version. For the edited version and R-rated cinematic release in the U.S., the producers excised about 18 seconds of footage from a scene featuring Bateman having a threesome with two prostitutes. Some dialogue was also edited: Bateman orders a prostitute, Christie, to bend over so that another, Sabrina, can \\"see your asshole\\", which was edited to \\"see your ass\\". The unedited version also shows Bateman receiving oral sex from Christie. The uncut version was released on Blu-ray on February 6, 2007.http://www.blu- ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-Blu-ray/135/ A 4K Blu-ray was released with the Uncut Version on September 25, 2018 in UShttps://www.blu- ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-4K-Blu-ray/208828/ and October 15, 2018 in United Kingdom.https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-4K-Blu- ray/215103/ Sony Pictures Home Entertainment also released the film on Blu-ray around Australia, Spain, South Africa and Portugal in December 2008. Legacy = Themes and analysis = The film has generated various academic works that examine the film as a form of social critique. The director, Mary Harron has claimed the film as a satire on toxic masculinity. In a 2020 interview with Little White Lies, Harron stated she \\"saw Bateman as a kind of buffoon ... The one thing you couldn‚Äôt do was think Bateman was in any way cool.\\" Harron herself had shown interest in the work of Valerie Solanas prior to filming, recounting the radical feminist's life in her debut piece, I Shot Andy Warhol. Furthermore, on reading Ellis's novel Harron was struck by its extreme violence, wanting her adaption to highlight the book's dark humour instead. Nonetheless, the film generated significant controversy for the scenes of violence that remained. Lila Shapiro of Vulture magazine has continued this idea of toxic masculinity, claiming American Psycho portrays \\"a certain type of man‚Äîvain, jealous, absurdly petty, materially wealthy but culturally bankrupt, and above all else, obsessed with what other people think.\\" Shapiro continues her article in drawing comparisons with U.S. President Donald Trump (a character featured much more heavily in the book as one of Bateman's idols), and calling the film a reflection on \\"Wall Street‚Äôs culture of unfettered greed in the 1980s\\". Bateman's confession at the end of the film, which the character says \\"meant nothing\\", is to Shapiro a comment on the apathy of Western society towards many social injustices. =Sequel= A direct-to-video sequel, American Psycho 2, directed by Morgan J. Freeman and starring Mila Kunis, was released in 2002. The sequel's only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback. The film was denounced by American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis. In 2005, star Mila Kunis expressed embarrassment over the film, and spoke out against the idea of a sequel. \\"Please somebody stop this,\\" she said. \\"Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn't know it would be American Psycho II. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh ... I don't know. Bad.\\" =In popular culture= Independent musician Miles Fisher covered \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\" on his self-titled 2009 EP, Miles Fisher. The music video is an homage to American Psycho, with Fisher imitating Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman. The film's influence can be seen in Kanye West's music video \\"Love Lockdown\\" and Maroon 5's music video \\"Animals\\". On September 10, 2013, it was announced that FX and Lionsgate were developing an American Psycho television series that would serve as a sequel to the film. It would be set in the present, with Patrick Bateman in his 50s, grooming an apprentice (Andrew Low) to be just like him. In April 2015, it was stated the show was still in development but as of 2019 it is presumed to have been cancelled or in development hell. The character Bateman mistakenly attributes a quote by Edmund Kemper to Ed Gein, which has led to it being mistaken as such by others; Bateman says: \\"You know what Ed Gein said about women? ... He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street, I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out, talk to her, be real nice and sweet and treat her right ... [the other part wonders] what her head would look like on a stick'.\\" References External links   * * Am.Psycho2000 e-mails * Bret Easton Ellis talks film adaptations at SCAD Category:2000 horror films Category:2000s crime drama films Category:American business films Category:American crime films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American serial killer films Category:American Psycho Category:2000s serial killer films Category:BDSM in films Category:English- language films Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators Category:Film adaptations disliked by their authors Category:Films about businesspeople Category:Films about narcissism Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films based on American horror novels Category:Films based on works by Bret Easton Ellis Category:Films directed by Mary Harron Category:Films scored by John Cale Category:Films set in apartment buildings Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in 1988 Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Lionsgate films Category:Wall Street films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:2000 drama films ja:„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´„É≥„Éª„Çµ„Ç§„Ç≥#Êò†Áîª ","title":"American Psycho (film)"},{"id":"4846579","text":"Seaside Retreat (foaled May 1, 2003 in Kentucky) is a Thoroughbred racehorse who competed in Canada and the United States from a base at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario.

He was the organist and director of music at York Minster for 36 years. Jackson was born in Malton, North Yorkshire, England, and received his early education as a chorister at York Minster under his predecessor, Sir Edward Bairstow. His first cousin once removed was the lyric soprano Elsie Suddaby. He was appointed organist and director of music at York Minster in 1946 and held these positions until his retirement in 1982. Jackson played for the wedding of Elizabeth II's cousin, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, to Katherine Worsley on 8 June 1961. The final voluntary was the final movement of Charles-Marie Widor's Symphony No. 5 for organ: Toccata, which set a fashion for the use of this piece for weddings. Both nationally and internationally acclaimed, Jackson has given recitals and concerts all over the world and made numerous recordings of solo organ music and of choral music with the choir of York Minster. Composition and writing Jackson's extensive output of sacred and secular music includes canticles, anthems, hymn tunes (including the widely sung \\"East Acklam\\"), organ sonatas and other organ pieces such as \\"Diversion for Mixtures\\", two acclaimed monodramas ‚Äì Daniel in Babylon and A Time of Fire, an overture, Brigantia, a concerto, a symphony, and solo songs.

Structure The composition is structured in two movements: # Cypr√®s (Poco adagio) # Lauriers (Allegro non troppo) Lasting not quite twenty minutes, the piece is program music divided into two parts. The first, \\"cypr√®s\\" (\\"cypress\\"), is a mournful dirge adagio for organ solo, recalling a mournful cypress. Once the orchestra makes its entrance, there is an uplifting and sprightly interplay between the organ and orchestra, reminiscent of a militaristic march (hence the \\"lauriers\\", or \\"laurels\\") that makes liberal use of brass and a large percussion band (unusually including a snare drum). Reception One of Saint-Sa√´ns' more unusual compositions, this piece has not secured the same status as his Third Symphony, written for similar ensemble 31 years earlier. This might be because Cypr√®s et Lauriers is shorter and markedly less profound and sweeping nature than its predecessor. The instrumentation bears note: whereas the Third Symphony was written with the organ incorporated as a member of the orchestral ensemble, something that would bear repetition (most famously in Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra), Cypr√®s et Lauriers is structured in traditional concerto form with the organ as soloist.

Caseasaurs are currently known only from the Late Carboniferous and the Permian, and include two superficially different families, the small insectivorous or carnivorous Eothyrididae, and the large, herbivorous, potentially aquatic Caseidae. These two groups share a number of specialised features associated with the morphology of the snout and external naris. The ancestor of caseasaurs can be traced back to an insect eating or an omnivorous reptile-like synapsid from the Pennsylvanian time of the Carboniferous, possibly resembling Archaeothyris, the earliest known synapsid. The caseasaurs were abundant during the later part of the Early Permian, but by the Middle Permian caseasaur diversity declined because the group was outcompeted by the more successful therapsids. The last caseasaurs became extinct at the end of the Guadelupian (Middle Permian).Maddin, H.C., Sidor, C.A. & Reisz, R.R. 2008. Cranial anatomy of Ennatosaurus tecton (Synapsida: Caseidae) from the Middle Permian of Russia and the evolutionary relationships of Caseidae. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology (28): 160-180 Phylogeny Most uncertainty in the phylogeny of synapsids lies among the earliest members of the group, including forms traditionally placed within Pelycosauria. As one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses, Brinkman & Eberth (1983) placed the family Varanopidae with Caseasauria as the most basal offshoot of the synapsid lineage. Reisz (1986) removed Varanopidae from Caseasauria, placing it in a more derived position on the stem. While most analyses find Caseasauria to be the most basal synapsid clade, the analysis of Benson (2012) placed a clade containing Ophiacodontidae and Varanopidae as the most basal synapsids, with Caseasauria occupying a more derived position. Benson attributed this revised phylogeny to the inclusion of postcranial characteristics, or features of the skeleton other than the skull, in his analysis. When only cranial or skull features were included, Caseasauria remained the most basal synapsid clade. Below is a cladogram modified from the analysis of Benson (2012): However, more recent examination of the phylogeny of basal synapsids, incorporating newly described basal caseids and eothyridids, returned Caseasauria to its position as the sister to all other synapsids. Brocklehurst et al. (2016) demonstrated that many of the postcranial characters used by Benson (2012) to unite Caseasauria with Sphenacodontidae and Edaphosauridae were absent in the newly discovered postcranial material of eothyridids, and were therefore acquired convergently.

The Maid's Tragedy is a play by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. It was first published in 1619. The play has provoked divided responses from critics. Date The play's date of origin is not known with certainty. In 1611, Sir George Buck, the Master of the Revels, named The Second Maiden's Tragedy based on the resemblances he perceived between the two works. Scholars generally assign the Beaumont/Fletcher play to c. 1608‚Äì1611. Authorship Scholars and critics generally agree that the play is mostly the work of Beaumont; Cyrus Hoy, in his extensive survey of authorship problems in the Beaumont/Fletcher canon, assigns only four scenes to Fletcher (Act II, scene 2; Act IV, 1; and Act V, 1 and 2), though one of those is the climax of the play (IV, 1).Cyrus Hoy, \\"The Shares of Fletcher and His Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon,\\" Studies in Bibliography, VIII‚ÄìXV, 1956‚Äì62. Publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1619, and published later that year by the bookseller Francis Constable. Subsequent editions appeared in 1622, 1630, 1638, 1641, 1650, and 1661. The play was later included in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 224. The texts of the first quarto of 1619, and the second of 1622, are usually synthesized to create modern editions, since Q2 contains eighty lines not included in Q1, plus a couple of hundred changes and corrections on Q1. Synopsis Melantius, a young general, returns from a military campaign which he has just concluded, winning peace for Rhodes. He is greeted by the King's brother, Lysippus. Melantius expects to have returned to witness the wedding of his friend Amintor with Aspatia, his betrothed, but instead the King has ordered Amintor to marry Melantius's sister, Evadne, in order to honour her brother's military achievements. Aspatia is very melancholy at this, but the whole court is about to celebrate the wedding with a masque. Aspatia's aged father Calianax and a servant are attempting to keep the populace out of the palace as the masque is for the court alone. Calianax has been ‚Äòhumorous‚Äô since his daughter's wedding was broken off and quarrels with Melantius and then with Amintor. The masque of Night and Cynthia (the Moon) is held with various songs, and Evadne and Amintor are taken to their wedding chamber. Outside the chamber Evadne's maid Dula jokes bawdily with her mistress, but Aspatia cannot join in the banter and announces she will die of grief, taking a last farewell of Amintor when he enters. Left alone with her husband Evadne refuses to sleep with him and eventually reveals that the King has forcibly made her his mistress and has arranged this marriage to cover up her ‚Äòdishonour‚Äô. Amintor is horrified, but agrees to go through with the charade of pretending to be a married couple. He sleeps on the floor. Aspatia is talking with her maids, advising them never to love. One of them has produced a tapestry of Theseus and Ariadne, a suitable theme for Aspatia's plight. Calianax enters and is angry at the situation, breathing threats against the men of the court. The morning after the wedding night some male courtiers are talking bawdily outside the chamber and are joined by Melantius. Evadne and Amintor emerge and continue with the pretense, but Amintor is so distressed he says various strange things and Melantius and Evadne notice. The King and courtiers enter and he quizzes the couple; Amintor's answers are so smooth that the King grows jealous and he dismisses everyone except Evadne and Amintor. He satisfies himself that the couple have not slept together and he lets Amintor know the rules: he is to allow Evadne to come to him whenever he wants and is to stay away from her himself. Melantius enters and quarrels with Calianax again; after he leaves, not daring to challenge Melantius, Amintor enters and Melantius gets the secret out of him. He dissuades his friend from revenge and counsels patience, but once Amintor has left he begins to plot to kill the King. In order to do this he has to have control of the citadel which is governed by Calianax. The old man enters again and Melantius proposes common revenge for the injuries that the King has done them both, but after he leaves Calianax resolves to go straight to the King with this information. Melantius goes to Evadne and forces her to reveal what has happened. He gets her to promise to kill the King. He leaves and Amintor enters, Evadne apologises for the situation, but doesn‚Äôt reveal she is to kill the King. Calianax has told the King of Melantius‚Äô plot, however the King has difficulty believing him. In the ensuing scene with the whole court, Meliantius easily outfaces Calianax's accusations and leaves him looking foolish. When everyone except these two leave, Calianax tells Melantius he has no option but to go along with the plot and hand over the citadel. Melantius expects Evadne to kill the King that night, but at this point Amintor enters talking wildly of revenge and Melantius has to pretend that none is planned. The King has summoned Evadne, but when she arrives at his bed chamber she finds him asleep. She soliloquises and then ties his arms to the bed. She wakes him and tells him she is going to kill him for his rape of her. The King doesn‚Äôt believe her, but she stabs him, makes sure he is dead, then leaves. The King's body is discovered and his brother Lysippus is proclaimed the new King. Melantius, his brother Diphilus, and the unwilling Calianax are standing on the citadel explaining to the populace why the King was killed. The new King enters, and after some negotiation the three agree to give up the citadel in return for a pardon. Aspatia enters the palace dressed as a man seeking Amintor. When she finds him she pretends to be a brother of hers looking to fight Amintor to avenge the insult offered to his sister. After much provocation she gets him to fight, but during the fight she drops her guard deliberately and is fatally wounded. Evadne then enters with the bloody knife and asks Amintor to take her as his wife in actuality. He hesitates, leaves, and she stabs herself. He reenters to find her dead and the dying Aspatia reveals herself. He then stabs himself and dies. Finally Melantius, the new King, and the court enter and discover the bodies; Melantius tries to kills himself too but is restrained. He promises to starve himself to death instead. The new King promises to rule ‚Äòwith temper‚Äô. Critical responses Critics have varied widely, even wildly, in their responses to the play. Many have recognised the play's power, but have complained about the play's extremity and artificiality. (People who dislike aspects of Beaumont and Fletcher's work will find those dislikes amply represented, even crystallised, in this play.) John Glassner once wrote that to display \\"the insipidity of the plot, its execrable motivation or the want of it, and the tastelessness of many of the lines one would have to reprint the play.\\"Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; p. 25. Andrew Gurr, one of the play's modern editors, notes that the play \\"has that anomaly amongst Elizabethan tragedies, an original plot.\\" Other critics have noted that the play introduces romance into the standard revenge tragedy, and that the play, even in its artificiality, has relevance to the disputes about authority that characterised relations between kings and Parliament in the decades leading up to the English Civil War.Logan and Smith, pp. 26‚Äì27. Due to its setting on the island of Rhodes, the play has also been read in light of sixteenth-century Ottoman military expansion in the Mediterranean.Lindsay Ann Reid, Beaumont and Fletcher's Rhodes: Early Modern Geopolitics and Mythological Topography in The Maid's Tragedy, Early Modern Literary Studies 16.2 (2012) References External links * Full text in Gutenberg Project * Article from Literary Encyclopedia * Category:English Renaissance plays Category:1600s plays Category:1610s plays Category:Plays by Francis Beaumont Category:Plays by John Fletcher (playwright) Category:Plays by Beaumont and Fletcher ","title":"The Maid's Tragedy"},{"id":"4846701","text":"The Cosmic Movement was the organisation established by Max Th√©on around 1900, in Tlemcen, Algeria, at the instigation of his wife Alma Th√©on, whom he declared to be the moving spirit behind the group.

Biography =Early life and family= Carmichael-Smyth was born in London the eldest son of Scottish physician and medical writer, James Carmichael Smyth and Mary Holyland. His younger brother Henry Carmichael-Smyth, would achieve distinction as an officer serving the East India Company and for being the step-father of William Makepeace Thackeray. Carmichael Smyth married Harriet Morse, daughter of Robert Morse, on 28May 1816 and they had one son. =Career= He was educated at Charterhouse School and the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich, London before joining the Royal Engineers in March 1795 as a second lieutenant. One of the chief engineering officers of the British Army in Southern Africa between 1795‚Äì1808, he then went to Spain under Lieutenant- general Sir John Moore in 1808‚Äì9. From 1813‚Äì15 he was stationed in the Low Countries and was present at the ill-fated Siege of Bergen op Zoom in 1814 before going on to command the Royal Corps of Engineers & Sappers at Waterloo. Prior to the battle, Smyth had created a plan of the ground that allowed Wellington to place his troops rapidly and advantageously. In 1818 he was on Wellington's staff at the Board of Ordnance and was made a baronet in August 1821. He was sent by Wellington in 1823 to survey the defences in the Low Countries and the British West Indies and in 1825 to repeat the operation in British North America. He was promoted major-general in May 1825 and, after carrying out some engineering works in Ireland, was made Governor of the Bahamas in May 1829. In June 1833 he was transferred to be Governor of British Guiana, where he had to deal with the problems of the emancipation of slaves Between 1815 and 1831 He had published eight volumes on the subjects of military engineering, defence, and slavery. =Death= He died of an illness on 4March 1838 in Georgetown, Guiana.

Christensen The Hill Cumorah by Christensen depicting Joseph Smith receiving the golden plates from the Angel Moroni. Painting of the Tarring and feathering of Joseph Smith by Christensen Carl Christian Anton Christensen (November 28, 1831 ‚Äì July 3, 1912) was a Danish-American artist who is known for his paintings illustrating the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Of him it has been said that he \\"did more than any other person to capture the images of the history of Mormon migration to Utah and the life lived there\\". Early life Christensen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark and studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. On September 26, 1850, he was baptized into the LDS Church in Copenhagen by George P. Dykes. Christensen subsequently served as a missionary in his native Denmark. Christensen also served as a missionary in Norway beginning in the fall of 1853. While in Norway, Christensen was the first Mormon missionary to preach in Christiania (now Oslo). While in Christiana, Christensen taught Danquart Anthon Weggeland, who became another prominent early Utah artist. During his time as a missionary in Norway, Christensen was twice put in prison due to government officials not approving of the preaching of MormonismAndrew Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, vol. 1, p. 380‚Äì81. In 1857, at the end of his service in Norway, Christensen set off for Utah Territory, stopping en route in England. He had met Elsie Scheel Haarby while serving in Norway, and he and Elsie married in Liverpool, England. They had planned to wait until reaching Utah to get married but leaders felt the trip would be easier if engaged couples got married before starting the journey. and they sailed for America on the Westmoreland.\\"Winter Quarters center features pioneer artist\\" , Church News, June 1, 2002. After reaching New York City, they traveled by railroad to Iowa City, Iowa, the end of the line, and from there set out for Utah Territory, traveling with the Christian Christiansen handcart company. Painting In 1862 Christensen did stage painting for a theatre in Springville, Utah. Early in his time in Utah, he could find so little demand for his artistic skills that he worked as a housepainter. The first major art work that Christensen undertook while in Utah was a commission from Dimick B. Huntington to do a collection of paintings from the Bible and Book of Mormon, in collaboration with Dan Weggeland.Hunter, J. Michael. \\"Storytellers: Scandinavians' art told of Restoration\\" , Church News, January 22, 2000. Christensen is best known for his Mormon Panorama, a series of 23 large paintings that depict the history of the church. Christensen also painted scenes from the Book of Mormon, such as Nephi and Zoram Return with the Record. Christensen's Book of Mormon paintings were originally issued by the Sunday School for use in classrooms; they were later issued in lithography form. Christensen began touring with the -long Mormon panorama in 1878. Christensen would transport it about Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, giving presentations along with the panorama. He did this during the winter when he was not busy working on his farm.Lloyd, R. Scott. \\"Vivid Panorama: C. C. A. Christensen recreation perpetuates artists' legacy\\", Church News, June 11, 2005. After Christensen's death the panorama was stored away. Many years later it was discovered again and brought back to light, partly by the efforts of Boyd K. Packer. It would gain its fullest recognition almost a century later when it would be shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Christensen also painted some of the murals in the Manti and St. George Temples. Christensen also did paintings for the Manti Tabernacle. Another theme of some of Christensen's paintings was Manti and its surroundings. Christensen often collaborated with Dan Weggeland in his work in Utah. Other Utah activities During his first days in Utah, Christensen found little time to paint. He did various odd jobs such as laying brick and burning charcoal as well as farming. Christensen wrote many LDS hymns in Danish. Some of his translated texts are still in use. Christensen also wrote poetry and contributed to Bikuben. Later he would serve as an editor of that publication. He was also a coauthor of the History of the Scandinavian Mission. Christensen was an instructor in drawing and Danish at the Sanpete Stake Academy (now Snow College). Christensen served a second mission from 1865 to 1868. He went on a third mission to Denmark from 1887 to 1889, during which he worked as the editor of the Scandinaviens Stjerne. Christensen was the Sanpete Stake patriarch in 1901. He also worked in the LDS Church Historian's Office where he compiled materials related to the history of the church in Scandinavia. Rediscovery In a 1976 speech given at Brigham Young University, LDS Church apostle Boyd K. Packer recounted the rediscovery of Christensen's work: Christensen's 1900 painting Handcart Pioneers (not part of Mormon Panorama) \\"has become the most widely published painting of the Mormon pioneer experience by an actual pioneer.\\" See also * List of Danish painters * Mormon art * Mormon pioneers * Moving panorama * Brent Christensen (American career diplomat, great-great-grandson of C.

The case is also significant as one of Justice L'Heureux-Dube's most famous dissents where she proposes an evolving model of the \\"family\\". Background In 1985, Brian Mossop, a gay man from Toronto, sought bereavement leave from his employer, the Canadian federal government's Translation Bureau, to attend the funeral of his same-sex partner's father. His partner is journalist and activist Ken Popert.Smith, Miriam Catherine. Lesbian and Gay Rights in Canada: Social Movements and Equality-Seeking, 1971-1995. University of Toronto Press, 1999. . p. 89. His employer denied him leave under the collective agreement on the grounds that Popert was not \\"immediate family\\". Mossop took his employer before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Sexual orientation was not a prohibited ground of discrimination at that time, so he argued that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his \\"family status\\", under section 3 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found in his favour, but the government appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal and the favourable finding was overturned. Mossop appealed to the Supreme Court, but it upheld the finding of the Federal Court. Reasons of the court The majority held that absent a Charter challenge of the constitutional validity of the Canadian Human Rights Act, there was no grounds for a claim. The only issues raised in the appeal was a question of law on whether the Federal Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to overturn the Tribunal under s. 28 of the Federal Court Act and of statutory interpretation of the Canadian Human Rights Act. It was held that the Federal Court of Appeal did have the necessary jurisdiction to review the Tribunal's decision, as there was no privative clause governing the Tribunal. Since the question posed to the Tribunal was one of statutory interpretation, a question of law, judicial deference was not warranted. On the question of whether there was discrimination on the basis of \\"family status\\", the court found that there was no grounds for Mossop's claim because Parliament intentionally excluded sexual orientation from the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. Since the intent was clear, both the Federal Court and Tribunal were bound to apply the law. Dissent In dissent, Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dube found that there was basis to read sexual orientation into the term \\"family status\\" within the Canadian Human Rights Act. She argued that the meaning of family should be read purposively and that given the growing number of non-traditional families there is a need to reconsider its meaning in light of these changes. She was joined on this point by McLachlin J. and Cory J., who both agreed that the relationship of Mossop and his partner fell within the scope of the term \\"family status\\". Aftermath Despite the dismissal of his appeal Mossop declared the decision a success as it opened up a national debate on gay rights.Didi Herman, \\"Rights of Passage\\", p.60 A subsequent Supreme Court case to consider discrimination against gay persons, Egan v. Canada, would find that sexual orientation is a prohibited grounds of discrimination under Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Fed primarily by high elevation snowmelt along the Great Western Divide, the Kaweah begins as four forks in Sequoia National Park, where the watershed is noted for its alpine scenery and its dense concentrations of giant sequoias, the largest trees on Earth. It then flows in a southwest direction to Lake Kaweah ‚Äì the only major reservoir on the river ‚Äì and into the San Joaquin Valley, where it diverges into multiple channels across an alluvial plain around Visalia. With its Middle Fork headwaters starting at almost above sea level, the river has a vertical drop of nearly on its short run to the San Joaquin Valley, making it one of the steepest river drainages in the United States. Although the main stem of the Kaweah is only long, its total length including headwaters and lower branches is nearly . The lower course of the river and its many distributaries ‚Äì including the St. John's River and Mill Creek ‚Äì form the Kaweah Delta, a productive agricultural region spanning more than . Before the diversion of its waters for irrigation, the river flowed into Tulare Lake, the now dry terminal sink of a large endorheic basin in the southern San Joaquin Valley, also fed by the Kern and Tule Rivers and southern branches of the Kings River. The name \\"Kaweah\\" (commonly rendered as ; the traditional pronunciation is ) comes from a native Yokutsan word, possibly meaning \\"crow cry\\". The Yokuts and Western Mono are the main Native American groups in the Kaweah River basin, which was explored by the Spanish in the early 1800s and heavily logged after the 1850s by American colonists, before its upper reaches became part of Sequoia National Park in 1890. Course Hamilton Lake and the Valhalla Cliffs at the headwaters of the Kaweah River The Kaweah River originates along the Great Western Divide, a chain of peaks in the middle of Sequoia National Park. The divide separates the Kaweah drainage from the Kern River drainage to the east. The Middle Fork, sometimes considered part of the main stem, flows southwest from the confluence of Lone Pine Creek and Hamilton Creek, whose lake sources lie at or above in the Mount Stewart area. The Marble Fork begins in a high plateau area known as the Tableland and drops over a glacial headwall, forming Tokopah Falls, before flowing west past Lodgepole Village and turning south. The two forks join at the bottom of a deep gorge directly below Moro Rock to form the main stem of the Kaweah River. The Kaweah River flows in a southwest direction, paralleled by Highway 198 in its narrow canyon. A short distance outside Sequoia National Park it picks up the East Fork, which originates above elevation in the Mineral King valley, from the left. It continues past the town of Three Rivers, where it receives the North Fork, which begins in the Grant Grove area of Kings Canyon National Park. The South Fork enters from the left before the river empties into Lake Kaweah, the reservoir formed by Terminus Dam in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Terminus Dam, a high earthfill dam, has the primary purpose of flood control but also supplies water for irrigation and hydroelectricity. Below the dam the Kaweah River passes Lemon Cove, receives Dry Creek (also known as Lime Kiln Creek) from the right and flows into the San Joaquin Valley where it divides into several major distributaries. At the McKay Point Dam, the St. John's River splits off to the northwest, making a wide loop around Visalia before becoming Cross Creek north of Goshen, from where it flows south. The main channel of the Kaweah River continues to the southwest through farmland, with Outside Creek and Deep Creek splitting to the south before the Kaweah itself divides into Mill Creek and Packwood Creek. Mill Creek continues westward through Visalia, and Packwood Creek skirts to the south of the city, terminating in a small flood control basin. Mill Creek ends at a confluence with Cross Creek, which flows southward to the old Tulare Lake bed near Corcoran, joining a channel carrying water from the Tule River. The Kaweah Delta region, as defined by the Kaweah Delta Water Conservation District, covers about in Tulare and Kings Counties; the main cities are Visalia and Tulare. The length of the Kaweah River is between the confluence of the Middle and Marble Forks and the bifurcation of Mill and Packwood Creeks. However, including its tributaries and distributaries, the river is much longer. Mill Creek (the largest distributary stream) flows westward for to Cross Creek, for a total distance of . Including the upstream Middle Fork, which is about long, and the length of Cross Creek below Mill Creek, which is , some water in the Kaweah system flows from the head of the Middle Fork to the Tulare Lake bed. Most of the Kaweah River's runoff comes from the mountain watershed above Visalia, which covers a total of . Including all the lands drained and crossed by the river's many distributaries down to the Tulare Lake bed, the Kaweah River hydrologic region covers . The annual runoff of the Kaweah River between 1975 and 1995 was , or about . The river's highest flows are during the peak snowmelt months of May and June; winter flows are usually more of a trickle, although the river often experiences flooding during rainstorms. Most of the water is diverted above Visalia for irrigation and groundwater recharge. With the exception of agricultural wastewater, water rarely flows any further downstream except in wet years. Extremely large storms can temporarily refill Tulare Lake, as occurred most recently in 1997. Natural features and environment Lake Kaweah is the only major reservoir on the Kaweah River. Due to its steep fall from the Sierra Nevada to the San Joaquin Valley, the Kaweah River passes through a wide range of climate and vegetation zones in a relatively short distance. Historically, the lower Kaweah flowed into a vast area of seasonally flooded wetlands surrounding Tulare Lake, almost all of which have been diked and drained for agriculture. The Kaweah historically formed a large overflow area east of Visalia known as the \\"Visalia Swamp\\" and in areas west of Visalia stream channels were poorly defined, often simply disappearing into the marsh lands during periods of high water. The foothill zone is characterized mostly by grassland and rangeland; California oak woodland occurs along the Kaweah River and its perennial tributaries, although its range has been much reduced since Native American times. Further upstream and higher in elevation, the watershed is mostly mixed coniferous forest (pines and firs). The largest concentrations of giant sequoias, which grow only on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, are found in this section of the Kaweah watershed at mean elevations of , although specimens have been found as low as . The Kaweah watershed includes Giant Forest, the most visited and accessible of all the sequoia groves, located on the divide between the Middle and Marble Forks; it includes the General Sherman Tree, the largest tree in the world by volume. Redwood Mountain Grove, the largest sequoia grove in the world at , and 21 other groves are also located in the Kaweah watershed. A relatively small portion of the Kaweah basin is high, craggy alpine country typical of the southern Sierra; such treeless, lake-studded areas of exposed granite are mostly found along the crest of the Great Western Divide. Today, mule deer are the largest wild animal inhabiting the valley and foothill area; historically, large herds of tule elk frequented the area, but their habitat in the Kaweah Delta has been almost entirely eliminated by agriculture. There are many species of foxes, wildcats, squirrels, and rabbits including the endemic San Joaquin kit fox, San Joaquin antelope squirrel, and others. California grizzly bear and beaver were once common to the area but were hunted or trapped out entirely by the early 1900s. The mountain areas continue to provide habitat for black bears, mule deer, and bighorn sheep, and the Kaweah River above Three Rivers has native rainbow trout and introduced brown trout and bass. In alpine areas above the tree line, small mammals such as marmots and pika are common. History The Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, in Sequoia National Park The Kaweah River watershed was originally inhabited by the indigenous Yokuts people of the Central Valley. By at least 3,000 years ago, a group known as the Wukchumni had permanent settlements along the river. The greatest concentration of Native American settlements was along the foothill reach of the Kaweah River, in what is today Three Rivers and Lake Kaweah. The Wukchumni spent summers hunting game and gathering herbs along the East Fork, and they traded with the Paiute peoples of the Great Basin. Around 700 to 500 years ago, the Western Mono came to settle in the region as well. Oak trees grew in abundance along low-elevation, permanent streams and provided the staple food of acorns, which were used to make cakes and bread. Native Americans ground acorns into a fine mush using holes in the local granite bedrock as mortars. Permanent winter settlements in the foothills consisted of pit houses thatched with tules (vast amounts of which once grew in the marshes of the Kaweah delta) up to in diameter. Hospital Rock, a flat next to the Middle Fork, was used as a camp possibly as early as the 1300s AD. Spanish explorers came to the Kaweah River area in the early 1800s, although it is not clear who first explored the Kaweah Delta (possibly the Gabriel Moraga party in 1806). Early Spanish names for the river included Rio de San Gabriel and Rio San Francisco. Several such expeditions were sent into the region, in order to conscript Native Americans into the mission system. Father Pedro Mu√±oz wrote that the Kaweah would be a good place for a mission, but none were ever established there, because it was too far from the coast and could not be easily defended. In the following decades, Native American resistance to Spanish colonial government prompted many military raids, killing many of the natives who had not already succumbed to European diseases. After California became a U.S. state, the California Gold Rush drew some prospectors to the Kaweah in the 1850s, but not much gold mining occurred in the area. During this time, the Kaweah was often known as the \\"River Francis\\", a corruption of the old Spanish name. Hale Tharp, a stockman and early settler in Three Rivers, discovered the Giant Forest in 1858 with the help of Native American guides. In 1861 Tharp returned to this area between the Middle and Marble forks of the Kaweah River, using a hollowed-out fallen sequoia log (Tharp's Log) as a cabin. In 1873, a silver boom in Mineral King attracted thousands of people to the high mountain valley along the East Fork. The peak of mining had passed by 1882, when the Empire Mine (owned by state senator Thomas Fowler, who invested most of his fortune in the mine) went under. Small operations continued, sporadically, into the late 1920s. After the end of silver mining, Mineral King became a popular summer resort. The St. John's River, a major distributary of the Kaweah River in the San Joaquin Valley The one resource extraction industry that succeeded in the Kaweah basin was timber; many logging camps sprang up in the heavily forested western slopes of the Sierra, including in the watershed's sequoia groves. The Kaweah Colony was a utopian socialist community founded in 1886, along the Kaweah River in what is now Sequoia National Park. Although giant sequoia wood is generally too soft to be useful in construction, many sequoias were felled between the 1860s and the 1880s when the U.S. government began establishing timber reserves in the area, under pressure from conservationists, including John Muir, who visited the Kaweah's Marble Fork and named Giant Forest in 1875. Logging mostly ended after Sequoia National Park was founded in 1890; the bill establishing the park was pushed through in part due to the actions of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which saw the Kaweah colony as a competitor to logging operations that it owned elsewhere. Some settlers in the Kaweah Colony attempted to continue their operations but were later convicted of illegal logging, after which the colony dissolved in 1892. The Kaweah Delta (historically also known as the \\"Four Creeks area\\", after the four major branches of the Kaweah River) was one of the earliest places in the San Joaquin Valley to be populated and farmed by U.S. settlers, although before the construction of Terminus Dam the entire area was frequently flooded; the Great Flood of 1862 temporarily changed the course of the river, creating the distributary today known as St. John's River. Agriculture began in the Kaweah Delta around 1864 when a group of local farmers dug the Consolidated Peoples' Ditch. The people of Visalia hired Native Americans to extend a canal from Mill Creek to power the expanding settlement's flour mill. In addition, multiple channels had to be dug to redirect the flow of St. John's River back into the Kaweah, which had been blocked by sediment during the 1862 flood. It was not until after the Wright Act of 1887, however, that farming expanded significantly. The Wright Act allowed the formation of the Tulare Irrigation District, which began to establish a network of canals across the Kaweah Delta. Surface water provided the main supply as late as 1900, after which the area's abundant groundwater reserves were pumped at increasing rates. Tulare Lake disappeared by the early 1900s, and by the 1930s, agricultural development had surpassed the capacity of local water resources. In the 1960s Disney proposed to construct a ski resort in Mineral King, which would have brought one of the most intense developments in the history of the upper Kaweah watershed. The resort would have included 22 ski lifts, a 1,030-room hotel, ten restaurants, and a railroad along the canyon of the East Fork Kaweah River to transport visitors from a parking area further down the mountain. Environmentalists fought against the proposal for many years, and in 1978 the National Parks and Recreation Act designated the area as part of Sequoia National Park. River modifications The control tower at Terminus Dam, which provides flood control and irrigation for the Kaweah Delta In order to make the Kaweah Delta suitable for agriculture and eventually urban development, the tangle of diverging seasonal channels and marshes had to be drained and diked extensively. As early as the 1870s local irrigation companies were dredging some creeks and blocking off side channels in order to direct floodwater away from farms. A major early 20th century project was the channelization of Mill Creek, which runs through the middle of Visalia and posed a major flooding threat before it was straightened, deepened and widened in 1910 at a cost of $70,000. Dams were built in the 1920s and 1930s at McKays Point to divide water flow between the Kaweah and St. Johns Rivers, to satisfy downstream water rights. Today, the Kaweah Delta has very little resemblance to historic times; most of the streams have either disappeared or been channelized, and Tulare Lake itself is now a dry, diked basin that only very occasionally floods. The Kaweah Delta Water Conservation District manages the distribution of water to irrigation districts and city water districts over a service area. The primary crops grown in the district are cotton, various fruits, nuts, alfalfa, and other field crops. In addition to surface water, the district utilizes Central Valley Project water from the Friant-Kern Canal, which delivers water from the San Joaquin River to the Tulare Basin. Water can be turned out into either the Kaweah or St. Johns rivers, augmenting the water supply available to Kaweah Delta users. Groundwater is the other important source of water supply for the basin. The local aquifer has suffered from overdraft for many decades with an estimated annual deficit of between pumping and replenishment. In order to increase the rate of groundwater recharge, more than 40 recharge basins or spreading grounds totaling have been constructed throughout the district, which allow floodwaters to percolate into the ground. Hydroelectric power development on the Kaweah River began when the Mount Whitney Power Company built a diversion, flume and the Kaweah No. 1 powerhouse on the East Fork in 1899. In 1905 it completed Kaweah No. 2 powerhouse on the Middle Fork. The company then applied for permission to construct a third power plant on the Middle Fork inside Sequoia National Park, which was approved partly because at the time, this was an infrequently visited area of the park. The Kaweah No. 3 plant was completed by 1913, and was followed by more plans to construct a reservoir at Wolverton and at least two additional power plants. The Kaweah plants brought electricity to Visalia for the first time, and the power was also used by farmers to pump groundwater. However, construction of the Wolverton dam was thwarted by bad foundation rock and the other power plants were also never built. Taken over by Southern California Edison in 1917, the system today consists of six dams, three powerhouses, three forebays and many miles of concrete and wooden flumes. The Kaweah No. 3 plant is an eligible property for the National Register of Historic Places. Terminus Dam was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1962 to help relieve the Kaweah Delta's chronic flooding. Prior to damming, the river could reach very high flows during winter storms, with a maximum of in December 1955. However, the capacity of the main channel of the Kaweah River is only , and its distributaries have an even lower capacity. Four years after the dam's completion, it prevented $19.6 million of damage during a single storm in December 1966. However, the capacity of the reservoir, Lake Kaweah, was too small to control the most severe floods, and was so for many years until the completion of a spillway enhancement project in 2004. Six huge fuse gates, the largest of their type in the world, were added to the dam; the reservoir can now safely hold of water, an increase of 30 percent from the original capacity. Recreation View of the Kaweah headwaters from the High Sierra Trail, a popular backpacking route All the forks of the Kaweah River are located in Sequoia National Park, which receives more than 1.2 million recreational visitors each year. The river is a major park attraction for boating and fishing, but can be \\"extremely hazardous\\" during high water in the spring and summer. Several commercial outfitters serve the traditional Class IV section of the Kaweah River between the Pumpkin Hollow bridge (near the park entrance) and Lake Kaweah. Advanced kayakers frequent the Class V Middle Fork at Hospital Rock, further upstream in Sequoia National Park; the North Fork is a wilderness run, requiring boaters to carry all their equipment to the put-in. The river is free-flowing above Lake Kaweah so the rafting season depends entirely on the natural snowmelt, typically between April and July. Access to the Kaweah River for fishing, swimming and water play can be difficult in the Three Rivers area, because most of the river banks are on private property. In Sequoia National Park the river flows at the bottom of a deep canyon and can also be difficult to reach. The river just above Lake Kaweah is publicly accessible at the Slick Rock Recreation Area; however, this location is inundated most summers when the level of Lake Kaweah is high. Slick Rock, known to locals as \\"Boulder Beach\\", has rock climbing areas and historic Native American bedrock mortars. Lake Kaweah itself offers shoreline fishing and flatwater boating. The upper South Fork in Sequoia National Park has good fishing for wild rainbow trout, although a long hike is required to reach it. A California fishing license is required for visitors older than age 16 in the park. The upper Kaweah is also home to many hiking trails. Day hikes include the walk along Marble Fork to Tokopah Falls, and the Mineral King area along the East Fork also has a number of short trails. Backpacking is popular on the High Sierra Trail, which runs from Giant Forest through the Middle Fork canyon, and summits the Great Western Divide via Kaweah Gap en route toward the John Muir Trail to Mount Whitney. The Bearpaw Meadow High Sierra Camp is located along the High Sierra Trail near the headwaters of the Middle Fork.

Construction The ship was ordered on 16 December 1916 from Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow in the 10th Order of the 1916‚Äì17 Programme. She was laid down in April 1917, launched on 13 May 1918, and completed on the last day of the war, 11 November 1918. Service history After being accepted in service Wryneck took part in operations in the Baltic against the Bolsheviks. Sailors of the ship took part in the Royal Navy mutiny of 1919. She was part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet in 1921, which was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1925 as the 1st Destroyer Flotilla. Wryneck was put into Reserve during the economic crisis of the 1930s and laid up in Gibraltar. In 1938 she was selected for WAIR conversion to a fast escort ship at Gibraltar Dockyard. The work began in September 1939 and was not completed until March 1940. In April 1940, after sea trials, Wryneck was recommissioned for service with the new pennant number L04, and assigned to convoy defence duty based at Alexandria. In December she was detached to support military operations against the Italian army in Egypt. In January 1941 she resumed convoy defence duties, and in March formed part of the escort of military convoys taking British and Commonwealth troops to Greece as part of \\"Operation Lustre\\". In April, with the fall of Greece, Wryneck returned to help the evacuation of Allied troops. Loss Wryneck was sent to help rescue survivors from and fend off Luftwaffe attacks, but both destroyers were sunk. On the morning of 27 April she was in Souda Bay when a convoy led by the cruiser evacuating troops from Nauplia in the Peloponnese came under air attack in the Argolic Gulf. , and Wryneck were ordered from Souda Bay to release the destroyers and , which were heavily laden with evacuated troops. By the time Vendetta, Waterhen and Wryneck reached the convoy, the Dutch troop ship had been disabled and left behind and the destroyer had been ordered to stay and assist. At 08:15 Diamond reported that she was still rescuing survivors and still under air attack. By then three destroyers had reinforced the convoy so Calcutta sent Wryneck to assist Diamond. Slamat was afire from stem to stern when Diamond fired a torpedo that sank her in a coup de gr√¢ce. Diamond reported at 09:25 that she had rescued most of the survivors and was proceeding to Souda Bay. An hour later Wryneck signalled a request for aircraft cover. At about 13:15, an air attack by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombersShores, Cull and Malizi, pp. 295, 299. sank both destroyers within minutes. Wryneck launched her whaler, and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Survivors in the whaler set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats to strike the boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift. rescued 50 survivors from Wryneck and Diamond, some of whom were survivors from Slamat After 1900 hrs on 27 April the Vice Admiral, Light Forces, Henry Pridham-Wippell, became concerned that Diamond had not returned to Souda Bay and was not answering radio signals. Wryneck had been ordered to keep radio silence so no attempt was made to radio her. Pridham-Wippell sent the destroyer to the position where Slamat had been lost. She found 14 survivors in two Carley floats that night, more floats and another four survivors in the morning, and took the survivors to Crete. The last living survivor from Slamat, Royal Army Service Corps veteran George Dexter, states that after Wryneck was sunk he and three other men were rescued by the cruiser . 24 survivors in Wrynecks whaler, one of them severely wounded, reached Crete in three stages. On 28 April they aimed for the island of Milos in the Aegean Sea, but were too exhausted so they landed at Ananes Rock about southeast of Milos after seeing two boys trying to draw their attention using a Union Jack. There they were met by the passengers of a ca√Øque full of Greek refugees and British soldiers evacuated from Piraeus, who were sheltering by day and sailing only by night to avoid detection. They too had been bombed when another ca√Øque carrying them, Irene, had been sighted near Monemvasia (Porto Gerakas) in the daytime when they were resting ashore. Embarking on another hastily bought caique, they sailed on to the Ananes. Among the passengers were the historian and SOE operative Nicholas Hammond, Major Ian Pirie the leader of the British expedition to Greece together with expatriate and high-ranking SOE operative David Pawson, as well as four Australian privates. The ca√Øque's captain, George Vergos, was also involved in SOE work and was a decorated veteran (OBE) of the Royal Navy from the First World War, also fleeing Greece with his extended family and some other Greeks. Pirie and Pawson together with Dennis Hamson were now charged with evacuating an unknown amount of bullion from the British Embassy in Athens, all lost with the Irene. In the evening everyone left Ananes and headed south for Crete, with most people in the ca√Øque and four being towed in the whaler. Five of the women and children were placed in a skiff on deck with a tarpaulin over them as the sea spray from a strong southerly wind was washing the deck. The next day all 46 people reached Souda Bay whose jetty was at the time under heavy aerial bombardment. They were making very slow progress in the small ca√Øque so a faster landing craft was sent out to tow them to safety.

Kennedy Department of Justice Building in Washington, D.C. George Biddle (January 24, 1885 ‚Äì November 6, 1973) was an American painter, muralist and lithographer, best known for his social realism and combat art. A childhood friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he played a major role in establishing the Federal Art Project (1935‚Äì43), which employed artists under the Works Progress Administration. Biography =Education= Born to an established Philadelphia family, Biddle attended the elite Groton School (where he was a classmate of Franklin D. Roosevelt). He completed his undergraduate studies and later earned a law degree from Harvard (1908 and 1911, respectively). He passed his bar examination in Philadelphia. Biddle's legal career was short-lived, however, and by the end of 1911 he had left the United States to study at the Acad√©mie Julianincollect.com in Paris. In the next two years he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Returning to Europe in 1914, Biddle spent time in Munich and Madrid, studying printmaking in the Spanish capital, before trying his hand at impressionism in France. As he remembered, \\"I gobbled up museums, French Impressionism, cubism, futurism, and the old masters; I copied Velasquez in Madrid and Rubens in Munich‚Ä¶.\\" In 1917, with the United States' entry into the First World War, Biddle enlisted in the army. In the early interwar period Biddle continued his studies in far-flung locations such as Tahiti, returned to France in 1924, and in 1928 went on a sketching trip through Mexico with Diego Rivera. =Career= Prior to his Mexican travels, Biddle had returned to the United States in 1927 and established a printing shop in New York, where he \\"began to explore the variety and richness of technique and expressionism possible in lithography\\", a medium which he hoped would \\"popularize American art by making it better known to the American public\\". In the 1930s, Biddle became a champion of social art and strongly advocated government funding for artistic endeavors.

Biddle himself completed a mural titled The Tenement for the Justice Department building in Washington, D.C. and made sketches of the opera Porgy and Bess during its late 1930s tour. His works were exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair. During these years Biddle also wrote several books and taught at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. Biddle was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film The Long Voyage Home, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's plays.\\"Cover Article, American Artist Magazine, September, 1940, pp. 4-14\\" He served as President of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1935 to 1936. During World War II, Biddle was appointed chairman of the United States Department of War's Art Advisory Committee and served to recruit artists to that body. Biddle himself traveled through Algeria, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy with the 3rd Infantry Division and produced works documenting that unit's activities. He wrote a book on his war travels: Artist at War Tunisia-Sicily-Italy, Viking Press, 1944.

November 15, 1934). George Biddle died on November 6, 1973, in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Style and influences Some factors that contributed to Biddle's artwork are the many art movements that he was involved in. Biddle was involved in \\"French Impressionism; the American Ashcan School; the School of Paris and Cubism during those early and exciting days when it first exploded on the world; Regionalism, the Mexican Mural Movement, and the New Deal Subsidy of Art\\".Biddle, George. The Yes and No of Contemporary Art. London: Oxford University Press, 1957 He also was involved in the \\"post war currents of contemporary art\\". Many of his works of art were contemporary. Another factor that contributed to Biddle's artwork were his friendships with many great \\"painters, sculptors, and critics of the past generation and his life-long activity in behalf of fellow artists\\". He borrowed many of the other artists' styles and turned them into his own by using different techniques and images to get a different effect. Biddle believed that everyone's life should be influenced by every \\"fact with which one comes in contact, until one ceases to grow or is, actually dead\\". This is the reason why Biddle became such a successful American artist; he had his own style, and expressed real actual events. A further influence on Biddle was Mary Cassatt. Biddle met Cassatt at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris; she too was from Philadelphia. Cassatt helped to cultivate in Biddle an appreciation of the work of Degas. Some of Biddle's prints reflected \\"the style of these two artists in their intimate, domestic subject matter\\". Biddle put in his \\"personal feelings--affection, humor, compassion, irony, social outrage--as well as his technical mastery of the lithographic medium\\" to \\"enliven his work\\".Pennigar, Martha. The Graphic Work of George Biddle with Catalogue Raisonn√©. Baltimore, Maryland: Garamond/Pridemark Press, 1979 George Biddle achieved a lot of goals that helped other artists make their way. His work serves as a \\"kind of index to the many style and themes which occupied artists in the first half of the 20th century\\". When Biddle volunteered to go to the war, it changed his whole life and how he saw the world. He got to travel the country and study the art of different cultures thus enriching the art that he would produce. Biddle captured scenes and people how they naturally occurred in life. \\"Catfish Row\\" is a good example of Biddle capturing people and objects in their natural state. \\"Rejecting the stale formulas of academism and critical of what he saw as a loss of articulate emotional expressionism in much of modernist art, Biddle grappled with his own artistic identity throughout his life\\". The artist Margaretta S. Hinchman bequeathed a self- portrait by George Biddle to the Philadelphia Museum of Art upon her death in 1955.

Route description I-5 in Bellingham SR 539 begins as a continuation of Meridian Street north of downtown Bellingham at an interchange with I-5 near the Bellis Fair Mall. The highway travels along the east side of the mall and through a retail and commercial district, passing near the Whatcom Community College campus and the Cordata business park. After leaving Bellingham city limits near the residential areas of the Cordata neighborhood, SR 539 becomes the Guide Meridian Road, so named because it follows the \\"guide meridian\\" plotted east of the Willamette Meridian. The four-lane highway continues north through the rural Laurel area and passes the campus of Meridian High School. After crossing Fourmile Creek and passing through a roundabout with Ten Mile Road, SR 539 gains a grass median with a cable barrier as it heads north towards Lynden. In the southern outskirts of the city, the highway reaches a roundabout with SR 544, which travels northeast to the towns of Everson and Nooksack. SR 539 continues north and crosses over Wiser Lake on a causeway and the Nooksack River on a pair of steel truss bridges before reaching Lynden. The Guide Meridian travels through the western outskirts of Lynden and passes through an industrial area and near the Northwest Washington Fair and Events Center. The highway leaves Lynden and narrows to two lanes before reaching an intersection with SR 546. After traversing another stretch of farmland, SR 539 reaches the Lynden‚ÄìAldergrove Border Crossing on the Canadian border, where it terminates. The highway widens to accommodate two separate lanes for trucks and NEXUS pass-holders and is split into two roads with a duty-free store in the middle. The border crossing is open from 8 a.m. to midnight and is the fourth-busiest border crossing in the state, with 509,467 vehicles entering the United States in 2017. Beyond the border, the road becomes British Columbia Highway 13, which continues north to Aldergrove and an interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway east of Langley. The entire route of SR 539 from Bellingham to the Canadian border is perfectly straight and runs due north‚Äìsouth. It serves as an alternate route between Bellingham and British Columbia, bypassing the Blaine border crossings. The entire highway is listed as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility, and is designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the state legislature. SR 539 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of annual average daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 1,400 vehicles at the Canadian border to a maximum of 37,000 vehicles near Bellis Fair Mall. The Guide Meridian corridor is also served by several Whatcom Transportation Authority bus routes connecting Bellingham to Lynden, Everson, Nooksack, and Sumas. History The Guide Meridian was preceded by a plank road that was built by the county government in stages between 1884 and 1885 and fully graded in 1890. The plank road ran to the west of the current Guide Meridian from Laurel to the Nooksack River to avoid Wiser Lake. By November 1891, it stretched and cost $72,000 to construct. It was destroyed several times by forest fires, including a major fire in 1897 that required using 80,000 board feet of lumber to replace the burned sections. The Guide Meridian was later reconstructed as a gravel road from Bellingham to the Canadian border in the early 1910s. The section of the Guide Meridian within Bellingham city limits, named Meridian Street, was paved by the city government in 1914. The following year, the Whatcom County government began $68,800 in work on the road, including a new bridge over the Nooksack River near Lynden and of pavement between Bellingham and Laurel. The paved Guide Meridian was opened on September 14, 1915, ahead of the Northwest Washington Fair, and the new Nooksack River bridge was completed the following month. The Nooksack river bridge from 1915 was moved to Mosquito Lake Road during the 1950s replacement of a wider bridge which is the current northbound bridge. The new bridge measured in length, the longest of any steel bridge in the Pacific Northwest at the time. The remainder of the unpaved road was maintained by a local citizen named John C. Anderson, who received praise from local newspapers for the quality of the road. The planked approaches to the Nooksack River bridge were deemed too narrow for automobile traffic and widened by in 1919. Further paving projects on sections of the Guide Meridian were contracted by the county government between 1920 and 1932, completing a paved highway from Bellingham to the Canadian border. The British Columbia government announced plans in 1931 to link the improved Guide Meridian to the Fraser Highway via a new paved highway. The Guide Meridian was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 1B (SSH 1B), connecting the Canadian border with Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1), also signed as U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in Bellingham. Several bills in the 1930s proposed elevating the Guide Meridian to a primary state highway, but the proposal was not considered by the state legislature. In 1952, the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the creation of US 99 Alternate, which would run concurrent to SSH 1B from Bellingham to the Canadian border. The designation came shortly before the completion of the Aldergrove highway (signed as British Columbia Highway 13). After the completion of the Bellingham Freeway (part of I-5) in December 1960, SSH 1B was truncated to a new interchange at the north end of Meridian Street. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, SSH 1B was replaced by US 99 Alternate and PSH 1 was provisionally renumbered to US 99 before being replaced outright by I-5. US 99 and its alternate routes were decommissioned in 1969, leaving SR 539 to replace SSH 1B when the new state highway system was codified by the state legislature in 1970. SR 539 crosses the Nooksack River on a pair of truss bridges; the southbound (left) span was constructed in 2009. Guide Meridian Road was transformed from a two-lane highway to a four-lane highway in the late 2000s. The project was completed in two phases. The first phase, carried out by IMCO General Construction of Bellingham, was from Horton Road to Ten Mile Road. Along with the wider roadway the project installed new signals at Smith, Axton and Laurel Road intersections. It also replaced both the Four Mile Creek and Ten Mile Creek Bridges with wider, safer bridges. Construction of this segment was started in June 2007 and completed in Fall 2008, at a total cost of $39.9 million, funded by the Washington State DOT. The second phase created a four-lane highway from Ten Mile Road to Badger Road; this phase was carried out by Max J. Kuney Construction of Spokane. It also built four new roundabouts at Ten Mile Road, Pole Road, Wiser Lake Road, and River Road to further help improve safety. Bridges were widened or replaced at Wiser Lake, Fishtrap Creek, Floodway and Nooksack River. In Summer 2007 the crews moved utilities from the roadway. In Fall 2007 the DOT finished buying property, and construction began in Spring 2008. The project was completed in July 2010., SR 539 - Ten Mile Road to Badger Road Widening Major intersections References External links *Highways of Washington State 539 Category:Transportation in Whatcom County, Washington Category:Bellingham, Washington Category:U.S. Route 99 Category:1969 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Washington State Route 539"},{"id":"4846982","text":"Dodona ouida, the mixed Punch, is a small but striking butterfly found in the Indomalayan realm in West China, Himalayas (west as far as Mussoorie), Northeast India (hills) and Burma that belongs to the Punches and Judies, that is, the family Riodinidae.

Beyond that river, the region was known as Veragua, and was disputed by the Spanish crown along with the Columbus family. The name \\"Castilla de Oro\\" was made official in May 1513 by King Ferdinand II of Aragon, then regent of the Crown of Castile. After Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa's discovery of the Pacific Ocean, Castilla de Oro's jurisdiction was broadened to include the Pacific coasts of Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua. With the creation, in 1527, of the Province of Nicaragua, which included today's Nicaragua as well as the Nicoya Peninsula, Castilla de Oro's jurisdiction was reduced. In 1537, once the conflict between the crown and the Columbus family was settled, Castilla de Oro was split up, divided by the Duchy of Veragua. The western portion, which comprised most of Panama's and Costa Rica's Pacific coasts, was merged in 1540 with Royal Veragua, to create the Province of Nuevo Cartago y Costa Rica. The eastern part, the last remnant of Castilla de Oro, in time became known as the Realm of Tierra Firme, or Panam√°, especially after the creation of the Royal Academy of Panam√° in 1538. In 1560, the new Province of Veragua, created by Philip II out of the now defunct Duchy of Veragua, was merged with Castilla de Oro.

It was founded in 1866 by the New York City Common CouncilCUNY VNY Cholera in New York at a suggestion by the New York Academy of Medicine, following a campaign led by Dr. Stephen Smith.Stephen Smith, American Surgeon and NYC Public Health Pioneer The several powers and duties of the health officers are set forth in detail in chapter xix of the first charter creating Greater New York (January 1, 1898; amended, 1901). In 1915 the health department was administered by a board of health, consisting of a commissioner appointed by the mayor, the commissioner of police, and the health officer of the port.New International Encyclopedia History The Board of Health, later known as the Metropolitan Board of Health began after the American Civil War on February 18, 1865 when the first Report of the Council of Hygiene and Public Health of the Citizens' Association of New York (known as Citizen's Association Report on the Sanitary Condition of the City) was written:Report of the Council of Hygiene and Public Health of the Citizens' Association of New York upon the sanitary condition of the City (Google eBook), 1865 Poor sanitation and filthy streets threatened both the physical health of the public as well as the economic welfare of the developing metropolis in the mid nineteenth century. The sanitation of the city went under city politics. Most of city sewage and welfare in New York City was headed by Tammany Hall. In 1863 Tammany Hall nominated City Street Inspector Francis I. A. Boole for mayor.Mass Meeting of the Democracy New York Times, November 28, 1863 Reformists discovered that street cleaning was deeply embedded in corruption. Workers were paid by Tammany Hall below minimum wage and forced to sign contracts that gave up half of their paycheck to Boole. After the release of the Citizens Association Report in late 1865, the new board began to manage New York City's worst environmental problems. The board of Health in New York, inspected at least 500 factories in the area and demanded that the factory owners decrease the amount of toxic air they released which they say was becoming a major health risk as well as the dirty tenements that contained new immigrants into the area. A Health official in 1866 wrote of the tenements in a 300-page document, entitled Inspection of Tenement living: > The streets were uncleaned; manure heaps containing thousands of tons, > occupied piers and vacant lots; sewers were obstructed; houses were crowded, > and badly ventilated, and lighted; privies were unconnected with the sewers, > and overflowing; stables and yards were filled with stagnant water, and many > dark and damp cellars were inhabited. The streets were obstructed, and the > wharves and piers were filthy and dangerous from dilapidation; cattle were > driven through the streets at all hours of the day in large numbers, and > endangered the lives of the people. The Board of Health helped encourage scientists and doctors to help cure diseases as well as join reformers in bringing attention to tenement law and work laws. By 1915 many of the powers originally possessed by the health department as to tenement houses had been transferred to the tenement-house department, which was charged with enforcing the tenement-house law in all flats and apartments.New International Encyclopedia See also *Metropolitan Health Bill *New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene References Category:Healthcare in New York City Category:Health departments in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in New York City Category:New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ","title":"Metropolitan Board of Health"},{"id":"4847100","text":"HarbourFront Centre is a shopping mall and ferry terminal that connects to nearby Indonesian ports, as well as the city of Batam and Bintan Island.

Despite the similar name and execution, the result of the shot bears little resemblance to the traditional slapshot due to the awkwardness of the motion involved. To execute the shot: #The player winds up their hockey stick to the side of their top hand (left hand for a right-hand shot). For a so-called backhand slapshot, the wind-up is awkward at best, requiring either a scissoring of the hands resulting in a golf-like ‚Äúchip,‚Äù or rotation of the shoulders with the arms and wrists moving very little. #Next the player violently \\"slaps\\" the ice slightly behind the puck. In a traditional slapshot the player uses body weight to bend the stick, storing energy in it like a spring. This bending of the stick gives the slapshot its amazing speed. On the backhand, less power can be generated because of the awkwardness of the motion and far less bend can be imparted to the stick. #When the rear of the stick blade strikes the puck, the player rolls their wrists and shifts weight so that the energy stored in the stick is released through the puck. On the backhand (as opposed to a traditional slapshot from the forehand), energy transfer is less efficient through the wrists and forearms. #Finally, the player follows through, ending up with the stick pointed towards the desired target. If done properly this shot can take the goalie off guard. The backhand slapshot is weaker than other shots, and because of the violent motion involved and the awkward nature of the swing somewhat less accurate. It also takes longer to execute if the player controls the puck; a player usually cannot take a backhand slapshot while under any significant pressure from an opposing player because the opponent could easily interfere during the windup. The backhand slapshot is most commonly used as a desperation move to shoot or clear a loose puck as a player approaches the puck and when he or she has no time to collect the puck. The invention of the backhand slapshot is credited to no one in particular. A traditional backhand shot (backhand wrist shot) will be much quicker, far more accurate, and nearly always more powerful.

Microbiotal alteration changes carbohydrate metabolism with decreased short-chain fatty acid absorption and an osmotic diarrhea as a result. Another consequence of antibiotic therapy leading to diarrhea is overgrowth of potentially pathogenic organisms such as Clostridium difficile. It is defined as frequent loose and watery stools with no other complications. Cause Clostridium difficile, also known more commonly as C. diff, accounts for 10 to 20% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea cases, because the antibiotics administered for the treatment of certain disease processes such as inflammatory colitis also inadvertently kill a large portion of the gut flora, the normal flora that is usually present within the bowel. With this lower level of \\"healthy\\" bacteria present, the overgrowth of C. diff is then responsible \\"for elaborating the enterotoxin\\". Treatment Meta- analyses have concluded that probiotics may protect against antibiotic- associated diarrhea in both children and adults. Evidence is insufficient, however, regarding an effect on rates of C. difficile colitis. Efficacy of probiotic AAD prevention is dependent on the probiotic strain(s) used and on the dosage. Up to a 50% reduction of AAD occurrences has been found. No side effects have been reported. Caution is advised when using probiotics in immunocompromised individuals or those who have a compromised intestinal barrier because of the risk of an infection caused by the probiotic supplements.

Her May 1988 conviction and prison sentence were the first under federal product tampering laws instituted after the 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders. Early life Stella Nickell was born Stella Maudine Stephenson in Colton, Oregon, to Alva Georgia \\"Jo\\" (n√©e Duncan; later changed her name to Cora Lee) and George Stephenson, and grew up poor. By age 16, Nickell was pregnant with her daughter Cynthia Hamilton. Nickell then moved to Southern California, married, and had another daughter. She began to have various legal troubles, including a conviction for fraud in 1968, a charge the following year of beating Hamilton with a curtain rod, and a conviction for forgery in 1971. Nickell served six months in jail for the fraud charge, and was ordered into counseling after the abuse charge. Nickell met Bruce Nickell in 1974. Bruce was a heavy equipment operator with a drinking habit, which suited her lifestyle, and the two were married in 1976. In the course of their ten-year marriage, he entered rehab and gave up drinking, which Nickell reportedly resented. When her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce's sobriety, Nickell began requesting evening shifts at her security screener job at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, and cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby. Deaths On June 5, 1986, the couple was living in Auburn, Washington when Bruce, 52, came home from work with a headache. According to Nickell, Bruce took four extra-strength Excedrin capsules from a bottle in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later.TruTV's website gives Nickell's date of death as June 6, which contradicts all other sources available, which specify June 5. He died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing emphysema. A second death, less than a week later, forced authorities to reconsider the cause of Bruce's death. On June 11, Sue Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Excedrin capsules for an early- morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work. At 6:30 am, their 15-year-old daughter Hayley found Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and with a faint pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness. Investigation =Initial investigation= During an autopsy on Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller detected the scent of bitter almonds, an odor distinctive to cyanide. Tests verified that Snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning. Investigators examined the contents of the Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities. A murder by cyanide was sensational news in Washington. When another tainted bottle from the same lot was found in a grocery store in nearby Kent, the manufacturers of Excedrin, Bristol-Myers, responded to the discovery with a heavily publicized recall of all Excedrin products in the Seattle area, and a group of drug companies came together to offer a $300,000 reward for the capture of the person responsible. In response to the publicity, Nickell came forward on June 19. She told police that her husband had recently died suddenly, after taking pills from a 40-capsule bottle of Excedrin with the same lot number as the one that had killed Snow. Tests by the FDA confirmed the presence of cyanide in her husband's remains and in two Excedrin bottles Nickell had turned over to police. Initial suspicions were directed at Bristol-Myers. Both Webking and Nickell filed wrongful death lawsuits against the company, and the FDA inspected the Morrisville, North Carolina plant where the tainted lot had been packaged, but found no traces of cyanide to explain its presence in the Washington bottles. On June 18, Bristol-Myers recalled all Excedrin capsules in the US, pulling them from store shelves and warning consumers to not use any they may already have bought; two days later the company announced a recall of all of their non-prescription capsule products. On June 24, a cyanide-contaminated bottle of Anacin-3 was found at the same store where Snow had bought her contaminated Excedrin. On June 27, Washington State put into an effect a 90-day ban on the sale of non-prescription medication in capsules. Examination of the contaminated bottles by the FBI Crime Lab found that, in addition to containing cyanide powder, the poisoned capsules also contained flecks of an unknown green substance. Further tests showed that the substance was an algaecide used in home aquariums, sold under the brand name Algae Destroyer. = Focusing the investigation= With contamination of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having been the source of the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth of the bottle sealed with foil and the lid secured to the bottle with plastic wrap. Both Webking and Nickell were asked to take polygraph examinations. Webking did so, but Nickell, who had started drinking heavily, declined. A lawyer representing Nickell told reporters that she was too \\"shaken up\\" to be subjected to the examination. Investigators' suspicions began to turn to Nickell when they discovered that she claimed that the two contaminated Excedrin bottles that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations. A total of five bottles had been found to be contaminated in the entire country, and it was regarded as suspicious that Nickell would happen to have acquired two of them purely by chance. With investigatory focus turned to Nickell, detectives uncovered more circumstantial evidence pointing to her as the culprit. Nickell had taken out a total of about $76,000Sources vary as to the exact amount. Some cite $71,000, some $75,000, and some $76,000. Gregg Olsen's Bitter Almonds provides $76,000 as the amount, based on actual trial testimony. in insurance coverage on her husband's life, with an additional payout of $100,000 if his death was accidental. She was also known to have, even before Snow's death, repeatedly disputed doctors' ruling that her husband had died of natural causes. Further FBI investigation showed that Bruce's purported signatures on at least two of the insurance policies in his name had been forged. Investigators were also able to verify that Nickell had purchased Algae Destroyer from a local fish store; it was speculated that the algaecide had become mixed with the cyanide when Nickell used the same container to crush both substances without washing it in between uses. Nickell finally consented to a polygraph examination in November 1986. She failed and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further. Concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking, and despite their relative certainty that Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance- motivated murder of her husband - or as a desperate attempt to force her husband's death to be ruled an accident to increase her insurance payout - they were unable to build a strong case supporting arrest. =Breaking the case= In January 1987, Hamilton, now grown, approached police with information: her mother, Nickell, had spoken to her repeatedly about wanting Bruce dead, having grown bored with him after he quit drinking. Nickell, Hamilton claimed, had even told her that she had tried to poison Bruce previously with foxglove hidden in capsules. When that failed, she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide. Hamilton also claimed that Nickell had spoken to her about what the two of them could do with the insurance money if Bruce was dead. Records from the Auburn Public Library, when subpoenaed, showed that Nickell had checked out numerous books about poisons, including Human Poisonings from Native and Cultivated Plants and Deadly Harvest. The former was marked as overdue in library records, indicating that Nickell had borrowed but never returned it. The FBI identified Nickell's fingerprints on cyanide-related pages of a number of the works she had checked out during this period. By the summer of 1987, even Nickell's attorneys acknowledged that she was the prime suspect in the case. Arrest and trial On December 9, 1987, Nickell was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts of product tampering, including two which resulted in the deaths of Bruce and Snow, and arrested the same day. She went on trial in April 1988 and was found guilty of all charges on May 9, after five days of jury deliberation. Nickell's legal team sought a mistrial on grounds of jury tampering and judicial misconduct. One of the jurors had been a plaintiff in a case involving a pill baked into Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. While it was deemed to be a manufacturing error, the defense thought that it involved product tampering, and therefore should have been disclosed during jury selection. However, the motion was denied. Nickell was sentenced to two terms of 90 years in prison for the deaths of Bruce and Snow, and three 10-year terms for the other product tampering charges. All sentences were to run concurrently, and the judge ordered Nickell to pay a small fine and forfeit her remaining assets to the families of her victims. Nickell became eligible for parole in 2018, when she was 75 years old. As of April 2019 Nickell is housed at female-only low security/minimum security Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, California, just east of San Francisco. Her release date is given as July 10, 2040. No parole hearing dates are provided. Appeals and subsequent petitions Nickell continued to maintain her innocence after her trial. An appeal based on jury tampering and judicial misconduct issues was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989. A second appeal, beginning in 2001, was filed by Nickell's new attorney, Carl Park Colbert, based on evidence obtained by private detectives Al Farr and Paul Ciolino, requesting a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense. The appeal was denied, though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence. Nickell claimed that her daughter, Hamilton, lied about her involvement in the case in order to reap the $300,000 of reward money being offered. Hamilton eventually collected $250,000 of that money. Nickell also alleges, among other things, that the evidence actually points to another person as the killer, and that the testimony about various smaller details in the case, such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer, was influenced by promises of payment. FDA regulations After the 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders, new FDA regulations went into effect which made it a federal crime‚Äîrather than just a state or local crime‚Äîto tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case as well as a state murder case, and she was not convicted of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Bruce and Snow continues to exist. In media Seattle author Gregg Olsen wrote about the Nickell case in his 1993 book, Bitter Almonds: The True Story of Mothers, Daughters and the Seattle Cyanide Murders. The case was also featured on episodes of Autopsy, Forensic Files, The New Detectives, Mysteries at the Museum, and Snapped, as well as two episodes of Deadly Women. Nickell's murders are also discussed in the Jodi Picoult novel House Rules, published in 2010. It was also featured in episode 93 of Casefile True Crime Podcast in August 2018. The case was referenced in an episode of In Plain Sight called Kill Pill which aired November 23, 2018 on the Investigation Discovery channel.https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/tv-shows/in-plain-sight/full- episodes/kill-pill A 2000 made-for-TV film, Who Killed Sue Snow?, was to be made about the Nickell case to air on USA Network, but it was cancelled shortly before production began. One factor was strong objections from advertisers, including Johnson & Johnson, owner of the Tylenol brand of painkillers which had been affected by the 1982 Chicago case. Additionally, network executives feared the film would inspire copycat crimes. The film was to have been directed by Jeff Reiner and starring Katey Sagal as Nickell.

Do prosodic domains deviate from syntactic constituent structure? * Is it possible to formally delineate languages from each other?

Psycholinguistics * Language emergence: ** Emergence of grammar * Language acquisition: ** Controversy: infant language acquisition / first language acquisition. How are infants able to learn language? One line of debate is between two points of view: that of psychological nativism, i.e., the language ability is somehow \\"hardwired\\" in the human brain, and that of the \\"tabula rasa\\" or blank slate, i.e., language is acquired due to brain's interaction with environment. Another formulation of this controversy is \\"nature versus nurture\\". ** Is the human ability to use syntax based on innate mental structures or is syntactic speech the function of intelligence and interaction with other humans? The question is closely related to those of language emergence and acquisition. ** The language acquisition device: How localized is language in the brain? Is there a particular area in the brain responsible for the development of language abilities or is it only partially localized? ** What fundamental reasons explain why ultimate attainment in second language acquisition is typically some way short of the native speaker's ability, with learners varying widely in performance? ** What are the optimal ways to achieve successful second- language acquisition? ** Animals and language: How much human language can animals be taught to use? How much of animal communication can be said to have the same properties as human language (e.g. compositionality of bird calls as syntax)? ** What role does linguistic intuition play, how is it formed and how does it function?

McDonough (1872 - 8 July 1947) was a crime boss, bail bondsman, and saloon owner in San Francisco, in partnership with his brother Tom. The McDonough brothers were a wealthy and influential force in San Francisco, dominating much of the underworld from 1910-1941. Together, they were called the \\"King of the Tenderloin.\\"  History  Pete was born and raised in Cow Hollow (now known as the Marina District) of San Francisco. With his brother, Pete grew up to take over the saloon previously owned by his father, located Kearny and Clay Streets. The bar was located close to the Hall of Justice, on Montgomery Street. This led the brothers to open the first bail bondsmen business at \\"the corner,\\" as it was called at the time, in 1896. It is possible that the brothers founded the first modern bail bonds business in the United States, the system by which a person pays a percentage to a professional bondsman who puts up the cash as a guarantee that the person will appear in court. Over time, the business expanded to include a range of services for accused individuals, such as providing lawyers. McDonough also developed a communication system with the police stations, so that his business could quickly respond to new arrests. As explained by FoundSF, \\"Within minutes of an arrest, McDonough's nephew was hailing a taxi to find a judge to sign an OR (order of release) form, and the client was soon free. Naturally, everyone was on the take, and McDonough was raking it in.\\" The brothers were a dominant force in organized labor. They provided bail without charge to striking workers, and he generously donated to the political campaigns of labor leaders. For example, he paid for the bail of striking streetcar workers during the 1906-07 strikes. For this support, the brothers often expected support from organized labor when they were in trouble. McDonough was a product of the post-earthquake Abe Ruef days of civic corruption. During his years as the pre-eminent bondsmen in San Francisco, McDonough was accused of bribery, perjury, suborning witnesses, tampering with judges, bootlegging, corrupting officials, and controlling and paying off police. A 1919 Grand Jury exonerated San Francisco District Attorney Charles Fickert from charges made by John B. Densmore, investigator from Washington, Director General of Employment, in the framing of Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings and for Fickert having conspired with McDonough in the freeing of wealthy defendants. Labelled the \\"fountainhead of corruption\\" by Edwin Atherton in the 1937 Atherton Report on San Francisco police corruption, McDonough was considered the overlord of San Francisco vice, gambling, and prostitution. Furthermore, a grand jury concluded that \\"No one can conduct a prostitution or gambling enterprise in San Francisco with the approval direct or indirect of the McDonough brothers.\\" During prohibition, McDonough spent eight months in the Alameda County Jail for bootlegging and eventually sought a pardon from President Calvin Coolidge. He was jailed again in 1938 for refusing to discuss police corruption before the Police Graft grand jury headed by Marshall Dill. Family McDonough's brother Thomas was born in San Francisco, February 19, 1870, and was educated in the public schools and Sacred Heart College. He became associated with his father in business in 1890, and in 1896 joined with his brother in the bail bond field of endeavor. Thomas married to Mary McDonough, who was born in San Francisco. He was a member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles and the Druids. Sources *Obituary S.F.

It was located at Malchow in Mecklenburg. Size of the Malchow camp The Malchow camp system consisted of ten barracks on the terrain of the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, which each had the capacity to house about 100 women. This meant that the Malchow camp was able to house 1,000 women prisoners. But, by 1945, the camp population had grown to 5,000 women. In the summer of 1943, the camp terrain finally became enclosed by a high fence. The ten barracks that were part of the camp, which was originally used for the construction workers of Ravensbr√ºck, were enclosed by this fence. Conditions and life in the camp Day-to-day conditions in the camp were almost unbearable. The prisoners were forced against their will to stand at attention for roll call, twice a day, like most regular concentration camp prisoners would have to do. The prisoners were guarded under the watchful eyes of the Schutzstaffel (SS) female guards and their German Shepherd Dogs. The SS were very cruel, but probably one of the harshest female guards at Malchow was the SS wardress Luise Danz. She was transferred from the main camp of Ravensbr√ºck to Malchow and became commandant of the camp. She was captured in 1945 and put on trial for crimes against humanity at the Auschwitz trial in Krak√≥w, Poland. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1947, but released due to general amnesty on 20 August 1957 In Malchow, the prisoners barely received anything to eat and were forced to kneel on sharp gravel stones. Body searches and beatings were routine at Malchow. Although residents of the town of Malchow were not allowed to have any contact with the prisoners of the camp, some townspeople provided the inmates with supplies of food. When they were discovered by the SS, they too were imprisoned in Malchow. Aside from starvation and exhaustion, many prisoners also died during many epidemics of diseases such as tuberculosis and typhus. Some types of forced labor that the prisoners had to do were producing mines, collecting nettles from children's playgrounds, cleaning the factory and town, building canals for the hospital of Malchow, and doing horticultural work. Malchow as a transit camp During 1944, when most of the death marches were taking place across Europe, Malchow served as a transit camp for other prisoners arriving from other concentration camps. Eyewitness reports of many Malchow survivors say that a transport of about 1,000 concentration camp prisoners arrived at the camp on 24 November 1944. They had traveled on a death march for several weeks. There, at Malchow, they were brought to Wismar, and placed on barges that were sunk in the Baltic Sea or a nearby river. Liberation of Malchow On 2 May 1945, Malchow, and the rest of Ravensbr√ºck was liberated by the Red Army.

Many of the pre-historic entries come from the 12th-century MS, Rawlinson B 502.Hughes, Early Christian Ireland: Introduction to the Sources, pp. 99-162. However, the real importance of the chronicle is for the period 489-766, 973‚Äì1003 and 1018‚Äì1178. These three fragments survive from the 14th- century MS Rawlinson B 488. The coverage of the period 766 to 973 is lost, but is thought to survive in abbreviated form in the Chronicon Scottorum (abbr. CT). The latter is defective for the period 718 to 804, but as much of its content is derived from the hypothetical Chronicle of Ireland (itself partly derived from the Iona Chronicle), of which the Annals of Ulster (abbr. AU) and Annals of Inisfallen (abbr. AI) are also derived, we have some idea of what the entries contained. Kathleen Hughes postulates that AU and AT diverged from the Chronicle of Ireland sometime before the year 913. The chronicle owes its modern name to Tigernach Ua Bra√≠n (d. 1088), abbot of Clonmacnoise, but this does not mean that he was also its author. A note added to the entry for 1088, the year of his death, in Rawlinson B 488 states that the text was written by Tigernach up to that point. If he was not merely the scribe of the original text copied by the 14th-century scribe, it may mean that he was one of the annalists responsible for the work.Charles-Edwards, \\"Ua Bra√≠n, Tigernach (d. 1088)\\" Notes See also * Irish annals * The Chronicle of Ireland * Gilla Cr√≠st Ua M√°el E√≥in * Chronicon Scotorum References * * Editions * *O'Conor, Charles.

Also, it defines the mapping from each of these encodings to ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode) for each character. Unicode version 3.2 incorporated all characters of JIS X 0213 except for the characters that could be represented using combining characters. Because about 300 kanji are in Unicode Plane 2, Unicode implementations supporting only the Basic Multilingual Plane cannot handle all of the JIS X 0213 characters. This is not an issue for most applications, however. Glyph variants changed by the 2004 edition (click to enlarge). The 2004 edition of JIS X 0213 changed the recommended renderings of 168 kanji.http://kakijun.jp/main/jis2004.html Ten additional kanji were added in JIS X 0213:2004.

He made a fortune in silver mining and was a co-founder of the town of Santa Monica, California. Early life John P. Jones, one of thirteen children of Thomas Jones (1793‚Äì1871) and Mary A. Jones, was born in Herefordshire, England. The family immigrated to the United States and settled in Cleveland, Ohio in 1831. Thomas Jones purchased property, and established himself in business as a marble manufacturer. California Gold Rush In 1849 John P. Jones went to California to participate in the Gold rush. He settled in Trinity County, California where he engaged in mining and farming. He served as county sheriff, and was a member of the California state senate from 1863 to 1867. In 1867 he was the nominee of the Republican party for Lieutenant-Governor.Mitchell Charles Harrison,(1902),Prominent and progressive Americans New York Tribune Comstock Lode Nevada In 1868, Jones moved to Gold Hill, Nevada where he was superintendent of the Crown Point silver mine which was part of the Comstock Lode. When a body of silver ore was stuck in 1870, Jones and Alvinza Hayward acquired shares and were able to gain control of the Crown Point mine. US Senate In 1873 he was elected by the Nevada state legislature to the United States Senate, in which he served five terms from 1873 to 1903. He served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Auditing the Contingent Expenses from 1877 to 1881 and from 1883 to 1893, and as chairman of the committee on epidemic diseases from 1893 to 1903. Jones was involved with the minting of the Twenty-cent piece silver coin. Like many Republicans from the western United States, Jones left the party in 1896 over the issue of bimetalism and joined the Silver Party.U.S. Senate: Senators Who Changed Parties During Senate ServiceNevada‚Äôs Doctrinaire Senator: John P. Jones and the Politics of Silver in the Golden Age. Nevada Historical Society Quarterly 36 (Winter 1993): 246-62. He caucused with the Silver Republicans and later rejoined the Republican Party, but decided not to run for re- election to the Senate in 1902. Jones was a strong proponent of racist immigration policy, arguing on the Senate floor for the exclusion of the \\"tawny and the black races, in order that our own race may be kept intact and uncontaminated.\\"13 Cong. Rec. 1740 (1882). Panamint Silver Mines In 1874, Jones and fellow Nevada senator, William M. Stewart, invested in the Panamint silver mines near Independence, Inyo County, California. Jones planned to build a railroad from the mines to the ocean at Santa Monica. By 1877, the Panamint mines were exhausted and closed. Santa Monica Palisades Park. Jones visited Los Angeles in 1874 and bought a three quarter interest in Colonel Robert S. Baker‚Äôs ranch in Santa Monica. In 1875, Jones and Baker laid out the town of Santa Monica. Jones built the first railroad (Los Angeles and Independence Railroad) from Los Angeles to Santa Monica. Due to financial pressures, Jones was forced to sell the railroad to Southern Pacific in 1877. Santa Monica home, in 1890 Miramar In 1903 Jones retired to his 1889 home, Miramar, in Santa Monica where he continued to oversee his businesses. Shortly before the Senator died, Miramar was sold to King Gillette. Gillette rarely visited the house, and after a brief spell towards the end of World War I as a boys military academy, the estate was sold to hotelier Gilbert Stevenson and it became the Hotel Miramar in 1921. Since then, it has been run by various hoteliers ‚Äî except for during World War II, when the Army Air Corps took over the Miramar and used it as a redistribution center for officers and enlisted men returning from overseas. The mansion was demolished in 1938, leaving as the oldest structure, the six story \\"Palisades\\" wing built in 1924. The Moreton Bay Fig Tree, given to the Jones‚Äô by the bartender in 1889, still stands where it was planted by gardener W.H. Lee. The site is now the home of the Fairmont Miramar Hotel. Family life Jones married the widow Hannah Cornelia (Conger) Greathouse, in 1861, and they had one son, Roy Jones. Hannah died in 1871, and Jones married Georgina Frances Sullivan in 1875.The Nevada Senators's Marriage New York Times, January 12, 1875 They had three daughters, Alice (MacMonnies), Marion (Farquhar) and Georgina (Walton).

They owe their effectiveness to their plier design, which multiplies force through leverage. Lineman's pliers are distinguished by a flat gripping surface at their snub nose. Combination pliers have a shorter flat surface plus a concave / curved gripping surface which is useful in light engineering to work with metal bar, etc. Both usually have a bevelled cutting edge similar to that on Diagonal pliers in their craw, and each may include an additional gripping, crimping, or wire shearing (for a flat ended cut) device at the crux of the handle side of the pliers' joint. Designed for potentially heavy manual operation, these pliers typically are machined from forged steel and the two handles precisely joined with a heavy-duty rivet that maintains the pliers' accuracy even after repeated use under extreme force on heavy-gauge wire. They usually have grips for better handling than bare metal handles; the grips may also provide insulation for protection against electric shock when working with live circuits, although most models are marked as not listed for such use. Some pliers are certified to withstand a specified voltage, e.g. 1000 V. Durability Like most hand tools the durability and useful working life of pliers vary greatly according to load, frequency of use and the specific design and quality of the tool. They may be forged out of alloyed or unalloyed tool steel. For basic quality pliers unalloyed tool steel with a relatively low carbon content of 0.45% may be used. Top-quality pliers are typically made from higher carbon tool steel and alloyed with elements such as chrome, vanadium and molybdenum. In addition to being suitable cutting soft copper and aluminum, pliers may be specifically designed for cutting hardened wire, such as piano wire or nails, by induction hardening of the cutting edges. Typical uses Lineman's pliers are used in the electrical trade to cut, straighten, and bend wire, and also to twist wires together when making splices. Lineman's can be used to strip wire and some types of cable, although wire strippers are more commonly used for this purpose as they can strip wire more quickly without damaging the conductors themselves. They can also be used to pull fish tape through long runs of conduit where the high friction makes it difficult to pull it by hand. Some pliers are equipped with a crimping tool for the purpose of compressing crimp connections. Lineman's pliers can be used to bend or straighten sheet metal components, especially in cases where smaller pliers don't offer enough mechanical advantage. The square nose and flat side of Lineman pliers is particularly useful for creating accurate right angle bends. The durability of these pliers allows them to be used for tasks like removing nails and other types of fasteners. Lineman's pliers are similar to needle- nose pliers: both tools share a typically solid, machined forged steel construction, durable pivot, gripping nose and cutting craw. The main differences are that the slender nose of the needle-nose pliers enable it to form small diameter bends, and position or support items in awkward places. Needle-nose pliers typically have a lower handle/nose length ratio, reducing the force that can be exerted at the tip. Also, needle-nose pliers tend to be available in smaller sizes (for electronics applications, they may be found as small as 1/10 scale of the full-size version). Lineman's pliers may be used to cut steel screws up to #10, and virtually any dry-wall screw, although the thread form will be distorted. Lineman's pliers sometimes include an integrated crimping device in the craw of the handle side of the pliers' joint. Lineman's pliers have a tapered nose suitable for reaming the rough edge of a 1/2\\" or larger conduit, or cleaning sharp metal from the inside of a standard metal knockout in an electrical enclosure such as a junction box or breaker panel. Some brands manufacture pliers (i.e. Ideal) with a narrower jaw, suitable for reaming smaller conduit.

Career Archer was one of the original three animators (along with David Silverman and Bill Kopp) on The Simpsons, Tracey Ullman shorts, and subsequently directed a number of The Simpsons episodes (many of which had John Swartzwelder as an episode writer) before becoming supervising director at King of the Hill. A few years later he left King of the Hill to direct for Futurama, before eventually returning to King of the Hill. Wes continued to supervise the direction of King of the Hill until the final season. He acted as a consulting director for the last season of King of the Hill, as he joined The Goode Family as supervising director. Archer's college animation film, \\"Jac Mac and Rad Boy, Go!\\" has long been a cult classic after receiving repeated airplay on USA Network's Night Flight in the 1980s. He studied at the Film Graphics/Experimental Animation Program at CalArts. He is currently the supervising director on Rick and Morty. Archer's namesake also appears in an episode of King of the Hill (season 3, \\"Death and Texas\\"), in which Peggy is tricked into smuggling cocaine to an inmate on death row. The antagonist of the episode, the inmate, was named Wesley Martin Archer. The name combined both Wes' and his brother and co-worker, Martin Archer.

In this story of twelfth-century life, the nun in question was admitted to the Gilbertine monastery in at Watton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, one of the most successful monasteries of those founded by Gilbert of Sempringham. The girl was admitted at approximately four years of age, at the request of Archbishop Henry of York. Nothing is known about her family, however, the fact that Henry took an interest in her, as well as her stature as a nun at an early age (as opposed to a lay sister) suggests that she was not from the lowest ranks of society. During this time period, the policy of the Gilbertines with respect to accepting children into religious order was less strict than in many contemporary religious orders, including the Gilbertines themselves as a later date. Aelred himself was a Cistercian, and his order took a paternalistic interest in the newly founded Gilbertine monasteries after refusing to assimilate with them because the Gilbertines allowed women in their houses. The Gilbertine Watton Priory was a double monastery with both male and female members, and was the only such house in the diocese of York in the twelfth century. According to Aelred, (1110-1167) the young girl adopted into the monastery grew into a rebellious young woman, who showed little interest in a life of celibacy. She soon made the acquaintance of a lay brother in the attached male community, meeting him when some of the brothers \\"to whom the care of external affairs was entrusted\\" entered the nunnery to do some work. One of these brothers, described by Aelred as \\"more comely than the others in features and more flourishing in age,\\" captured her attraction, and after a series of discreet exchanges, they arranged to meet at night \\"at the sound of a stone\\" which the brother promised to throw onto the roof or wall of the building where she was waiting. After two unsuccessful attempts, the two finally managed to meet. According to Aelred, \\"She went out a virgin of Christ, and she soon returned an adulteress,\\" clearly indicating that their furtive relationship had been consummated following their encounter. The lovers continued to meet secretly, until eventually the other nuns became suspicious of the repeated noise of the stones thrown by the man. The senior sisters challenged the young nun, who confessed to her sins. Aelred then goes on to describe the fury of the nuns who seized and beat the young woman in punishment for her crime. They tore her veil from her head, and were prevented only by the senior sisters from burning, flaying, and branding the young nun. She was then chained by fetters on each leg, placed in a cell, and fed with only bread and water. She was saved from harsher punishments merely by virtue of the fact that she was now pregnant, and perhaps due to apparent remorse for her actions. The male culprit fled from Watton in hopes of returning to secular life, however, his subsequent whereabouts were revealed by the nun. He was then tracked down by several brothers from Watton, who captured him by having one brother impersonate the culprit's lover and lure him in, while the other brothers lay in wait to attack. After the young man was captured, the nuns, filled with religious zeal and with a desire to avenge their injured virginity, engaged in a brutal attack of the offending brother. He was taken by them, thrown down and held while his lover stood by. She was handed an instrument, presumably a knife of some sort, and she was forced to castrate him. At this point, one of the senior sisters snatched the newly severed genitalia and thrust them into the disgraced nun's mouth. Following the castration, the young man was returned to the brothers, and the nun was put back into her prison. Henry Murdac, Archbishop of York, who had brought her to the priory, then appeared to the nun in her sleep, instructing her to confess her sins and recite psalms. He returned to her again following night, just when the nun was about to give birth. He was accompanied by two heavenly women, who took away the baby, and cleansed the young nun's body of sin and pregnancy. This caused her chains and fetters to fall off. The next morning, her caretakers found her healthy, girlish, and distinctly not pregnant. After thorough inspection of her cell, they found no evidence of a birth at all. Additionally, the chains and fetters that had previously held her had fallen off.. After Gilbert was informed of these miraculous events, he consulted Aelred before proceeding. Aelred investigated and declared the event to be a miracle after deciding that she could have been freed \\"neither by others nor by herself without the strength of God\\" and therefore it would be sacrilegious to imprison her again. Aelred fully accepted the authenticity of the events he described, and deemed the miraculous delivery of the child and the freeing of the nun from her fetters to be more important than the preceding acts of adultery and punishment. However, he was also intensely critical of the nun's fellow sisters and of Gilbert of Sempringham himself for their lack of pastoral care. The miracle described in this story introduces both a socially and religiously acceptable method for disposing of an unwanted child, as well as providing a precedent for reconciliation in religious communities after one of its most cherished norms had been shattered. Although at the time, death and other punishments were recognized as just penalties for adultery and fornication, modern chroniclers such as John Boswell and Sarah Salih, have focused on the degree of brutality that these nuns perpetrated on their hapless charge and her unfortunate lover. Boswell's The Kindness of Strangers (1989) provided a Modern English translation of Aelred's original account, and Aelred similarly professed ambivalence about the propriety of the nuns' behaviour toward their charge and her lover, and the apparent absence of pastoral care available to the hapless young woman at the centre of this case. Brian Golding's history of the Gilbertines places the incident in its historical context. It has been suggested that the most remarkable feature of the punishment at Watton was not the beating or the imprisonments, but the castration performance by the woman herself, and the subsequent insertion into her mouth of the severed genitalia. The Freudian interpretation of the story of the nun of Watton describes the castration event as a sign of suppressed desire of the nuns to identify with the culprit, and in particular, an expression of their wish to possess what they all secretly wanted. He called the \\"sadistic and erotico-anal actions\\" of the nuns to be the result of guilt generated by their unconscious temptations. A more conservative interpretation of the punishments describes the reactions of the nuns and canons as being fuelled by a passionate desire to defend the honour of Christ and their monastery. This communal desire arose from the fear that the sin of one of their members would be associated with the entire monastery, and they would all suffer as a result.

The bridge is currently the sole designated exit/entry point for West Bank Palestinians traveling abroad. Being 381 meters (1,250 ft) below sea level, it is the lowest fixed water crossing in the world History In 1885 the Ottoman government of the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem built a bridge at this site.Hamidian Palestine: Politics and Society in the District of Jerusalem 1872-1908 p448 In 1918 British general Edmund Allenby built a bridge over the remnant of the Ottoman predecessor. It was first destroyed by the 1927 Jericho earthquake, when it fell apart and collapsed into the river. It was destroyed again in the Night of the bridges operation by Palmach on 16 June 1946, thus severing one of the main overland connections between Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan. The next destruction occurred during the 1967 Six-Day War, after which was replaced in 1968 with a temporary truss-type bridge. In 1994, subsequent to the Israel-Jordan peace treaty, a new modern paved crossing was constructed adjacent to the older wooden one with the aid of the Japanese Government.  The Allenby border crossing  Since the 1994 Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty, the Allenby Bridge Terminal is operated by the Israel Airports Authority.The History of the Terminal. Israel Airports Authority It serves as a border crossing between the West and East Banks of the Jordan River. The Jordanian authorities recognize the bridge as an international border entry point, but neither grant entry visas to foreign passport holders at this crossing, unlike the country's other border crossings with Israel, nor stamp the passports of departing travelers. Palestinians traveling abroad can use Allenby Bridge to exit the West Bank into Jordan and then use the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman to fly abroad. Travel permits from both Israeli and Jordanian authorities are required, with varied stringency depending on the prevailing political situation. Israeli citizens are not permitted to use the terminal, except pilgrims to Mecca, the Hajj and Omra. Tourists who wish to travel to Jordan may have to be in possession of a visa from Jordan in advance, depending on their nationality. Tourists and inhabitants of East Jerusalem may travel directly to an Israeli terminal, although Palestinians from the West Bank have to start the departure procedure at the special Palestinian border terminal in Jericho city. The Jordanian side of the bridge has a branch of the Bank of Jordan for the exchange of currencies.

It became the country's first manufactury of architectural terracotta in 1889. The production consisted of drain tile, brick, chimney tops, finials, urns, and other economically fireproof building materials. Gates used the facilities to experiment with clays and glazes in an effort to design a line of art pottery which led to the introduction of Teco (pronounced Tƒíƒí - C≈å ) Pottery. American Terra Cotta's records are housed at the University of Minnesota and include original architectural drawings.American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company records, N5, Northwest Architectural Archives, University of Minnesota Libraries, Minneapolis, MN The smooth, micro-crystalline, matte \\"Teco Green\\" glaze of Teco art pottery was developed independently and wasn't an attempt to copy the famous Grueby green. Wares The pottery shapes derived from line and color rather than elaborate decoration. While most of the 500 shapes created by 1911 were the product of Gates' efforts, many of the remaining Teco designs were the work of several Chicago architects that were involved in the Prairie School style as expressed by Frank Lloyd Wright. They had rejected the revival styles of American architecture of the 19th century in favor of using wood, stone and clay in simplicity of design. Any ornamentation consisted of geometrical or natural objects which merged gracefully with the form. Teco Pottery became closely linked with this style and the pottery was often an integral part of Prairie School homes Bungalow. Gates retired in 1913 to write for Clay-worker magazine, but returned in 1915. His son Major Gates, a ceramic engineer, invented a pressing machine and tunnel kiln, and also a glaze spraying apparatus called a pulischrometer. In 1918, they acquired Indianapolis Terra Cotta Company. In 1919, a Minneapolis branch opened. Nearing the end of his life, William D. Gates constructed a residence just north of Crystal Lake, Illinois named \\"Trail's End\\" symbolizing his decreasing involvement in the company. After the Crash In October 1929, the Indianapolis branch closed due to the stock market crash. Later, the plant also fell victim to the Great Depression and operations ceased. In 1930, ownership was transferred to George A. Berry, Jr; Gates' attorney. Terra cotta production resumed until 1941. After World War II, they resumed manufacturing structural clay products through 1966. In 1972, TC inc. was formed from a merger of three businesses as production facility of ground engaging tools for construction equipment on the site.

History  During Enver Hoxha leadership (1944-1985) communist Albania was labeled as one of the most repressive countries in East Europe, however, from 1992 under the leadership of Democratic Party several liberalizing reforms had been conducted.  Human trafficking  There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe (see main article: Human trafficking in Albania). The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution.Council of Europe Albania is a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Albanian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticised for not fully complying with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and failing to develop effective measures in witness protection.U.S Department of State,\\"ALBANIA (TIER 2) Albania is a source country for women and children trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor, largely to Greece and Italy, where many victims are then further transited to the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands. Albanian children, especially ethnic Roma and Egyptian, continue to be trafficked externally for forced begging. Regional and international experts consider Albania to have significantly decreased as a transit country for trafficking in Western Europe. The Government of Albania does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government remained committed to monitoring and preventing trafficking at the country's main ports and produced successful interdictions. However, implementation of Albania's anti- trafficking tools remained inadequate and a critical area of concern. Greater, proactive steps in the areas of protection and reintegration are needed to ensure the safety of victims. The government must apply available laws and programs, in addition to improving prevention for vulnerable groups. Trafficking-related corruption must also be addressed. ;Prosecution In 2004, the Government of Albania continued to arrest, prosecute, and convict traffickers. Its courts prosecuted 132 traffickers and handed down 121 convictions. Commendably, over half of the sentences during the reporting period were over five years in length and 30 traffickers were sentenced to more than ten years' imprisonment. In September 2004, the government adopted legislation that includes broad civil asset forfeiture provisions, requiring the accused trafficker to prove the legitimacy of sources of wealth. Prosecutors, however, had yet to employ the forfeiture provisions. Serious resource constraints and corruption among government officials continued to hamper anti-trafficking efforts. The government continued to investigate police involvement in trafficking; in 2004, four police officers were investigated for offenses related to trafficking. The government did not prosecute or convict any officials for trafficking complicity during the reporting period. ;Protection The government provided some facilities and personnel to assist trafficking victims, and operates its own National Reception Center; NGOs have two additional shelters. The government has begun work on a national referral mechanism involving law enforcement, social services, and NGO partners to improve the initial identification, reception, protection, and reintegration procedures for returnee victims. Police slightly increased the number of ad hoc referrals made to shelters in Albania via IOM and NGOs. Police referred 274 victims to the Vatra Center, a leading NGO in Albania providing shelter and reintegration services to victims. Notably, a number of police directorates opened their own temporary shelters to accommodate trafficking victims. However, regulations necessary for the implementation of witness-protection measures adopted in 2003 have yet to be finalized. In 2004, the Government of Albania established a witness relocation program and adopted special witness protection provisions allowing for endangered witnesses in trafficking cases to testify via remote video link. The program remains unfunded. ;Prevention In 2004, the government conducted few prevention programs, and continued to reply primarily on NGOs and international organizations to carry out such activities. The Ministry of Education began to incorporate prevention activities into school curricula. In 2004, the government adopted a newly improved Strategic Framework and National Action Plan that outlines a comprehensive and targeted approach to trafficking. However, few aspects of the plan have been funded or initiated. In February 2005, the government also finalized its Child Trafficking Strategy and Action Plan. \\"  Torture and Death by the Authorities Since the beginning of 1994, Amnesty International has received reports of incidents in which members of the Albanian police are alleged to have ill-treated people during arrest or detention, some even died due to this treatment. Detainees are reported frequently to have suffered injuries, such as bruising, broken teeth or cuts which have needed medical treatment or even admission to hospital. Some cases of ill-treatment have amounted to torture. Many of these violations have been directed at members or supporters of the Socialist Party (the renamed communist party). Other victims include homosexuals, members of the Greek minority and former political prisoners. Prosecution of police officers for torture or ill-treatment appears to be rare.ALBANIA: FAILURE TO END POLICE ILL-TREATMENT AND DEATHS IN CUSTODY Also, Amnesty International mention that torture and ill-treatment of detainees are common in Albania even today.ALBANIA HUMAN RIGHTS  Violence and discrimination against women  Nearly 60% of women in rural areas suffer physical or psychological violence and nearly 8% are victims of sexual violence. Protection orders are often violated. In 2014 the Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reported that the number of female murder victims is still high. The Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination has raised concerns regarding the family registration law that discriminates against women. As a result heads of households, who are overwhelmingly men have the right to change family residency without their partners‚Äô permission.  Violence against children  In 2015 UNICEF reported that 77% of children have been subjected to some form of violent punishment at home. Hundreds of children are being forced to beg or subjected to other forms of forced labour within the country and even abroad.  Revenge Attacks  At least 70 families are in a self-imposed confinement due to fear of revenge attacks.  Human rights violations of Greek minority  Human rights in Albania are violated by the Government which have targeted the Greek minority population via police and secret service according to Human Rights organisations. Greek communities have been targeted by development projects and had their homes demolished in alleged ethnic targeting of Northern Epirus Greeks from Southern Albania, where homes are systematically demolished. Also, according to Amnesty International there were cases of mistreatment of members of Greek minority by the authorities. Also, the ethnic Greek minority complained about the government‚Äôs unwillingness to recognize ethnic Greek towns outside communist-era ‚Äúminority zones,‚Äù to utilize Greek in official documents and on public signs in ethnic Greek areas, or to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.United States Department of State ALBANIA 2008 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]United States Department of State ALBANIA 2009 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]ALBANIA 2010 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2011 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2012 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2014 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTALBANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT In 2008, the government inserted several new road signs in the Himara district written in Albanian and English but not Greek. The ethnic Greek mayor of Himara ordered the removal of these signs and the government charged him of destruction of government property. The 2012 USA annual report mention that the emergence of strident nationalist groups like the Red and Black Alliance (RBA) increased ethnic tensions with the Greek minority groups.

Acquired by Fives in 2015, the Bryant product line specializes in the grinding field, building grinding machines with computer numerical control (CNC). Bryant began as an independent machine tool builder. The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company was founded in Springfield, Vermont in 1909.. and was an independent company for its first half century, during which time it was widely known in the machining industries by the colloquial name Bryant Grinder. In 1958, it was bought by Ex-Cell-O Corporation, another machine tool builder, and became a subsidiary. In 1986, Ex-Cell-O and its subsidiaries, including Bryant, were purchased by Textron. In 1988, Textron sold Bryant Grinder to the Goldman Group, a financial investment group. In 2002, Bryant was purchased by Vermont Machine Tool, where it was operated as a division. In 2015, Bryant was purchased by Fives, an international engineering group, expanding its expertise to the design and manufacture of high-precision/high- production inner-outer diameter grinders. Early decades (1910s-1930s) The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company was founded in 1909 by William LeRoy (Roy.) Bryant, one of the machine tool entrepreneurs mentored by James Hartness of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J&L;). Roy Bryant had joined J&L; in 1897, became chief draughtsman in 1899, and was chief engineer by 1905. While working on tooling for chucking lathes, he invented a multispindle grinder for second-operation work, which he patented (). He took Hartness's advice and formed a company to build his grinders, and the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company joined J&L; as one of several firms that made Springfield, Vermont an important center for machine tools and their tooling, such as accessories and cutting tools. (Others were the Fellows Gear Shaper Company and the Lovejoy Tool Company). Hartness helped finance the Bryant venture and was the firm's first president; Roy Bryant afterward assumed the post. According to Vermont Machine Tool, \\"By 1910, a 20,000 sq ft building was built on the current location across the street from J&L.; During the same year, 9 machines were shipped to Ford and Cadillac.\\" The Bryant Company established itself as a noted brand for both internal and external grinding, and (like J&L;) it became an important machine tool builder to the automotive industry. World War I fueled great demand for machine tool builders such as J&L; and Bryant. By 1917, the plant had doubled in size and was running 3 shifts a day. Vermont Machine Tool says, \\"Additional space was rented from J&L; to help produce artillery shells. The war promotion created two new machine models especially for the aircraft industry.\\" During World War I, the Ford Aircraft Division kept 102 Bryant machines busy in its production of the Liberty engine, and Bryant earned such a reputation for accuracy and precision that most of the grinding done on aircraft engines from World War I through the Interwar Period and World War II was performed on Bryant machines. Vermont Machine Tool says, \\"Firmly established in the automotive and aircraft sectors, Bryant began producing machines for the bearing industry.\\" Roy Bryant, a member of ASME and SAE, remained the firm's president and general manager until his death in 1931. He was succeeded in the presidency by E.J. Fullam, then Treasurer of the Fellows Company. The Great Depression brought desperation to machine tool builders, many of which closed down. The strength of the product lines of some companies, including J&L; and Bryant Grinder, allowed them to survive, generally because they were on the forefront of productivity, accuracy and precision, or both. Such firms' survival was helped by exports. For example, the Soviet Union was a large and important customer for many American industrial firms (including Ford and machine tool builders such as J&L; and Bryant Grinder) in the 1920s and 1930s. According to Vermont Machine Tool, Bryant used the downtime created by the Depression to focus on improvements to its machine designs. In various cases, manually controlled machines were made into semiautomatic, hydraulic power replaced pneumatic, and automatic sizing became available as an option. Also during this decade, motorized spindles (rotary axes with their own motors instead of being served power by gear trains or belts) were incorporated. World War II Vermont Machine Tool says, \\"With WWII on the horizon, business was building rapidly. By 1938, sales had tripled and by 1940, the US Ordnance Department requested that Bryant expand the building to 127,000 square feet. By 1942, the workforce grew to 1350 people with 200 of them being women.\\" Like dozens of other companies during World War II, Bryant had a product line that was in such high demand that additional production had to be licensed to another firm. However, production volume of grinders caught up in time for Bryant itself to take on licensed production for other companies. For example, Bryant built some radar units for Raytheon and General Electric. In 1946, Joseph B. Johnson, a longtime Bryant employee (and later a Governor of Vermont), became vice president and general manager. Lend-Lease during World War II was in some respects the peak of export activity, but export would remain central ever after. 1950s and 1960s Business volume surged again with the Korean War. In the mid-1950s, Bryant's expertise in spindles led it to get involved in the computer drum memory business, in which it was successful. In 1958, Ex-Cell-O, based in Detroit, Michigan, purchased Bryant. Vermont Machine Tool says, \\"The Computer Products Division grew very rapidly and was eventually moved to Walled Lake, MI and rolled into another Ex-Cell-O division.\\" With the advent of the Cold War, U.S. trade with the U.S.S.R. was curtailed, although it did continue. But concerns about helping Soviet military strength tended to limit exports of some companies, especially those dealing with advanced machinery (as opposed to commodity goods). For example, Bryant was barred by the U.S. Commerce Department from fulfilling a large Soviet order for grinders in 1960‚Äì61. Bryant remained a strong exporter overall, though, with exports to many European and Asian countries. But continued trade with the Soviet Union would increasingly prompt contention. Bryant's trade with the Soviet Union is an example of what has been criticized by scholars including Antony C. Sutton as the moral dubiousness of corporations from democratic countries trading with those of nondemocratic countries, most especially in dual-use sectors of industry. In 1959 Bryant started developing a computer disc-drive with 39 inch vertical platters http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/memory-storage/ Computer History Museum: Timeline of Memory and Storage 1970s and 1980s Bryant acquired the precision external centerless grinder line from Van Norman in 1972. Bryant's Soviet contracts continued to be controversial that same year. Vermont Machine Tool says of the Lectraline LL3 model, \\"The LL3 was the first CNC multi-surface grinding machine in the world. It was later introduced and demonstrated at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in 1980. The LL1, LL2 and LL4 size machines were soon to follow, giving Bryant the capacity of grinding internal diameters from .040\\" ID's to 88\\" OD's.\\" In 1986, Ex-Cell-O and its subsidiaries, including Bryant, were purchased by Textron. In 1988, Textron sold Bryant Grinder to a financial investment group, the Goldman Group. 1990s to 2014 According to Vermont Machine Tool, the Goldman Group had \\"limited experience in the machine tool industry, which resulted in some difficult times for the company [and its] customers and suppliers. During February of 2002, Bryant Grinder suddenly closed [‚Ä¶], prompting many to speculate that the company would never do business again.\\" In July 2002, Vermont Machine Tool bought Bryant Grinder. In the ensuing decade it operated Bryant with a continuing presence in the CNC grinding market. 2015 to present In 2015, Fives acquired Bryant's technology and intellectual property. The Bryant Grinder range of technologies and services will be legally operated out and developed by the resources (sales ‚Äì engineering ‚Äì assembly ‚Äì field service) of Fives Landis Corp.

Secwepemc√∫ƒ∫ecw, their country, ranges from the eastern Chilcotin Plateau and the Cariboo Plateau southeast through the Thompson Country to Kamloops and the Shuswap Country, and spans the Selkirk Mountains and Big Bend of the Columbia River to include the northern part of the Columbia Valley region. The country's traditional territory covers approximately 145,000 square kilometres. They relied heavily on hunting, trading and fishing to support their communities. The Secwepemc are perhaps the most numerous of the Interior Salish peoples of British Columbia if based upon the numbers who speak their language.Statistics Canada: 2006 Census Their traditional language is Shuswap, known as Secwepemcts√≠n (), which is currently spoken by over 1,600 people. Secwepemcts√≠n is being revitalized by the efforts of organizations such as Chief Atahm School, which offers an immersion program until the ninth grade. In addition, Simon Fraser University now offers a University program teaching students about Secwepemc language as well as culture. The program hopes to focus on learning the language, culture, and traditions of the Secwepemc people. The Secwepemc have always stressed the importance of recognizing their title to the land. In 1910, the Secwepemc Chiefs addressed a memorial to Prime Minister Laurier. The memorial laid out the grievances of the Secwepemc stemming from the previous 50 years of settlement. The Secwepmc people have created a number of organizations, institutions, and initiatives including the Shuswap Nation Tribal Council and Secwepemc Cultural Education Society.

She was born in Calcutta on 24 July 1947, to a prominent Muslim family of the Indian subcontinent.  Family  Her father, the Bhopal-born Ambassador Mohammed Ikramullah, was a senior member of the Indian Civil Service in the Government of British India prior to Partition. He went on to join the Partition Committee of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, later becoming Pakistan's first Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Ambassador to Canada, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom. His last post was as chairman of the Commonwealth Economic Committee. Sarvath's Bengali mother, the Kolkata-born Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, was a writer and one of Pakistan's first two female members of Parliament. Begum Ikramullah also served as Ambassador to Morocco and several times as a delegate to the United Nations. Princess Savrath has three siblings, including the late Bangladeshi barrister Salma Sobhan and the British-Canadian filmmaker Naz Ikramullah.\\"Princess Sarvath on the Education of Women in the Muslim World\\". Arabic News. 1998-12-10. The Princess' paternal uncle, Mohammad Hidayatullah, was Vice-President of India. Her maternal uncle, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, was the Prime Minister of Bengal and the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Her mother's paternal family are direct descendants of the 14th-century Persian Sufi philosopher, Shaikh Shabuddin Suhrawardy. Many of her male and female forebearers, on both sides of her family, were poets, writers and academics. She lived in all the countries that her parents were posted to, but mostly received her education in Britain, and received her bachelor's degree from the University of Cambridge. She first met Prince Hassan in London in 1958, when they were both 11 years old.  Marriage and children  Princess Sarvath married Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, in Karachi, Pakistan, on 28 August 1968. They live in one of the oldest houses in Amman and have four children: *Princess Rahma (born 13 August 1969) *Princess Sumaya (born 14 May 1971) *Princess Badiya (born 28 March 1974) *Prince Rashid (born 20 May 1979)  Career and controversy  Princess Sarvath served as Crown Princess of Jordan for over 30 years. She initiated, sponsored and continues to support many projects and activities in Jordan, mainly in the field of education, in addition to issues pertaining to women and the family, social welfare and health. Much of her work focuses on promoting education about various topics (both locally and internationally), assisting disadvantaged women, encouraging community service and helping people with mental and learning disabilities. Princess Sarvath and her husband continue to represent Jordan at international royal events, such as the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, and the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. In 2013, she rode in the carriage of Queen Elizabeth II at Royal Ascot. There have been tensions between Princess Sarvath and her sister- in-law, Queen Noor. The tensions between the Queen, who wanted her own son Hamzah to be proclaimed crown prince, and the then Crown Princess Sarvath were exacerbated by the matter of succession during the last days of King Hussein's life. According to off-the-record briefings by anonymous palace officials in Amman, a rumour was circulated that Princess Sarvath had drawn up plans for a redecoration of the Jordanian royal apartment before King Hussein had even died of cancer. This allegedly occurred while the King was undergoing chemotherapy in the United States and Prince Hassan was running the country in his place. In contrast, other sources state that the Princess only gave orders for some state apartments to be spruced up in preparation to receive a foreign delegation. Still other accounts imply that only a kitchen was renovated for the visit of Germany's then President, Roman Herzog, who was travelling with his native cook. Some people believe that the Princess' Pakistani roots may have been an obstacle in reference to her husband's accession. Others hold the viewpoint that the succession change had to do with completely different reasons. She received an honorary degree of Doctor of Education from the University of Bath in 2015 to mark her achievements as a longstanding and influential supporter of inspiring young people.

organisation that seeks to create global awareness of the exploitation of workers and environmental abuses as they allegedly relate to the South African wine industry and its practices. Strike-breaking with mechanical harvesters Until the late 1990s, all grapes in South African vineyards were harvested by workers by hand. Workers received low wages, as little as 95 Rands a week, and were housed in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. Workers organised strikes in order to negotiate better pay and housing conditions. Mechanical harvesters were originally brought in as a strike-breaking ploy, however vineyard owners quickly saw their economic benefits for the profitability of their businesses. Each machine replaced 200 workers and could be operated by only one driver. As a result of the introduction of these machine during the last year of Apartheid (1994) thousands of South African workers were left unemployed and homeless. Legacy of the dop system The South African wine industry was also responsible for the \\"dop system\\", which involved replacing partial monetary wages for work with payments of wine. This practice has been illegal since 1961, but was practised until the end of Apartheid. According to an August 2011 Human Rights Watch Report, civil society actors assert that \\"dop\\" payments continue to a limited extent, but they are having difficulties to document it, as farmworkers are reluctant to discuss it, fearing to lose the \\"dop\\" payments. The report documents two farms in the Western Cape that provide farmworkers with wine as partial compensation, and farms giving their workers free wine. The existence of the \\"dop system\\" over a long period has caused the Western Cape's grape-pickers to suffer the highest rate of Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the world. According to research, some 25,000 FAS children are born in South Africa every year. The wine industry does not currently carry any responsibility in terms of addressing these issues. Animal parts in wine Mechanical harvesters are machines that straddle grape vines and through a combination of vibration and suction harvest grapes off the vine. As a consequence of this action, an indeterminate number of insects, reptiles, small mammals and bird's eggs are processed with the grapes as they are turned into wine. Manual labourers claim that since there is no human perception and decision-making in the mechanical reaping process, these creatures end up in a \\"destalking screw\\" where their blood and debris contaminates the wine.South Africa Wine Initiative Website Cape Dwarf Chameleon Of particular concern is the decimation of the Cape Dwarf Chameleon population, a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)-protected species. South African law (ordinance 19 of 1974, 44.1C) states that it is illegal to produce a product with a part of a protected species without the necessary permit. To date the Department of Cape Nature Conservation has issued no such permit to the South African Wine Industry. Thus, advocates for environmental rights claim the use of mechanical harvesters is illegal if their use endangers the chameleon.

It is about 900 to 1,500 light-years away. The bright star Alnitak (Œ∂ Ori), the easternmost star in the Belt of Orion, shines energetic ultraviolet light into the Flame and this knocks electrons away from the great clouds of hydrogen gas that reside there. Much of the glow results when the electrons and ionized hydrogen recombine. Additional dark gas and dust lies in front of the bright part of the nebula and this is what causes the dark network that appears in the center of the glowing gas. The Flame Nebula is part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, a star-forming region that includes the famous Horsehead Nebula. At the center of the Flame Nebula is a cluster of newly formed stars, 86% of which have circumstellar disks. X-ray observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show several hundred young stars, out of an estimated population of 800 stars.

Athletics career Redmond first broke the British record for the 400 metres in 1985 with a run of 44.82 seconds. This record was subsequently broken by Roger Black, but Redmond reclaimed the record in 1987. In 1986, Redmond was a member of the team that won the 4x400 metres relay gold medal Championships. The following year, he was on the team that won the 4x400 metres relay silver medal at the World Championships. At the 1991 World Championships Redmond was a member of the British team that shocked the athletics world by beating the much-favoured American team into second place to claim the gold medal in the 4x400 metres relay. Redmond ran the second leg in the final and, together with teammates Roger Black, John Regis and Kriss Akabusi, ran what was then the second-fastest 4x400 metres relay in history. Injuries consistently interrupted Redmond's career. At the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, he pulled out of the opening round of the 400 metres 90 seconds before his heat because of an injury to his Achilles tendon. Before the 1992 Summer Olympics, he had undergone eight operations due to injuries. =1992 Summer Olympics= Redmond was in good form by the time of the Barcelona Olympics. He posted the fastest time of the first round, and went on to win his quarter-final. In the semi- final, Redmond started well, but in the back straight about 250 metres from the finish, his hamstring tore. He hobbled to a halt, and then fell to the ground in pain. Stretcher bearers made their way over to him, but Redmond decided he wanted to finish the race. He began to hobble along the track. He was soon joined on the track by his father, Jim Redmond, who barged past security and on to the track to get to his son. Jim and Derek completed the lap of the track together, with Derek leaning on his father's shoulder for support. As they crossed the finish line, the crowd of 65,000 spectators rose to give Derek a standing ovation. However, as his father had helped him finish, Derek was officially disqualified and Olympic records state that he \\"Did Not Finish\\" the race.Many cried, many were inspired by the retired athlete.

Redmond's struggle in the 1992 semi-final later became the subject of one of the International Olympic Committee's \\"Celebrate Humanity\\" videos, which proclaimed: \\"Strength is measured in pounds. Speed is measured in seconds. Courage? You can't measure courage\\". In 2008, Redmond was featured in the \\"Go World\\" series of Visa advertisements promoting the Olympic Games. The advertisement highlights his 1992 injury, noting that \\"he and his father finished dead last, but he and his father finished\\", narrated by actor Morgan Freeman. On 10 January 2012, it was announced that his father Jim would be one of the Olympic torch bearers in London for the Summer Games.2012 London Games ‚Äì Derek Redmond's father to carry Olympic torch ‚Äì ESPM.

Retirement from sport Two years after the Olympics in Barcelona, he was told by a surgeon that he would never run again or represent his country in sport. However, after coming to terms with the loss of athletics as a career, he began to turn his attention, with the encouragement of his father, to other sports that he enjoyed. He went on to play professional basketball for the Birmingham Bullets. Redmond formerly served as Director of Development for sprints and hurdles for UK Athletics. In 1994, Redmond won Celebrity Gladiators, and during the third series of Gladiators (1994), he served as \\"Official Timekeeper\\" to Referee John Anderson. Redmond has also served as a commentator for Eurosport, and presented a basketball show on ITV. Redmond raced a motorcycle in the Hottrax Motorsport Racing Club with his team in conjunction with Maria Costello, as Costello Redmond Racing. The team finished second in the 2009 Senior 1000 Tag Endurance championship where three team members raced relay style over a six- hour period at seven national UK circuits. Redmond currently does motivational speaking on the conference circuit, inspiring people with the story of the 4x400 gold medal triumph and his famous ordeal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He currently co-owns a Superbike team. In 2015, Redmond joined psychometric assessment provider Thomas International as their Group Performance Director.

Leak scandal On April 21, 2006, it was reported that a CIA employee was dismissed for releasing classified material. The employee was subsequently identified as Mary McCarthy by the New York Times and other news organizations. Sources said the firing occurred after a polygraph examination indicated the possibility of deception and she subsequently admitted revealing classified information. McCarthy reportedly had leaked information to the Washington Post's Dana Priest on several occasions. Her identity has as yet not been confirmed officially by government sources; however, several CIA spokespersons have talked to the press about the incident. CIA spokeswoman Michele Neff is quoted as saying, \\"This CIA officer acknowledged having unauthorized discussions with the media in which the officer knowingly shared classified intelligence, including operational information.\\"Dafna Linzer, The Washington Post, \\"CIA Officer Is Fired for Media Leaks\\", April 22, 2006; accessed December 2, 2015. On April 24, McCarthy's lawyer, Ty Cobb, told the New York Times that she \\"categorically denied leaking classified information [and] having access to the information attributed to her\\".

The same Newsweek article reported that a \\"counter-terrorism official ... acknowledged that in firing McCarthy, the CIA was not necessarily accusing her of being the principal, original, or sole leaker of any particular story\\". According to David Johnston and Scott Shane of the New York Times, \\"In an effort to stem leaks, the Bush administration launched several initiatives this year [2006] targeting journalists and national security employees. They include FBI probes, extensive polygraphing inside the CIA and a warning from the Justice Department that reporters could be prosecuted under espionage laws.\\"Espionage Act of 1917 is in U.S. Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 37.

These laws carry penalties of up to capital punishment or up to ten years imprisonment, respectively. =Polygraph investigation= The polygraph investigation was part of a large-scale investigation into intelligence leaks. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"In the last several months, the agency has conducted dozens of 'single-issue' polygraph examinations in which senior officers were asked exclusively about contacts with news organizations and disclosures of classified information\\". Some have suggested that the investigations may have been politically motivated. Former CIA officer Melissa Boyle Mahle while appearing on MSNBC's Countdown on April 24, 2006, that many in the agency consider the leak investigation a \\"witch hunt\\". She added that, \\"within the agency, there is no such thing as a good leak. And everybody looks at that pretty much through the same optic. Leaks are bad. Nobody supports it. And if you are caught leaking, you're‚Äînot only are you going to get fired and lose your security clearance, but you're going to lose the respect of your colleagues\\". She observed that Director of Central Intelligence Porter Goss focused on leaks from \\"the first day [he] came over to the CIA\\" and suggests that \\"employees feel targeted\\" by what is widely perceived as a witch hunt.Countdown with Keith Olbermann, NBC News.msn.com, April 24, 2006.Goss himself resigned suddenly on May 5, 2006. News reports claim this move was unrelated to the McCarthy firing two weeks earlier. Associated Press, \\"CIA Chief Goss Leaves CIA in Latest Change\\", yahoo.com, May 5, 2006. On November 14, 2004, Newsday quoted a former senior CIA official on the political implications of Goss's focus on leaks: \\"The agency is being purged on instructions from the White House. ... Goss was given instructions ... to get rid of those soft leakers and liberal Democrats.

Less than two weeks after McCarthy's dismissal, Goss himself was forced out of the CIA, resigning his directorship \\"under pressure\\" on May 5, 2005. =Black sites= On April 21, 2006, NBC reported that the \\"leak pertained to stories on the CIA's rumored secret prisons in Eastern Europe\\", commonly known as black sites.Robert Windrem and Andrea Mitchell, \\"CIA Officer Fired After Admitting Leak\\", NBC News.msn.com, April 21, 2006. The article added that the original Washington Post report, authored by Dana Priest, \\"caused an international uproar, and government officials have said it did significant damage to relationships between the U.S. and allied intelligence agencies\\". Earlier in April 2006, Priest received a Pulitzer Prize for beat journalism for her report on the black sites, a decision that was criticized by some political commentators as Priest refused to identify her sources. Accuracy in Media demanded Priest reveal her sources or return the Pulitzer Prize.Cliff Kincaid, \\"No Evidence for Prize-Winning Story\\" , aim.org, May 1, 2006. A day later the New York Times reported, \\"Intelligence officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the dismissal resulted from \\"a pattern of conduct\\" and not from a single leak, but that the case involved in part information about secret CIA detention centers that was given to The Washington Post\\". McCarthy has denied being the source of that information. Her lawyer denies she even had access to that information. It was reported that some of the information about rendition operations may have been available from unclassified sources. Newsweek reported that \\"Intelligence officials privately acknowledge that key news stories about secret agency prison and 'rendition' operations have been based, at least in part, upon information available from unclassified sources.\\"Coverage of leak scandal , msnbc.msn.com; accessed December 2, 2015. On April 25, the Washington Post reported that McCarthy's leaks had nothing to do with secret prisons: \\"Though McCarthy acknowledged having contact with reporters, a senior intelligence official confirmed yesterday that she is not believed to have played a central role in The Post's reporting on the secret prisons. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing personnel matters.\\" A follow-up story on May 14 by the Washington Post posited that McCarthy \\"had been probing allegations of criminal mistreatment by the CIA and its contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan\\", and became convinced that \\"CIA people had lied\\" in a meeting with Senate staff in June 2005.R. Jeffrey Smith, \\"Fired Officer Believed CIA Lied to Congress\\", washingtonpost.com, May 14, 2006. =Responses and opinions= The response to the revelations in the intelligence community has been mixed. Some former colleagues stressed the illegality and impropriety of leaking classified documents, while others praised the act of alerting the public to possible misconduct within the CIA. Most internal CIA sources requested anonymity. A number of these sources voiced doubts as to whether McCarthy had actually leaked the information. The Washington Post quoted a former senior intelligence official who claimed to have discussed the matter with former colleagues on the previous day as saying, \\"A majority of CIA officers would probably find the action taken [against McCarthy] correct. ... A small number might support her, but the ethic of the business is not to leak, and instead to express one's dissenting views through internal grievance channels.\\" Referring to a senior law enforcement official's comments on the possibility of a criminal prosecution of McCarthy, a Fox News report said \\"if the person admitted to leaking classified information, it would be almost negligent not to prosecute them for breaking the law. Failing a polygraph in and of itself does not qualify a person for prosecution but an admission does.\\"Fox News, \\"CIA Officer Fired for Leaking Classified Info to Media,\\" April 21, 2006, by Bret Baier NBC's Andrea Mitchell commented that the CIA's action may be an attempt to send a message about leaks as well as a broader message about any contact with reporters: > Now they've found someone who was about to retire, and they're sending a > very tough message.

Robert David Steele, a former intelligence officer associated with the open- source intelligence movement, issued a press release praising McCarthy's actions in leaking information, stating that \\"There is absolutely no question that Mary acted in the finest traditions of the Republic, helping reveal and reduce terrible violations of international law and human rights by the CIA.\\" Steele added, \\"Mary McCarthy should accept her firing with pride‚Äîshe served the Republic, and has been fired by individuals who will eventually be censured if not impeached.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for 21 seasons with the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Giants. O'Farrell also played for the Cincinnati Reds, albeit briefly. He was considered as one of the greatest defensive catchers of his generation. Baseball career O'Farrell was born in Waukegan, Illinois where he grew up a Chicago White Sox fan. He signed with the Cubs in 1915 after playing an exhibition game for his local semi-professional team. His first manager was former catcher, Roger Bresnahan, who helped O'Farrell develop his catching skills.Ritter: p. 241. After a season on the bench, O'Farrell was sent to Three-I League where he spent two years before returning to the Cubs for the 1918 season. He served as backup catcher working behind Bill Killefer as the Cubs went on to claim the National League pennant before losing to the Boston Red Sox in the 1918 World Series. O'Farrell went hitless in three at bats during the series. In 1920 O'Farrell caught the majority of the Cubs' games and posting a .248 batting average as, Killefer was injured during the season. He began the 1921 season as backup catcher until August when, Killefer was named the Cubs new manager. O'Farrell had a breakout season in 1922 when he hit for a .322 average along with 4 home runs, 60 runs batted in and a .439 on-base percentage. He also became one of the best defensive catchers in baseball, leading National League catchers in games caught, putouts, assists, baserunners caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage. He became skillful at framing pitches by moving his catcher's mitt towards the strike zone after having caught a pitch, in an effort to influence the umpire to call a strike. O'Farrell had an even better year offensively in 1923, producing career-highs in home runs (12), runs batted in (80), stolen bases (10) along with a .319 batting average. In July 1924, O'Farrell suffered a fractured skull when a foul ball broke his catcher's mask. He had asked a club house attendant to bring him a newer mask however, not wanting to delay the game, decided to continue to play with the older mask when he was struck in the head. He missed most of the season, and lost his job when future Baseball Hall of Fame member, Gabby Hartnett, played well in his absence.Ritter: p. 235. The Cubs decided to keep Hartnett as their starting catcher and traded O'Farrell to the St. Louis Cardinals at the start of the 1925 season for Mike Gonz√°lez and Howard Freigau. O'Farrell experienced the highlight of his career in 1926 when he hit for a .293 average with a career-high 30 doubles, 7 home runs and 68 runs batted in as he helped the Cardinals clinch the National League pennant. He also led National League catchers in games caught and in putouts. In the 1926 World Series against the New York Yankees, O'Farrell produced a .301 batting average but, is remembered for throwing out Babe Ruth trying to steal second base for the last out of the seven-game series as the Cardinals claimed their first-ever world championship. In November, he was voted the winner of the National League Most Valuable Player Award with 79 out of the possible 80 votes. He was the first catcher to win a Most Valuable Player Award. In December , the Cardinals traded their manager Rogers Hornsby to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring while O'Farrell was named player-manager. He led the Cardinals to a second-place finish, behind the Pittsburgh Pirates even though the Cardinals won three more games than the previous season.Eisenbath: p. 254. He only played in 61 games that season because of a sore arm. The owner of the Cardinals at that time, Sam Breadon was unhappy that the Cardinals did not win the pennant, and that O'Farrell was leaving his pitchers in too long during games. He was given a $5,000 bonus to step down and replaced by Bill McKechnie. O'Farrell was traded to the New York Giants for George Harper in May 1928. The trade caught many observers by surprise as, it left the Cardinals without an experienced catcher while the Giants had a surplus of catchers. O'Farrell played as a part-time catcher for the Giants, sharing catching duties with Shanty Hogan during John McGraw's final four years as manager of the club.Ritter: p. 239. He hit for a .306 batting average in 1929 and followed that with a .301 average in 1930. By the 1931 season, the 34-year-old O'Farrell was past his prime as his batting average dipped to .224. In October 1932, O'Farrell was traded back to the St. Louis Cardinals for catcher Gus Mancuso as part of new Giants manager Bill Terry's rebuilding campaign. He spent one season serving as backup catcher to Jimmie Wilson before being traded to the Cincinnati Reds in January 1934. O'Farrell during the 1918 season The General Manager of the Reds, Larry MacPhail, named O'Farrell as the team's player-manager. By July, the Reds had fallen to last place in the National League standings and, on July 27, O'Farrell requested his unconditional release from the team. It was later reported that after the Reds had lost nine consecutive games, O'Farrell was engaged in a conversation with MacPhail when he quipped, \\"Well, you can't win 'em all.\\" A supposedly infuriated MacPhail hired Charlie Dressen as the new Reds manager the following day. In August, he returned to the Chicago Cubs where he worked as a backup catcher to Gabby Hartnett. O'Farrell was released by the Cubs at the end of the year and signed to play with the Cardinals for the 1935 season. He appeared in only 14 games for the Cardinals, playing his final major league game on September 23 at the age of 38, and was released by the Cardinals in December . O'Farrell played two more seasons in the minor leagues with the Rochester Red Wings. In he managed the Bloomington Bloomers before retiring from professional baseball at the age of 41. Career statistics In a twenty-one-year major league career, O'Farrell played in 1,492 games, accumulating 1,120 hits in 4,101 at bats for a .273 career batting average along with 51 home runs, 549 runs batted in and a .360 on-base percentage. He finished his career with a .976 fielding percentage. He led the National League three times in putouts and twice in assists. While with the Giants, O'Farrell caught Carl Hubbell's no-hitter on May 8, 1929.http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1929/B05080NY11929.htm He caught for six pitchers who would eventually be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. After retirement he ran a bowling alley in Waukegan which was open for over 30 years. O'Farrell died in Waukegan at the age of 91.

Aged nine years, Simpson was abducted, raped, and murdered by asphyxiation when Andrew Peter Garforth (born 5 August 1963) drowned her. Garforth pleaded guilty to the crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Abduction and murder On 19 August 1992, Simpson disembarked from her school bus. Her mother, who usually met her at the bus stop, was busy that day and had arranged for Simpson's older brother to meet her and accompany her home, after his bus reached the bus stop. But his bus arrived later than usual and Simpson was not there. Simpson, not seeing her brother at the bus stop decided to start the walk home, which was only a short distance away, and see him at home. Police immediately suspected that Simpson had been kidnapped rather than running away. Suspicion fell on a man who was seen working on his car near where Simpson had gotten off the bus. Over a hundred people began searching the area for Simpson, including police, firemen, State Emergency Service members, and volunteers. On 21 August, police found Simpson's body in a dam at a wildlife sanctuary near her home. Her hands and feet were still bound. Later that day, Andrew Peter Garforth was arrested and confessed to the murder. With her house in sight, Garforth had grabbed Simpson, thrown her in the boot of his car and drove off to a remote dam. Once there, he bound her with wire, raped her, weighted her schoolbag and threw her into the dam's reservoir, where she drowned. According to police, Garforth had participated in the search for Simpson on the day her body was found. Arrest Garforth confessed to the crime after police detained him, showing no remorse for his actions during the confession and court sessions. He pleaded guilty to the murder of Simpson and was sentenced in 1993 to life imprisonment. Justice Peter Newman refused to fix a non-parole period and ordered that Garforth's papers be marked \\"never to be released\\". Garforth appealed to the High Court of Australia, but he was refused special leave.. It is one of two similar cases which were refused special leave. In discussing the meaning of \\"life imprisonment\\" when Garforth appealed his sentence the Judges said, \\"the community interest in retribution, deterrence, protection of children and the community in such situations may so strongly outweigh any regard for rehabilitation that a life sentence becomes the only option.\\" In 1995, Garforth lodged several claims for victims' compensation via his lawyers, relating to alleged assaults which occurred in prison. The claims were later withdrawn after public outrage. Garforth's prisoner status was downgraded upon the recommendation of the Serious Offenders Review Council in 2015, giving him access to prison employment and rehabilitation courses. The council's decision was immediately reversed by Minister for Corrections David Elliott. Aftermath Simpson's parents, Christine and Peter Simpson, joined forces with Grace and Garry Lynch, the parents of New South Wales 1986 murder victim Anita Cobby, to create the Homicide Victims Support Group. The group provides support to the families of murder victims and lobbies for victims' rights. Following the 1988 state election, the NSW Government introduced legislation in 1989 and 1990 broadly aimed at truth in sentencing. Garforth's case was often cited as a test case for the application of the principle of life sentencing and security classification.

The book was written by Suzanne Collins and was published in 2003 as the first book of The Underland Chronicles. It was received well by critics, and was listed as one of New York Public Library's 100 Books for Reading and Sharing. It was featured by the U.S. National Public Radio in 2005. Scholastic has rated the book's \\"grade level equivalent\\" as 4.9 and the book's lexile score as 630L, making it reading-level-appropriate for the average fourth or fifth grader. The novel has been published in several languages and is available as both an audiobook and ebook. Its United Kingdom edition was published under the alternate title Gregor and the Rats of the Underland. Plot summary Eleven- year-old Gregor is left home alone in his family's New York City apartment to watch his sister and grandmother. When Gregor's baby sister Boots falls through an old air duct grate in the building's basement, he dives in after her. The two fall miles below into the Underland: a subterranean world home to humans with near-translucent skin; giant sentient bats, rodents, and insects; and an escalating conflict between the human city of Regalia and the rats' King Gorger. They meet several \\"Underlanders\\", among them the Regalians' crown princess Luxa, her cousin Henry, and the bats who are \\"bonded\\" to them. At first, Gregor wants only to return home, but when he is attacked by two rats during an escape attempt and saved by the Underlanders, he inadvertently brings the conflict between the two groups to a head. It is then that he learns the real reason for the rats' hatred of Overlanders: a mysterious prophecy written by the human colony's founder Bartholomew of Sandwich hints that an Overland \\"warrior\\" will stop an attempt by the rats to take over the underground realm once and for all. The Regalian council believes Gregor to be this warrior, and tries to convince him to undertake the quest mentioned in the \\"Prophecy of Gray\\". Though he sympathizes, Gregor is reluctant to help until he learns a surprising fact: his father, who disappeared unexpectedly over two years before, had actually fallen down into Regalia just like Gregor and Boots and been taken prisoner by the rats. Gregor, his sister, and a group of Regalians go on a journey to rescue Gregor's father and recruit allies for a war against the rats. The quest group is challenged to successfully recruit allies for the Regalians, and then journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and tortured in the personal prison of King Gorger. When the rat king discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals that he has been helping the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and conquer the entire Underland. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force ‚Äî King Gorger and Henry among them ‚Äî off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather than Henry as they fall. When the few remaining quest members make it back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of Henry's treason and death and because Ares has been sentenced to banishment (essentially a death sentence in the Underland) for allowing his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the \\"warrior\\" to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done all they can for his father, Gregor and his family return to the surface. =The Prophecy of Grey= Beware, Underlanders, time hangs by a thread The hunters are hunted, white water runs red. The gnawers will strike to extinguish the rest. The hope of the hopeless resides in a quest. Meaning: The usually uneasy balance of power in the Underland is in flux, with the rats' king planning to launch an attack against the other species in the Underland. The phrase \\"white water runs red\\" refers specifically to how the humans deposit the bodies of two rats who try to kill Gregor into a fast-flowing river beneath the Regalian palace. \\"Hope of the hopeless\\" may be interpreted as a reference to Gregor, who refuses to \\"allow himself to think about the future at all\\", because it makes him sad as he has made rule, thinking if he thinks good thoughts they are never to happen. He made this rule after he lost his father. An Overlander warrior, a son of the sun, May bring us back light, he may bring us back none. But gather your neighbors and follow his call Or rats will most surely devour us all. Meaning: Gregor is an Overlander and the son of another fallen Overlander (thus a \\"son\\" of the \\"sun\\", in multiple ways). He brings the Regalians \\"light\\" (an Underland idiom for \\"life\\") by killing King Gorger and the traitor Henry. The humans ally themselves with the other species of their world, warding off an attack by the rats, who are carnivores and occasionally cannibalistic. Two over, two under, of royal descent, Two fliers, two crawlers, two spinners assent. One gnawer beside and one lost up ahead. And eight will be left when we count up the dead. Meaning: Gregor and Boots; Luxa and Henry; the bats Ares and Aurora; two giant cockroaches named Temp and Tick; the spiders Gox and Treflex; and the evil rat Ripred all journey on a quest to find the \\"one lost up ahead\\": Gregor's dad. Out of the original twelve, Tick, Treflex, Gox, and Henry all die during the quest. The last who will die must decide where he stands. The fate of the eight is contained in his hands. So bid him take care, bid him look where he leaps, As life may be death, and death life again reaps. Meaning: Henry, the last \\"quester\\" to die, decides that he is a traitor to the humans, and seals his fate by failing to notice as Gregor leads him off a cliff. He may be interpreted as controlling the \\"fate of the eight\\" because of his powerful connection with the rats, whom he could have manipulated had he lived. The final line may have many different meanings; among them may be a hint about how miserable Luxa is even though she lives, as Henry was her best friend until he had his life \\"reaped\\". =Characters= Quest Members * Gregor: An ordinary eleven-year-old boy from New York City, is meant to be the warrior mentioned in \\"The Prophecy of Gray\\". He is later bonded to Ares the flier who was betrayed by Henry. * Boots (Margaret): Boots is Gregor's two- year-old sister. She accidentally discovers the entrance to the Underland. She is the only reason they decide to come on the quest. * Luxa: The future queen of the Underland, about the same age as Gregor. Her parents were killed by rats shortly after Henry's. She is bonded to Aurora the flier. * Vikus: The leader of the quest and Luxa's Grandfather. During the quest, he leaves them, and they have to continue the quest without Vikus' advice. * Henry: Luxa's cousin, next in line to the throne after her. He wants to ally with the rats to conquer the \\"weak\\" species of the Underland. He dies chasing Gregor off the edge of a cliff, believing his bond Ares would always come catch him. * Ripred: A gnawer (rat) with deadly fighting skills and intelligence; Vikus asks him to help the quest group into the rats' domain. Ripred in the later books teaches Gregor to learn how to use echolocation. * Temp: One of two crawlers (cockroaches) to join the quest. He is one of the first crawlers who encounters Boots and her brother and befriends the two. * Tick: A friend of Temp who sacrifices herself to save Boots from a group of rats. * Ares: A large black flier (bat) bonded to Henry who chooses to save Gregor rather than his bond when the two fall off a cliff. He does not know of Henry's treachery until after the fact, and so Gregor decides to bond with him to save him from banishment. * Aurora: A flier who is bonded to Luxa. She has a golden coat. * Gox and Treflex: Two spinners (spiders) who help the quest group. * Gregor's dad: Though never named, Gregor's father is an important member of the quest because it is he the group goes to find and rescue. Publication Several editions of the novel have been published since the first in 2003, each with new or adapted cover art. To date, editions have appeared in German, French, Spanish, Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Greek, Dutch, Finnish, and Chinese. Scholastic has also licensed the novel's rights to publishers in several other languages. In 2006 The Chicken House produced yet another edition, distributed in the UK by Gardners Books. This edition was published under the alternate title Gregor and the Rats of the Underland. The novel was available as an ebook as early as 2010, and as part of a boxed set. An audiobook edition was published December 13, 2005, read by actor and narrator Paul Boehmer. School Library Journal called it \\"an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre.\\" Common Sense Media gave it a 5/5 and credited the book's \\"strong characters, vivid descriptions, flawless pacing, breathless excitement, laughs and scares, and a vision that makes this fantasy very different.\\" The book has also been praised for covering political themes, such as war and genocide, while still maintaining an adventurous feeling. Collins herself has stated that \\"she spent hours ... plotting strategic alliances that would make military sense\\" in a way that kept such themes accessible for younger audiences. Publishers Weekly's review of the novel was \\"starred\\", an honor reserved for books of \\"exceptional merit\\". The reviewer stated, \\"Collins does a grand job of world-building, with a fine economy of words-no unnecessary details bog down either the setting or the invigorating story. In her world, a child singing \\"Patty-Cake\\" can change the course of history and a stoic rat can mourn the fact that although he is able to read, he cannot write because he has no thumb. Unlike Gregor who cannot wait to leave, readers will likely find it to be a fantastically engaging place.\\" Despite the mainly positive reviews, the novel has received some negative criticism. One critical review by Children's Literature writer Tina Gregory points out that \\"the novel lacks at certain points necessary descriptive details of the characters and settings. For instance, the descriptions of Regalia, the Underland city, and many of the book's characters should be so distinct that we visualize them.\\" The same School Library Journal review which praised the novel's \\"exciting scenes and cliff-hanger chapters\\" also had this to say: \\"Gregor is not the most compelling figure at first, but as the story progresses he becomes more interesting, maturing through the challenges he faces.\\" Gregor the Overlander was named a Kirkus Reviews Editors' Choice and placed third for the Nutmeg Children's Book Award in 2006 in the intermediate category. It was also nominated for the Kansas William Allen White Children's Book Award, the Pacific Northwest Young Reader's Choice Award, and several other awards. It won the Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award for 2005‚Äì2006 and was the first runner-up for the Texas Bluebonnet Award.

It is only found around sandstone escarpment areas around Sydney, from Ourimbah in the north, Nowra to the south and the Blue Mountains areas to the west. Description Ventral surface, showing strong marbling This is a small species of frog, reaching 30 mm in length. It is characterised by the red \\"T\\" shaped mark on its head. It is dark brown or black above with a red wash or spots over its back, and a red mark near the vent. The sides are a blue-grey and there is a white mark in the armpits and thighs. The ventral surface is very strongly marbled black and white, with a bluish colour in some areas between the black and white. Ecology and behaviour This species is only found around temporary creeks and soaks in sandstone habitats in woodland, heathland and dry sclerophyll forest around the Sydney basin. Males make an ark call from nest sites under leaf litter and rocks, in areas likely to be inundated, generally only after heavy rain. Eggs are laid under leaf litter and tadpoles begin developing inside the egg, the males stays with the eggs in the nest. Once heavy rain floods the nest site the eggs hatch and the tadpoles (already fairly developed) finish their development in the temporary pools. In Sydney it is often found in the same habitats as Giant Burrowing Frogs. This species has declined due to urbanisation around Sydney.

Plot The beautiful Tollea is abducted and taken to Cobra Island, where the Queen is her grandmother. Hava warns the angered Ramu not to go after her, but Ramu sets sail for the forbidden island, with his young friend Kado accompanying him as a stowaway. A panther attacks Ramu, who is saved by a dart from Kado's deadly blowgun. They continue the search for Tollea, unaware that the high priestess of the island is Naja, her twin sister. The queen has ordered Tollea to be forcibly returned to Cobra Island only so she can displace her evil sister. Ramu mistakenly becomes involved with Naja, who falls in love with him. Kado is captured and tortured by the brutal Martok, but refuses to reveal Ramu's whereabouts. Martok proceeds to murder the Queen. When they finally meet, Naja attempts to kill her sister with a spear, but plunges to her own death instead.

Synopsis Jim Doyle (David Wenham) is a maverick mathematician who has devised a formula to predict the fluctuations of the stock market. When he joins O'Reilly's fold, he must first prove his loyalty to the \\"greed is good\\" ethos. Plot [This section is a rough translation from German. It has been generated by a computer. Please help to enhance the translation. It is from the German-language article that is under \\"Deutsch\\" in the \\"languages\\" sidebar.] The CEO of a bank, Simon O'Reily (Anthony LaPaglia), becomes aware of the mathematician Jim Doyle (David Wenham), whose software makes it possible to predict stock market trends. Doyle is hired by O'Reily and supplied with the best computer hardware. He enters into a relationship with his colleague Michelle Roberts, who views O'Reily's business activities critically. Meanwhile, the couple Diane and Wayne Davis, who took out a loan in a foreign currency at the bank, become insolvent. The son of the couple is found dead after a meeting with the deliverer of the eviction notice. The Davises sue the bank on the grounds that they were not informed about the risks of a loan in foreign currency. O'Reily demands a proof of loyalty from Doyle, requiring Doyle to falsely state in court that he was present as an intern in the bank's loan counseling of the Davises and that Wayne Davis was sufficiently informed. That causes the Davises to lose their lawsuit. Doyle informs his boss that a stock market crash would soon occur. Roberts finds out in Doyle's hometown that his real name is not Jim Doyle; the bank had terminated his father's credit, whereupon his father committed suicide. A man who watches Roberts on behalf of O'Reily learns the truth and warns O'Reily. O'Reily wants to stop the bank's stock sale, but right now Wayne Davis breaks into O'Reily's house to shoot him. O'Reily offers him two million dollars if Davis allows him to make a phone call. Davis realizes that it should be a very important call for the bank; He destroys the house's power-box to stop this important phone-call, which is intended to warn the bank of Doyle's plans, and leaves the estate. Stock prices initially perform as expected, but then they rise instead of falling. The bank goes bankrupt after losing $50 billion. Doyle leaves the country. He asks Roberts to come after him before departure, which she refuses. The married couple Davis bring an account statement at an ATM, on the unexpected $727,000 credits - a reference to the opening credits - are. They want to clarify the matter in the neighboring bank branch, but this is one of the numerous branches, which were closed by order of O'Reily. They decide to keep the money.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes scored The Bank at 65% from 36 professional reviews (average rating 5.8/10), but 45% from 11 \\"top critic\\" reviews (average rating 5.5/10). Australian film review site Urban Cinefile's three reviewers summarized the film as \\"favourable\\". The New York Times concluded \\"As far- fetched as the movie is ... conveys an engaging zest for upper-crust mischief. The two stories come together in the hurtling final lap as Wayne confronts Simon in his country house while Jim puts his perfected program into operation. The upshot is a whopper of an ending that is as silly as it is satisfying.\\" The New York Post gave the film 1.5/4 stars, stating \\"Despite a crafty premise and a clever kink in the tale that almost saves it, Connolly isn't dexterous enough to achieve the Hitchockian level of suspense the movie needs.\\" The Los Angeles Times stated \\"Connolly might well have constructed a brisker, more exciting picture with more vivid and involving characters. As it is, the film takes too long to become truly compelling.\\" References External links *The Bank at the National Film and Sound Archive *The Bank at AllMovie *The Bank at Box Office Mojo * * The Bank at Rotten Tomatoes *The Bank at Metacritic *The Bank at Oz Movies Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian films Category:2001 films Category:Australian thriller drama films Category:2000s business films Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films shot in Melbourne Category:Trading films Category:English- language films Category:2001 thriller drama films Category:Films scored by Alan John Category:Films about mathematics Category:2001 drama films ","title":"The Bank (2001 film)"},{"id":"4848050","text":"TV9 is a Malaysian free-to-air television network, launched on 22 April 2006 as a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad.

Channel 9 officially closed on 1 February 2005 to restructure its debts and corporate organisation and due to intense competitions from the other free-to-air television stations in Malaysia during that time. On the same day, Malaysia's largest media corporation, Media Prima Berhad announced its acquisition of 100% equity stake in Ch-9 Media Sdn Bhd and almost completed the company's ownership of all commercial free-to-air television stations in Malaysia. = Renamed as TV9 and early history = Channel 9 was renamed as TV9, with test transmission commenced on Saturday, 1 April 2006 with 4-hour broadcasts from 8:00 pm to midnight daily and airing music videos mostly in Malay. Full launch of the channel began at noon of 22 April 2006 with 13-hour broadcasts from 12:00 pm to 1:00 am daily and a new slogan: Dekat di Hati (Malay for Close at heart). TV9 is available via terrestrial television in Peninsular Malaysia. Since 28 December 2006, it expanded its coverage to Sabah and Sarawak via pay television provider Astro Malaysia. For the first months of broadcast, TV9 did not have its in-house news bulletin, except for Edisi 7 simulcasts from NTV7. TV9 began to produce news bulletins on New Year's Day 2007, under the Berita TV9 (literally: TV9 News) brand. It is currently broadcasting two half-hour editions: a midday edition at 1:00 pm Saturday to Thursday, and its flagship nightly edition at 8:00 pm. On New Year's Day 2010, the channel launched a new tagline, Di Hatiku (At your heart in Malay). = Inclusion of home shopping blocks = Since 1 April 2016 Media Prima included home shopping block CJ WOW Shop, collaboration between them and Korean conglomerate CJ Group, to all of its channels lineup, including TV9. It currently airs on this channel from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm (with buffer periods at 1:00 pm from Monday to Thursday to accommodate Berita TV9 Tengah Hari). Such long periods of teleshopping blocks has make this channel known as a part time TV shopping channel. This block, however, attracted huge criticism by viewers through social media due to overtaking a large part of daytime schedule, previously running mostly reruns, religious programming and children's programming. On 4 March 2018, Friday to Sunday breakfast show Nasi Lemak Kopi O (which formerly occupied the first two hour block of CJ WOW Shop) ended its 10 year run; thus gave the home shopping block a weekend extension. On 5 March 2018, TV9 revamped its programming lineup to solely focus on rural Malay communities in order to reduce viewership. Media Prima did so as part of its television revamp which saw its channels aligning with a specific core audience. Korean and English programmes aired on the channel were then transferred to the NTV7, which also revamped on the same day to serve the \\"Modern Malaysia\\" audience. From 31 December 2018, Media Prima made a major restructuring overhaul among all of its channels, as well as few rumoured job losses. Tanyalah Ustaz and Indonesian dramas were moved to the main TV3 so they can extend CJ Wow Shop's airtime at 6.00 AM to before afternoon news (excluding Friday) and 1.30 PM to 8.00 PM. Reruns of axed TV3 and NTV7 shows were also aired TV9 as NTV7 extended the Mandarin variant of CJ WOW Shop's airtime.CJ WOW SHOP to Extend All-New Mandarin Segments on ntv7  See also  * List of Malaysian television stations * List of programmes broadcast by TV9 (Malaysia)  References   External links  * Category:Media Prima Category:Television stations in Malaysia Category:Television channels and stations established in 2003 Category:Television channels and stations established in 2006 Category:Malay language television stations ","title":"TV9 (Malaysia)"},{"id":"4848054","text":"The All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (, OPZZ) is a national trade union center founded in 1984.  History  Following the decisions of the Polish government declaring the Solidarity trade union illegal, the OPZZ was created on 24 November 1984 according to the 1982 trade union act which made trade union pluralism illegal. The OPZZ inherited all of Solidarity's property, and was part of the pro-government Patriotic Movement for National Revival (Patriotyczny Ruch Odrodzenia Narodowego - PRON). In 1985 it joined the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Until 1990 the OPZZ was tied closely to the Polish United Worker's Party (PZPR). Following the end of communist rule in Poland the federation aligned with various post-communist and social- democratic parties (e.g. Democratic Left Alliance, SLD). In 2006 the OPZZ affiliated to the European Trade Union Confederation and the International Trade Union Confederation. In the summer of 2006, Roman Giertych, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland and a stalwart of the ultra-right- wing and chauvinistic League of Polish Families, voiced his support for the confiscation of OPZZ property and the dissolution of the organization, branding it a mouthpiece of the Social-Democratic Union (SLD) and the heir of the Communist PZPR.  Activities  Seat All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions on Kopernik Street (Ulica Kopernika) in Warsaw, Poland The mission of OPZZ is stated as the defence of social and worker's right of the trade unions. OPZZ has strongly supported the demands of state owned industry sector. The OPZZ is governed by Congress (Kongres), Council (Rada) and Presidium (Prezydium). OPZZ associates 90 nationwide trade union organisations (uniform trade unions and federations) grouped in 12 branches: # Raw materials and power industry # Manufacturing # Education, science and culture # Health care and social insurance # Agriculture and food economy # Construction, forestry, wood industry, environment protection and water economy # Municipal economy # Co- operatives # Trade and services # Transport and maritime economy # Railways # Communication OPZZ also has its internal territorial structures, with territorial range corresponding to the administrative division of the country.

Al Fayfi was repatriated to Saudi custody in December 2006, and completed a rehabilitation program. He then however joined al-Qaeda in Yemen and was in Yemen for two years, where he rose to become one of the top dozen leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In September 2010, he surrendered to Saudi Arabia, and on November 1, 2010, he was reported to have provided information that helped thwart the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot. Career Al-Faifi grew up in Taif and earned a certificate after completing 18 months in the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation. At the age of 22 he worked as a security guard at Taif Prison and then transferred to a prison in Jeddah. Al-Faifi said of his move, \\"I moved to Jeddah because I wanted to join the Al-Ahli club. I used to play football for the prison team in Taif. My friend recommended I move to work in Jeddah so I could be closer to the club which I could join and continue working. However, when I moved to Jeddah, I found out that the period to register new players was over.\\" He was fired from his job at the prison after receiving many warnings for being late. He returned to Taif and was unable to find employment and remained unemployed for four years. It was during this time that al-Faifi's involvement with militants began. He began to go out with \\"friends every day to escape from the daily pressure of finding a job.\\" At first he led a self-described \\"wild-life,\\" but then became more religiously conservative to the extent that he would prevent his siblings from watching television. He listened to taped lectures on the subject of Jihad and then he said he \\"felt like joining a jihad group.\\" He spent the next nine months with a group of friends who showed him videotapes of militant activities in Chechnya. One of his friends arranged for al-Faiafi to travel to Afghanistan by way of Qatar and then Pakistan while his family thought him to have gone to the Eastern Province for employment. Al-Faifi said he had not heard of al- Qaeda at that point and only wanted to train in firearms and then join the Taliban or go to Chechnya. He had been in Afghanistan for nine months when the September 11 attacks occurred. He said he initially thought the attacks were the work of China and then \\"heard\\" that a jihadi group was responsible. After September 11, he described al-Qaeda as \\"emerging,\\" at which point he moved to northern Afghanistan to fight against the Northern Alliance and American forces. He remained there for a month until the bombing of Kabul by Allied forces and then retreated first to Tora Bora and then to Jalalabad. After the month of Ramadan in 2001, al-Faifi and approximately 300 other exhausted and scared fighters, mostly Saudis, walked for four days to the Pakistani border where they surrendered to local tribes hoping to be returned to their home governments. Instead, the militants were \\"sold\\" to the Americans before being transferred to Guant√°namo. Activities in Afghanistan The U.S. military asserted that Al Fayfi was present in Afghanistan following the al-Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001. It asserted Al Fayfi had acknowledged being an armed participant in the Taliban's conflict with the Afghan Northern Alliance in the fall of 2001, but that he denied ever firing his weapon. It also indicated that Al Fayfi had denied ever meeting any al-Qaeda member in Afghanistan, and that he denied attending any Afghan training camps. Al Fayfi said that he decided to go to Afghanistan as a form of repentance, because he had not been a sufficiently observant Muslim, having used drugs, smoked, and not prayed often enough. Al Fayfi's Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 188. American intelligence analysts estimate he was born in 1975, in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia. Summarized transcripts (.pdf), from Jabir Jubran Al Fayfi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal ‚Äì pages 10‚Äì13 = Administrative Review Board = Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. =First annual Administrative Review Board= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Jabri Jabran Al Fayfi's first annual Administrative Review Board, on December 3, 2004. The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. The following primary factors favor continued detention: The following primary factors favor release or transfer: =Second annual Administrative Review Board= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Jabri Jabran Al Fayfi's second annual Administrative Review Board, on February 18, 2006. The memo listed factors for and against his continued detention. =Board recommendations= In early September 2007, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to Gordon R. England, the Designated Civilian Official. The Board's recommendation was unanimous. The Board's recommendation memos were heavily redacted‚Äîtheir actual recommendation was redacted. The Board based its recommendation on assessments from the FBI, the CIA, the United States Department of State and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs. The Board's recommendation memo indicated that it convened twice, on March 3, 2006, and April 28, 2006. The Board concluded that Jabri Jabran Al Fayfi continued to pose a threat to the United States. In the memo where they explained the basis for their recommendation, the Board reported: Repatriation According to the Department of Defense, Al Fayfi was released from Guant√°namo and turned over to the Saudi Arabian government on December 13, 2006, after he promised never to participate in another jihad and said he wanted to return home to Saudi Arabia to take care of his parents and resume his job as a taxi driver. He was released with 15 other Saudis: Muhammed Yahia Mosin Al Zayla, Salim Suliman Al Harbi, Yusef Abdullah Saleh Al Rabiesh, Salman Saad Al Khadi Mohammed, Ibrahimj Sulayman Muhammad Arbaysh, Abdullah Muhammed Abdel Aziz, Anwar Hamdan Muhammed Al-Noor, Salah Abdul Rasul Ali Abdul Al-Balushi, Abd Al Aziz Muhammad Ibrahim Al Nasir, Ziad Said Farg Jahdari, Majed Hamad Al Frih, Bessam Muhammed Saleh Al Dubaikey, Said Ali Abdullah Al Farha Al Ghamidi, Sultan Sari Sayel Al Anazi and Abdul Rahman Khowlan. According to the Saudi government, Al Fayfi was repatriated on December 14, 2006, along with six other Saudis. The seven men were detained, without charge, in Hayer Prison, while Saudi justice officials determined whether they had violated any Saudi laws. =Rehabilitation program= He went through and completed Saudi Arabia's militant rehabilitation program, at the Muhammad Bin Naif Al-Munasaha Center. He was considered \\"low risk\\", and one of a series of test cases to assess whether the program worked. The program seeks to convince its participants through Islamic teachings that al-Qaeda's ideology is wrong. It also offers participants money and supervision through their family that seeks to prevent them from resuming militant activities. Al-Qaeda Fayfi joined al-Qaeda in Yemen at some point after his participation in the Saudi rehabilitation program. He was in Yemen for two years, and rose to become one of the top dozen leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. On February 3, 2009, the Saudi government published a list of 85 \\"most wanted\\" suspected terrorists, that included Al Fayfi. Surrender  On September 7, 2010, Fox News reported that Al Fayfi had recently been arrested in a sweep of suspected militants. A Yemeni official said that security authorities in Abyan province in Yemen had accepted his surrender and taken him into custody on September 9. Yemeni authorities arranged for his return, and transferred him to Riyadh. The Saudi Interior Ministry announced on October 15, 2010, that Al Fayfi had contacted Saudi authorities from Yemen within then-recent weeks during Ramadan to express his regret and readiness to surrender. Interior Ministry spokesman General Mansour al-Turki said that Al Fayfi's case will be administered \\"according to local laws\\", but that he will be given consideration for turning himself in. =Reportedly helped thwart bomb plot= On November 1, 2010, Al Fayfi was reported to have provided information that helped thwart the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot.

It is the 33rd most-widely distributed consumer magazine and the NRA's primary magazine. The magazine has its headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia.  History  Arthur Corbin Gould, an avid shooter and member of the Massachusetts Rifle Association, published The Rifle in 1885 as an effort to focus discussion on the sport of rifle shooting.May 1885, The Rifle The Rifle later changed its title to Shooting and Fishing in 1888, branching out into other outdoor sports. In 1894, while the magazine was titled Shooting and Fishing, Gould attended the National Rifle Association matches held at Sea Girt and was impressed with the level of competition, leading him to write several editorials urging the public to join.Serven (1967), p. 114. This call eventually led to the revitalization of the National Rifle Association and established a Board of Directors to help manage the nationwide organization. A 1922 masthead of Arms and the Man incorporating the previous titles Following Gould's death in 1903, Shooting and Fishing deteriorated. There had been no official connection between the NRA and the magazine, but Gould's prominence in the shooting world had helped establish and lend credibility to the organization as it tried to gain national footing. In 1906, James A. Drain, then Secretary of the NRA, purchased the magazine and renamed it Arms and the Man, becoming its editor and publisher.Serven (1967), p. 138. Two years later, as President of the NRA, Drain moved both the magazine and the NRA‚Äîofficially two distinct entities‚Äîback to Washington D.C. in order to establish closer ties with the political aspects of rifle shooting.Serven (1967), p. 141. Though there was still no explicit tie between the magazine and the NRA, their relationship was extremely close. In 1916, seven years after the end of his NRA presidency, James A. Drain decided to part with the magazine in order to fully devote himself to his law practice, though Arms and the Man had become the top magazine of its kind. At first, Drain tried unsuccessfully to sell the magazine to his former staff writer, Frank J. Kahrs, who had since moved on to Remington Arms, but Kahrs suggested instead that Drain offer the magazine to the NRA, since Arms and the Man had been an unofficial NRA journal. On July 1, 1916, James A. Drain sold Arms and the Man to the NRA for $1. Fred H. Phillips took over as editor, and Kendrick Scofield as associate editor, and, due to Drain's close ties to the organization, though there was a transition in leadership, there was no disruption of publication.Serven (1967), p.180. Following its move into NRA control, Arms and the Man, which had primarily focused on shooting competition results and discussion of rifles, began to expand into hunting stories, ballistics, handgunning, shotgunning and new shooting productsServen (1967), p. 201. In June 1923, the publication changed its name for the fourth and final time to the current title, The American Rifleman. In the aftermath of the name change, the scale of the magazine widened and four influential writers that would help shape the future of both The American Rifleman and shooting sports in general joined: Julian S. Hatcher, Charles Askins, Townsend Whelen and C.B. Lister. Also during this time, Hatcher began his column \\"The Dope Bag,\\" a write-in question and answer column, which still continues today. By 1928, \\"The Dope Bag\\" had grown to 3 staff members, answering over 5000 letters that year. The prominence of rifle shooting, as well as the decision to include all NRA members with free copies of the magazine, helped boost the circulation to over 30,000, making the publication self-sustainable for the first time in its history.Serven (1967), p. 223. Despite the harsh economic climate that caused the Great Depression in the 1930s, American Rifleman only continued to gain readers, eventually reaching a circulation of 56,000 and carrying its first full-color advertisement from the Packard Car Company.Serven (1967), p. 234. During World War II, The American Rifleman Editor Bill Shadel received press credentials from CBS and shipped overseas to cover the European Theateras a War Correspondent for CBS and NRA. His duties were taken over by his associate editors, and The American Rifleman carried articles and interviews by Shadel up until the end of the war.Roberts, Joseph B. The American Rifleman Goes To War (Washington D.C.:1992) p. 135. Also during World War II, the physical size of the magazine had to be cut in half due to wartime paper shortages. Due to the poor quality of paper that was used, The American Rifleman began to rely on artwork more heavily than photography. Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist James T. Berryman was brought in as art director. Following the war, C.B. Lister retained editorship of the magazine.Serven (1967), pp. 248, 251. The American Rifleman continued to develop in scope following World War II. Lee Harvey Oswald killed US President John F. Kennedy with a rifle purchased from a Klein's Sporting Goods ad in the February 1963 issue of American Rifleman. This prompted what the magazine called \\"a wave of anti-firearm feeling\\" and an \\"almost universal demand for tighter controls over the mail-order sales of guns.\\"Alexander DeConde, Gun Violence in America: The Struggle for Control, Northeastern University Press, 2001, pp. 170-2 In 1966, Ashley Halsey Jr. became editor for the magazine, bringing much more focus to the political realm, given the prominence of the bills proposed by senator Thomas Dodd restricting the sales of firearms across state lines. Halsey Jr. was a former writer at the Saturday Evening Post for 18 years, and became known for his prominent editorials and investigative articles. In 1971, The American Rifleman published a special centennial issue that was 168 pages long, by far the largest in the magazine's history. The centennial edition also included the first full-sized, full-color photographs of firearms ever printed in the magazine. Shortly afterward, in October 1973, hunting stories, reviews and tips were spun out into a separate publication, American Hunter, which was operating profitably within two years of its premiere. In 1993, the NRA launched another magazine titled America's First Freedom that specialized in political activism. Content The magazine is typically free with membership in the Association, although discounted memberships with no magazine subscription are available. Each issue contains reviews of different firearms, historical articles about firearms, technical information about reloading, notes from the President of the NRA and a column known as The armed citizen which lists specific events of people defending themselves with a firearm successfully.

Its most visible project was the SS HOPE, the first peacetime hospital ship (converted from the USS Consolation (AH-15)). The SS HOPE was retired in 1974, after sailing to Indonesia, South Vietnam, Peru, Ecuador, Guinea, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Tunisia, Jamaica, and Brazil. On these voyages doctors, nurses, and technical staff provided medical care and training to people in each country visited. In its early years, there was muddling of humanitarianism with other agendas, e.g. business interests and fighting the Cold War. Although not necessarily directed by the CIA, multiple sources report that Project HOPE had been used as a CIA front organization. Charges of \\"shocking\\" American commercialism being exploited abroad by Project HOPE's administration were also levied. Project HOPE has been criticized for these conflicts of interest and noted to be \\"a cautionary tale for development organizations seeking mass appeal now.\\" The SS HOPE was not replaced, and emphasis switched entirely to land-based operations. Today there are organizations in Germany and the United Kingdom, in addition to the original organization in the United States. Project HOPE helps different developing countries in efforts to eradicate infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. They also help educate parents on how to prevent and treat diseases for their children and themselves, and also train health professionals. Project HOPE also sets up village health banks, which give small loans to women so they can improve their health and family's health. The village health banks also educate women on health.

This species is found throughout most of central New Guinea and the Vogelkop region to the northwest in montane forests at altitudes from 1800 to 2150 m.  Etymology  The species' scientific name is Epimachus fastosus. Epimachus, its generic name, means \\"equipped for battle\\", referring to this genus' machine gun-sounding calls. Its specific name, fastosus, means \\"proud\\". For its subspecies, atratus means \\"black\\", ultimus means \\"final\\" (probably referring to this subspecies as the last one discovered for this species), and stresemanni honors the German naturalist, Erwin Stresemann. Description Male specimen of race atratus at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Nominate female specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. As being the second longest bird of paradise species (behind the Ribbon-tailed astrapia), the black sicklebill measures about 110 cm (around 43 inches) in length if the tail is included, and around 24 inches (63 cm) without the tail. The female is around 21 inches (55 cm) in length. The black sicklebill is a very bizarre species of bird of paradise. The male has a black head with a long, silver, slightly downcurved bill (not as downcurved as Drepanornis sicklebills), a bright yellow mouth, scarlet-red eyes which are surrounded by iridescent scaly feathers of typically blue- greenish color that cover most of the front of the face. The rest of the head, including the neck, is jet black. The back is jet black, but is mostly covered with iridescent scale-like feathers with metallic blue color, but can be concluded as greenish-blue in some lights. His wings are black with a less conspicuous bluish iridescence. The greatly exaggerated tail is jet black with a more visible blue iridescence, more notable at the center. On its underside, he has very soft, almost silky brownish-black plumage that ends in relatively elongated flank plumes that extend slightly past the tail, but these plumes are more pronounced in the Brown sicklebill. Typically hidden when perched, the males' most splendid ornaments are two glorious pectoral fans on each side of the breast. These large feathers are almost entirely black, but an outstanding feature is that each feather is intricately tipped iridescent blue-greenish. These fans are used in their courtship displays when they bring them up over their head to form an overall comet shape edged with a stroking narrow, blue line. The female, however, is generically unimpressive. She is an olive-light brown above with more of an orange-brown crown. She is creamy on the belly, which is covered with black barring. She still has a long tail, but not nearly as long as her male counterpart. She differs from the female brown sicklebill by her brown eyes vs. the white eyes of the latter species. The tail is a dull olive. Both sexes have grey-blackish legs and feet. = Call = Long-tailed Sicklebills have very un-birdly calls. The male of this species produces a powerful, far-carrying, bubbling \\"kwit-it kwit-it\\", a characteristic sound in its range. The true unusual call is found in the brown sicklebill (see that species). Listen to call here. = Hybridization = In the wild, the bird has hybridised with the Arfak astrapia to create offspring that were once considered two distinct species, the Elliot's sicklebill (\\"Epimachus ellioti\\") and the Astrapian sicklebill (\\"Astrapimachus astrapioides\\"). Both species are generally viewed by most mainstream ornithologists as hybrids, but a minority of ornithologists believe ellioti may be a valid species. There have also been records of hybrids with the Long- tailed paradigalla (Paradigalla carunculata), Superb Bird-of-paradise (Lophorina superba) and perhaps the Vogelkop Superb Bird-of-paradise (Lophorina niedda).  Ecology and Behavior  = Feeding = Black sicklebills, like many of their relatives, are primarily omnivorous, feeding on fruits, insects and other animal prey. Unlike most mostly frugivorous cousins, it tends to feed on both items at an equal proportion. It typically feeds solitarily, but mixed foraging flocks aren't abnormal. Nominate male specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Note the pectoral fans, which are folded on this specimen. = Courtship and Breeding = Male black sicklebills display anywhere from September to October and February to April. Like nearly all members in Paradisaeidae, they are polygnous, mating with several females in a single season. The male chooses a pole-like, upstanding branch for his display. He may practice for days on end; once he's ready to display, he advertises with his loud call to attract a female. When a female lands on his pole, he fluffs up his pectoral fans to make a comet shape, leaning and bending horizontally. After his intro, he rises upward and perpendicular to the ground and repeatedly rubs the rachides of his flight feathers together to make woodpecker-like beating sounds, all while slowly orbiting around the female's inquisitive face. Once she's been impressed, the two birds copulate. The female tend to all parental duties; she builds the nest, cares for the eggs and chicks. However, as custom with the family, very little is known about the actual breeding process of this species. Subspecies and Taxonomy The Black sicklebill has been classified as Promerops fastuosus, and was first thought to be a species of sugarbird (from the family Promeropidae) upon discovery; of course this was proved false and it now sits in the family Paradiseidae. The \\"long-tailed\\" sicklebills are actually not closely related to the \\"short-tailed\\" birds of the same genus, Drepanornis; they in fact belong to a clade that includes the Paradigalla and Astrapia. Of course, its closest relative is the brown sicklebill (Epimachus meyeri). The black sicklebill has three subspecies: * Epimachus fastosus atratus- the disputed subspecies stresemanni is synonymized with atratus. *Epimachus fastosus fastosus *Epimachus fastosus ultimus  Status and Conservation  With a population estimated around 2,000-10,000 individual birds, the habitat Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, and hunting in some areas for food and its tail feathers, the black sicklebill is declining in a relatively relevant portion of it distribution. It is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and is listed on Appendix II of CITES. References * Frith, C. & Frith, D. (2019). Black Sicklebill (Epimachus fastosus).

In her early years, Blake wrote several novels and for the press. In 1869, she became actively interested in the woman suffrage movement and devoted herself to pushing the reform, arranging conventions, getting up public meetings, writing articles and occasionally making lecture tours. A woman of strong affections and marked domestic tastes, she did not allow her public work to interfere with her home duties, and her speaking outside of New York City was almost wholly done in the summer, when her family was naturally scattered. In 1872, she published a novel called Fettered for Life, designed to show the many disadvantages under which women labor. In 1873, she made an application for the opening of Columbia College to young women as well as young men, presenting a class of girl students qualified to enter the university. The agitation then begun led to the establishment of Barnard College. In 1879 she was unanimously elected president of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association, an office which she held for eleven years. During that period, she made a tour of the State every summer, arranged conventions, and each year conducted a legislative campaign, many times addressing committees of the senate and assembly. In 1880, the school suffrage law was passed, largely through her efforts, and in each year woman suffrage bills were introduced and pushed to a vote in one or both of the branches of the legislature. In 1883, the Rev. Morgan Dix, D. D., delivered a series of Lenten discourses on \\" Woman,\\" presenting a most conservative view of her duties. Blake replied to each lecture in an able address, advocating more advanced ideas. Her lectures were printed under the title of \\"Woman's Place To-day\\" (New York), and had a large sale. Among the reforms in which she was actively interested were that of securing matrons to take charge of women detained in police stations. As early as 1871, she spoke and wrote on the subject, and through her labors, in 1881 and 1882, bills were passed by the assembly, failing to become laws, however, because of the opposition of the New York City Police Department. She continued to agitate the subject, public sentiment was finally aroused, and in 1891 a law was passed enforcing this reform. The employment of women as census takers was first urged in 1880 by Blake. The bills giving seats to saleswomen, ordering the presence of a woman physician in every insane asylum where women were detained, and many other beneficent measures were presented or aided by her. In 1886, Blake was elected president of the New York City Woman Suffrage League. She attended conventions and made speeches in most of the U.S. state and Territories and addressed committees of both houses of Congress and of the New York and Connecticut legislatures. At the same time, she continued her literary labors. She was remembered as a graceful and logical writer, a witty and eloquent speaker and a charming hostess, her weekly receptions through the season in New York having been for many years among the attractions of literary and reform circles. Early years and education Elizabeth Johnson Devereux was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her father was George Pollok Devereux, and her mother was Sarah Elizabeth Johnson. Mr. Devereux was a wealthy southern gentleman, of Irish descent on his father's side. His mother, Frances Pollok, was a descendant of Sir Thomas Pollok, one of the early governors of North Carolina under the Lords Proprietaries. Mrs. Devereux was the daughter of Judge Samuel William Johnson, of Stratford, Connecticut, and a granddaughter of the Hon. William Samuel Johnson, member of the Stamp Act Congress, of the Fourth and Fifth Continental Congresses, and of the Federal Convention, Senator from Connecticut, and president of Columbia College, his father, the Rev. Samuel Johnson, D. D., having been the founder and first president of that university, when it was called King's College. Both Mr. and Mrs. Devereux were descended from the Rev. Jonathan Edwards, D. D. Blake spent much of her early childhood in Roanoke, Virginia. It was Mr. Devereux who called his daughter \\"Lilly,\\" giving her the name she would later adopt as her own. Her father, a plantation owner in North Carolina, died in 1837. His widow and daughters removed to New Haven, where Mrs. Devereux was widely known for the generous hospitality which she dispensed from her home, \\"Maple Cottage\\". Blake studied at Miss Apthorp's School for Girls in New Haven before taking the Yale College course from tutors at home. Her close connection to Yale turned into a minor scandal. She was a renowned belle, who at 16 wrote that she intended to redress the wrongs done to her sex by trifling with men's hearts. Although she abandoned this particular formulation of feminism, the difficulties of expressing her independence within the limited roles allowed by her social station would prove a continuing theme in her life. In this case, Yale undergraduate William H. L. Barnes was expelled for being involved with her in what was called a disgraceful affair.Farrell 2002, pp. 16‚Äì18. The student was an admirer whose affections were too serious. She rejected him and he retaliated with stories implying a sexual relationship. He was punished by the college for impugning her character. In her autobiography, Blake denied that a disgraceful affair had taken place and expressed regret that the student had been expelled. She also noted that the story was not taken very seriously in social circles as she still received offers of marriage. Career =Writer= In 1855, she married Frank Geoffrey Quay Umsted, a Philadelphia lawyer. With him she made her home in St. Louis, Missouri, and New York City. Her first daughter. Elizabeth, was born in 1857; her second daughter, Katherine, was born the following year. Mr. Umsted died in 1859 (after he apparently committed suicide) leaving her with two children to support. She had already begun to write for the press, one of her first stories, \\"A Lonely House,\\" having appeared in the Atlantic Monthly. She had also published Southwold (1859), a novel, which achieved a decided success. The handsome fortune she had inherited was largely impaired, and the young widow began to work in real earnest, writing stories, sketches and letters for several leading periodicals. She made her home most of the time with her mother in Stratford, Connecticut. but spent some winters in Washington D.C. and New York. In 1862, she published a second novel, called Rockford, and subsequently wrote several romances. What generated the most money and fame for Blake, however, was her job as a correspondent in Washington, D.C. during the Civil War. She was contracted as a correspondent for several publications, including the New York Evening Post, New York World, Philadelphia Press, and Forney's War Press.Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 202: Nineteenth- Century American Fiction Writers, s.v. \\"Lillie Devereux Blake\\" Blake's early fiction modeled itself on the popular sentimental fiction of the time, but became subversive. Her stories for popular magazines, published under her own name and various nom de plume, depicted strong female protagonists in standard sentimental plots which reflected her own resistance to the roles that she was expected to fill in her own life. Her later fiction included the realism that she gained from her journalism experience. It also showed a more explicit consciousness of women's issues. Her most famous novel Fettered for Life, or, Lord and Master: A Story of To-Day is an attempt to draw attention to the myriad of complex issues facing women. When the Civil War broke out, she worked as a correspondent for several newspapers, including the New York Evening Post, the New York World, Philadelphia Prost, and the War Press. Blake's detailed and riveting accounts of the unfolding events brought her acclaim and fame. Visiting the White House, she met with President Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson and General Ulysses S. Grant. Blake was the author of the law providing for matrons in the police stations, passed in 1891. She was an avid writer and her writings also included: Fettered for Life (1872), a novel dealing with the woman's suffrage question; Woman's Place To-day (1883), a series of lectures in reply to Dr. Morgan Dix's lenten sermons on the \\"Calling of a Christian Woman\\"; and A Daring Experiment (1894). Blake writing for The Knickerbocker magazine in 1858 told a fictional story of a woman, Melissa, who murdered her tutor who did not return her love, by abandoning him in the cave without a lamp. According to the story, Melissa goes back to the cave fifteen years later to end her misery. Researcher Joe Nickell writing for Skeptical Inquirer magazine explains that this gives \\"Credulous believers in ghosts... confirmation of their superstitious beliefs\\" who tell of hearing Melissa weeping and calling out for her murdered tutor. Nickell states that it is common to hear sounds in caves which \\"the brain interprets (as words and weeping)... it's called pareidolia\\". Nickell does not think that Blake tried to create a ghost story, but the 1858 story was embellished over the years adding that Melissa had died of tuberculosis explaining why they heard coughing in the cave. There have been several versions of the tale. Melissa is pure fiction, but Blake did visit Mammoth Cave with her husband Frank Umsted, \\"traveling by train, steamer, and stagecoach\\". Like other women writers of her time she was expected to show interest in feminine pursuits by demonstrating culinary competence or publishing her own recipes, which she did in The Women Suffrage Cookbook, including one for \\"Last Century Blackberry Pudding\\". =Suffrage= In 1866, she married Grinfill Blake, a wealthy New York merchant, and since that time, made her home in that city. Blake testified before the New York Constitutional Commission of 1873 in support for women's suffrage. Along with Matilda Joslyn Gage, she signed the 1876 Centennial Women's Rights Declaration. She was president of the New York State Woman's Suffrage Association from 1879 to 1890 and of the New York City Woman's Suffrage League from 1886 to 1900. Blake was also the chair of the National American Women's Suffrage Association's Committee on legislative Advice from 1895, when it was founded, until 1899, when it was effectively dissolved by Susan B. Anthony.Yanosky, Ronald. American National Biography Online. American National Biography Online. February 1, 2000. Accessed September 10, 2015. Lillie Devereux Blake (1894) Lillie Devereux Blake (1895) Finally, Blake completely broke ties with the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1900 when Susan B. Anthony, who was retiring as the leader of the organization, selected Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard to succeed her. Blake had withdrawn her candidacy in the interests of harmony. Indeed, Blake and Anthony had for years disagreed on the basic purpose of the women's movement. Anthony wanted to focus solely on suffrage; Blake wanted to pursue a broader course of reform. This split in strategy was caused by a deeper theoretical divide. Blake developed a theory of gender that was radical for her time. She argued that gender roles are learned behaviors, and that women and men shared a common nature. Therefore, women should have the same rights as men in all areas. Anthony and her followers instead emphasized the unique nature of women, their separate sphere, and innate moral authority as justification for their right to suffrage. This conflict, among others that Blake took part in, helps to explain the way she is remembered, or not remembered, in the context of the woman's movement. =National Legislative League= Blake went on to create the National Legislative League. She worked on improving immigration laws for women and furthering equality in society. In addition, Blake helped establish pensions for Civil War nurses and also worked on granting mothers joint custody of their children. She wanted to have women involved in civic affairs and encouraged them to study law in school.Gussman, D. (2004, June 25). Lillie Devereux Blake: Retracing a Life Erased (review). Retrieved September 29, 2020, from https://muse.jhu.edu/article/169964/summary =Push for co-education= She was one of the active promoters of the movement that resulted in the founding of Barnard College. In 1869, she visited the Women's Bureau in New York and soon after, began speaking all over the United States in support of female enfranchisement. She earned a reputation as a freethinker and gained fame when she attacked the well known lectures of Morgan Dix, a clergyman who asserted that woman's inferiority was supported by the Bible. Her lectures, published as Woman's Place To-Day rejected this idea, asserting in one instance that if Eve was inferior to Adam because she was created after him, then by the same logic Adam was inferior to the fishes. P.S. 6 on the Upper East Side of Manhattan is named after her.

It was released in the United States by Lions Gate Entertainment and After Dark Films, and focuses on werewolves. Directed by James Isaac, it stars Jason Behr, Elias Koteas, Rhona Mitra, and Tom Jackson. The film was originally announced for theatrical release on December 1, 2006, but was delayed until August 10, 2007. Skinwalkers marks Lions Gate Entertainment's first collaboration with Constantin Film, which produced such other science fiction/horror films as Resident Evil and Wrong Turn. The visual effects are by effects house Mr. X, and the creature effects by Stan Winston Studio. The film was shot at Century Manor in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. To achieve a PG-13 rating, the production team cut several scenes containing graphic violence ‚Äî the home media release is the uncut version of the film. Plot Two packs of werewolves, divided by principles, are signaled by the moon of the coming of an ancient prophecy. A young boy named Timothy (Matthew Knight) approaches his 13th birthday, unaware this marks the time of his transformation. Timothy has been raised by his grandmother Nana (Barbara Gordon), his mother Rachel (Rhona Mitra), his uncle Jonas (Elias Koteas), his cousin Katherine (Sarah Carter) and Katherine's boyfriend, Adam (Shawn Roberts). His father is said to be dead. Rachel and Timothy have been unaware that the rest of the family are \\"good\\" werewolves who have guarded Timothy and his secret since birth. They know that Timothy is a \\"half-blood\\" who is prophesied to end the curse. But they also know that Timothy's power will put him in danger, for there are other werewolves that revel and embrace their blood-lust and are bent on finding and killing the boy. Four of these werewolves are a motorcycle pack‚Äîleader Varek (Jason Behr), and cohorts Zo (Kim Coates), Sonya (Natassia Malthe), and Grenier (Rogue Johnston), who use a hawk as an airborne spy‚Äîwho track down Timothy in the small town of Huguenot, precipitating the movie's extended chase. Varek discovers the location of Timothy via a video tape which is shown to various \\"good\\" werewolves that he is alive and well. Reaching Huguenot, Varek saw Nana and Timothy and proceeds with a gunfight between his pack against the \\"good\\" werewolves and various townspeople. Adam's father is killed in the gunfight and Nana sacrifices herself to let Timothy and the others escape. Jonas explain the whole situation to both Rachel and Timothy and they are convinced after Jonas and others turn into werewolves at night. The next day, Timothy faints and is sent to a nearby hospital. Varek's gang infiltrate the hospital and attack Timothy. Grenier is killed by Adam while Katherine is being held hostage by Varek. It is subsequently revealed that Varek was Caleb, Rachel's husband and Timothy's father, and his transformation was due to him feeding on humans. After escaping to a safe place, Adam goes off on his own and finds Katherine and brings her back. At sundown, Katherine was discovered to have been forced to feed on humans and kills Adam with his own gun. Just as Katherine is about to attack Timothy, Jonas manages to kill her with a gunshot in the back. They manage to find their next safe place, with Rachel and Timothy hiding in a steel cage while Jonas sets out to ambush Varek, Zo & Sonya. Zo is killed after being trapped and being dropped down from a height. Sonya tries to attack Rachel and Timothy but is shot by Timothy. Rachel then proceeds to finish Sonya off. Varek then tries to kill Timothy but is stopped by Jonas. They get into a struggle and in a bid to win, Jonas feeds on Varek's arm and knocks Varek unconscious. Taken over by the blood frenzy, Jonas attempts to attack Timothy, but is shot to death by Rachel. Varek wakes up and bites Timothy but the clock chimes midnight. He is then struck by Rachel and knocked to the ground. He then transforms back into a human and to his former self, Caleb. It is later revealed that Timothy is the cure via his blood and that they travel around, giving the cure to those who want it. They also fill bullets with Timothy's blood. The film leaves off with Timothy saying \\"For some I am salvation, for the others their destruction\\". Cast *Jason Behr as Varek‚ÄîFormerly Caleb, Jonas's brother and Rachel's husband. Now the leader of the evil werewolves. He turns out to be the father of Timothy. He is cured at the end of the film and reverts to his old normal self. *Elias Koteas as Jonas‚ÄîThe Alpha of the pack sworn to protect Timothy, and father of Katherine. Like the others, he keeps himself restrained on the full moon and wants their curse to finally end.

Release Skinwalkers purchased the American distribution rights and international sales rights to Skinwalkers in 2005 and was selling international rights to the film at the Cannes Film Festival in all territories except Germany. The film was scheduled for release in 2006. The film premiered in Los Angeles and New York on 10 August 2007. The film was not widely released, appearing at its peak on 745 screens during the course of its 2 week run. The film grossed $553,520 on its opening weekend in the US and a total of slightly more than $1 million domestically. The film grossed $2.5 million worldwide. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Skinwalkers is an atrociously-acted project whose unoriginal and ineptly-staged action sequences remind viewers of far better werewolf and action movies.\\" Skinwalkers had no advance screenings for critics, though Lionsgate did provide DVD screeners to those who asked. Maitland McDonagh of TVGuide.com noted that \\"the emphasis is more on conventional action than on man-to-wolf metamorphosis effects and the subsequent beastly mayhem,\\" and said the movie was \\"briskly paced and features a couple of clever twists on genre conventions before getting bogged down\\".TVGuide.com (August 10, 2007): Skinwalkers, by Maitland McDonagh (review) Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said that, \\"Before flagging toward the end to become a second- rate Terminator 2, this Canadian-made action drama sparks an old-fashioned B-movie charge‚Äîit's welcome-to-the-grindhouse all over again with such delicious conceits as a town of werewolf-citizens and a pistol-packing grandma going it gangsta-style\\".Film Journal International (August 10, 2007): Skinwalkers, by Frank Lovece (review) Despite the praise given to the creature effects by Stan Winston, the film received mostly negative reviews. DVD release In Canada and worldwide, the film was released in its uncut form in the theaters and on DVD. In the USA however, the film was edited from an R-rating down to a PG-13 for its theatrical and DVD release. The DVD was released on November 27, 2007. It includes a director's commentary, digital effects comparisons, a previsualization featurette, deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, a making of featurette, and additional Lionsgate film trailers to The Monster Squad, Fido, Fangs, and The Descent.

Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality. Born and raised in Queens, New York City, Trump attended Fordham University for two years and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He became president of his father's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations to building or renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He owned the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice from 2003 to 2015. Trump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise electoral college victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. He became the oldest first-term U.S. president and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist. During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act, but has failed to repeal and replace the ACA as a whole. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed import tariffs which triggered a trade war with China, moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria. Trump met three times with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019. Trump reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic; he minimized the threat, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, and promoted false information about unproven treatments and the availability of testing. A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia. Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump solicited Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, the House of Representatives impeached him in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020.  Personal life  = Early life = 1964 New York Military Academy yearbook photo Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City. His father was Frederick Christ Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants. His mother was Scottish-born housewife Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school. In 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics. Profiles of Trump published in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 erroneously reported that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton, but he had never made the school's honor roll. In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Fordham University and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.  Military deferment  While in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments. In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968 a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve. ‚Äì via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) In October 1968, he was medically deferred and classified (unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency). In 1972, he was reclassified due to bone spurs, which permanently disqualified him from service. = Family =  Parents and siblings  Fred Trump started working in real estate with his mother Elizabeth when he was 15, after his father Friedrich had died in the 1918 flu pandemic. By 1926, their company, \\"E. Trump & Son\\", was active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. It would grow to build and sell tens of thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments. Fred claimed to be Swedish amid the anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II; Donald Trump also claimed Swedish heritage until 1990. Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Scotland. Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens. Trump grew up with three elder siblingsMaryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabethand younger brother Robert.  Wives and children  sworn in as president by Chief Justice John Roberts on January 20, 2017. From left: Trump, wife Melania, and his children Donald Jr., Barron, Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany. In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zeln√≠ƒçkov√°. They have three children, Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984), and ten grandchildren. Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988. The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples. Maples and Trump married in 1993 and had one daughter, Tiffany (born 1993). They were divorced in 1999, and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California. In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They have one son, Barron (born 2006). Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006. = Religion = Trump identifies as Presbyterian. He went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens. In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, which belongs to the Reformed Church. The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to Trump's family until Peale's death in 1993. Trump has described Peale as a mentor. In 2015, after Trump said he attends Marble, the church publicly stated he \\"is not an active member\\" of the church. In November 2019, Trump appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison. = Health = In 2015, Harold Bornstein, who had been Trump's personal physician since 1980, wrote that Trump would \\"be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency\\" in a letter released by the Trump campaign. In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three agents of Trump had removed his medical records in February 2017 without authorization. Statements by White House physicians Ronny Jackson and Sean Conley in 2018, 2019, and 2020 said Trump was healthy overall, but was obese. Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's 2018 LDL cholesterol level of 143 did not indicate excellent health. Trump's 2019 coronary CT calcium scan score indicates he suffers from a common form of coronary artery disease. Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19 on October 2, 2020, and treated with the antiviral drug remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone, and an unapproved experimental antibody drug made by Regeneron. He was discharged on October 5. = Wealth = Trump and wife Ivana in the receiving line of a state dinner for King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1985, with U.S. president Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan In 1982, Trump was listed on the initial Forbes list of wealthy individuals as having a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995. In its 2020 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $2.1 billion (1,001st in the world, 275th in the U.S.) making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president. During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots. When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion; however, FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50 million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million. Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in 2018 that Trump, using the pseudonym \\"John Barron\\" and claiming to be a Trump Organization official, called him in 1984 to falsely assert that he owned \\"in excess of ninety percent\\" of the Trump family's business, to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the Forbes 400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984. Trump has often said he began his career with \\"a small loan of one million dollars\\" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest. In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump \\"was a millionaire by age 8\\", borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime. According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied. The tax department of New York said it is investigating. Trump's investments underperformed the stock market and the New York property market. Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3 million. Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion over the ten-year period, in contrast to his claims about his financial health and business abilities. The New York Times reported that \\"year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer,\\" and Trump's \\"core business losses in 1990 and 1991more than $250 million each yearwere more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years\\". In 1995 his reported losses were $915.7 million. According to a September 2020 analysis by The New York Times of twenty years of data from Trump's tax returns, Trump had accumulated hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in losses, and deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. According to the analysis, Trump's main sources of income were his share of revenue from The Apprentice and income from businesses in which he was a minority partner, while his majority-owned businesses were largely running at losses. A significant portion of Trump's income was in tax credits due to his losses, which enables him to avoid paying income tax, or paying as little as $750, for several years. Over the past decade, Trump has been balancing his businesses' losses by selling and taking out loans against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower (due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. Trump has personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due to be repaid by 2024. If he is re-elected and unable to repay or refinance the debt, the lenders may consider foreclosing on a sitting president, an unprecedented situation. Trump has a total of over $1 billion in debts, borrowed to finance his assets, reported Forbes in October 2020. Around $640 million or more was owed to various banks and trust organizations. Around $450 million was owed to unknown creditors. However, Trump's assets still outvalue his debts, reported Forbes.  Business career  = Real estate = Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan While a student at Wharton and after graduating in 1968, Trump worked at his father Fred's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs. In 1971, he became president of the company and began using The Trump Organization as an umbrella brand. The business had previously used the names Fred C. Trump Organization, Fred Trump Organization, and Trump Organization, (Subscription required to read full article.) but had not had a single formal name. It was registered as a corporation in 1981.  Manhattan developments  Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump, who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70 million in bank construction financing. The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel, and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan. The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization and was Trump's primary residence until 2019. In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan with a loan of $425 million from a consortium of banks. Two years later, the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, and a reorganization plan was approved in 1992. In 1995, Trump lost the hotel to Citibank and investors from Singapore and Saudi Arabia, who assumed $300 million of the debt. In 1996, Trump acquired a vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building. In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors who were able to finance completion of the project, Riverside South.  Palm Beach estate  Mar-a-Lago in 2009 In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump used a wing of the estate as a home, while converting the remainder into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.  Atlantic City casinos  Entrance of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with financing from the Holiday Corporation, who also managed the operation. Gambling had been legalized there in 1977 to revitalize the once-popular seaside destination. The property's poor financial results worsened tensions between Holiday and Trump, who paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control of the property. Earlier, Trump had also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million. Upon its completion in 1985, that hotel and casino were called Trump Castle. Trump's then-wife Ivana managed it until 1988. Trump acquired a third casino in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal, in 1988 in a highly leveraged transaction. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed at a cost of $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990. The project went bankrupt the following year, and the reorganization left Trump with only half his initial ownership stake and required him to pledge personal guarantees of future performance. Facing \\"enormous debt\\", he gave up control of his money-losing airline, Trump Shuttle, and sold his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers. In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana. THCR purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent successive bankruptcies in 2004, 2009, and 2014, leaving Trump with only ten percent ownership. He remained chairman of THCR until 2009.  Golf courses  The Trump Organization began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999. It owned 16 golf courses and resorts worldwide and operated another two . From his inauguration until the end of 2019, Trump spent around one of every five days at one of his golf clubs. = Branding and licensing = Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago After the Trump Organization's financial losses in the early 1990s, it refocused its business on branding and licensing the Trump name for projects owned and operated by other people and companies. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, it expanded this branding and management business to hotel towers located around the world, including Chicago; Las Vegas; Washington, D.C.; Panama City; Toronto; and Vancouver. There were also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia. The Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings. According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than fifty licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59 million in yearly revenue for his companies. By 2018 only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name. = Legal affairs and bankruptcies = Fixer Roy Cohn served as Trump's lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s. According to Trump, they were so close that Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship. In 1973, Cohn helped Trump counter-sue the United States government for $100 million over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices; in 1975 an agreement was struck for Trump's properties to change their practices. It was Cohn who introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government. , Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today. While Trump has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over- leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009. They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties. During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion, but in the aftermath of his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks declined to lend to him, with only Deutsche Bank still willing to lend money. In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. In response, Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairman Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures. In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena, and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply. Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings, arguing that Congress was attempting to usurp the \\"exercise of law-enforcement authority that the Constitution reserves to the executive branch\\". = Side ventures = In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (where they competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit against the organization. Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia. In the late 1980s, Trump mimicked the actions of Wall Street's so-called corporate raiders, whose tactics had attracted wide public attention. Trump began to purchase significant blocks of shares in various public companies, leading some observers to think he was engaged in the practice called greenmail, or feigning the intent to acquire the companies and then pressuring management to repurchase the buyer's stake at a premium. The New York Times found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later \\"lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously\\". In 1988, Trump purchased the defunct Eastern Air Lines shuttle, with 21 planes and landing rights in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. He financed the purchase with $380 million from 22 banks, rebranded the operation the Trump Shuttle, and operated it until 1992. Trump failed to earn a profit with the airline and sold it to USAir. Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, and then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20‚Äì50 percent and more. The proceeds generated by the markups were shared by the owners. The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units. From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002. In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe. After NBC and Univision dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and sold the entire company to the William Morris talent agency.  Trump University  In 2004, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word \\"university\\" violated state law, its name was changed to Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010. In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. In addition, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students. Shortly after he won the presidency, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases. = Foundation = The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988. In the foundation's final years its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014. The foundation gave to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion. Also in 2016, the New York State attorney general's office said the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York. Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved. In June 2018 the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties. In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed all its assets to other charities. In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign. = Conflicts of interest = Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, then the prime minister of Turkey, attended the opening of Trump Towers Istanbul AVM in 2012. Before being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate. According to ethics experts, this measure does not help avoid conflicts of interest, because Trump continues to profit from his businesses. Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend selling the businesses. Though Trump said he would eschew \\"new foreign deals\\", the Trump Organization has since pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. Pending lawsuits allege that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which forbids presidents from taking money from foreign governments. The plaintiffs state that Trump's business interests allow foreign governments to influence him. Previous presidents in the modern era either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts, and Trump is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause. NBC News reported in 2019 that \\"representatives of at least 22 foreign governmentsincluding some facing charges of corruption or human rights abuses such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and the Philippinesseem to have spent funds at Trump properties while he has been president.\\" As president, Trump mocked the Emoluments Clause as \\"phony\\".  Media career  = Books = Trump has written up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics, though he has employed ghostwriters to actually write them. Trump's first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was on the New York Times Best Seller list for 48 weeks. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz. According to The New Yorker, \\"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.\\" Trump has called the book his second favorite after the Bible. = WWF/WWE = Trump has had a sporadic relationship with the professional wrestling promotion WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) since the late 1980s. He was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. = The Apprentice = In 2003, Trump became the co-producer and host of The Apprentice, a reality show in which Trump played the role of a powerful chief executive and contestants competed for a year of employment at the Trump Organization. Trump winnowed out contestants with his famous catchphrase \\"You're fired\\". He later co-hosted The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities competed to win money for charities. = Acting = Trump has made cameo appearances in eight films and television shows. = Talk shows = Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show. He also had his own short-form talk radio program called Trumped! (one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008. In 2011, he was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox & Friends, a role that continued until he became a presidential candidate in 2015.  Political career  = Political activities up to 2015 = Trump and President Bill Clinton in June 2000 Trump's political party affiliation changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in Manhattan in 1987, switched to the Reform Party in 1999, the Democratic Party in 2001, and back to the Republican Party in 2009. In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major work, advocating peace in Central America, accelerated nuclear disarmament talks with the Soviet Union, and reduction of the federal budget deficit by making American allies pay \\"their fair share\\" for military defense. He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.  2000 presidential campaign  In 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election. A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support. Trump dropped out of the race in February 2000.  2012 presidential speculation  Trump speaking at CPAC 2011 Trump speculated about running against President Barack Obama in the 2012 election, making his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011 and giving speeches in early primary states. In May 2011 he announced he would not run. Trump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time. Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump \\"accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world\\" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011. In 2011, the superintendent of the New York Military Academy at the time, Jeffrey Coverdale, ordered the headmaster of the school, Evan Jones, to give him Trump's academic records so he could keep them secret, according to Jones. Coverdale confirmed that he had been asked to hand the records over to members of the school's board of trustees who were Trump's friends, but he refused to and instead sealed them on campus. The incident reportedly happened days after Trump demanded the release of Obama's academic records.  2013‚Äì2015  In 2013, Trump spoke at CPAC again; he railed against illegal immigration, bemoaned Obama's \\"unprecedented media protection\\", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested the government \\"take\\" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers. He spent over $1 million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy. In October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting that Trump run for governor in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship. A poll showed Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen said that he sent letters to the New York Military Academy and Fordham in May 2015, threatening legal action if the schools ever released Trump's grades or SAT scores. Fordham confirmed receipt of the letter as well as a phone call from a member of the Trump team. = 2016 presidential campaign =  Republican primaries  Trump campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, July 2015 On June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States. His campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls. On Super Tuesday, Trump received the most votes, and he remained the front-runner throughout the primaries. After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaignsRNC chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.  General election campaign  Clinton had a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, her lead narrowed in national polling averages. Candidate Trump and running mate Mike Pence at the Republican National Convention, July 2016 On July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Four days later, the two were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention. Trump and Clinton faced off in three presidential debates in September and October 2016. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.  Political positions  Trump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.‚ÄìChina relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the campaign Trump repeatedly called NATO \\"obsolete\\". Trump's political positions and rhetoric are right-wing populist. He supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time. Politico has described his positions as \\"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\\", while NBC News counted \\"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\\" during his campaign.  Campaign rhetoric  In his campaign, Trump said he disdained political correctness and frequently made claims of media bias. His fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. Trump made a record number of false statements compared to other candidates; the press reported on his campaign lies and falsehoods, with the Los Angeles Times saying, \\"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has.\\" His campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive. Trump adopted his ghostwriter's phrase \\"truthful hyperbole\\" to describe his public speaking style.  Support from the far right  According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream. During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists. He retweeted open racists, and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying he would first need to \\"do research\\" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists. Duke himself enthusiastically supported Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has said he and like- minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \\"take our country back\\". After repeated questioning by reporters, Trump said he disavowed Duke and the Klan. The alt-right movement coalesced around and enthusiastically supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration. In August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannonthe executive chairman of Breitbart Newsas his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as \\"the platform for the alt-right\\". In an interview days after the election, Trump condemned supporters who celebrated his victory with Nazi salutes.  Financial disclosures  As a candidate, Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million. Trump has not released his tax returns, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office. He said his tax returns were being audited (in actuality, audits do not prevent release of tax returns), and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them. Trump has told the press his tax rate is none of their business, and that he tries to pay \\"as little tax as possible\\". In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied. On March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150 million and paid $38 million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of the documents. In 2019, the House Ways and Means Committee sought Trump's personal and business tax returns from 2013 to 2018 from the Internal Revenue Service. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to turn over the documents, and ultimately defied a subpoena issued by the committee. A fall 2018 draft IRS legal memo asserted that tax returns must be provided to Congress upon request, unless a president invokes executive privilege, contradicting the administration's position. = Election to the presidency = 2016 electoral vote results On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides. Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote. Clinton was ahead nationwide, with 65,853,514 votes () compared to Trump's 62,984,828 votes (). Obama and president-elect Trump on November 10, 2016 Trump's victory was a political upset. Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a nationwidethough diminishinglead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated. The polls were relatively accurate, but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states. Trump won 30 states; included were Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been part of what was considered a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of an undivided Republican governmenta Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of Congress. Trump is the oldest person to take office as president. He is also the first president who did not serve in the military or hold any government office prior to becoming president. = Protests = Women's March in Washington on January 21, 2017, a day after Trump's inauguration Some rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, both inside and outside the venues. Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially tweeted that these were \\"professional protesters, incited by the media\\" and \\"unfair\\", but later \\"Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.\\" In the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2.6 million people worldwide, including 500,000 in Washington alone. Marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just nine days after his inauguration. = 2020 presidential campaign = Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency. This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one. Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office. In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million, allowing him to begin 2019 with $19.3 million cash on hand. From the beginning of 2019 through July 2020, the Trump campaign and Republican Party raised $1.1 billion, but spent $800 million of that amount, evaporating their formerly large cash advantage over the Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden. The campaign's cash crunch forcing a scale-back in advertising spending. Trump became the Republican nominee on August 24, 2020. Trump's reelection campaign saw declining poll numbers by mid-2020, reflecting dissatisfaction with his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread racial justice protests following the killing of George Floyd. Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, repeatedly warning that the election would be \\"rigged\\" and claiming without evidence that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce \\"massive election fraud\\". When the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service, to allow it to handle the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail. In what The New York Times called an \\"extraordinary breach of presidential decorum\\", Trump raised the idea on July 30 of delaying the election. He has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses. Trump campaign advertisements have focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if his opponent Biden, won the presidency. Trump has repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions during the campaign. Several sources described Trump's campaign message as shifting to \\"racist rhetoric\\" in an attempt to reclaim voters lost from his base.  Presidency (2017‚Äìpresent)  = Early actions = Trump during his inauguration in 2017. From left, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act (\\"Obamacare\\"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Upon inauguration, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his sons Eric and Donald Jr. His daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner became Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the President, respectively. = Domestic policy =  Economy and trade  The period of economic expansion that began in June 2009 continued until February 2020, when the COVID-19 recession began. Throughout his presidency, Trump mischaracterized the economy as the best in American history. In December 2017, Trump signed tax legislation that permanently cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal income tax rates until 2025, increased child tax credits, doubled the estate tax exemption to $11.2 million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000. Trump speaks to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017 Trump is a skeptic of multilateral trade agreements, believing they incentivize unfair commercial practices, favoring bilateral trade agreements as they allow one party to withdraw if the other party is believed to be behaving unfairly. Trump adopted his current skepticism of trade liberalization in the 1980s, and sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign in 2015. He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S. On several occasions, Trump has said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury. Although Trump pledged during his 2016 campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the U.S. trade deficit reached its highest level in 12 years under his administration. Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump as president has approved large increases in government spending, as well as the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the American government's budget deficit has increased by almost 50%, to nearly $1trillion in 2019. In 2016, the year before Trump took office, the U.S. national debt was around $19trillion; by mid-2020, it had increased to $26trillion under the Trump administration. In April 2020, the official unemployment rate rose to 14.7% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was an underestimation of the actual unemployment rate, but still was the highest level of unemployment since 1939.  Energy and climate  Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He made large budget cuts to programs that research renewable energy and rolled back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change. In June 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement. At the 2019 G7 summit, Trump skipped the sessions on climate change but said afterward during a press conference that he is an environmentalist. Trump has rolled back federal regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, water pollution, and the usage of toxic substances. One example is the Clean Power Plan. He relaxed environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, while expanding permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing drilling in the Arctic Refuge. Trump also weakened protections for animals. Trump's energy policies aimed to boost the production and exports of coal, oil, and natural gas. Deregulation  During his presidency, Trump has dismantled many federal regulations on health, labor, and the environment, among other topics. Trump signed 15 Congressional Review Act resolutions repealing federal regulations, becoming the second president to sign a CRA resolution, and the first president to sign more than one CRA resolution. During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations. On January 30, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed that for every new regulation administrative agencies issue \\"at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination\\". Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well- organized, well-funded interest groups.  Health care  During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and shortly after taking office, Trump urged Congress to do so. In May 2017, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to repeal the ACA in a party-line vote, but repeal proposals were narrowly voted down in the Senate after three Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing it. Trump scaled back the implementation of the ACA through Executive Orders 13765 and 13813. Trump has expressed a desire to \\"let Obamacare fail\\"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment. The 2017 tax bill signed by Trump effectively repealed the ACA's individual health insurance mandate in 2019, and a budget bill Trump signed in 2019 repealed the Cadillac plan tax, medical device tax, and tanning tax. As president, Trump has falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA; in fact, the Trump administration has joined a lawsuit seeking to strike down the entire ACA, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions. If successful, the lawsuit would eliminate health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans. As a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020 he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.  Social issues  Trump favored modifying the 2016 Republican platform opposing abortion, to allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother. He has said he is committed to appointing \\"pro-life\\" justices, pledging in 2016 to appoint justices who would \\"automatically\\" overturn Roe v. Wade. He says he personally supports \\"traditional marriage\\" but considers the nationwide legality of same- sex marriage a \\"settled\\" issue. Despite the statement by Trump and the White House saying they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people, in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people. Trump says he is opposed to gun control in general, although his views have shifted over time. After several mass shootings during his term, Trump initially said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but abandoned the idea in November 2019. The Trump administration has taken an anti-marijuana position, revoking Obama-era policies that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana. Trump favors capital punishment, Under Trump, the first federal execution in 17 years took place. Five more federal prisoners were executed, making the total number of federal executions under Trump higher than all of his predecessors combined going back to 1963. In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of waterboarding and \\"a hell of a lot worse\\" methods, but later apparently recanted, at least partially, his support for torture, due to the opposition of Defense Secretary James Mattis.  Pardons and commutations  In 2017, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff who was convicted of contempt of court for disobeying a court order to halt the racial profiling of Latinos. In March 2018, he pardoned former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of a submarine. In April 2018, Trump pardoned Scooter Libby, a political aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Libby had been convicted of obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements to the FBI. In June 2018 he pardoned conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who had made illegal political campaign contributions. That month he also commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a non-violent drug trafficking offender, following a request by celebrity Kim Kardashian. In February 2020, Trump pardoned white-collar criminals Michael Milken, Bernard Kerik, and Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., and commuted former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich's 14-year corruption sentence. In July 2020, Trump commuted the 40-month sentence for his friend and adviser Roger Stone, who had been soon due to report to prison for covering up for Trump during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections.  Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op  On June 1, 2020, federal law enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets, pepper spray projectiles, stun grenades, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from Lafayette Square, outside the White House. The removal had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr. Trump then walked to St. John's Episcopal Church. He posed for photographs holding a Bible, with Cabinet members and other officials later joining him in photos. Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself. Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against the protesters. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark A. Milley, later apologized for accompanying Trump on the walk and thereby \\"creat[ing] the perception of the military involved in domestic politics\\". = Immigration = Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed Mexico would pay for it. He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States, and criticized birthright citizenship for creating \\"anchor babies\\". As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an \\"invasion\\" and conflated immigrants with the gang MS-13, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans. Trump has attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement. Some of the results are harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president. This was accompanied by the Trump administration's mandating in 2018 that immigration judges must complete 700 cases a year to be evaluated as performing satisfactorily. Although Trump pledged to deport \\"millions of illegal aliens,\\" that did not occur. Under Trump, migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border rose to their highest level in 12 years, but deportations remained below the record highs of fiscal years 2012-2014. From 2018 onwards, Trump deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, in 2019 was allowed by the Supreme Court to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum, and from 2020 used the public charge rule to restrict immigrants using government benefits from getting permanent residency via green cards. Trump has reduced the number of refugees admitted into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year. Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused (potentially long-lasting) bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.  Travel ban  Following the 2015 San Bernardino attack, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented. He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \\"proven history of terrorism\\". On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning. Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports. Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional; Trump immediately dismissed her. Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and a federal judge blocked its implementation nationwide. On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities. Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation. In a decision in June 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \\"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States\\". The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials. After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017, and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.  Family separation at border  The Trump administration has separated more than 5,400 migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border while the families attempted to enter the U.S. The Trump administration sharply increased the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017, before an official policy was announced in 2018; this was not reported publicly until January 2019. In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted. This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were taken away as unaccompanied alien minors. The children would be brought to immigration detention, immigrant shelters, tent camps, or metal cages, with the stated aim of releasing them to relatives or sponsors. Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration. The policy of family separations had no precedent in previous administrations and sparked public outrage, with Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups demanding that the policy be rescinded. Trump falsely asserting that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, when in fact this was his administration's policy. More than 2,300 children were separated as a result of the \\"zero tolerance policy\\", the Trump administration revealed in June 2018. Although Trump originally argued that the issue could not be solved via executive order, he proceeded to sign an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together, unless the administration judged that doing so would harm the child. On June 26, 2018, a federal judge concluded that the Trump administration had \\"no system in place to keep track of\\" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification; the judge ordered for the families to be reunited, and family separations stopped, except in the cases where the parent(s) are judged unfit to take care of the child, or if there is parental approval. In 2019, the Trump administration reported that 4,370 children were separated from July 2017 to June 2018. Even after the June 2018 federal court order, the Trump administration continued to practice family separations, with more than a thousand migrant children separated.  Migrant detentions  Overcrowded conditions for migrant families detained in Weslaco, Texas were reported by inspectors from the federal government in June 2019. While the Obama administration detained and deported migrants at high rates, the Trump administration took it to a significantly higher level. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General inspections of migrant detention centers in 2018 and 2019 found that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \\"in many instances\\" violated federal guidelines for detaining migrant children for too long before passing them to the Office of Refugee Resettlement and that migrants were detained for prolonged periods under dangerous conditions failing federal standards, enduring dangerous overcrowding and poor hygiene and food. CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in 2019 that there was a \\"border security and a humanitarian crisis\\" and that the immigration system was at a \\"breaking point\\". The treatment of the detained migrants resulted in a public outcry by July 2019. That month, Trump reacted to criticism of the migrant detentions by saying if the migrants were unhappy about the conditions of the detention facilities, \\"just tell them not to come.\\" In August 2019, the administration attempted to change the 1997 Flores Agreement that limits detention of migrant families to 20 days; the new policy allowing indefinite detention was blocked before it would go into effect.  2018‚Äì2019 federal government shutdown  Trump examines border wall prototypes in Otay Mesa, California. On December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6 billion in federal funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall to partly fulfill his campaign promise. The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities. Trump said he would not accept any bill that did not include funding for the wall, and Democrats, who control the House, said they would not support any bill that does. Senate Republicans have said they will not advance any legislation Trump would not sign. In earlier negotiations with Democratic leaders, Trump commented that he would be \\"proud to shut down the government for border security\\". As a result of the shutdown, about 380,000 government employees were furloughed and 420,000 government employees worked with pay. According to a CBO estimate, the shutdown resulted in a permanent loss of $3 billion to the U.S. economy. About half of Americans blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped. On January 25, 2019, Congress unanimously approved a temporary funding bill that provided no funds for the wall but would provide delayed paychecks to government workers. Trump signed the bill that day, ending the shutdown at 35 days. It was the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. Since the government funding was temporary, another shutdown loomed. On February 14, 2019, Congress approved a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles of border fences, in lieu of Trump's intended wall. Trump signed the bill the next day.  National emergency regarding the southern border  On February 15, 2019, after Trump received from Congress only $1.375 billion for border fencing after demanding $5.7 billion for the Trump wall, he declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States, in hopes of getting another $6.7 billion without congressional approval, using funds for military construction, drug interdiction, and money from the Treasury. In doing so, Trump acknowledged that he \\"didn't need to\\" declare a national emergency, but he \\"would rather do it much faster\\". Congress twice passed resolutions to block Trump's national emergency declarations, but Trump vetoed both and there were not enough votes in Congress for a veto override. Trump's decision to divert other government funding to fund the wall resulted in legal challenges. In July 2019, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to use $2.5 billion (originally meant for anti-drug programs) from the Department of Defense to build the Trump wall. In December 2019, a federal judge stopped the Trump administration from using $3.6 billion of military construction funds for the Trump wall.  Trump wall  As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent migration. In 2017, the border had 654 miles of primary fencing, 37 miles of secondary fencing and 14 miles of tertiary fencing. Trump's target, from 2015 to 2017, was 1,000 miles of wall. The Trump administration set a target of 450 miles of new or renovated barriers by December 2020, with an ultimate goal of 509 miles of new or renovated barriers by August 2021. Even into 2020, Trump has repeatedly provided false assertions that Mexico is paying for the Trump wall, although American taxpayers are footing the bill from funds being diverted from the U.S. Department of Defense. In October 2018, the administration revealed two miles of replacement fences made of steel posts, which it called the first section of Trump's 'wall', although earlier that year Border Patrol had said the project was unrelated to the Trump wall and had been long planned (dating to 2009). In December 2018 and January 2019, Trump tweeted out a design of a steel fence, and a picture of a fence, while declaring \\"the wall is coming.\\" By November 2019, the Trump administration had replaced around 78 miles of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier along the border; these replacement barriers were not walls, but fences made of bollards. The administration in November 2019 said it had \\"just started breaking ground\\" to build new barriers in areas where no structure existed. By May 2020, the Trump administration had replaced 172 miles of dilapidated or outdated design barriers, and constructed 15 miles of new border barriers. = Foreign policy = Trump with Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau and other leaders at the 45th G7 summit in France, 2019 Trump, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the 2017 Riyadh summit in Saudi Arabia Trump describes himself as a \\"nationalist\\" and his foreign policy as \\"America First\\"; he has espoused isolationist, non-interventionist, and protectionist views. His foreign policy has been marked by repeated praise and support of neo- nationalist and authoritarian strongmen and criticism of democratic governments. Trump has cited Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte, Egypt's Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Turkey's Tayyip Erdoƒüan, Russia's Vladimir Putin, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, India's Narendra Modi, Hungary's Viktor Orb√°n, and Poland's Andrzej Duda as examples of good leaders. As a candidate, Trump questioned the need for NATO, as president, he repeatedly and publicly criticized NATO and the U.S.'s NATO allies, and has privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from NATO. Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure include unpredictability and uncertainty, a lack of a consistent foreign policy, and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.  Syria Trump ordered missile strikes in April 2017 and in April 2018 against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks, respectively. In December 2018, Trump declared \\"we have won against ISIS,\\" contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria. Mattis resigned the next day in opposition to Trump's foreign policy, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s Kurdish allies who played a key role in fighting ISIS. One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria. In January 2019, national security advisor John Bolton announced America would remain in Syria until ISIS is eradicated and Turkey guarantees it will not strike the Kurds. Trump with Turkish president Erdoƒüan in November 2019 In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the White House acknowledged Turkey would carry out a military offensive into northern Syria, and U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the area. The statement also passed responsibility for the area's captured ISIS fighters to Turkey. As a result, Turkey launched an invasion, attacking and displacing American-allied Kurds in the area. Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for \\"abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe\\".  Saudi Arabia and Yemen Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.  Afghanistan U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, , reversing his pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan. On February 29, 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months if the Taliban uphold the terms of the agreement.  Iran  Trump has described the regime in Iran as \\"the rogue regime\\", although he has also asserted he does not seek regime change. Trump repeatedly criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015. In May 2018, Trump announced the U.S.' unilateral departure from the JCPOA. After withdrawing from the agreement, Trump administration moved forward with a policy of \\"maximum pressure\\" on Iran via economic sanctions, but without support of other parties to the deal. The Trump State Department had certified Iran's compliance with the deal in July 2017, but Iran began breaching its terms in May 2020, and by September the IAEA reported the country had ten times the amount of enriched uranium allowed under the deal. During the summer of 2020 the United States attempted to \\"snap back\\" pre-deal sanctions by asserting to the UN Security Council that it remained a participant in the deal, but only the Dominican Republic voted with the United States on the proposal. Following Iranian missile tests in January 2017, the Trump administration sanctioned 25 Iranian individuals and entities. In August 2017, Trump signed legislation imposing additional sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea. In May 2017, strained relations between the U.S. and Iran escalated when Trump deployed military bombers and a carrier group to the Persian Gulf. Trump hinted at war on social media, provoking a response from Iran for what Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif called \\"genocidal taunts\\". Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman are allies in the conflict with Iran. Trump approved the deployment of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following the attack on Saudi oil facilities which the United States has blamed on Iran. Demonstrations in Iran over the death of Qasem Soleimani, January 3, 2020 On January 2, 2020, Trump ordered a U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian general and Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al- Muhandis, and eight other people. Trump publicly threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites, or react \\"in a disproportionate manner\\" if Iran retaliated; though such attacks by the U.S. would violate international law as war crimes. Several days later, Iran retaliated with airstrikes against Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. Initially the Trump administration claimed no Americans suffered injuries and Trump said injuries were not \\"very serious\\", but by February 2020, more than a hundred traumatic brain injuries were diagnosed in U.S. troops.  Israel  Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Yad Vashem, May 2017 Trump supported the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Under Trump, the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017, and opened an embassy in Jerusalem in May 2018. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the move. In March 2019, Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy by recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, a move condemned by the European Union and the Arab League.  China  Before and during his presidency, Trump has repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S. During his presidency, Trump has launched a trade war against China, sanctioned Huawei for its alleged ties to Iran, significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars, and classified China as a \\"currency manipulator\\"; on other occasions during his presidency, Trump has praised Xi Jinping and the Chinese government for their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade. Trump said he resisted punishing China for its human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in the northwestern Xinjiang region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations. In July 2020, the Trump administration imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, including Chen Quanguo, a member of China's powerful Politburo of the Communist Party, who expanded mass detention camps holding more than a million members of the country's Uyghur Muslim minority.  North Korea  Trump meets Kim Jong- un at the Singapore summit, June 2018. In 2017, North Korea's nuclear weapons were increasingly seen as a serious threat. In August 2017, Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean threats would be met with \\"fire and fury like the world has never seen\\". North Korea responded by releasing plans for missile tests that would land near Guam. In a September 2017 speech at the UN General Assembly, Trump said the U.S. would \\"totally destroy North Korea\\" if \\"forced\\" to defend itself or its allies. Also in September 2017, Trump increased sanctions on North Korea, declared that he wanted North Korea's \\"complete denuclearization\\", and engaged in name-calling with leader Kim Jong- un. After this period of tension in 2017, however, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters (described by Trump as \\"love letters\\"), in which the two men describe a warm personal friendship. In March 2018, Trump immediately agreed to Kim's proposal for a meeting. In June 2018, Trump and Kim met in Singapore. Kim affirmed his intent \\"to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\\" but a second Trump‚ÄìKim summit in Hanoi in February 2019 terminated abruptly without an agreement. Both countries blamed each other and offered differing accounts of the negotiations. In June 2019, Trump, Kim, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in held brief talks in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, marking the first time a sitting U.S. president had set foot in North Korea. Trump and Kim agreed to resume negotiations. Bilateral talks in October 2019 were unsuccessful.  Russia  G20 Osaka summit, June 2019 During his campaign and as president, Trump has repeatedly asserted that he desires better relations with Russia. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.‚ÄìRussian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump has criticized Russia about the Nord Stream2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and the Skripal poisoning, but remained silent on the Navalny poisoning, and sent mixed messages regarding Crimea. Trump announced in October 2018 that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing alleged Russian non-compliance. In 2017, Trump signed the legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia; in 2018, however, the Trump administration lifted other U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. As a presidential candidate, Trump described Putin as a strong leader. After he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit on July 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for siding with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Trump has repeatedly praised, and rarely criticized, Putin. = Personnel = Cabinet meeting, March 2017 The Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. , 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left and 141 staffers had left in the past year. Both figures set a record for recent presidentsmore change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years. Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out. Some, like Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts. Trump has disparaged several of his former top officials as incompetent, stupid, or crazy. Trump has had four White House chiefs of staff, marginalizing or pushing out several. Reince Priebus was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general John F. Kelly. Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him. Kelly was succeeded by Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by Mark Meadows. Trump's Cabinet nominations included U.S. senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury, retired Marine Corps general James Mattis as Secretary of Defense, and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations. Two of Trump's 15 original Cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Tillerson as Secretary of State with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy. In 2018, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned amid multiple investigations into their conduct. Trump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee. By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61%) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37%).  Dismissal of James Comey  On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. He first attributed this action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails. A few days later, Trump said he was concerned with the ongoing \\"Russia thing\\" and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier, regardless of DOJ advice. According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \\"hoped\\" Comey would drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. In March and April, Trump had told Comey the ongoing suspicions formed a \\"cloud\\" impairing his presidency, and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation. He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election. Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal. Comey eventually testified on June8 that, while he was director, the FBI investigations had not targeted Trump himself. = Impeachment =  Impeachment by the House of Representatives  Members of House of Representatives vote on two articles of impeachment , December 18, 2019 During much of Trump's presidency, Democrats were divided on the question of impeachment. Fewer than 20 representatives in the House supported impeachment by January 2019; after the Mueller Report was released in April and special counsel Robert Mueller testified in July, this number grew to around 140 representatives. In August 2019, a whistleblower filed a complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential primary candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, adding that the White House had attempted to cover-up the incident. The whistleblower further stated that the call was part of a wider pressure campaign by Trump's personal attorney Giuliani and the Trump administration which may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Vice President Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip. Trump later confirmed having withheld military aid from Ukraine and offered contradictory reasons for the decision. House speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019. The Trump administration subsequently released a memorandum of the July 25 phone call, confirming that after Zelensky mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate and to discuss these matters with Giuliani and Attorney General Barr. The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election. In October 2019, William B. Taylor Jr., the charg√© d'affaires for Ukraine, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelensky was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelensky into making a public commitment to investigate the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He said it was made clear that until Zelensky made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelensky to the White House. Zelensky denied that he felt pressured by Trump. On December 2019, the House Intelligence Committee published a report authored by Democrats on the committee, stating that \\"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents... solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.\\" The report said Trump had withheld military aid and a White House invitation to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals. Furthermore, the report stated that Trump \\"openly and indiscriminately\\" defied impeachment proceedings by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas. House Republicans released a draft of a countering report the previous day, saying that the evidence \\"does not prove any of these Democrat allegations.\\" On December 13, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. After debate, the House of Representatives impeached Trump with both articles on December 18.  Impeachment trial in the Senate  The Senate impeachment trial began on January 16, 2020. On January 22, the Republican Senate majority rejected amendments proposed by the Democratic minority to call witnesses and subpoena documents; evidence collected during the House impeachment proceedings was entered into the Senate record. For three days, January 22‚Äì24, the impeachment managers for the House presented their case to the Senate. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they included an impeachment process in the Constitution. Trump displaying the front page of The Washington Post reporting his acquittal by the Senate Responding over the next three days, the Trump legal team did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress. They argued that the impeachment was \\"constitutionally and legally invalid\\" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense. On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote. Thus, this became the first impeachment trial in U.S. history without witness testimony. On February 5, Trump was acquitted of both charges in a vote nearly along party lines, with Republican Mitt Romney voting to convict on one of the charges. Following his acquittal, Trump began removing impeachment witnesses and political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal. = COVID-19 pandemic = Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law on March 6, 2020. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, spreading worldwide within weeks. The first confirmed case in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020. The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar on January 31, 2020. Trump's public discussions of the dangers of the virus were different than his private understanding. In February 2020 Trump publicly suggested that flu was more dangerous than COVID-19 and asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was \\"very much under control\\" and would soon be over, but he told Bob Woodward at the time that COVID-19 was \\"deadly\\" and \\"tricky\\" to handle because of airborne transmission. In March 2020 Trump privately told Woodward \\"I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\\" Trump's comments to Woodward were made public in September 2020. A Cornell University study concluded that Trump was the \\"likely the largest driver\\" of COVID-19 misinformation in the first five months of 2020.  Initial response  Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the imminent threat and ignoring calls for action from government health experts and Secretary Azar. Throughout January and February, he rejected persistent public health warnings from officials within his administration, focusing instead on economic and political considerations of the outbreak. By mid-March, most global financial markets had severely contracted in response to the emerging pandemic. Trump continued to claim that a vaccine was months away, although HHS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials had repeatedly told him that vaccine development would take 12‚Äì18 months. Trump also falsely claimed that \\"anybody that wants a test can get a test,\\" despite the availability of tests being severely limited. On March 6, Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13. That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak \\"horrible\\" but \\"a temporary moment\\" and saying there was no financial crisis. On March 13, he declared a national emergency, freeing up federal resources. On April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of immigration to the United States. In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly-optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.  White House Coronavirus Task Force  Trump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on March 15, 2020. Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29, 2020. Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials, sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments. Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced members of the White House press corps. On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur. On April 3, Trump announced that the federal government would use funds from the CARES Act to pay hospitals for treatment of uninsured patients infected with the coronavirus. His repeated use of the terms \\"Chinese virus\\" and \\"China virus\\" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from the media, health experts, the WHO, and the Chinese government. By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the WHO. By mid-April 2020, some national news agencies began limiting live coverage of his daily press briefings, with The Washington Post reporting that \\"propagandistic and false statements from Trump alternate with newsworthy pronouncements from members of his White House Coronavirus Task Force, particularly coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci.\\" The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of ingesting bleach or injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19; the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals. Poland's president Andrzej Duda was the first foreign leader to travel to the White House since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In early May, Trump proposed that the coronavirus task force should be phased out, to accommodate another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump publicly said the task force would continue on \\"indefinitely\\". By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.  Pandemic response program terminated  In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated the PREDICT program, a $200 million epidemiological research program that had been initiated by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad. The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. In April 2020, USAID extended the PREDICT program for six months.  Pressure to abandon pandemic shutdown mandates early  In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized anti-lockdown protests against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic; Trump encouraged the protests on Twitter, even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening. He first supported, then later criticized Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses, which was a key example of Trump often reversing his stances in his communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy. Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump continued to mostly downplay the pandemic, including his claim in early July 2020 that 99% of COVID-19 cases are \\"totally harmless\\", a claim which contradicts health officials in the U.S. He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall, despite a July spike in reported cases.  Controversy over face masks as strategy for pandemic mitigation  Trump has refused to wear a face mask at most public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public. and despite nearly unanimous consensus by the medical community that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus. By June, Trump had said masks were a \\"double-edged sword\\"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask is a political statement against him personally. Trump's contradictory example to medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.  World Health Organization  Prior to the pandemic, Trump had been critical of the WHO and other international bodies as taking advantage of U.S. aid. His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, had reduced WHO funding by more than half. In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of \\"severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus\\" and alleging without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic. He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization. Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic. In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021. The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as \\"short-sighted\\", \\"senseless\\", and \\"dangerous\\".  Testing  In June and July Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases \\"makes us look bad\\". The CDC guideline was that any person exposed to the virus should be \\"quickly identified and tested\\" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus. In August 2020, however, the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, \\"do not necessarily need a test\\". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists. The following day, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.  Political pressure on health agencies  Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take particular actions that he favored, such as giving approval to unproven treatments that he favored or speeding up the approval of vaccines. Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to gain control over the communications from the CDC, to remove any reporting that undermined Trump's claims that the COVID-19 pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a \\"deep state\\" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.  Effect of Trump's response on the 2020 presidential campaign  By July 2020 Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic became a major issue for the 2020 presidential election. Democratic challenger Joe Biden sought to make the election a referendum on Trump's performance on the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy. Polls indicated voters blamed Trump for continued pandemic problems and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65% of Americans disapproving of his pandemic response.  Hospitalization with COVID-19  On October 2, 2020, Trump announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. He was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that day and treated with the antiviral drug remdesevir, the steroid dexamethasone, and the unapproved experimental antibody REGN-COV2. He was discharged on October 5. = Investigations = The Crossfire Hurricane FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation. There are 30 open investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve Congressional investigations. A book by Jeffrey Toobin, published in 2020, summarizes evidence against Trump as if he were on trial before a jury.  Hush payments  Stormy Daniels in 2010 American Media, Inc. (AMI) paid $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal in August 2016, and Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016. Both women were paid for non-disclosure agreements regarding their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump in order to influence the presidential election. AMI admitted paying McDougal to prevent publication of stories that might damage Trump's electoral chances. Trump denied the affairs, and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but reimbursed him in 2017. Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014. Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016. Federal prosecutors closed the investigation, but days later the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the hush payments and in August subpoenaed eight years of tax returns for Trump and the Trump Organization.  Russian election interference  In January 2017, American intelligence agenciesthe CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligencejointly stated with \\"high confidence\\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump. In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress \\"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\\" The connections between Trump associates and Russia have been widely reported by the press. One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked from December 2004 until February 2010 to help pro- Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency. Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials. Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump. Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election. On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence. Trump had told Kislyak and Sergei Lavrov in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections. Trump and his allies have promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 electionwhich has also been promoted by Russia to frame Ukraine. After the Democratic National Committee was hacked, Trump firstly claimed it withheld \\"its server\\" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); secondly that CrowdStrike, the company which investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and thirdly that \\"the server\\" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration have spoken out against the conspiracy theories.  2017 FBI counterintelligence inquiry  After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and business dealings with Russia. Within days of its opening, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein curtailed the inquiry, giving the bureau the impression that the incipient Mueller investigation would pursue it, though Rosenstein instructed Mueller not to, effectively ending the inquiry.  Special counsel investigation  redacted version of the Mueller report released by the Department of Justice on April 18, 2019 On May 17, 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating \\"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\\", thus taking over the existing \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\" FBI investigation into the matter. The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice, and possible campaign ties to other national governments. Trump repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. Mueller also investigated the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China. Trump sought to fire Mueller on several occasionsin June 2017, December 2017, and April 2018and close the investigation but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind. He bemoaned the recusal of his first Attorney General Jeff Sessions regarding Russia matters, and believed Sessions should have stopped the investigation. On March 22, 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave his report to Attorney General William Barr. On March 24, Barr sent a four-page letter to Congress summarizing the \\"principal conclusions\\" in the report. He quoted Mueller as stating \\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\\" Barr further wrote that he and Rosenstein did not see sufficient evidence to prove obstruction of justice. Trump interpreted Mueller's report as a \\"complete exoneration\\", a phrase he repeated multiple times in the ensuing weeks. Mueller privately complained to Barr on March 27 that his summary did not accurately reflect what the report said, and some legal analysts called the Barr letter misleading. A redacted version of the report was released to the public on April 18, 2019. The first volume found that Russia interfered to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's. Despite \\"numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\\", the prevailing evidence \\"did not establish\\" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference. The report states that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was illegal and occurred \\"in sweeping and systematic fashion\\", and it details how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged foreign interference believing they would politically benefit. The second volume of the Mueller report dealt with possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction inasmuch as investigators were not confident of his innocence after examining his intent and actions. Investigators decided they could not \\"apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes\\" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted, and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court. The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, \\"may apply the obstruction laws\\". Congress subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal, albeit it ultimately did not press charges related to the Mueller investigation.  Associates  In August 2018, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts of false tax filing and bank fraud. Trump said he felt very badly for Manafort and praised him for resisting the pressure to make a deal with prosecutors. According to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, Trump had sought advice about pardoning Manafort but was counseled against it. In November 2018, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as \\"Individual-1\\" in the court documents. The five Trump associates who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in Mueller's investigation or related cases include Paul Manafort, deputy campaign manager Rick Gates, foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen. In February 2020, Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone was sentenced to over three years in jail, after being convicted of lying to Congress and witness tampering regarding his attempts to learn more about hacked Democratic emails during the 2016 election. The sentencing judge said Stone \\"was prosecuted for covering up for the president\\".  2019 congressional investigation  In March 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power. Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler sent letters demanding documents to 81 individuals and organizations associated with Trump's presidency, business, and private life, saying it is \\"very clear that the president obstructed justice\\". Three other committee chairmen wrote the White House and State Department requesting details of Trump's communications with Putin, including any efforts to conceal the content of those communications. The White House refused to comply, asserting that presidential communications with foreign leaders are protected and confidential. =Judiciary= Trump has appointed more than 200 federal judges who were confirmed by the Senate. Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have rapidly confirmed Trump's judicial appointees, usually against unified Democratic opposition. Trump's appointments have shifted the federal judiciary to the right. Trump's judicial appointments have been overwhelmingly white men, and are younger on average than appointees by Trump's predecessors. Many are affiliated with the Federalist Society. Trump has made three nominations to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Gorsuch was confirmed in 2017 in a mostly party-line vote of 54-45, after Republicans invoked the \\"nuclear option\\" (a historic change to Senate rules removing the 60-vote threshold for advancing Supreme Court nominations) to defeat a Democratic filibuster. Trump's predecessor Obama had nominated Merrick Garland in 2016 to fill the vacancy, left by the death of Antonin Scalia, but Senate Republicans under McConnell refused to consider the nomination in the last year of Obama's presidency, angering Democrats. Trump nominated Kavanaugh in 2018 to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy; the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh in a mostly party-line vote of 50‚Äì48, after a bitter confirmation battle centered on Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that Kavanaugh had attempted to rape her when they were teenagers, which Kavanaugh denied. In 2020, weeks before the elections, Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; if confirmed, the ideological composition of the Supreme Court would be substantially changed. As president, Trump has disparaged courts and judges whom he disagrees with, often in personal terms, and has questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts have drawn rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, who are concerned with the effect of Trump's statements on the judicial independence and public confidence in the judiciary.  Public profile  = Approval ratings = At the end of Trump's second year, his two-year average Gallup approval rating was the lowest of any president since World War II. In January 2020, his Gallup rating reached 49%, the highest point since he took office, with 63% of those polled approving his handling of the economy. His approval and disapproval ratings have been unusually stable. In Gallup's end-of-year poll asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, and tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019. Since Gallup started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office. Globally, a Gallup poll on 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that only in 29 of them did Trump lead Obama in job approval, with more international respondents disapproving rather than approving of the Trump administration. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency. = Social media = Trump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He frequently tweeted during the 2016 election campaign and has continued to do so as president. As of October 2020, Trump has more than 85 million Twitter followers. By the end of May 2020, Trump had written about 52,000 tweets. These include 22,115 tweets over seven years before his presidential candidacy, 8,159 tweets during the years of his candidacy and transition period, and 14,186 tweets over the first three years of his presidency. Trump has frequently used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press. A White House press secretary said early in his presidency that Trump's tweets are official statements by the president of the United States, employed for announcing policy or personnel changes. In March 2018, Trump fired his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by tweet. Many of Trump's tweets contain false assertions. In May 2020, Twitter began tagging some Trump tweets with fact-checking warnings and labels for violations of Twitter rules. Trump responded by threatening to \\"strongly regulate\\" or \\"close down\\" social media platforms. = False statements = Fact-checkers from The Washington Post, the Toronto Star, and CNN (direct link to chart image) compiled data on \\"false or misleading claims\\" (orange background), and \\"false claims\\" (violet foreground), respectively. As president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks. The misinformation has been documented by fact-checkers; academics and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics.    This behavior was similarly observed when he was a presidential candidate. His falsehoods have also become a distinctive part of his political identity. Trump uttered \\"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\\" in office, according to The New York Times, and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office, according to the \\"Fact Checker\\" political analysis column of The Washington Post. By the Posts tally, it took Trump 601 days to reach 5,000 false or misleading statements and another 226 days to reach the 10,000 mark. For the seven weeks leading up to the midterm elections, it rose to an average of thirty per day from 4.9 during his first hundred days in office. The Posts reported tally is 20,055 as of July 9, 2020, with the 2019 total more than double the cumulative total of 2017 and 2018. Some of Trump's falsehoods are inconsequential, such as his claims of a large crowd size during his inauguration. Others have had more far-reaching effects, such as Trump's promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID‚Äë19 in a press conference and on Twitter in March 2020. The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia. The state of Florida obtained nearly a million doses for its hospitals, even though most of them did not want the drug. Other misinformation, such as Trump's retweet of unverified videos of a far-right British nationalist group in November 2017, serves Trump's domestic political purposes. As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods. Despite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as \\"lies\\", a word that has in the past been avoided out of respect for the presidential office. Nevertheless, in August 2018 The Washington Post declared for the first time that some of Trump's misstatements (statements concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal) were lies. In 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on national voting practices and the COVID-19 virus. Trump's attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, while his disinformation about the pandemic dangerously delayed and weakened the national response to it. Some view the nature and frequency of Trump's falsehoods as having profound and corrosive consequences on democracy. James Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers \\"egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well- known facts\\"; these lies are the \\"most important\\" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by \\"political power\\"; this erodes liberal democracy, wrote Pfiffner. = Promotion of conspiracy theories = Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including \\"birtherism\\", the Clinton Body Count theory, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections. Trump retweeted a July 2020 video by Stella Immanuel, a Texas physician, promoting an unproven cure for the coronavirus. Her post was subsequently removed from several social networks because it violated their rules on misinformation. = Relationship with the press = Trump talking to the press, March 2017 Throughout his career, Trump has sought media attention, with a \\"love-hate\\" relationship with the press. Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s. Fox News anchor Bret Baier and former House speaker Paul Ryan have characterized Trump as a \\"troll\\" who makes controversial statements to see people's \\"heads explode\\". In the campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries. New York Times writer Amy Chozick wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance, which enthralls the public and creates \\"can't miss\\" reality television-type coverage, was politically beneficial for him. Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency, Trump has accused the press of bias, calling it the \\"fake news media\\" and \\"the enemy of the people\\". After winning the election, journalist Lesley Stahl recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media \\"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.\\" Trump has privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he views as critical. His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts. In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump. The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019. Trump has employed the legal system as an intimidation tactic against the press. In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN for alleged defamation. These lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed, however. Their design and effect is to intimidate journalists and the press. = Racial views = Many of Trump's comments and actions have been seen as racially charged.Multiple sources:   He has repeatedly denied he is racist, asserting: \\"I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world.\\" Many of his supporters say the way he speaks reflects his rejection of political correctness, while others accept it because they share such beliefs. Scholars have discussed Trump's rhetoric in the context of white supremacy.  * * Several studies and surveys have found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascendance and have been more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters. Racist and islamophobic attitudes have been shown to be a powerful indicator of support for Trump. In national polling, about half of Americans say that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believe that he has emboldened racists. In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters. He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He has maintained his position on the matter into 2019. Trump relaunched his political career in 2011 as a leading proponent of \\"birther\\" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. In April 2011, Trump claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the \\"long-form\\" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later saying this made him \\"very popular\\". In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S. and falsely claimed the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2017, he reportedly still expressed birther views in private. According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made \\"explicitly racist appeals to whites\\" during his 2016 presidential campaign. In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were \\"bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists.\\" His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist. Trump answers questions from reporters about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Trump's comments in reaction to the 2017 Charlottesville far-right rally were interpreted, by some, as implying a moral equivalence between white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters. In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation, he reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as \\"shithole countries\\". His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress. In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic members of Congressall four minority women, three of them native-born Americansshould \\"go back\\" to the countries they \\"came from\\". Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240‚Äì187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his \\"racist comments\\". White nationalist publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days. Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign. = Misogyny and allegations of sexual assault and sexual misconduct = Trump has a history of insulting or demeaning comments against women. After being questioned about his behavior during an Republican primary debate by Fox News journalist and debate moderator Megyn Kelly in August 2015, Trump brushed off the question and implied that she was treating him unfairly. In an interview the next day, Trump said of Kelly, \\"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever.\\" The comment was widely viewed as referring to menstrual blood. Trump denied the comment was about menstruation and insisted that what he said was appropriate. Trump incurred bipartisan condemnation for his comments. In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 \\"hot mic\\" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying \\"when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab 'em by the pussy.\\" The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign and caused outrage across the political spectrum. At least twenty-six women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct , including his then-wife Ivana. There were allegations of rape, violence, being kissed and groped without consent, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked women. In 2016, he denied all accusations, calling them \\"false smears\\", and alleged there was a conspiracy against him. = Allegations of inciting violence = Some research suggests Trump's rhetoric causes an increased incidence of hate crimes. During the 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters. Since then, some defendants prosecuted for hate crimes or violent acts cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should received a lighter sentence. In August 2019 it was reported that a man who allegedly assaulted a minor for perceived disrespect toward the national anthem had cited Trump's rhetoric in his own defense. In August 2019, a nationwide review by ABC News identified at least 36 criminal cases in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence. Of these, 29 were based around someone echoing presidential rhetoric, while the other seven were someone protesting it or not having direct linkage. = Popular culture = Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \\"Bart to the Future\\"written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform Partyanticipated a Trump presidency. A parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018. Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip-hop lyrics since the 1980s; he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone. Mentions of Trump in hip-hop turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015. = Recognition = In 1983, Trump received the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life Award, after he helped fund two playgrounds, a park, and a reservoir in Israel. In 1986, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of \\"patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity\\", and in 1995 was awarded the President's Medal from the Freedoms Foundation for his support of youth programs. He has been awarded five honorary doctorates, but one was revoked by Robert Gordon University in 2015 after Trump called for a Muslim ban, citing Trump's speech being \\"wholly incompatible... with the ethos and values of the university\\". The remaining awards are Lehigh University's honorary doctorate of laws in 1988, Wagner College's honorary doctorate of humane letters in 2004, and Liberty University's honorary doctorates of business and law in 2012 and 2017 respectively. In December 2016, Time named Trump as its \\"Person of the Year\\", but Trump took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \\"President of the Divided States of America\\". In the same month, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year and was ranked by Forbes the second most powerful person in the world after Vladimir Putin. As president, Trump received the Collar of The Order of Abdulaziz al Saud from Saudi Arabia in 2017.

This sheltered area is part of William Bay National Park and has a sandy white beach ringed by large granite boulders that prevent the swell of the Southern Ocean reaching the shoreline. The pool is roughly long from east to west and at its widest point from the beach to the protective rocks. Early settlers of the region used the beach location for outings and picnics. The area has a car park, viewing platform and toilet facility with a reasonably steep sandy path down to the beach. The granitic rocks along much of the south coast formed 1.5 billion years ago, placing them among some of the oldest rocks in the world. As the Australian continent collided with Antarctica, the rocks along the south coast became part of the Albany-Fraser Orogen, and 600 million years ago the area was a massive mountain range. The mountains eroded away long ago and the remaining rocks were once deep down in the base of the range. The high pressures and temperatures these rocks experienced during the mountain building event caused them to melt then recrystallise, forming granitic gneisses and migmatites, which are referred to as granites. The pool is a popular tourist attraction within the National Park; in 1993-1994 the park had 110,000 visitors, and in 2011-2012 the park had some 218,105 visitors. In 2020, Greens Pool was ranked 13 in TripAdvisor's Top 25 Beaches in the South Pacific Greens Pool was named to honour Police Inspector John Green, who was originally a farmer in Denmark. His son, Victor Green, drowned in nearby Wilson Inlet in 1922, and often used to fish at the pool. It was originally known as Green's Pool but the Lands Department dropped the apostrophe for many place names although the letter \\"s\\" was retained. Robert Byleveld constructed the first track to Greens Pool in the early 1920s when most of William Bay was inaccessible and visited infrequently. Many species of fish inhabit the area, including; estuary cobbler, southern garfish, species of flathead, southern blue devil, King George whiting, skipjack trevally and Australian herring.

He is applauded for his acting in an emotional scene in which he plays a son with his father. When a student asks him how he managed to cry he walks out, troubled and embarrassed. In the next class he loses control when playing another scene with the student who played his father. He punches the other student and kicks him as he lies on the floor. That night he throws away everything he has written. Furio Giunta is now in New Jersey, a soldier with the Soprano crime family. Christopher was making collections from the owner of a tanning salon used to front a brothel, but the payments have been short. Tony sends Furio to intimidate the owner. Furio ruthlessly assaults the girls and the customers, breaks the owner's arm and shoots him in the kneecap, and hits the owner's wife and spits on her. With Furio's arrival, Tony promotes Paulie and Silvio, and demotes Pussy. Pussy sees this as a betrayal and complains about it to Agent Lipari, who feels he has been passed over in his job as well. Sympathizing with each other, each complains about the declining standards of his organization. Tony is becoming short-tempered and violent and is inflamed when he learns that Janice is using their mother's house as security for a loan. He goes to the house early one morning to confront her. He is taken aback when the door is opened by Richie, who says that he and Janice have revived the relationship they had many years ago. Tony says that their relationship was like Israel and Palestine. He leaves, saying with disgust, \\"She's your fucking problem now.\\" Tony visits Hesh Rabkin, seeking the comfort and guidance from him that he is not getting from Dr. Melfi. Hesh is sympathetic, and tells Tony that Tony's father also had panic attacks. Hesh gets bored listening to Tony and rambles on about his own experiences. Dr Melfi consults Dr. Kupferberg, and tries to understand her feelings about her gangster patient. Eventually she decides to resume treating Tony. At their first session, while questions are being asked and answered, it seems they cannot stop smiling at each other.

The 80th has served in combat operations in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. History =World War II= The Headhunters' history began only one month after Pearl Harbor, as the squadron shipped out to fight in the Pacific Theater. The Squadron was first activated on 10 January 1942 at Mitchel Field in New York. Originally designated as a pursuit squadron, they were redesignated in May 1942 as a fighter squadron. Attached to the 8th Fighter Group. One of the early squadron commanders, Edward \\"Porky\\" Cragg named the Squadron \\"The Headhunters\\" after the local New Guinean Headhunter tribes who hated the Japanese and helped to rescue downed pilots. He also commissioned a crew chief, M/Sgt. Yale Saffro, who was once offered a job to work for Walt Disney as a cartoonist but turned it down, to design the 80th's patch. (This original patch design can be seen , and has been officially sanctioned by the Office of Air Force Heraldry for current uniform wear.)

With their conversion to jet engines, the headhunters were redesignated as the 80th Fighter Squadron, Jet, on 1 January 1950. Later that month, they would become the 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. The outfit served in the Korean war in June and July 1953 while mostly flying the North American F-86 Sabre. In 1956, the Headhunters would begin flying the North American F-100 Super Sabre. Following the squadron's engagement in the Korean War, the 80th was tasked with providing air defense in Japan and Korea (1953‚Äì1954), in Okinawa (1954‚Äì1956), and in Japan and Korea (1956‚Äì1971). =Vietnam War= In 1963, the squadron began flying the Republic F-105 Thunderchief.

During the summer of 1968 the 80th TFS became the first PACAF squadron to assign a contingent of experienced F-4 aircraft commanders and electronic warfare officers (EWOs) as F-4C Wild Weasel crews. The first fully modified F-4C Wild Weasel aircraft arrived in April 1969. Between 1968 and 1971 the primary mission of the 80th TFS was to deploy on a rotating basis to Osan AB, Korea, providing a nuclear strike alert posture against targets in the Soviet Union, North Korea, and China, maintaining several aircraft on fifteen-minute alert. It also trained on conventional weapons. In 1970 all PACAF F-4 Wild Weasel crews transferred into the 80th TFS. =Korean service= On 15 February 1971, the 80th TFS redeployed from Yokota to Kunsan AB, Korea, while temporarily assigned to Detachment 1, 475th Tactical Fighter Wing to begin the process of inactivation, with its personnel and aircraft transferred to the 35th TFS. Lt Gen Jay T. Robbins, a former 80th commander and World War II ace who was Vice Commander of Tactical Air Command, rescinded the inactivation and had the 80th transferred to the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing, in Korea. There it was re-staffed with personnel from the 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron, which was inactivated on 28 February. The 391st's insignia had included the motto Audentes Fortuna Juvat, which subsequently became the \\"Headhunters\\" motto. On the 391st sleeve patch, the scroll displaying the motto was such that when the patch was ripped off, the word \\"Juvat\\" was left in place. The former 391st aircrew did so with the consent of the 80th commander at the time, Lt Col Soloman Harp III, who named himself the first \\"Juvat\\". The motto remained unofficial until approved on 9 October 1986. In its history, the 80th has recorded 251 total air-to-air victories. The 80th scored one air-to-air victory by an F-105 pilot, but an assigned officer detached at the time to the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron in Thailand, Captain Jeffrey Feinstein, was credited with five victories and ace status as an F-4 weapons system officer in 1972.

She was Director of the Bureau of Measurements at the Paris Observatory and was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur.  Biography  Her father, John Gerard Klumpke (1825‚Äì1917), was a German immigrant who had come to California in 1850 with the Gold Rush and had later become a successful realtor in San Francisco. He married Dorothea Mathilda Tolle in 1855 and they produced a family of five daughters and two sons. In 1877 she moved to Paris, France while her four sisters were placed in schools in Germany and Switzerland. The sisters all went on to distinguished careers: Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, painter and companion to the great French animal painter Rosa Bonheur; Julia Klumpke, a violinist and composer; Mathilda, an accomplished pianist and pupil of Marmontel, and the neurologist Augusta, who, with her physician husband, Joseph Jules Dejerine, established a clinic and wrote numerous papers. Dorothea studied at the University of Paris and started out also studying music, but later turned to astronomy. She received her bachelor's degree in 1886 and PhD in 1893. In 1887 she took up a post at the Paris Observatory. Here she worked with Guillaume Bigourdan and Lip√≥t Schulhof, and later with the pioneer astrophotographers Paul and Prosper Henry, who were working with a 34 cm refractor and photographing the minor planets (asteroids). Her work consisted of measuring star positions, processing astrophotographs, studying stellar spectra and meteorites.  Work  In 1886 Sir David Gill proposed an atlas of the heavens. The idea received enthusiastic support, especially from the Director of the Paris Observatory, Admiral Am√©d√©e Mouchez, who suggested an international meeting in Paris. This led to the Carte du Ciel project which required photographing the entire sky and showing stars as faint as the 14th magnitude. The Paris Observatory was to do a major portion of the sky as its contribution. It was also envisioned that a catalogue of all the stars to the 11th magnitude be drawn up. Despite being a woman, and in the face of fierce competition from 50 men, she secured the post of Director of the Bureau of Measurements at the Paris Observatory. In 1896 she sailed to Norway on the Norwegian vessel Norse King, to observe the solar eclipse of August 9, 1896. The eclipse was not a success because of obscuring clouds, but romance was about to enter her life. She met up with Dr. Isaac Roberts, a 67-year-old Welsh widower and entrepreneur turned astronomer, who had become a pioneer in astrophotography. He had attended the Paris Carte du Ciel Congress. Roberts had equipped his private observatory with a 50 cm reflector and camera, and a 13 cm Cooke refractor. In 1899, astronomers had predicted a great meteor shower now known as the Leonids. The French chose a female astronomer - Dorothea Klumpke - to be the one to ride in a balloon to observe the shower - the shower turned out a complete failure. Five years after meeting, Dorothea and Isaac were married in 1901 and stayed at his Sussex home. Dorothea left her job at the Paris Observatory in order to be with Isaac, whom she assisted in a project to photograph all 52 of the Herschel \\"areas of nebulosity.\\" Their marriage ended after only a short while with Isaac's death in 1904. Dorothea inherited all his astronomical effects and a considerable fortune. Dorothea remained at the Sussex home and completed photography of the 52 areas, after which she went to stay with her mother and sister, Anna, at Chateau Rosa Bonheur, taking along the entire set of photographic plates. She returned to Paris Observatory and spent 25 years processing the plates and Isaac's notes, periodically publishing papers on the results. In 1929 she published a comprehensive catalogue of the survey \\"The Isaac Roberts Atlas of 52 Regions, a Guide to William Herschel's Fields of Nebulosity\\". She was awarded the H√®l√©ne-Paul Helbronner prize in 1932 from the French Academy of Sciences for this publication. Through a donation of Dorothea in honor of her late husband, the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (the French Astronomical Society) established the Prix Dorothea Klumpke-Isaac Roberts for the encouragement of the study of the wide and diffuse nebulae of William Herschel, the obscure objects of Barnard, or the cosmic clouds of R.P. Hagen. This biennial prize was first given in 1931 and continues today.l'Astronomie, Vol. 93, 1979, pp. 543-546. Dorothea Klumpke died on October 5, 1942, having been in poor health for a number of years. = About signals from Mars = \\"The body of Mars is not very luminous, and the eye has to be trained. Imagination must not be permitted to carry eye away. The astronomers at Arizona Observatory are very advanced, and imagination may have played a part, though Mars should be the first planet with which we shall be able to communicate. Mars will be the first to give us a true knowledge of life beyond the earth, as it was the first to lead Keppler to the truth about the solar system. The projections are astronomical phenomena, not signals from the inhabitants. Mars is doubtless inhabited by a superior race, and I see probability in Kant's theory that we may be transmitted to another planet for another life.\\"  Honors  She was the first recipient of the \\"Prix de Dames\\" from the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France in 1897, and in 1893 was made an Officier d'Acad√©me of the French Academy of Sciences - up to that time, these honours had not been awarded to a woman. On December 14, 1893 she read her doctoral thesis, \\"L'√©tude des Anneaux de Saturne\\" to a large audience of academics at the Sorbonne, and was awarded the degree of Docteur √®s Sciences; the first woman to do so. Her main subjects were mathematics and mathematical astronomy. The examining committee, composed of Dr. Jean Gaston Darboux and Drs. F√©lix Tisserand and Marie Henri Andoyer were unanimous in their praise. By way of contrast, Harvard awarded its first doctorate in astronomy to Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin in 1925. On February 22, 1934, she was elected a Chevali√®re de la L√©gion d'Honneur with the French President himself presenting the Cross. Shortly after the award, she and Anna moved to San Francisco where she spent the rest of her days. She made endowments to the Paris Observatory, the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, and the University of California to be granted to aspiring astronomers. Asteroids 339 Dorothea and 1040 Klumpkea were named in her honor, as is the Klumpke-Roberts Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

It is divided between Golden Plains Shire, the Shire of Colac Otway and Corangamite Shire. At the 2016 census, Cressy and the surrounding area had a population of 175. Terry Lewis played Australian rules football for Cressy in 1987. Lewis is regarded as one of the greatest footballers Cressy has ever seen. History George Russell, manager of the pastoral Clyde Company, opened up the area to European settlement in 1836. In 1837, a Frenchman named Jean Duverney crossed the Woady Yaloak River, claimed land on both banks, and named the area \\"Frenchman's Run\\". Duverney called the small, developing village Cressy, after Cr√©cy in France, where he was born. Cressy Post Office opened on 1 January 1858. After the outbreak of World War II, an airfield was constructed south of the town towards Colac, and was used by the RAAF until 1946 as a combat training base and for bombing practice. Cressy airfield had three airstrips, two about 300 metres long with a drained gravel surface and a grass airstrip about 900 metres long. Two large Bellman hangars were used for aircraft maintenance. The local history group at the church has some photos and information on the airmen and the planes involved. Several RAAF aircraft crashed in the vicinity during the war. The tranquil local cemetery, surrounded by old trees, is still in use. Railways The first railway to reach Cressy was an extension of the line from Colac to Beeac. This opened in December 1910, and by September 1911, the line had been extended north to Newtown, where it joined the line to Ballarat. In September 1910 work began at Cressy on the Western Plains Railway. This line ran joined the line to Ararat at Maroona, and the lines to Geelong at Gheringhap. Cressy, being at the junction of the two cross-country lines, became an important railway centre, with extensive buildings, railway yards and a turntable. Buildings included station offices, refreshment rooms and an elevated signal box. The line from Colac to Newtown was closed in 1953. Very few traces of Cressy station now remain. Terry Lewis Era Terry Lewis was an Australian Rules Football Player. A hard fighting inside midfielder with a booming right foot was a major recruitment for the Cressy Demons during the 1980s. Terry's arrival at the demons brought much needed relief to the struggling football team and community. Travellers flocked from all around Australia to witness this footballing hero play in what many said at the time was a league well below his standards. With Terry's unbelievable on field and off field performances Cressy was put on the map as a must visit. It was said that the club had a competition between Terry and the remainder of the senior playing group competing to see whether Terry or the combined group of footballers could drink more Heineken Lager in which Terry was never defeated. However, when all was looking up for the beloved team and the surrounding town tragedy struck when partner and love of Terry's life Michelle O‚ÄôConnor desired a change of scenery. Terry moved to Bell Park Sport & Recreation Club. This began the downfall of the Cressy Demons who shortly went into recess in 1998 due to the loss of star player and club attraction as the Western Plains FL merged with the Lexton FL. The town barely survived currently populating less than 200 people and continuing to fall. Cressy in recent times Cressy was once a bustling town with several shops, garages, churches and a thriving railway station. Cressy still boasts many interesting old buildings, although many were destroyed in the fires of 1977 which also killed three people. There are two beautiful old churches, and the Cressy Historical Society is now housed in the Presbyterian Church, opposite the old Post Office and general store. The church was built in 1862 and is open for research on the first Sunday of every month. The Cressy police station closed in 2010. The old post office and telephone exchange was built in 1924 at a cost of ¬£5,000. After it was closed it was turned into a family home. It opened as a cafe and mixed business which operated until 2014. The public restrooms back onto a picnic spot with a new children's playground. The town football team went into recess in 1998 after the Western Plains FL merged with the Lexton FL.

History  Savanuru was one of the princely states of British India, under the Bombay Presidency, and later the Deccan States Agency. Its Muslim rulers, styled \\"Nawab\\" descended from Abdul Karim Khan, an Afghan in the service of the Mughal Empire, who received a grant near Delhi in 1672. His successors ruled over extensive territories almost independently for over a century. However, Savanuru was located between the increasing power of the Marathas and the equally powerful Nizam of Hyderabad, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, which gradually eroded away Savanuru's territory. By the second half of the eighteenth century, more than half of Savanuru had been ceded to the Marathas. By the end of the century, Tipu Sultan had annexed the remainder. With the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799, independence returned to Savanuru with about a third of its original territory. Thereafter, Savanuru slowly drifted towards British suzerainty. After the destruction of the Maratha Confederacy in 1818, Savanuru accepted protection from British India. The final ruling Nawab of Savanuru, Abdul Majid Khan II, succeeded as a minor at the age of two years, and had been carefully raised and educated by his British overseers. He traveled widely and mixed with people in all walks of life in India and abroad. He returned to assume power determined to modernize his state, engaging in a furious program of building modern schools, dispensaries, government offices, courts, palaces, jails, irrigation tanks, and roads. In the short period of thirty-five years of his active rule, this little state advanced beyond anything achieved in the previous three centuries. The advent of Indian independence in 1947 and the withdrawal of the British caused the Nawab great sadness. Once the transfer formalities were completed, he retired to his private mansion at Dharwad, never setting foot in Savanuru again. After his death in 1954, local authorities, out of sincere respect for a distinguished gentleman held in high regard almost universally, buried him in his beloved Savanuru. The great scholarly saint Shri Satyabodha Tirtha's Brindavana is present at Savanur. https://www.uttaradimath.org/parampara/sri-satyabodha-tirtha We get some important information in the Bombay Gazetteer, Karnataka Dharwad district Chapter III . Page Nos 58-59 edited and published by James M. Campbell, compiled in the year 1863 A.D Shri Satyabodha Vijaya is a kavya of twenty one sargas written by Kanchi Achrya who was his own disciple. The Mahakavya describes his life in detail. He was a saint of marvelous powers, his life is full of thrilling events. Let alone Hindus, even Mohammedanas worshipped him with great reverence, Tippu Sultan, Nawab of Ramnad, Nawab of Savanuru and many other Muslim princes felt it an honour. Grand annual celebrations are conducted during Phalguna Krishna Pratipat (March/April). Shri Satyabodha Teertha was the pontiff of the Uttaradi Matha for 39 years. Savanuru(‡≤∏‡≤µ‡≤£‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å) State covered an area of 189 square kilometers in 1901. It acceded to Dominion of India on 8 March 1948. It is currently a part of Karnataka State. Successors: Prince Of Savanuru Md.Hussain Ahsan (Khan)(9th Generation Nawab), Prince Of Savanuru Md.Najeeb Hussain (Khan) (9th Generation Nawab), Princess Of Savanuru Sana Rauf Hussain (Khan)(9th Generation Nawab), Princess Of Savanuru Ainan Rauf Hussain (Khan)(9th Generation Nawab). Demographics India census, Savanur had a population of 35,561. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Savanur has an average literacy rate of 49%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 54%, and female literacy is 43%. In Savanur, 16% of the population is under 6 years of age. The Savanuru Boababs Dodda Hunise Mara, as it is known in the native language Kannada, is the proverbial baobab tree (Adansonia digitata). Savanuru might be the only place in the state of Karnataka or rather in whole India, which boasts of having three big Baobab trees on the outskirts of the town. This species of tree reaches heights of between 5‚Äì25 m (exceptionally 30 m) tall, and up to 7 m (exceptionally 11 m) in trunk diameter. The specimens at Savanuru are exceptional by all standards; the biggest one measures above 18 m at girth, the second one above 16 m and the third one above 14 m. These are planted in a triangular shape and stand together closely. The state government has put up a fence to protect the trees and a board briefly describing the history of the trees, which also gives the statistics about height and girth.

To Gabriel, this video demonstrated the power of video to capture the world‚Äôs attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses. WITNESS was founded the next year, in 1992, with a one million dollar seed grant from the Reebok Human Rights Foundation and a partnership with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (now Human Rights First). In 1999, WITNESS.org was utilizing streaming video as a part of its mission and was a finalist for RealNetworks, Inc. Streamers Progressive Award as the year's best non-profit streaming media organization losing out to Assistive Media. In 2001, WITNESS became an independent nonprofit organization. In 2012, WITNESS released a 20 year timeline about the organization. In 2004, WITNESS started hosting a benefit dinner and concert called \\"Focus for Change.\\" The event brings together video activists, funders, and celebrities to share the work of WITNESS' partners. In 2009, WITNESS initiated a focused use of social media as a part of its outreach for video for change. Since 2009, the organization started reporting social media statistics in the organization's performance reports. In 2012, WITNESS launched a joint project with Storyful and YouTube called the Human Rights Channel. WITNESS has worked in over 80 countries to advance human rights through the use of video for change. Today, WITNESS has a staff of 30 and a $3.9 million budget. Campaigns WITNESS has worked with over 300 organizations in over 80 countries since its founding. On February 18, 2015, the New York Times article, ‚ÄúThe Media Doesn‚Äôt Care What Happens Here‚Äù, featured WITNESS‚Äô work in Brazil and their groundbreaking video as evidence initiative with media activists operating in the country's favelas. Other programs include: =Training= WITNESS has developed training kits to help activists and videographers use video effectively and safely to support their advocacy campaigns. WITNESS gives access to their educational materials through their online library. Other resources: Espa√±ol, Fran√ßais, Portugu√™s, ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ ÿ£ÿπÿØÿßÿØ. They have released the WITNESS Video for Change Book, a document intended to teach human rights, environmental, and social justice organizations how to use video most effectively in campaigns. They have also created an Advocacy Planning Toolkit, an interactive step-by-step guide to help advocates and organizations develop a strategic video advocacy plan. =Cameras Everywhere= WITNESS partnered with the Guardian Project to begin the Cameras Everywhere program with the goal of ensuring that human rights videos are created and distributed safely, effectively, and ethically. The focus of the Cameras Everywhere project is SecureSmartCam, a program that runs on smartphones to ensure the safety and authenticity of human rights videos. The safety of activists is the goal of the ObscureCam, which detects and blurs faces in photos and videos. Video support is under development as of March 2012. The authenticity of the video is the goal of InformaCam, which automatically records and encrypts information such as the GPS coordinates of the camera during filming, and nearby wireless signals. The Cameras Everywhere Report lays out a call to technology companies, investors, policymakers and civil society to work to use technology for the benefit of human rights. 2015: The Quest For Social Justice Goes Mobile =Gender-based violence= WITNESS provides support to activists and survivors of gender-based violence by empowering them use video to share their stories, make their voices heard and catalyze the change they seek in their lives.

Femicide in Mexico: In March 2009, Mexico's Attorney General and Minister of Interior committed to personally follow-up on the cases of Neyra Cervantes, who was brutally murdered in 2003, and her cousin, David Meza who spent three years in jail after being tortured into confessing to her murder. This agreement was the outcome of a meeting between Peter Gabriel, actor Diego Luna, Jaguares‚Äô Sa√∫l Hern√°ndez, Patricia Cervantes (Neyra‚Äôs mother) and Mexico‚Äôs President Calder√≥n, asking him to end feminicide in Ciudad Ju√°rez and Chihuahua, Mexico. Since the meeting, WITNESS partner Comisi√≥n Mexicana has met twice with government officials, who are reviewing the status of the proceedings of Neyra/David‚Äôs cases and studying the list of priority policies related to ending feminicide. Neyra‚Äôs story is the focus of the film, Dual Injustice, co-produced by WITNESS and (CMDPDH). The video was part of a successful international WITNESS campaign in 2006 calling for Miguel David Meza‚Äôs release and a further investigation into Neyra‚Äôs case to ensure that justice will be served for all families suffering similar fates. Discrimination against Akhdam Women in Yemen: In 2009, Witness partnered with the Sisters Arab Forum (SAF) to produce a documentary called ‚ÄúBreaking the Silence,‚Äù about the plight of Akhdam women in Yemen. The video is currently banned in Yemen, and both Witness and SAF are working to repeal the ban. =Middle East and North Africa transitions= Witness launched a program in 2011 to support the transition to democracy in the Middle East and North Africa following the Arab Spring. This program includes: a partnership with the Egyptian Democratic Adademy (EDA); hosting a human rights convening in the region to identify immediate needs; identifying, disseminating and translating innovative tools and tactics; and developing new apps for human rights in the region. =Child Soldiers= 2007: WITNESS teamed with AJEDI-Ka/PES to create a video to oppose the recruitment of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The partnership sought to bring to justice those responsible for the crimes that led to the 2007 war crimes charges by the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. The resulting film, A Duty to Protect. was screened at a high-level panel discussion at U.N. Headquarters in November 2007 following the arrest by the ICC of a second DRC warlord for the use of child soldiers. Witness partnered with Amnesty International to develop a companion curriculum for the film. 2009: The trial against Mr. Dyilo begun in January 2009. Three more warlords have been arrested and are currently awaiting trial at the ICC for the use of child soldiers in the DRC. 2012: On March 14, 2012, Thomas Lubanga was convicted of using child soldiers - a war crime. 2015: Court of Appeals Upholds Conviction of Congolese Warlord Thomas Lubanga. =Infrastructure= Following screenings to decision-makers in Chechnya and globally in 2009, Human Rights Center Memorial achieved significant advocacy success by securing the Chechen government's funding for rebuilding homes and other infrastructure in the Zumsoy, Chechnya. =Human trafficking= Modern-Day Slavery in Brazil: In 2007, Bound by Promises, a film about modern-day slavery in rural Brazil, was screened before the Brazilian Congress‚Äô Human Rights Commission, and has proven instrumental in getting the Mobile Inspection Squads to resume the investigation of claims made by runaway slaves. Bound by Promises has also led to greater investments in programs for workers. Human Sex Trafficking in the United States: In 2012, WITNESS co-produced a 21-minute advocacy video called What I Have Been Through Is Not Who I Am, with ECPAT-USA. The short documentary tells the story of Katrina, a child who was trafficked for sex in the United States. =Elder abuse= Elder abuse in the United States of America: In 2009, WITNESS and National Council on Aging (NCOA) produced An Age for Justice: Confronting Elder Abuse in America, a film providing proof of the financial, emotional and physical abuse that up to an estimated five million older Americans face every year. =Climate change= Witness joined the \\"iMatter Trust Campaign\\" with Our Children's Trust, the iMatter Campaign and students from Montana State University‚Äôs MFA in Science and Natural History Filmmaking to co-produce a series of videos highlighting how climate change and government inaction is affecting the everyday lives of our youth. =Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)= 2007: Footage from Burma Issues was used to buttress a critical BBC Newsnight item that criticized the Labor administration in the UK for its minimal levels of funding to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Burma. This broadcast helped push the UK government to conduct an official review that, in July 2007, recommended a four-fold increase in aid to IDPs in Burma. =The Hub: Human Rights Media Center= Witness launched the Hub in 2007 as a single point for users to upload human rights video, that might not be uploadable elsewhere. Because those needs have been fulfilled by other sources, the Hub has now become an archive for the content that had previously been uploaded.

There are two classes of NIR's. A multi haem enzyme reduces NO2‚àí to a variety of products. Copper containing enzymes carry out a single electron transfer to produce nitric oxide.  Iron based  There are several types of iron based enzymes. Cytochrome cd1, or Pseudomonas cytochrome oxidase contains two c and two d type hemes with two polypeptide chains. Different forms of this reductase catalyze the formation of nitric oxide or nitrous oxide. A version of this compound was originally called [Ferrocytochrome c-551:oxidoreductase]. It was initially considered an oxidase. It catalyzes the reduction of NO2‚àí to NO. This tetraheme enzyme has two subunits, each containing a c-type and a d-type heme. The reduced d hemes bind nitrite and convert it to product. Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNIR) is a multiheme enzyme that converts nitrite to ammonia on each active site. The active site iron is bound to a protoporphyrin IX ring that is covalently linked to the enzyme's proteins. = Proposed mechanism = The ccNIR protein uses six electrons and seven hydrogens to reduce nitrite to ammonia. The active site of the enzyme contains an iron in a +2 oxidation state. The oxidation level allows nitrite to bond more strongly than to the +3 state due to increased pi backbonding. This electronic effect transfers electron density into the nitrite antibonding orbital between nitrogen and oxygen. The occupation of the LUMO decreases the strength of the N-O bond. A second electronic effect is the hydrogen bonding of both oxygens to nearby amino acids. These acids are often arginine and Histidine. The interactions lengthen the N-O bonds and facilitate cleavage of an oxygen from nitrogen. The Fe-NO bond is linear and has six shared valence electrons. This is not a stable state for an Fe-NO bond. However, a bent seven electron configuration is too stable to undergo further reaction without considerable energy input. To compensate for this barrier, two rapid, consecutive, single electron reductions form an eight electron complex. The electron transfer occurs before a shift in geometry from a linear to bent geometry. Two protonations of the nitrogen lead to an increased N-O bond distance. The resulting intermediate is a hydroxylamine. further protonation of the hydroxylamine leads to the breakage of the N-O bond to form water. The oxidation of iron from Fe(II) to Fe(III), coupled with a further protonation of nitrogen leads to the release of ammonia.  Copper based  To date, there have been several types of Copper Nitrite Reductases discovered. These CuNIR are found in many different fungi and bacteria; for example, the bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Bordetella, Alcaligenes, and Achromobacter all contain CuNIR. What is common to all CuNIR is the presence of at least one type 1 copper center in the protein. These centers are similar to Azurin in their bonding structure. Each type 1 Cu is strongly bonded to a thiolate sulfur from a cysteine, two imidazole nitrogens from different Histidine residues, and a sulfur atom of an axial Methionine ligand. This induces a distorted tetrahedral molecular geometry. The cysteine ligated to the type 1 Cu center is located directly next to a Histidine in the primary structure of the amino acids. This Histidine is bound to the Type 2 Cu center responsible for binding and reducing nitrite. This Cys-His bridge plays an important role in facilitating rapid electron transfer from the type 1 center to the type 2. = Proposed mechanism = The type 2 copper center of a copper nitrite reductase is the active site of the enzyme. The Cu is bound by nitrogens of two Histidines from one monomer, and bound by one Histidine from another monomer; the Cys-His bridge to the type 1 Cu. This gives the molecule a distorted tetrahedral geometry. In the resting state, the Cu is also binding a water molecule that is displaced by nitrite. As nitrite displaces water, Cu is bound by both oxygens in a bidentate fashion. A nearby Aspartic acid residue hydrogen bonds to one of the newly formed oxygen ligands. An incoming electron reduces the Cu from oxidation state (II) to (I). This change facilitates a shift in nitrite binding so that the nitrogen is bound to Cu, and one oxygen has an extended bond length due to hydrogen bonding. A second hydrogen bond forms from Histidine or a nearby water molecule and leads to the cleavage of the N-O bond. The Cu is now five coordinate bonded to nitric oxide and water. Nitric oxide is released as Cu is oxidized to state (II) and returns to the resting configuration.  Assimilatory  Assimilatory nitrate reductase is an enzyme of the assimilative metabolism involved in reduction of nitrate to nitrite. The nitrite is immediately reduced to ammonia (probably via hydroxylamine) by the activity of nitrite reductase. The term assimilatory refers to the fact that the product of the enzymatic activity remains in the organism. In this case, the product is ammonia which has an inhibitive effect on assimilatory nitrate reductase, thus ensuring that the organism produces the ammonia according to its requirements.

T.'s Theory of Pets is a horror short story by American writer Stephen King. It was originally published in the 1997 limited-edition collection Six Stories. In 2001, it was released as an audiobook with the recording of King reading the story live at Royal Festival Hall in London. In 2002, it was collected in King's collection Everything's Eventual. Plot summary The story is told from the first-person perspective of a working-class husband, who recalls a story told by L. T., a chatty co-worker, about the brewing trouble behind his marriage. These problems are attributed to pets purchased by L. T. and his wife. The wife purchases a dog for L. T. which dislikes him instantly and sides with his wife. Soon, L. T. purchases a cat for his wife, which immediately takes to L.T. instead. Despite the fact that the dog and the cat get along fine, L. T. and his wife continually argue. While riding home in the narrator's car, L.T. asks if his arrogance is to blame. L.T.'s wife eventually leaves him, saying she is going to her mother's house, but fails to arrive there. The narrator reveals that she has taken the dog with her, and her car was discovered abandoned on a deserted roadside in Nevada. The only thing found was her dog, axed to death. It's revealed that a serial killer is on the loose in the area, who kills women with an axe. L.T. still hopes she is alive, although this is unlikely. Inspiration Stephen King said his story is inspired by a Dear Abby editorial about how giving people pets as gifts may be viewed as arrogance in certain circles, because it assuming the receiver can‚Äîand wants to‚Äîlook after the pet. King himself briefly discusses how he received a Pembroke Welsh Corgi as a present, and has enjoyed its company ever since.

She was the mother of Sforza's son, Giovanni Paolo I Sforza, Marquess of Caravaggio. Crivelli has been thought to be the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's painting, La belle ferronni√®re.  La belle ferronni√®re  While unproven, Crivelli has long been presumed to be the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's painting La belle ferronni√®re, which is displayed in the Louvre. The rationale for the Crivelli identification has been primarily based on da Vinci's earlier depiction of Cecilia Gallerani, in his painting, Lady with an Ermine. Gallerani had been an earlier mistress of Sforza. In a 2011 exhibition at the National Gallery, London entitled, Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan (9 November 2011 ‚Äì 5 February 2012), the gallery listed the painting as a possible portrait of Beatrice d'Este, wife of Ludovico Sforza, rather than his mistress, Crivelli.Syson, Luke; and Larry Keith. \\"Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\\", Exhibition Catalogue, London: National Gallery, 2011.  \\"Profile of a young lady: Lucrezia Crivelli\\"  It has been initially suspected by Adolfo Venturi (1933) and then recently found that the Lucrezia Crivelli is not the Belle Ferronni√®re at all. In recent years, the original painting of Lucrezia Crivelli, that has been kept in the family for centuries, has been shown to the public, during an important exhibition in Speyer (Historisches Museum from June 19 to November 19, 1995) . But regardless of the enormous success of the painting amongst the general public, the striking elements of the real Crivelli painting are to be found in the examination made by Pinin Barcillon Brambilla ( the restorer of the Last Supper ) who found that some pigments are the same of the Milanese mural .The Speyer Lady - Nathalie Guttmann . File:Crivelli.jpgProfile of a Young Lady (Lucrezia Crivelli)  Personal background  Crivelli was a lady-in-waiting to Ludovico Sforza's wife, Beatrice d'Este (29 June 1475 ‚Äì 2 January 1497). During this time, she also became the mistress of Sforza. In 1497, she gave birth to his son, Giovanni Paolo.Cawley, Charles. ', Dukes of Milan Sforza's affair with Crivelli caused much distress to his wife, who was considered accomplished and cultured. Upon learning of the affair, d'Este tried without success to have Crivelli banished from court. Crivelli's son by Sforza, Giovanni Paolo I Sforza (March 1497 ‚Äì December 1535), became the first Marquess of Caravaggio, as well as a celebrated condottiero. He married Violante Bentivoglio (1505‚Äì1550), a granddaughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, by his mistress Lucrezia Landriani. The marriage produced a son and a daughter. Ludovico Sforza died in 1508. Crivelli lived for many years in Rocca di Canneto in Mantua, under the protection of Isabella d'Este, the elder sister of Beatrice, who had died in January 1497.

The report examined the problems that drug cartels and drug money laundering in South and Central America and the Caribbean posed for American law enforcement and foreign policy. The Sub-Committee was chaired at the time by Democratic Party Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts, so that the report is often referred to under his name. The report was released on April 13, 1989, Hosted on National Security Archives and included discussions of drug trafficking in the Bahamas, Colombia, Cuba and Nicaragua, Haiti, Honduras, and Panama. The longest chapter in the report was on narcotics trafficking and the Nicaraguan Contras. The Subcommittee determined that there was \\"substantial evidence of drug smuggling... on the part of individual Contras, Contra suppliers, Contra pilots, mercenaries who worked with the Contras, and Contra supporters\\".. It \\"did not find that Contra leaders were personally involved in drug trafficking\\". Background Press accounts concerning links between the Contras and drug traffickers, which began with a December 1985 story by the Associated Press, led to a review by the United States Department of State, U.S. Department of Justice and relevant U.S. intelligence agencies in 1986. In April 1986, the State Department informed Congress that it had \\"evidence of a limited number of incidents in which known drug traffickers tried to establish connections with Nicaraguan resistance groups.\\" Hearings begin In April 1986, John Kerry and Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, proposed that hearings be conducted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding charges of Contra involvement in cocaine and marijuana trafficking. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, the Republican chairman of the committee, agreed to conduct the hearings. Findings The Kerry Committee report found that \\"the Contra drug links included... Payments to drug traffickers by the U.S. State Department of funds authorized by the Congress for humanitarian assistance to the Contras, in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcement agencies on drug charges, in others while traffickers were under active investigation by these same agencies.\\" Reception The report did not initially receive significant news coverage.

While he was young he accompanied his father to live in Beijing, but the Taiping rebellion forced them to flee to the lower Yangtze delta. Although he studied the Confucian classics as a child, in 1862 he became interested in Buddhism after reading a copy of the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana (Â§ß‰πòËµ∑‰ø°Ë´ñ d√†ch√©ng q«êx√¨n l√πn). In 1866 he moved to Nanjing to manage architectural engineering projects for the government, where his Buddhist beliefs were strengthened through contact with other lay Buddhists. It was not long after that he and several friends raised money to establish the Jinling Sutra Publishing House (ÈáëÂáåÂàªÁ∂ìËôï Jƒ´nl√≠ng k√®jƒ´ng ch√π), Jinling being an old name for Nanjing. In 1878 he left China to visit England and France, bringing back several scientific instruments which he donated to researchers in China. During another trip to England he met the Japanese Buddhist Nanjo Bunyu (ÂçóÊù°ÊñáÈõÑ) and started a correspondence with him. With Nanj≈ç's help, Yang was able to import over 300 sutra texts from Japan that had been lost within China. In 1894 he worked with the British missionary Timothy Richard (ÊùéÊèêÊë©Â§™) to translate Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana into English.The Awakening of Faith of Ashvagosha index at www.sacred-texts.comTarocco, Francesca (2008).

The spherical candy, which weighs 3 grams, has an outer shell that is pure milk chocolate and a hollow interior containing candies. The wonder ball is wrapped in foil, placed in a small box, and packaged with a collectible sticker. There is also a version of the Wonder Ball called the Wonder Ball Plus Prize that contains a chocolate ball filled with tangy dextrose candy, stickers and a small capsule with a relevant toy inside.  History  The Wonder Ball was first introduced in the mid 1990s. The product's slogan was \\"What's In the Wonder Ball?\\" Originally called Nestl√© Magic Ball, the product contained small figurines of Disney characters, similar to the Kinder Surprise which retails in Europe, Canada, and Mexico. The product was withdrawn in 1997 after competitors and consumer groups campaigned that the toy posed a choking hazard. In April 2000, the Wonder Ball was re-released with candy in place of the toys. The Wonder Ball had a variety of themes, including Disney, Pok√©mon, Cartoon Network, Care Bears, and Winnie the Pooh. In 2004, the brand was sold to Frankford, who released it under a SpongeBob SquarePants theme. An urban legend has circulated that the product was discontinued because a child choked and died, but there was no confirmation that the discontinuation was due to choking allegations. After a 9-year absence, Frankford re-released the Wonder Ball with Despicable Me themed candy and stickers in February 2016. Also, it released Shopkins, Dinosaurs, Disney and Halloween. Wonder Ball Minis were released as two smaller Wonder Balls packaged together to enable sharing. They released in 2017 with Disney and Disney/Pixar characters. Wonder Ball Plus Prizes features a normal size Wonder Ball with stickers and a separated capsule with a prize inside.

A brief preamble to the first book describes a system failure that leaves the starship Phoenix stranded in some far-flung reach of space, without any idea of how to get home, completely unable even to locate Sol in the visible stars. Phoenix is carrying colonists and equipment to establish a new space station to extend Earth's interstellar trade empire. Sketched in the preamble is the heroic effort to refuel Phoenix in the environs of a hostile sun, and navigate the lost starship to a more habitable environment. Lost to this effort are many of the best and bravest of the crew. The habitable environment that the damaged starship can reach is the homeworld of the atevi, a green and living world, already populated by aliens with steam age technology. The humans build their station in orbit around the atevi world but tensions build between the colonists and the Phoenix crew. The Pilot's Guild, comfortable with the power it has accrued during the emergency, and stripped of its best elements by the battle to refuel, has become oppressive and oligarchic. When the refueled Phoenix leaves to explore the local space and establish a further station the colonists become restless. When Phoenix is slow to return, some of the colonists choose to abandon the station in parachuting landers (much akin to NASA's Project Mercury), despite the efforts of the remaining Pilot's Guild to retain the colonists and control, until the space station becomes unviable and is abandoned entirely. On the surface the humans encounter the atevi, a race of ebon-skinned humanoids, for whom math is as intrinsic as breathing. Atevi possess no directly corresponding concept of liking or loving another person, but instead place utmost importance on a concept called man‚Äôchi, most directly analogous to loyalty. Man'chi is not merely a cultural construct, but is an intrinsic drive, a natural instinct to follow a leader, and is therefore a difference between the two races that cannot be bridged. After an initial period of peaceful co-existence, cross- cultural misunderstandings lead to the War of the Landing. Despite their vast technological advantage the colonists lose, and swiftly. In the aftermath of the war, the atevi government abandons the island of Mospheira to allow the establishment of an enclave for the human colonists. Only one human, the paidhi (interpreter), is allowed to live among atevi and learn one of their languages. All communication between the atevi and the humans is via this single point of contact. On the island of Mospheira the colonists prosper. As part of the treaty of the landing that ceded Mospheira to humans a succession of paidhiin broker a slow, careful, managed transfer of technology to the atevi, all the while creating dictionaries so that the next paidhi can further the work of understanding and technology transfer. Fast forward 200 years. The colonists on Mospheira are comfortable and self-absorbed. The atevi are close to technological parity, and have outpaced the humans in some areas. All seems peaceful and manageable. Against this background the main story of the first book of the series unfolds as, unknown to the main protagonist, paidhi Bren Cameron, Phoenix returns to orbit. The remaining books focus on the interrelations among Bren Cameron, Tabini (the Aiji, the head of the most powerful atevi clan, keystone of the atevi western association, and thus effective supreme ruler of the atevi government), his atevi associates, the human enclave of Mospheira, the humans aboard Phoenix, and an alien presence in the nearer stars. The first eight books of the series are told exclusively from the viewpoint of Bren Cameron, the paidhi at the time of Phoenix's return. Starting with the ninth book, Deliverer, occasional passages are told from the point of view of Tabini's young son, Cajeiri, as he grows into maturity. Major characters and other important persons *Bren Cameron, paidhi and later paidhi-aiji, translator to the court of Tabini. *Tabini, Aiji of Shejidan, supreme leader of the atevi. *Ilisidi, the Aiji-dowager, grandmother of Tabini, and twice denied the throne by the hasdrawad; a house of the atevi parliament. *Banichi, Bren's male Assassin's Guild guard, assigned from Tabini's own staff in the first novel together with Jago. *Jago, Bren's female Assassin's Guild guard. Later becomes Bren‚Äôs lover. *Cajeiri, minor son of Tabini, presumed heir to the aishidi'tat. *Damiri, partner of Tabini and mother of Cajeiri. Has problematic family connections. *Tatiseigi, a conservative Lord of the Northern Association, uncle of Tabini's wife (Damiri), great-uncle of Cajeiri. *Geigi, a provincial lord, trusted ally of Ilisidi. *Machigi, one of several lords of the Marid Association, a southern territory nominally in rebellion against Tabini. *Ramirez, seniormost of the Phoenix captains when it arrived at the atevi homeworld. Keeper of many secrets. *Ogun, a captain of Phoenix, second only to Ramirez. *Sabin, a captain of Phoenix, second only to Ogun. *Jason Graham, Phoenix crew selected by the captains to learn Ragi (the dominant atevi language). =Spelling= Cherryh frequently misspells the name of the riding animals used in the books, generally going between mecheita / mecheiti and mechieta / mechieti. The official spelling is mecheita / mecheiti as stated in the entries dated 10/18/04 and 10/19/04 of her Progress Report: > Mecheita is a hoot‚Äîon the same page, usually meticulous me has \\"mechieta,\\" > \\"mecheita,\\" \\"mechieita,\\" and I'm wickedly tempted to standardize it as \\"ie\\" > in the singular and \\"ei\\" in the plural, just to drive the copyeditors > berserk, but hey, it would drive me there first. It is officially \\"mecheita, > pl. mecheiti.\\" The clan name of the Kadagidi also changes. Early in the series it is spelled \\"Kadigidi\\" and then, in the 8th book, Pretender, it inexplicably changes to \\"Kadagidi\\" for the remainder of the series. Story arcs Each arc consists of three novels. Each arc deals with an entire storyline, although there are cross-connections as the series has progressed. Roughly 10 years of time are supposed to have elapsed (per the novel) from Book 1, Foreigner, to Book 8, Pretender. *Arc 1 (Foreigner, Invader, Inheritor): focuses on an assassination attempt against Bren Cameron, an act illegal by the peace treaty made following the War of the Landing. The attempt proves to be a conspiracy by factions of humans and atevi to depose Bren as the paidhi, or official translator between the two cultures. The Starship Phoenix returns, causing the entire system to come out of balance, causing political unrest on both Mospheira and the mainland, and while the atevi change from simple rocketry to advanced single-stage-to-orbit shuttles, radically altering their economic and industrial base in the process. *Arc 2 (Precursor, Defender, Explorer): focuses on Bren as he is elevated by Tabini to be the Lord of the Heavens, making him a lord of the aishidi'tat with authority to negotiate. Bren is then charged with taking Tabini's heir, Cajeiri, and Ilisidi, Cajeiri's great grandmother, to see to a threat of aliens encountered by Phoenix, but Bren and the aiji-dowager must first solve a mutiny aboard Phoenix. *Arc 3 (Destroyer, Pretender, Deliverer): focuses on the return of Bren Cameron, Ilisidi and Cajeiri from deep space and their encounter with the alien Kyo. They find the aishidi'tat in tatters, Tabini-aiji rumored to be dead, and Murini, the pretender-aiji, on the throne in Shejidan. The kyo will expect to meet a unified planet under the rule of Tabini-aiji. Bren, the dowager, and the aiji must restore order before the kyo arrive for negotiations. *Arc 4 (Conspirator, Deceiver, Betrayer): set in the immediate aftermath of the third arc, and is set against the shifting political relations between the different Atevi ethnic factions. With Tabini restored in Shejidan, Cameron must find a way to stabilise the Eastern and coastal regions where he has his own Lordly estate. The peace gained with the restoration of Tabini's rule is threatened by long standing ethnic and cultural differences between the ruling Ragi Atevi and the more conservative Edi and Eastern clans. *Arc 5 (Intruder, Protector, Peacemaker): Arc is about Cajeiri's felicitous 9th birthday, the final disposition of the Shadow Guild, and the birth of the Aiji's daughter. *Arc 6 (Tracker, Visitor, Convergence): For the past two arcs, Bren has focused on Atevi associations and political conflicts. In this arc, Bren must address the political situation on Alpha station resulting from the influx of Reunioners, as the Kyo approach to visit. Then Bren revisits Mospheira, and explains how politics and the world have changed while he has been dealing with everything else. Several chapters are from the view of Cajeiri. *Arc 7 (Emergence, Resurgence, Divergence) Genre As with many of C. J. Cherryh's novels, this series could be best described as anthropological science fiction, focusing on the interface between our human customs and understandings and that of an alien race whose motivations, thoughts and even feelings are diametrically opposed to our own. Broadly speaking, the series could also be described as space opera, especially the second and third story arcs. It also contains elements of political thriller, with the complex racial and cultural interplay between humans and atevi, and between ship crew and colonist. Like other works, such as the Chanur novels, Cuckoo's Egg and her other alien centered novels, the Foreigner series brings in a peppering of alien names and concepts attached to the language. The atevi have no feeling immediately equivalent to love, but rather man'chi‚Äîa loyalty-web to one's leader, one's leader's leader, and so on outward until the Aiji of Shejidan, leader of the aishidi'tat or union of all atevi. Political boundaries are not based on territory, but on association‚Äîwhere their man'chi lies. Inherent to the mental structure of an atevi is arithmetical ability we would consider intuitive and a world viewed in arithmetical terms. The main atevi language Ragi is a continual mathematic construct. Properly forming statements requires effort similar to a mathematician keeping equations balanced. Stringently asserted is the idea that the number two to the atevi is disharmonious and as unnerving as fingernails on a chalkboard is to humans. The number three however is \\"felicitous\\", and ideas are spoken using felicitous numbers ‚Äì unless the speaker wishes to convey disharmony or anti-social ideas to their audience. Another aspect of atevi culture that is critical to the stories, particularly the political thriller aspect, is that assassination is a legal and accepted means of settling disputes, provided proper protocol is followed. It is preferred over lawsuits. One files a document of Intent which liberates the target to file one back. The Assassin's Guild has the right, often exercised when Intent is filed for foolish reasons, to reject a particular filing. For this reason, the assassins' guild (commonly referred to as simply \\"the guild\\") has considerable power, despite being supposedly neutral. Assassins are also employed as bodyguards, and often need to defend against attacks by others of their own guild. Cover artwork Almost all of Cherryh's DAW covers, including Book 1 of the Foreigner series, are from artist Michael Whelan. Todd Lockwood picked up where Whelan left off for the remaining books. Consequently, the cover art for the series maintains a fairly consistent look and feel. Every cover to date but three has featured the protagonist Bren Cameron as the sole adult human visually pictured along with one or more armed Atevi. Both Protector and Peacemaker covers have human children and human armored security, and Convergence has added Toby, Bren's brother, to emphasize that in the later books, as well as being Bren's closest human advisor, Toby is designated as Bren's replacement should he get killed. This serves to visually emphasize Bren's, and the human refugees in general, patently foreign presence among this aggressive alien race. Bren's Atevi lover, Jago and most of his bodyguard or Aishid appear on most of the covers; Jago's father Banichi makes an appearance on all the covers save one; this may both exacerbate and ease the reader's sense of the protagonist's isolation. Several of the artists hired to paint the covers have taken Cherryh's description of the white ribbons in Bren's hair and extended it to the entirety of his clothing, white, showing no attachment to any house. However, this is an artistic license. He is described as wearing muted colors: beiges, blues and greens; and he only wears all white in very formal occasions in the later books. Adaptations An audio drama of the first three books of the Foreigner series was scheduled for production in 2013, however the effort was suspended. The books were being adapted by award-winning audio dramatist Sable Jak for Audio Cinema Entertainment. Jak worked closely with Cherryh on the project, and was to direct the six-hour production. Audible.com has released the first 19 books as single-narrator audiobooks. The narrator is Daniel Thomas May.

A member of the gens Valeria, an old patrician family believed to have migrated to Rome under the Sabine king T. Tatius, Laevinus played an integral role in the containment of the Macedonian threat.  Background and early career  Map showing Apulia, where Laevinus was stationed in 215 BC. Laevinus was the son of P. Valerius Laevinus, and grandson of P. Valerius Laevinus. The latter may have been the consul of 280 BC whom Pyrrhus of Epirus defeated at Heraclea.Broughton. MRR. p.190-191. Praetor of Sicily in 227.Solinus 5.1; M. Laevinus was first elected consul in 220. His consulship, however, was annulled, likely due to accusations of a faulty election. In 215, during the Second Punic War, Laevinus was elected praetor peregrinusLivy 23.24.4 with command of the Roman forces in Apulia.Polybius 8.1.6; Eutropius 3.12.3 Stationed in Brundisium, Laevinus was appointed to act as a deterrent to any potential advance from the Macedonian king, Philip V, who had allied his forces with the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca who had invaded Italy.Polyb. 7.9.1 Valerius was thereby tasked with monitoring activities on the Adriatic Sea, through which he assumed command over the bulk of the Roman fleet.Polyb. 8.1.6  First Macedonian War  The Mediterranean during 218 BC, showing Italy, Carthage, and Greece. As praetor peregrinus, Laevinus commanded the Roman fleet off the Adriatic coast during the First Macedonian War,Eutr. 3.12.3 which occurred contemporaneously with the Second Punic War against Carthage. Rome's preoccupation with war against Carthage provided an opportunity for Philip V of Macedon to extend his power westward. Following the Carthaginian victory over Rome at Cannae in 216, Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy to negotiate an alliance against Rome. On their journey back to Macedon, the emissaries were captured by P. Valerius Flaccus, commander of the Roman fleet patrolling the southern Apulian coast. A letter from Hannibal to Philip, as well as the terms of their agreement, was discovered, much to Rome‚Äôs dismay.Polyb. 7.9; Livy 23.33-34 Coin of Philip V of Macedon, whom Laevinus fought against in the First Macedonian War. Laevinus, who was stationed at Brundisium, was given command of two legions and a fleet of fifty-five ships. With these, he was tasked with guarding the Italian Adriatic coast and monitoring Philip‚Äôs movements. If they were hostile, Laevinus was to cross the Adriatic and keep Philip confined to Macedon, so as to prevent him from providing any assistance to Hannibal in Italy. Throughout 214, Laevinus‚Äô forces provided aid to several Roman allies under Macedonian threat. He successfully recaptured Oricum from the Macedonians by conducting an attack at night, thereby ambushing Philip‚Äôs army. According to Livy, the Macedonians feared him so much they burned their boats to avoid facing his ships again.Livy 24.40.1-17 Laevinus also relieved the siege of Apollonia and saved Tarentum.Livy 23.38.8-12; 24.20.12-16 Map depicting Macedon in orange, and the Aetolian League in grey. = The Aetolian League = Preoccupied by the ongoing conflict with Hannibal and the Carthaginians, Rome was unable to send a force large enough to effectively deal with the Macedonian threat. Instead, they decided to form an alliance with one of Macedonia‚Äôs long-term enemies in Greece, the Aetolians.Hoyos. Punic Wars. p.235-6. In 212 BC, Laevinus was sent to begin negotiations with both the Aetolian League and Attalus I of Pergamum, which successfully concluded in the autumn of 211.Rosenstein. Rome and the Mediterranean. p.155. The provisions of the treaty were generous to the Aetolians, but they were expected to do the bulk of the fighting, with Rome supplying naval support. Following the agreement, Laevinus wasted no time; he captured Zakynthos, and the Arcananian cities of Oeniadae and Nasos before wintering on Corcyra.Livy 26.24 = Governorship of Sicily = In late 211, Laevinus was sent to Sicily as governor in place of M. Claudius Marcellus.Livy 26.40.1 At the time, Mutines, a Carthaginian general, had been replaced as commander of the Numidian cavalry and betrayed Agrigentum to the Romans in revenge for the demotion.Livy 26.40.3-8 According to Livy, Laevinus treated the city‚Äôs leading citizens brutally to make an example of them. Shortly after, he received voluntary surrenders from forty Sicilian towns, and captured another twenty- six by betrayal or force, thus ending the war in Sicily.Livy 26.40.9-12  210 BC consulship and proconsulship  = Consulship = The following spring, whilst besieging Anticyra in the Gulf of Corinth, Laevinus received news that he had been elected consul in absentia, with M. Claudius Marcellus (IV) as his colleague. P. Sulpicius took over his duties in the east, and Laevinus withdrew to Rome.Livy 26.26.1-4 Triumph of Rome over Sicily by Jacopo Ripanda, depicting Rome's conquest of Sicily. Livy describes both Laevinus and Marcellus as \\"fond of war... over-enterprising and impetuous\\", and states that they would have most likely allowed the war against Carthage and Macedonia to continueLivy 26.26.11‚Äîwhich, indeed, they did. Their election was plagued with controversy, as Marcellus was accused by Syracusans of committing acts of brutality in Sicily. Although he was found not guilty, the Senate swapped the commands of the consuls, sending Marcellus to fight Hannibal and placing Laevinus in charge of Sicily.Plutarch, Life of Marcellus, 23; Livy 26.30-31  Senatorial donations to the public treasury  Whilst Laevinus was in Rome, he was confronted with a lack of public funds and the distressing state of the public treasury after years of war.Hoyos. Punic Wars. p.380. In response to this, the consuls demanded that the citizens supply funds to the treasury to finance the conscription of oarsmenLivy 26.35.2-4. The citizens, however, stood vehemently against this, since the same measures had been implemented in 214 with little success, and the Senate withdrew the plan.Livy 27.5.3-5 Due to the severity of the situation, Livy records that Laevinus instead proposed to the senators that they themselves should be the ones to shoulder these costs. The senators eventually agreed, donating many of their precious metals. The equites imitated their example, raised enough funds for the oarsmen, and the consuls sailed to their respective provinces.Livy 26.35-36 Nevertheless, after his consulship, Laevinus proposed that senators be refunded for this donation in three stages.Livy 29.16.1-3 Only the first two, however, were repaid as the third instalment came at another time of economic instability.  The consular elections for 209  As it was necessary for at least one consul to preside over the election of their successors, Laevinus returned from Sicily to Rome to conduct the consular elections for 209.Livy 27.5.3-5 The Senate likely sent for him instead of Marcellus as he had conquered Sicily by that time, whereas Marcellus' battle against Hannibal was still rife. In Rome, Laevinus received information about a Carthaginian plan for the recovery of Sicily, and desired to return there as quickly as possible. In response, the Senate asked him to name a dictator to conduct the elections in his absence. Laevinus nominated his cousin M. Valerius Messala, his praefectus classis, but the Senate refused since he was not in Italy. Frustrated, Laevinus returned secretly to Sicily. Laevinus had forbidden the praetor from bringing a motion to the people for the appointment of a dictator, but as he was no longer in Italy, the tribunes ignored his order. Thus, Q. Fulvius Flaccus was elected dictator, with P. Licinius Crassus as magister equitum.Livy 27.5.17-19 = Proconsulship = After his consulship, Laevinus was granted imperium as a proconsul in Sicily, holding the office until 206. There, he commanded a fleet, received troops from defeated Italian armies, and was tasked with guarding the grain supply.Livy 27.7.12-16; 27.8.13-19 During this time, he actively promoted agriculture in Sicily, re-establishing cereal farming.Livy 26.40; Cicero In Verrem 2.3.125 In 209, he was able to send supplies to RomeLivy 27.8.18 and Polybius states that he ensured a significant part of the grain supply for the future.Polyb. 9.27.11 Laevinus also occasionally led his fleet to Africa for raids and to battle against Carthaginian fleets.Livy 27.8.13-19; 27.29.7; 28.4.5-7; 28.10.16  Later career  Statue of Cybele. Sources which chronicle Laevinus‚Äô later career are scarce. However, from what survives it is possible to construct a brief overview of his final years. In 205, following his recall to Italy the year before, it appears that Laevinus was involved in the Roman embassy tasked with transporting the sacred stone of Cybele from Phrygia back to the capital, in response to a consultation of the Sybilline Books.Livy 29.11.1-8 In 203, Laevnius urged the Senate to set aside the peace P. Cornelius Scipio had negotiated with the Carthaginians.Livy 30.23.5 His proposal passed, but Scipio‚Äôs terms were later ratified.Scullard. Roman Politics. p.78. Following this, it appears that Laevinus was dispatched to Greece in 200, and he died later that year. Discussion of sources Although born 150 years after the events of Laevinus' life, Livy's account of the Second Punic War provides the most detailed narrative of Laevinus' career. One must, however, be wary of Livy's pro-Roman bias, which tends to emphasise Roman victory and virtue. Other ancient accounts which refer to Laevinus include those of Polybius, Eutropius, Plutarch, Cicero, and Solinus. There is no modern historical work which solely discusses Laevinus, but he appears in narratives and analyses of the Punic Wars. These include Dexter Hoyos's Companion to the Punic Wars (2011), Nathan Rosenstein's Rome and the Mediterranean 209‚Äì146 BC (2012), Rachel Feig Vishnia's State, Society, and Popular Leaders in Mid-Republican Rome, 241‚Äì167 BC (1996), and H.H. Scullard's Roman Politics, 220‚Äì150 BC (1973). T. Robert S. Broughton's Magistrates of the Roman Republic (1951‚Äì1960) provides an overview of the political offices which Laevinus held.

He became a Member of Parliament for Sunderland and the main founder of the Sunderland Echo newspaper. Early life Samuel Storey was born in Sherburn, near Durham, on 13 January 1841. He was the sixth son of County Durham farmer Robert Storey. When Robert died in 1843, his mother moved to Newcastle, where Samuel Storey was educated at St Andrew‚Äôs School. He became a pupil-teacher there when he was 13 and then attended Durham Diocesan Training College from 1858‚Äì59.Sunderland Echo archive story After leaving college, Storey worked as a master at Birtley Church of England School from 1860‚Äì1864. However, when his mother moved from Newcastle to Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, in around 1858, he became increasingly involved in events in the town, helping to establish Sunderland Working Men's Club in 1863. Storey married Mary Ann Addison, daughter of John Addison of Monkwearmouth, in April 1864. By the end of that year, he moved to Monkwearmouth as well. Following the move, he worked as a traveller for Glaholm and Robson, a rope manufacturer, for three years before setting up on his own as an accountant. Business life It was in October 1865 that Storey and Thomas Steel, a Sunderland solicitor, set up the Atlas Building Society. Steel acted as the Society's solicitor, while Storey was its manager. In 1870, Storey succeeded his father-in-law as Actuary of the Monkwearmouth Savings Bank, a post he held until 1876. In the same year, he joined his brother-in-law, J.G. Addison, as a partner in the timber firm, Armstrong, Addison & Co. The 1870s also saw Storey speculate successfully in building land, mostly in the Monkwearmouth and East Boldon areas. Political life Storey became involved in local politics from the time he moved to Sunderland. He worked for the Whig candidate, Henry Fenwick, in the 1865 General Election but, the following year, helped to persuade the Radical John Candlish to oppose Fenwick when he had to stand for re-election on taking office. Candlish was successful in the 1866 by-election and, from then on, Storey became increasingly prominent in the Liberal Party in Sunderland. His influence extended to North Durham, too, from 1874, when he helped to found the Sunderland and North Durham Liberal Club. Sunderland Liberal Association followed in 1876. In 1868, Storey stood unsuccessfully for Sunderland's town council for Monkwearmouth Ward, but a year later he was successful. He remained a councillor for the ward until his election as an Alderman in 1877 and he stayed on the council until he resigned in 1890. During the 1870s, he led a radical revival in the council and was elected mayor in 1876, 1877 and, following the death of T.S. Turnbull in April 1880. In April 1881, Storey was elected MP for Sunderland at the by-election which followed the resignation of Sir Henry Havelock-Allan. He was re-elected at the General Elections of 1885, 1886 and 1892, but was defeated in 1895. He stood as Liberal candidate for Newcastle in 1900, when he was defeated, and as an Independent Tariff Reformer in Sunderland in the January 1910 election. He was elected this time, but retired at the December 1910 election. Storey's political opinions were often at variance with his party's. In particular, he advocated Home Rule for Ireland several years before William Ewart Gladstone made this Liberal party policy and Storey's public opposition to Liberal policy on Ireland in 1880 gave the moderate Liberals in Sunderland a chance to prevent his election to Parliament in 1881. In the event, however, the radical wing was strong enough to counter this and secure his unopposed return. In October 1903, he caused a considerable stir by resigning as Chairman of the Northern Liberal Association in order to become a Tariff Reformer, and he devoted most of his energies in the ensuing decade to that cause. He failed, however, to win the Sunderland Liberal Association over to Tariff Reform in 1904 but, the following year, was a prime mover in the formation of the Northern Tariff Reform Federation. This, he hoped, would bring together men of all shades of political opinion, since he insisted the question was an economic, not a party political, matter. Storey spoke at meetings all over the country and won the Sunderland seat at the January 1910 election as an Independent Tariff Reform candidate. In the same year, he bought the Newcastle Daily Journal, to help further the Tariff Reform cause in the North - the Tariff Reformers having been deprived of their ‚Äòloudest local advocate‚Äô when the North Mail was sold to a group of Liberals headed by Sir Christopher Furness in 1906. Local politics remained a constant interest for Storey too, and he was a member of Durham County Council from 1892 to 1913. He was first elected to the authority as an Alderman in 1892, then as a councillor from 1898‚Äì1907, and again as an Alderman from 1907‚Äì1913. He served as vice-chairman of the council from 1892‚Äì1894 and 1897‚Äì1898, and as chairman from 1894‚Äì97, and from 1898‚Äì1905. During this time, his major concerns were sanitary matters and education. Storey's contribution to Sunderland history, both politically and through his newspaper business, was formally recognised when he was presented with the Freedom of Sunderland on 7 October 1921. Publishing life Samuel Storey was one of the original seven founders of the Sunderland Echo, a regional daily newspaper which is still published today. The first edition of the Echo was printed on 22 December 1873, on a flat-bed press in Press Lane, Sunderland. Five hundred copies of the four-page issue were produced at noon and 4 p.m., and sold for a ha'penny each. Today the Echo is printed on a ¬£12 million full colour press, which was installed at its purpose-built base in Pennywell, Sunderland, in 1996. More than 44,000 tabloid copies are printed each day, which sell for 45p each. Storey founded the paper to fill a gap in both the newspaper and political markets. Although the 100,000-strong population of Sunderland was served by two weekly newspapers, there were no daily papers, and none at all reflecting the Radical views held by Storey and his partners. He promised readers in the first edition that, if things went wrong, the 'Echo would try its best to put them right'. But he added: \\"Always with moderation and without esteeming all those who oppose us as fools and knaves.\\" Early copies of the Echo also included lengthy reports of Liberal meetings, and critical articles on Liberal opponents. The Sunderland Echo was launched with an initial investment of ¬£3,500, raised by donations of ¬£500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were: Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, shipbroker and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Only Ruddock, however, had any knowledge of newspapers and the money was quickly used up. Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the venture early on and Storey took over their shares. A further ¬£7,000 in investment enabled the remaining partners to abandon the \\"wheezing flat-bed press\\" and, in July 1876, the Echo was moved to a new premises at 14 Bridge Street, Sunderland. Bridge Street was to remain the home of The Echo for the next 100 years and, in 1923, Storey paid a visit to mark the paper's 50th anniversary. He died just two years later. The Echo is placed into delivery vans at the old base in Bridge Street, Sunderland, in the 1930s. Besides the Sunderland Echo, Storey also started the Tyneside Daily Echo in Gateshead in 1879, which was moved to Newcastle in 1880 and discontinued in 1888. But it was a partnership with Andrew Carnegie, from 1882 to 1885, which really saw his newspaper business take off. The pair started several new papers and bought up many existing ones. Their chain included the Wolverhampton Express and Wolverhampton Star, which was amalgamated as the Express and Star by the syndicate in 1884. Other papers in their stable were the Hampshire Telegraph, Portsmouth Evening News, the London Echo and the North Eastern Daily and Weekly Gazettes at Middlesbrough. Two papers which the syndicate tried, but failed, to buy were the Shields Gazette and the Northern Echo. One of its last purchases was the Northern Daily Mail, in Hartlepool. When the syndicate broke up in 1885, Storey retained the Northern Daily Mail, the Hampshire Telegraph, the Portsmouth Evening News, and his own Sunderland and Tyneside Echoes. These papers were to become the basis of his new business idea, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers. Personal life Samuel Storey died in 1925, aged 84, several months after the death of his eldest son, Frederick George Storey. The chairmanship of his company passed to his grandson, Samuel (the elder son of Frederick Storey), who carried on with his grandfather's political activities too, joining Sunderland Brough Council in 1928 and being elected as the town's MP in the same year, holding this position until 1945.

It is a genetically encoded calcium sensor created by Roger Y. Tsien and coworkers. The name is a conflation of CaM (the common abbreviation of calmodulin) and chameleon to indicate the fact that the sensor protein undergoes a conformation change and radiates at an altered wavelength upon calcium binding to the calmodulin element of the Cameleon. Cameleon was the first genetically encoded calcium sensor that could be used for ratiometric measurements and the first to be used in a transgenic animal to record activity in neurons and muscle cells. Cameleon and other genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) have found many applications in neuroscience and other fields of biology. It was created by fusing BFP, calmodulin, calmodulin-binding peptide M13 and EGFP.  Mechanism  The DNA encoding cameleon fusion protein must be either stably or transiently introduced into the cell of interest. Protein made by the cell according to this DNA information then serves as a fluorescent indicator of calcium concentration. In the presence of calcium, Ca2+ binds to M13, which enables calmodulin to wrap around the M13 domain. This brings the two GFP- variant proteins closer to each other, which increases FRET efficiency between them.

It emerged as an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade via enacting a ban on abortion in the state of South Dakota. The law was repealed by voter referendum on November 7, 2006. Legislative history and legal ramifications In 2004, both houses of the South Dakota legislature passed House Bill 1191, outlawing abortions, but it was vetoed by governor Mike Rounds due to a technicality. The state's legislature subsequently passed five laws curtailing the legality of abortion in 2005.Washingtonpost.com The majority of a legislative \\"task force\\" then issued a report recommending that the Legislature illegalize all abortions, which would lead to a challenge of the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade in the United States Supreme Court. A separate minority report criticizing the process and reaching different conclusions was also released.Thenation.com In February 2006, the Legislature passed the Women's Health and Human Life Protection Act, which was signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds on March 6, 2006. This law would have forbidden pregnancy termination under virtually every circumstance, including for victims of rape and incest, with the exception of \\"a medical procedure designed or intended to prevent the death of a pregnant mother.\\" Physicians performing such procedures would have been required to \\"...make reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the mother and the life of her unborn child.\\" The act had specifically defined pregnancy as beginning at the point of conception rather than at implantation into the uterine wall (see beginning of pregnancy controversy), which might have meant that WHHLPA applied to emergency contraception, and on its face possibly all forms of hormonal contraception. However, the text of the bill did clarify that \\"Nothing in section 2 of this Act may be construed to prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive measure, drug or chemical, if it is administered prior to the time when a pregnancy could be determined through conventional medical testing and if the contraceptive measure is sold, used, prescribed, or administered in accordance with manufacturer instructions.\\" Several members of the South Dakota legislative majority, as well as Governor Rounds, acknowledged that the overt goal of WHHLPA was to get the Supreme Court to overturn RoeSeattle Times per the recommendation of the task force (the Supreme Court at that time was shifting in a conservative direction, one that might have been more amenable to overturning Roe: See also Supreme Court of the United StatesPolitical Leanings). Repeal A referendum to repeal the Women's Health and Human Life Protection Act was placed on ballot for the November 2006 statewide election due to a successful petition drive by the organization South Dakota Healthy Families. On May 30, over 38,000 petition signatures were filed, more than twice the 17,000 required to place a measure on the ballot. On November 7, WHHLPA was repealed by the South Dakota electorate; the vote was 56%-44% favoring repeal.Foxnews.com Reaction to WHHLPA * Cecilia Fire Thunder, President of the Oglala Sioux tribe in South Dakota, long-time abortion advocate and former California abortion clinic employee, had discussed establishing a Planned Parenthood clinic on Sioux land, which might not have been subject to the state's jurisdiction.

The therocephalians (\\"beast-heads\\") are named after their large skulls, which, along with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were carnivores. Like other non-mammalian synapsids, therocephalians were once described as \\"mammal-like reptiles\\". Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals. This relationship takes evidence in a variety of skeletal features. The phylogeny of therocephalians has been disputed, as the monophyly of the group and the relationships of its members are unclear. The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa, but have also been found in Russia, China, and Antarctica. Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group, which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world. Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, a few representatives of the subgroup called Eutherocephalia survived into the Early Triassic. However, the last therocephalians became extinct by the early Middle Triassic, possibly due to climate change and competition with cynodonts and various groups of reptiles. Anatomy and physiology Pristerognathus Like the Gorgonopsia and many cynodonts, most therocephalians were presumably carnivores. The earlier therocephalians were, in many respects, as primitive as the gorgonopsians, but they did show certain advanced features. There is an enlargement of the temporal opening for broader jaw adductor muscle attachment and a reduction of the phalanges (finger and toe bones) to the mammalian phalangeal formula. The presence of an incipient secondary palate in advanced therocephalians is another feature shared with mammals. The discovery of maxilloturbinal ridges in forms such as the primitive therocephalian Glanosuchus, suggests that at least some therocephalians may have been warm-blooded. The later therocephalians included the advanced Baurioidea, which carried some theriodont characteristics to a high degree of specialization. For instance, small baurioids and the herbivorous Bauria did not have an ossified postorbital bar separating the orbit from the temporal opening‚Äîa condition typical of primitive mammals. These and other advanced features led to the long-held opinion, now rejected, that the ictidosaurs and even some early mammals arose from a baurioid therocephalian stem. Mammalian characteristics such as this seem to have evolved in parallel among a number of different therapsid groups, even within Therocephalia. Several more specialized lifestyles have been suggested for some therocephalians. Many small forms, like ictidosuchids, have been interpreted as aquatic animals. Evidence for aquatic lifestyles includes sclerotic rings that may have stabilized the eye under the pressure of water and strongly developed cranial joints, which may have supported the skull when consuming large fish and aquatic invertebrates. One therocephalian, Nothogomphodon, had large saber-like canine teeth and may have fed on large animals, including other therocephalians. Other therocephalians such as bauriids and nanictidopids have wide teeth with many ridges similar to those of mammals, and may have been herbivores. Many small therocephalians have small pits on their snouts that probably supported vibrissae or whiskers. In 1994, the Russian paleontologist Leonid Tatarinov proposed that these pits were part of an electroreception system in aquatic therocephalians. However, it is more likely that these pits are enlarged versions of the ones thought to support whiskers, or holes for blood vessels in a fleshy lip. Classification Moschorhinus The therocephalians evolved as an early line of pre-mammalian eutheriodont therapsids, and are the sister group to the cynodonts, which includes mammals and their ancestors. Therocephalians are at least as ancient as a third large branch of therapsids, the Gorgonopsia, which they resemble in many primitive features. For example, many early therocephalians possess long canine teeth similar to those of gorgonopsians. The therocephalians, however, outlasted the gorgonopsians, persisting into the early-Middle Triassic period. While common ancestry with cynodonts (and, thus, mammals) accounts for many similarities between these groups, some scientists believe that other similarities may be better attributed to convergent evolution, such as the loss of the postorbital bar in some forms, a mammalian phalangeal formula, and some form of a secondary palate in most taxa (see below). Therocephalians and cynodonts both survived the Permian-Triassic mass extinction; but, while therocephalians soon became extinct, cynodonts underwent rapid diversification. Therocephalians experienced a decreased rate of cladogenesis, meaning that few new groups appeared after the extinction. Most Triassic therocephalian lineages originated in the Late Permian, and lasted for only a short period of time in the Triassic. =Taxonomy= Scaloposaurus'Lycosuchus head reconstruction Head of unnamed East European akidnognathid Some previously recognized therocephalian clades have turned out to be artificial. For example, the Scaloposauridae were classified based on fossils with mostly juvenile characteristics, but probably represent immature specimens from other known therocephalian families. On the other hand, the aberrant therocephalian family Lycosuchidae, once identified by the presence of multiple caniniform teeth, was thought to represent an unnatural group based on a study of canine replacement in that group (van den Heever, 1980). However, subsequent analysis has exposed additional synapomorphies supporting the monophyly of this group, and Lycosuchidae is currently considered the most basal clade within a monophyletic Therocephalia (van den Heever, 1994).

Owned by Bell Media, it broadcasts a country music format branded as Pure Country 106. History The station was originally launched in 1943, broadcasting at 1450 AM in Nobel, with the call sign CFPS. Following the end of World War II, the station's owner, Gordon Ellesworth Smith, wanted to affiliate the station with CBC Radio's Dominion Network, but without a feed line to get CBC programming to the station, this was not possible in Nobel ‚Äî so in the summer of 1945, the station was shut down and moved to Orillia, where it relaunched on September 3 as AM 1450 CFOR. The station joined the Dominion Network the following year. In 1954, the station moved to 1570 AM. In 1957, a fire destroyed the station's transmitter building, but with help from other broadcasters, the station was back on the air within a day. Later that year, the station increased its signal power to 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts nighttime. Bob Hope, who was in Toronto performing at the Canadian National Exhibition, visited CFOR on September 4 of that year to officially launch the station's new transmitter. The Dominion Network dissolved in 1962 and the station's affiliation transferred to the main CBC Radio network. In 1964, the station dropped its CBC affiliation, and was sold to a consortium that included Maclean-Hunter. In 1967, Maclean-Hunter became the station's sole owner. In 1976, the station was reacquired by local owners, who in turn sold it to Telemedia in 1980. In 1993, the station moved to 105.9 MHz, adopting its current call sign and a country music format.

At least 200 people were killed in the accident, which happened on February 14, 1998. Details The train was a regular industrial transportation service running from Cameroon's oil fields along the Nigerian border to the capital Yaound√©, where it would either be processed at the Mvolye plant, or shipped directly to the coast for exportation. As it entered Yaound√©'s suburbs in the mid-morning, it collided with another freight train heading south, and derailed. The tanker carriages were ruptured, and fuel oil began to spill. A large number of local people and passing taxi drivers stopped to collect the fuel oil in containers, which they could then sell on for a bit of extra money, when the disaster occurred. Apparently, one of the persons collecting fuel was smoking, and dropped a cigarette, creating a flash fire, which travelled right back to the wrecked tankers, creating a massive fireball, which engulfed bystanders and persons collecting fuel. The emergency services arrived on the scene soon after the blaze started, but were for a long time held back by the force of the flames, which they were only able to contain, not extinguish. The fire did not stop burning for at least a day, and there were fears it might spread to the nearby central petroleum depot at Nsiam, although this was avoided. For days, a column of black smoke hung over the area of the blast. Authorities were unable to give an exact number of casualties, but the final number of confirmed dead was over 200 people. At least 150 people were at some time after the accident hospitalized after suffering burns. Railway services to the south of the country were cut off dealing another blow to Cameroon's oil industry, following a series of border skirmishes with Nigerian troops over control of the area two years previously. Former colonial rulers France sent numerous types of aid to Cameroon following the disaster, including several prestigious medical burns specialists, as well as financial and technical help. The cause of the crash is not known, but may have had something to do with poor equipment and maintenance on the rail system due to Cameroon's endemic corruption. Cameroon was labelled \\"most corrupt nation 1998\\" by Transparency International.

This allows re- suspension of the lateral and anterior thighs along with the traditional tummy tuck improvements. The operation is extensive and is known for wound healing complications. Some surgeons have arbitrarily divided the operation into smaller portions to help limit these complications. Furthermore, the concept has been expanded upon to include additional lifts such as those of the inner thigh (medial thigh lift). The traditional lower body lift targeted the upper thighs as well as the buttocks and abdomen. For the large volume weight loss patient, this operation is ideal to remove the redundant skin that frequently \\"hangs\\" around the lower torso. These operations typically require 5‚Äì8 hours operating time when done together. The procedure requires time off from work. Close post-operative supervision is advised.

In 1832 he emigrated to Canada and settled on a farm in Middlesex County. In a few years he removed to Toronto, studied law, and was called to the bar in 1838. He soon distinguished himself in the profession, but was strongly interested in the political issues which agitated the province. In 1848 he was elected to the Legislature for East York (now Ontario County) and in the same year was appointed Solicitor-General for Upper Canada in the Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry. In 1849 he prepared the act reforming the practice and organization of the Court of Chancery in Upper Canada and resigned from the ministry in order to become in 1849 the first chancellor of the court. In March, 1862, he resigned on account of failing health, and eight years later he died in Toronto. He was named a QC in 1848.

Robinson repeatedly appealed, but without success. On July 4, 2014, Robinson died in prison. Murder, investigation, and trial In 1980 Robinson was the Jesuit chaplain at Mercy Hospital, Toledo, Ohio, United States, where he ministered to the sick and terminally ill. Sister Margaret Ann was the caretaker of the chapel. Robinson was convicted of strangling and stabbing Pahl, who was 71 at the time, in the sacristy of a chapel of the hospital where they worked together. The priest presided at her funeral Mass four days after her death. Pahl was stabbed 31 times, including nine times in the shape of an inverted cross. Prosecutors considered this shape was deliberate and intended to humiliate Pahl in death. Pahl was found covered in an altar cloth, her clothes and body arranged to suggest she had been sexually assaulted, although it was not clear she had been. Specific elements of the murder suggested it was a satanic ritual. A book describing how to perform the satanic black mass was also found in Robinson's possession. Robinson was questioned about the crime in 1980 but was not charged. The chief of the criminal division in the Lucas County prosecutor's office, Dean Mandros, shared that when detectives were questioning the priest two weeks after the killing, Deputy Police Chief Ray Vetter, who would later testify he was a practicing Catholic, broke off the interview against all normal procedure and allowed a monsignor to escort Father Robinson out of Police Headquarters, which \\"upset the detectives to no end\\". Mandros also said Vetter asked detectives to give him their reports on the case, and some of those reports were never seen again. A cover-up was alleged.\\"Priest Found Guilty of Nun's 1980 Murder\\", New York Times, 12 May 2006. Whether Robinson was part of a coven, and whether other priests had participated in the murder, may have been part of what was covered up. The case remained unsolved, with no new leads, until 2003 when police received a letter from a woman who claimed that Robinson had sexually abused her when she was a child in a series of Satanic ritual abuse that also involved human sacrifice.Fast Facts: Timeline of Sister Margaret Ann Pahl's KillingPriest convicted of slaying nun The woman, using the name \\"Survivor Doe\\", also filed a civil lawsuit against Robinson seeking financial damages for having been a victim of ritual abuse by Robinson and other adults dressed as nuns.

Forensic tests indicated a sword-shaped letter opener that had been found in Robinson's apartment and stored without detailed examination was consistent with the weapon that inflicted the wounds; in the words of the prosecutor's expert, it could \\"not be ruled out\\". The tip of the opener fitted a wound in the jaw of the nun's exhumed body \\"like a key in a lock\\" according to prosecutors.NBC News: Prosecutor: Priest‚Äôs blade fits nun‚Äôs wounds, 21 April 206 Prosecutors also found three witnesses who said they had seen the priest near the chapel around the time of the killing.

MechWarrior was the first video game to offer the player a chance to pilot a BattleMech from the view of a pilot (a MechWarrior). With this game the player has a great deal of freedom when compared to many of the follow-up MechWarrior games, which include choosing missions, buying & selling 'Mechs and parts, hiring lance-mates, and traveling throughout the Inner Sphere. Underneath the major game mechanics, the player had the option of following a role playing style story arc that would unfold over five in-game years. The game was ported to the Japanese Sharp X68000 and PC-98 home computers in 1992 and 1993 under the name Battletech: Ubawareta Seihai. Story The story follows a mechwarrior by the name of Gideon Braver Vandenburg. His family has been murdered and the chalice that proves he is heir to the throne of his planet, Ander's Moon, has been stolen. Without the chalice he is exiled. Gideon must develop a force of mechwarriors and battlemechs, find those who committed the acts against his family, and take his revenge within five years or all is lost. The story ends with the defeat of the Dark Wing Mercenaries. Gameplay =Overview= Mechwarrior revolves around three basic elements of play. The player can travel around an accurate map of the Inner Sphere negotiating contracts with the five Great Houses. Depending on the players actions, his mercenary unit will develop a reputation with each house which can bring about larger and more lucrative missions. A negative reputation can also be created if the player fights against a house in several missions. In this situation players will find that house is no longer willing to negotiate a contract. The second element revolves around the battlemechs within the game. Battlemechs can be bought and sold or repaired from combat damage. In this way, the player can act as a merchant and acquire mechs on one planet and sell them on another planet to gain profit. Mechwarriors, too can be hired at the local bar with ranging levels of skill. As above, the unit's reputation will determine the quality of potential recruits. Finally, there is the combat simulation. Depending on the contract for a mission, the player must meet certain criteria ranging from defense of a facility to outright destruction of the enemy. Combat is shown in first person from the cockpit of a battlemech. The game's engine uses simple vector based graphics for the actual combat. The three elements combined to create a unique game that was part RPG, part economic, and part combat simulation. =Combat simulation= 1989's Mechwarrior was the first BattleTech simulator that placed the user within an actual battlemech to pilot in first person. While the flat-shaded 3D graphics were very simple, individual mechs were easy to identify. The player begins with a damaged Jenner and has the opportunity to build over time a full lance of 4 battlemechs with the ability to choose from a total of 8 designs. Each mech was well balanced and had its own unique role within the game. The Locust and Jenner were specially designed for quick strike style missions while the heaviest machines such as the Battlemaster and Marauder could walk through heavy fire and survive. Medium mechs such as the Phoenix Hawk and Shadow Hawk had the ability to leap over terrain with jump jets and harass enemies from behind (the Jenner also has this property). Finally the heavy class including both the Rifleman and Warhammer could bring the most firepower to bear. Every class had its own special role and was instrumental to the gameplay. Combat itself followed the rules devised by the tabletop game. Rate of fire is limited by the mech's ability to dissipate heat through heat sinks.http://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/43-action/21336 Overall combat was defined by 3025 era rules. Damage was carried over after each mission and required repairs to be completed at a cost to the owner. Early in the game, it is sometimes necessary to repair a mech only partially so that it can operate for a mission due to limited funds. During combat the player can also give basic commands to lancemates which had very simple AI. One interesting feature of this AI was its ability to retreat if a certain damage level was reached. Reception MechWarrior was commercially successful, with sales of nearly 100,000 copies by 1997. The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #161 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, Computer Gaming World gave the title four of five stars, stating that \\"this robotic combat simulation is like candy ‚Äî fun and exuberant, although it may rot your teeth\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game three stars out of five. Rik Haynes of ACE scored MechWarrior 887 out of 1,000 points. He wrote, \\"Mechwarrior had me hooked right from the start, it's a near perfect fusion of flight- (tank!) simulation and role-playing game.\\" See also *MechWarrior, a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System References External links * *MechWarrior at the BattleTechWiki Category:1989 video games Category:BattleTech games Category:DOS games Category:Video games about mecha Category:MechWarrior Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Sharp X68000 games Category:Video games scored by Russell Lieblich Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"MechWarrior (1989 video game)"},{"id":"4848776","text":"CFGI-FM is a Canadian radio station, airing at 92.3 FM in Georgina Island, Ontario.

Marie Canal is a National Historic Site in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and is part of the national park system, managed by Parks Canada. It includes a lock to bypass the rapids on the St. Marys River. The first canal on the site opened in 1798, but was destroyed in 1814 during the War of 1812. The latest canal dates to 1895, and formed part of the shipping route from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Superior, along with the two locks on the US side of the river. One of the walls of the lock collapsed in 1987 and the canal was closed to traffic. In 1998 a smaller lock was opened within the original canal. It is suitable for smaller boats and mostly used for pleasure craft.  History  The first lock was built in 1798 by the Northwest Trading Company. On July 20, 1814 an American force destroyed the North West Company depot on the north shore of the St. Marys River. Since the Americans were unable to capture Fort Michilimackinac, the British forces retained control of the Sault.Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.)

Marie Canal National Historic Site of Canada, Natural Wonders & Cultural Treasures , Parks Canada. On June 9, 1909, the locks were seriously damaged when the Perry G. Walker, owned by the Gilchrist Transportation Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, crashed into the south main gate, forcing it back and allowing the force of water to push the north main gate over. The rush of water threw the Perry G. Walker back and carried two other ships downstream, one of which struck the south main gate, breaking it diagonally in two.Parks Canada A Unique Bridge - Found Only in Canada! The rush of water through the destroyed locks was stopped by activation of the Emergency Swing Dam, allowing repairs to commence. Amazingly, there was no loss of life or injury associated with this disaster, and repairs required only 12 days, with the bridge reopening on June 21, 1909. Due to a wall failure in 1987, the historic lock was shut down indefinitely. A new lock, built within the old lock, was opened in 1998 and is long, wide, deep, with a draft. The canal is used for recreational and tour boats; major shipping traffic uses the U.S. locks.  Heritage Designation  The canal was designated a National Historic Site in 1987, and is managed by Parks Canada as a unit of the national park system. It welcomes recreational boating and land- based visitors. There are several heritage buildings on the site: the administration building, the superintendent's residence, the canalmen's shelter, the powerhouse and the blacksmith shop, all constructed from red sandstone dug up during the canal's construction. Most of the original machinery used to operate the lock is also still in place. Another unique feature of the site is the Sault Canal Emergency Swing Dam, the only emergency swing dam left in existence, and the only one to ever be used in an emergency. Guided tours are available in the summer only. The visitor centre is open year round. The Red River Expedition of 1870, a National Historic Event, portaged nearby, prior to the canal's construction, and was the major reason for its creation.

Ramdas became a wandering ascetic at a young age. His story and his teachings have been presented in several different books. Biography Ramdas was born as Vittal Rao in Kanhangad, in northern Kerala, India on 10 April 1884,page xiii in: Swami Satchidananda (1979). The Gospel of Swami Ramdas. Published for Anandashram by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. to Balakrishna Rao and Lalita Bai. Ramdas worked as a spinning master in a cotton mill, and in 1908 was married. He experienced difficulties, both in his financial pursuits and domestic life, leading him to seek relief from his circumstances. Ramdas began to chant \\"Ram\\" ‚Äì a name used by Hindus to refer to an important deity. Soon afterward, his father instructed him to repeat the mantra Ram Mantra: \\"Sri Ram jai Ram jai jai Ram\\". Ramdas then added the \\"Om\\" to each repetition: \\"Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram,\\" and he found the benefit at least threefold. He became detached from the material world and embarked on a pilgrimage, thereby taking on the name Ramdas, and living on charity (though he never accepted money). His practice was to view the world as forms of Ram ‚Äì and thus to see everything that might befall him as the will of Ram. His mantra practice also gradually became a round-the-clock practice. Ramdas was known for always referring to himself in the third person, which is a common spiritual practice in Hinduism. In 1922 he met Ramana Maharshi. As a result of this, he went into his first retreat, living for 21 days in solitude in a cave in Arunachala. Upon leaving this cave he began claiming that, \\"All was Ram, nothing but Ram\\" The Mountain Path After continuing to live as an itinerant for many years, his devotees established Anandashram for him in Kanhangad, Kerala in 1931.

Cholas were the first dynasty who tried to bring the entire South India under a common rule and to a great extent succeeded in their efforts. Although the form and protocols of that government cannot be compared to a contemporary form of government, the history of the Chola empire belongs to a happy age in their history and great things were achieved by the government and the people. The Chola system of administration was highly organised and efficient. The king was the central pivot of administration and all the authority rested in his hands.  Extent of government  Extent of Chola empire c.1014 CE Between 980 CE, and c. 1150 CE, the Chola Empire comprised the entire south Indian peninsula extending east to west between sea to sea, and bounded in the north by an irregular line along the river Tungabhadra and the Vengi frontier. Although Vengi had a separate political existence, it was so closely connected to the Chola Empire, for all practical purposes, the Chola dominion extended up to the banks of the Godavari river. The main conquests took place between the accession of Sundara Chola and of Rajendra Chola I. The bulk of the conquests occurred during Rajaraja, and in his reign the Chola kingdom ceased to be a small state and the character of the Empire took true imperial proportions. The king was referred to as Chakravartigal (Emperor) and the lord of the three worlds (Tribhuvanachakravarti). The crown prince began to take part in active administration from the time of Rajaraja and minor princes were appointed as regional governors.  Capitals  Thanjavur and later Gangaikonda Cholapuram, were the imperial capitals. However both Kanchipuram and Madurai were considered as regional capitals and occasional courts were held in them. =Thanjavur= The early Cholas had Urayur and Puhar as their capitals. Urayur was still their capital during the interregnum before their revival in the ninth century CE. Vijayalaya Chola defeated the Pandya feudatories Muttarayars and captured the city of Thanjavur, and the city maintained its position as the main city during the reigns of the Chola emperors up to Rajendra Chola I. The presence of the great Brihadisvara Temple also provided the impetus to the grandeur of the monarchy as well as the financial hub of the empire. Inscriptions on the walls of the Brihadisvara temple give us information on the number of royal palaces once present in the city. =Gangaikonda Cholapuram= Rajendra Chola I established the town of Gangaikonda Cholapuram and made it his capital commemorating his successful expedition to the Ganges in 1023 CE. This town, situated south west of the temple town of Chidambaram does not exist anymore. It was extensively sacked and destroyed by the Pandyas during the dying days of the Chola empire. However the great Siva temple Gangaikonda Choleshwara still exists proclaiming the once great city. We also find evidence of the splendour of the royal palaces and great markets that once existed there.  Administrative machinery  The king was the supreme commander and a benevolent dictator. His share in the administration consisted of issuing oral commands to responsible officers when representations were made to him. Such orders were recorded in great detail in the inscriptions, usually on the walls of temples. A special type of official, names Tirumandira Olai Nayagam (‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞ ‡Æì‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç), who recorded the oral orders immediately on palm leaf manuscripts were responsible of the accurate records of them. =Council of Ministers= There is no definite evidence of the existence of a council to ministers or of other officers connected to the central government, though the names of individual ministers are found in the inscriptions. A powerful bureaucracy assisted the king in the tasks of administration and in executing his orders. Due to the lack of a legislature or a legislative system in the modern sense, the fairness of king‚Äôs orders dependent on the goodness of the man and in his belief in Dharma ‚Äì sense of fairness and justice. The ancient society did not expect anything more than general security from the government. Even matters of disputes went to the officers of the court only as the last resort. =Bureaucracy= The Chola bureaucracy did not differ much from its contemporaries. However, what distinguished it was its highly organised nature. A careful balance between central control and local independence was maintained and non-interference in local government was sacrosanct. There was a definite hierarchy of the bureaucracy and the tenure of the officials simply dependent on the 'Crown‚Äôs pleasure'. The officials held various titles such as Marayan and Adigarigal . Seniority between the same cadre was indicated by qualifying title such as Perundanam and Sirutanam. One of the important such officers were the Revenue officials responsible for the receipts and expenditures of the government. =Administrative divisions= Every village was a self-governing unit. A number of such villages constituted a Korram (‡Æï‡Øä‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ÆÆ‡Øç) or nadu (‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ) or Kottam (‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç) in different parts of the country. Taniyur (‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç) was a large village big enough to be a Kurram by itself. A number of Kurrams constituted a Valanadu (‡Æµ‡Æ≥‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ). Several Valanadus made up one Mandalam, a province. At the height of the Chola empire there were eight or nine of these provinces including Sri Lanka.These divisions and names underwent constant changes throughout the Chola period. An inscription of the eighth century CE at Uttaramerur temple describes the constitution of the local council, eligibility and disqualifications for the candidates, the method selection, their duties and delimits their power. It appears that the administration of a common village Ur(‡Æä‡Æ∞‡Øç) or Oor was different from that of a village given to Brahmins. =Audits= The activities of the officials of the bureaucracy were under constant audit and scrutiny. We have an example of such reports in an inscription from the reign of Uttama Chola which gives us the details of the remissness and neglect of some officials in the delay of recording a particular grant. As a result a dispute arose between contending parties as to who should benefit from the grant. The officials involved were punished. As the head of the civil administration, the king himself occasionally toured the country and carried out inquests into the local administration. =Revenue administration= An extensive resurvey was done around 1089 CE by the Chola king Kulottunga, recording the extents of lands and their assessment, boundaries of villages and the common rights inside the village, including the communal pastures. Revenue officials were responsible for the tax collection. The Chola government was very mindful of the need for the fair and accurate collection of tax to run the state machinery. The revenue records were not manuals of extortion, but a carefully maintained records of land rights, based on complete enquiries and accurate surveys, and were kept up-to-date by regular surveys. The duties of revenue officials included many other spheres of responsibilities. They also regulated receipts and expenditures of temples. They were also seen to purchase land on behalf of village assemblies. They attested and certified important documents drawn up by local government agencies such as village councils. They were also shown to act as magistrates. Besides the tax collected by the central government, several local bodies enjoyed the privilege of collecting tolls and other imposts. A part of the revenue was kept for the king. The rest was used on public works such as the building of roads, on tanks, on the army, and on the building of temples.  Justice  Justice was mostly a local matter in the Chola Empire, where minor disputes were settled at the village level. The punishments for minor crimes were in the form of fines or a direction for the offender to donate to some charitable endowment. Even crimes such as manslaughter or murder were punished by fines. Crimes of the state such as treason were heard and decided by the king himself and the typical punishment in such cases was either execution or confiscation of property. The people had to agree to the king in these situations, no matter what. Village assemblies exercised large powers in deciding local disputes. Small committees called Nyayattar heard matters that did not come under the jurisdiction of the voluntary village committees. The punishments in most cases were in the form of donations to the temples or other endowments. The convicted person would remit their fines at a place called Darmaasana. There is not much information available on the judicial procedures or court records. There was no distinction between civil and criminal offences. Sometimes civil disputes were allowed to drag on until time offered the solution. Crimes such as theft, adultery and forgery were considered serious offences. In most cases the punishment was in the order of the offender having to maintain a perpetual lamp at a temple. Even murder was punished with a fine. In one instance a man had stabbed an army commander. Rajendra Chola II ordered the culprit to endow 96 sheep for a lamp at a neighbouring temple. Capital punishment was uncommon even in the cases of first-degree murder. Only one solitary instance of capital punishment is found in all the records available so far.  Foreign trade  Hindu temple complex at Prambanan in Java clearly showing Dravidian architectural influences. Towards the end of ninth century CE, the countries of southern India had developed extensive maritime and commercial activity. The Cholas, being in possession of both the west and the east coasts of peninsular India were at the forefront of these ventures. The Tang dynasty of China, the Srivijaya empire in the Malayan archipelago under the Sailendras and the Abbasid Caliphate at Baghdad were the main trading partners.See Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. The C≈çƒªas, 1935. pp 604 During the trouble developed at the decline of the Tang Dynasty, China became dangerous for foreign traders and the Srivijaya empire benefited from the shifting trade from China and acted as the clearing house for Tamil trade. The Song Dynasty that followed the Tang dynasty made the situation more normal and the trade began to flourish once more. Several trade delegations were sent to many countries including the Chola offering profitable licenses. Cholas were eager to exploit this opportunity and sent several trade missions to China. Chinese Song Dynasty reports record that an embassy from Chulian (Chola) reached the Chinese court in the year 1077 CE and the king of the Chulien at that time was called Ti-hua-kia-lo.See Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. The C≈çƒªas, 1935. pp 316 It is possible that these syllables denote \\"Deva Kulo[tunga]\\" (Kulothunga Chola I). This embassy was a trading venture and ended very profitable to the visitors. They returned with 81,800 strings of copper coins in return for some articles of tributes including glass articles, and spices. A fragmentary Tamil inscription found in Sumatra mentions the name of a merchant guild Nanadesa Tisaiyayirattu Ainnutruvar (‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æö ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æö‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æê‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ®‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç) (Lit. The Five Hundred from the 16 countries (4x4) and the thousand directions) who were a merchant guild famous in the Chola country. The inscriptions is dated 1088 CE, clearly proving that there was an active overseas trade during the Chola period. Notes References * Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955).

Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. This episode featured extensive location filming at Bodiam Castle. Plot Tim says that he is expecting a letter from his Uncle King Arthur. Bill points out that King Arthur is not Tim's uncle. Tim responds, \\"Okay, Arthur King\\", and goes on to point out that his uncle's name is King Arthur on his birth certificate, although admits that there is a comma between \\"King\\" and \\"Arthur\\". He insisted that the uncle does look \\"king-ish\\" and he does live at Camelot, not \\"Camelot\\" in Bill's sense, but \\"Camelot, 33 Acacia Road, Wessex. Graeme and Bill mock Tim about it, and Graeme asks Tim if his aunt is Queen Guinevere. Tim answers \\"No, of course she's not Queen Guinevere. She's Queen Doris\\". Tim's other relatives include his Uncle Sir Lancelot, and a parson (the Venerable Bede). Tim's Uncle King Arthur's heralds signal their arrival by blowing their trumpets, and deliver the letter to Tim by hand. Uncle King Arthur writes that he is having trouble with the local Town Planner and asks Tim to look after \\"Camelot\\" while he and the family are on holiday. He says that he will make Tim the Earl of Northumbria if Tim succeeds in keeping \\"Camelot\\" out of the Town Planner's hands. Then, the Town Planner arrives accompanied by two of his clerks (standover men), and asks the Goodies to sign a release for \\"Camelot\\" to be handed over to him (following which \\"Camelot\\" can be demolished and replaced by a super-highway). Graeme decides that they should fight for \\"Camelot\\". When the Goodies arrive at \\"Camelot\\", which is located in an ordinary suburban street, they are surprised to find that \\"Camelot\\" is indeed a real castle, complete with drawbridge and moat. Graeme, wandering around the castle, sees some notices on the wall: \\"An Englishman's castle is his home.\\" and \\"You don't have to be mad to live here, but it helps\\", both of which he proceeds to rip off the wall. Bill walks into the room dressed in medieval clothes, while Tim arrives dressed as a jester and immediately begins to tell jester jokes. Tim and Bill say \\"Once a Knight, always a knight, twice a night, and you're doing all right!\\" followed by Tim and Bill singing (and dancing) a duet of the Morecambe and Wise song \\"Bring Me Sunshine\\". Graeme is determined to keep \\"Camelot\\" safe, and he decides to open the castle to the public to help with its financial upkeep. He sings: \\"Roll up, roll up to Camelot in 1973, and tour the Middle Ages for only 50p\\". The Town Planner then arrives at \\"Camelot\\", and Bill signs over the castle to him, saying that Tim's uncle and aunt would like a \\"two up, two down\\". Graeme is horrified at what Bill has done and says that Bill should not have sold the castle. Graeme refuses to hand the castle over to the Town Planner, saying that everyone who comes to the castle has to be dressed in medieval clothes. The Town Planner says that he will be back and will take over the castle by vacant possession. Graeme says that they do not intend to leave the castle. However, a fire-breathing dragon and a woman's scream succeed in making the Goodies do so. While they are outside rescuing the 'damsel in distress' from the dragon, the Town Planner returns (dressed as the Black Knight in a suit of medieval armour) to take over the vacant castle, sending the Goodies to the torture chamber to force their consent, but fails. To regain the castle, the Goodies fight the Town Planner and his clerks in archery, swordsmanship and jousting (with the Goodies riding their trandem instead of a horse). The Goodies and their adversaries also fight other medieval contests, and the Goodies end up winning the battle, so they are able to hold on to the castle for Tim's relatives. King Arthur and Queen Doris and their family then return from their holiday and everything returns to normal at \\"Camelot\\".

Originally intended to serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until after the end of the war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953. Development In general, the Fleet Air Arm had required fighters that were capable of navigating long ranges over sea and speed differential over attackers was not critical. Defence of British naval bases was a RAF commitment but provision had not been made for this and so the Admiralty accepted that it would have to take on the duty. For this it needed an interceptor fighter and experience in the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 had also shown a high-performance, carrier- based, single-seat fighter would be an advantage. Blackburn tendered their B-37 design using the Napier Sabre 24-cylinder H-type engine, and this was accepted by June 1940 with a proposal to order \\"off the drawing board\\" (meaning without prototypes). Air Ministry Specification N.11/40‚Äîstating a minimum top speed of ‚Äîwas raised to cover this design and an order placed in January 1941 for three prototypes.Buttler 2004, p. 173 The B-37, given the service name \\"Firebrand\\" on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the main fuel tank and the auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended to the edges of the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards.Brown, p. 27; Jackson, pp. 440‚Äì41 The Firebrand was unusual in the fact that there was an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.Brown, p. 29 The unarmed first prototype first flew on 27 February 1942 using the Sabre II, the first of two armed prototypes following on 15 July. The initial flight trials were a disappointment as the aircraft could only reach below Blackburn's estimated maximum speed. Replacement of the Sabre II with a Sabre III (an engine built specifically for the Firebrand) improved its top speed to at 17,000 ft (5,182 m). The second prototype, DD810, conducted deck-landing trials, with Commander Dennis Cambell at the controls, aboard the fleet carrier in February 1943.Brown, pp. 26, 28 The Sabre engine was also used in the Hawker Typhoon, a fighter already in production and the Ministry of Air Production (MAP) decided that the Typhoon had priority for the Sabre. The Sabre was also experiencing production problems and so a new engine was needed, along with the necessary airframe adaptations. To use the time and effort invested in the design, the MAP decided to convert the Firebrand into an interim strike fighter, to meet a Fleet Air Arm requirement for a single-seat torpedo bomber capable of carrying bombs, rockets and being capable of air-to-air combat. Nine production F. Mk I aircraft were built to the original specifications and were retained for trials and development work.Friedman, p. 279; Jackson, pp. 441‚Äì42 After it was badly damaged during an emergency landing, DD810 was converted into a prototype of the first strike variant, the Firebrand T.F. Mk II (with the company designation B-45), that flew on 31 March 1943. It was an adaptation of the Mk I with the wing centre section widened by to make room for the torpedo on the centreline between the mainwheels. Like the Mk I, the TF Mk II only saw a very limited production run of 12 aircraft and they were also allocated for development work, including those assigned to 708 Naval Air Squadron, a shore- based trials unit. Blackburn proposed several versions of the Sabre-powered aircraft including one for the RAF as the B-41, a version with a high-lift wing as the B-42, and the B-43 floatplane, none of which were accepted for further development.Jackson, pp. 442‚Äì43 A new specification was issued as S.8/43 to cover the development of the Firebrand T.F. Mk III (B-45) with the Bristol Centaurus VII radial engine. Two prototypes were converted from incomplete F Mk Is and 27 additional aircraft were delivered, completing the first batch of 50 aircraft. The first prototype flew on 21 December 1943, but construction of the new aircraft was very slow with the first flight not being made until November 1944. Most changes were related to the installation of the larger-diameter Centaurus engine, including air intakes for the carburetor and oil cooler in the wing-root extensions that formerly housed the engine's radiators. Spring-loaded trim tabs were also fitted to all control surfaces. Production aircraft after the first 10 were fitted with the improved Centaurus IX engine.Jackson, pp. 443‚Äì44 The Mk III was found to be unsuitable for carrier operations for a variety of reasons. The new engine produced more torque than the Sabre, and rudder control was insufficient on takeoff with the full flaps needed for carrier use. Visibility while landing was very poor, the tailhook attachment to the airframe was too weak, and the aircraft had a tendency to drop a wing at the stall while landing, so development continued to rectify these issues. The T.F. Mk IV (B-46), as the new development was designated, featured larger tail surfaces for better low-speed control. The enlarged rudder was horn balanced and the vertical stabilizer was offset three degrees to port to counteract the four-bladed Rotol propeller's torque. The wings now featured hydraulically operated dive brakes on both upper and lower surfaces. The aircraft's wings were now stressed to carry one bomb under each wing or a drop tank or eight RP-3 rockets. The frame that held the torpedo was connected to the undercarriage so that it pivoted nose-downward to increase ground clearance with the landing gear extended and pivoted upward to reduce drag while in flight. A fuel tank could be fitted on the centreline in lieu of the torpedo. The Mk IV first flew on 17 May 1945, and was the first version of the Firebrand to enter mass production,Brown, p. 30; Jackson, p. 445 with 170 built, although 50 more aircraft were cancelled. The later Firebrand T.F. Mk 5 featured minor aerodynamic improvements and 123 were converted from Mk IVs. The final version was the Firebrand T.F. Mk 5A with hydraulically boosted ailerons to increase the aircraft's rate of roll. Two Mk 5s and five Mk IVs were converted to the Mk 5A standard. Operational history A prototype Firebrand TF Mk II taxiing along the flight deck of with its flaps extended during trials The Firebrand did not see action in World War II, as TF 4s were not issued to 813 Naval Air Squadron until 1 September 1945. The squadron was disbanded 30 September 1946 without deploying to sea. It was reformed with TF 5s on 1 May 1947 and flew them from the carrier , later , until it was re- equipped with turboprop Westland Wyvern attack aircraft in February 1953. 827 Naval Air Squadron received their TF 5 and 5As on 13 December 1950 and flew them primarily off the carrier until it disbanded on 19 November 1952. A variety of second-line squadrons were issued Firebrands of various marks for training or trials at one time or another.Sturtivant 1984, pp. 212, 214, 280, 282, 437 In test pilot and naval aviator Captain Eric Brown's opinion the aircraft was \\"short of performance, sadly lacking in manoeuvrability, especially in rate of roll\\".Brown, p. 30 The position of the cockpit even with the trailing edge of the wing gave the pilot a very poor view over the nose, inhibited his ability to view his target and to land his aircraft aboard a carrier, sufficient for Brown to call it \\"a disaster as a deck-landing aircraft\\".Brown, pp. 31, 46‚Äì47 Variants ;Blackburn B-37 :Three prototypes ordered to meet Specification N.11/40, named Firebrand on 11 July 1941.

Enclaves may also exist within territorial waters. Enclave is sometimes used improperly to denote a territory that is only partly surrounded by another state. The Vatican City State and San Marino, both enclaved by Italy, and Lesotho, enclaved by South Africa, are completely enclaved sovereign states. The disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. An exclave is a portion of a state or territory geographically separated from the main part by surrounding alien territory (of one or more states). Many exclaves are also enclaves, but are not necessarily so; an exclave can be surrounded by several states. The Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan is an example of an exclave that is not an enclave (bordering both Armenia, Turkey and Iran). Semi-enclaves and semi-exclaves are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border (a coastline contiguous with international waters), would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves. Enclaves and semi-enclaves can exist as independent states (Monaco, The Gambia and Brunei are semi-enclaves), while exclaves and semi-exclaves always constitute just a part of a sovereign state (like the Kaliningrad Oblast). A pene-exclave is a part of the territory of one country that can be conveniently approached‚Äîin particular, by wheeled traffic‚Äîonly through the territory of another country. Pene-exclaves are also called functional exclaves or practical exclaves. Many pene-exclaves partially border their own territorial waters (i.e., they are not surrounded by other nations' territorial waters), such as Point Roberts, Washington and Minnesota's Northwest Angle. A pene-exclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. A commonly cited example is the Kleinwalsertal, a valley part of Vorarlberg, Austria, that is accessible only from Germany to the north. Origin and usage The word enclave is French and first appeared in the mid-15th century as a derivative of the verb enclaver (1283), from the colloquial Latin inclavare (to close with a key).Le Grand Robert, Dictionnaire de la Langue Fran√ßaise, 2001, vol. III, p. 946. Originally, it was a term of property law that denoted the situation of a land or parcel of land surrounded by land owned by a different owner, and that could not be reached for its exploitation in a practical and sufficient manner without crossing the surrounding land. In law, this created a servitude of passage for the benefit of the owner of the surrounded land. The first diplomatic document to contain the word enclave was the Treaty of Madrid, signed in 1526. Later, the term enclave began to be used also to refer to parcels of countries, counties, fiefs, communes, towns, parishes, etc. that were surrounded by alien territory. This French word eventually entered the English and other languages to denote the same concept, although local terms have continued to be used. In India, the word \\"pocket\\" is often used as a synonym for enclave (such as \\"the pockets of Puducherry district\\"). In British administrative history, subnational enclaves were usually called detachments or detached parts, and national enclaves as detached districts or detached dominions.As can be seen on 18th. century maps of Germany and other European countries by British cartographers and publishers such as R. Wilkinson. In English ecclesiastic history, subnational enclaves were known as peculiars (see also Royal Peculiar). The word exclave is a logically extended back- formation of enclave. Characteristics Enclaves exist for a variety of historical, political and geographical reasons. For example, in the feudal system in Europe, the ownership of feudal domains was often transferred or partitioned, either through purchase and sale or through inheritance, and often such domains were or came to be surrounded by other domains. In particular, this state of affairs persisted into the 19th century in the Holy Roman Empire, and these domains (principalities, etc.) exhibited many of the characteristics of sovereign states. Prior to 1866 Prussia alone consisted of more than 270 discontiguous pieces of territory. Residing in an enclave within another country has often involved difficulties in such areas as passage rights, importing goods, currency, provision of utilities and health services, and host nation cooperation. Thus, over time, enclaves have tended to be eliminated. For example, two-thirds of the then-existing national-level enclaves were extinguished on 1 August 2015, when the governments of India and Bangladesh implemented a Land Boundary Agreement that exchanged 162 first- order enclaves (111 Indian and 51 Bangladeshi). This exchange thus effectively de-enclaved another two dozen second-order enclaves and one third-order enclave, eliminating 197 of the Indo-Bangladesh enclaves in all. The residents in these enclaves had complained of being effectively stateless. Only Bangladesh's Dahagram‚ÄìAngarpota enclave remained. Netherlands and Belgium though decided to keep the enclave and exclave system in Baarle. As both Netherlands and Belgium are members of the European Union and Schengen Area, people, goods and services flow freely with little or no restrictions. =Enclave versus exclave= For illustration, in the figure (above), A1 is a semi-enclave (attached to C and also bounded by water that only touches C's territorial water). Although A2 is an exclave of A, it cannot be classed as an enclave because it shares borders with B and C. The territory A3 is both an exclave of A and an enclave from the viewpoint of B. The singular territory D, although an enclave, is not an exclave. True enclaves An enclave is a part of the territory of a state that is enclosed within the territory of another state. To distinguish the parts of a state entirely enclosed in a single other state, they are called true enclaves. A true enclave cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. Vinokurov (2007) calls this the restrictive definition of \\"enclave\\" given by international law, which thus \\"comprises only so-called 'true enclaves'\\". Two examples are B√ºsingen am Hochrhein, a true enclave of Germany, and Campione d'Italia, a true enclave of Italy, both of which are surrounded by Switzerland. The definition of a territory comprises both land territory and territorial waters. In the case of enclaves in territorial waters, they are called maritime (those surrounded by territorial sea) or lacustrine (if in a lake) enclaves. Most of the true national-level enclaves now existing are in Asia and Europe. While subnational enclaves are numerous the world over, there are only a few national-level true enclaves in Africa, Australia and the Americas (each such enclave being surrounded by the territorial waters of another country). An historical example is West Berlin before the reunification of Germany. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled de jure by the four Allied powers. However, the East German government and the Soviet Union treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a de facto enclave within East Germany. Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as Steinst√ºcken, were separated from the city, some by only a few meters. =Enclaved countries= Position of Lesotho within South Africa Three nations qualify as completely surrounded by another country's land and/or internal waters: * The Republic of San Marino, enclaved within Italy * Vatican City, enclaved within the city of Rome, Italy * The Kingdom of Lesotho, enclaved within South Africa The Republic of Artsakh, a disputed territory not recognised by any UN member states, consists of Nagorno-Karabakh, which was an enclave within Azerbaijan, and territories bordering Armenia and Iran that were conquered during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Historically, four Bantustans (or \\"Black homelands\\") of South Africa were granted nominal independence, unrecognized internationally, by the Apartheidist government from 1976 until their reabsorption in 1994. Others remained under government rule from 1948 to 1994. Being heavily partitioned, various parts of these Bantustans were true enclaves. The United States' constitutional principle of tribal sovereignty treats federally-recognized Indian reservations as quasi-independent enclaves. True exclaves Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic True exclave is an extension of the concept of true enclave. In order to access a true exclave from the mainland, a traveller must go through the territory of at least one other state. Examples include: * Nakhchivan, which borders Turkey, Armenia and Iran, is an exclave of Azerbaijan. * Baarle-Hertog is a collection of Belgian exclaves in the Netherlands. * In the United Arab Emirates, four emirates have five true exclaves: Dubai (Hatta), AjmƒÅn (Masfout and Manama), Ras al-Khaimah (the southerly of the emirate's two non-contiguous sections), and Sharjah (Nahwa, also both a true national-level enclave and a counter-enclave).The Federal Boundaries of the United Arab Emirates * Ll√≠via is an enclave and exclave of Spain surrounded by France. * Campione d'Italia is an enclave and exclave of Italy surrounded by Switzerland. * B√ºsingen am Hochrhein is an enclave and exclave of Germany surrounded by Switzerland. The shortest distance from B√ºsingen's borders to the main portion of German territory is only about 700 metres (about 2,300 ft). * Likoma and Chizumulu Islands in Lake Malawi are lacustrine enclaves and exclaves of Malawi, surrounded by Mozambique territorial waters. Related constructs and terms = Semi- enclaves and semi-exclaves= Semi-enclaves and semi-exclaves are areas that, except for possessing an unsurrounded sea border, would otherwise be enclaves or exclaves. Semi-enclaves can exist as independent states that border only one other state, such as Monaco, the Gambia and Brunei. Vinokurov (2007) declares, \\"Technically, Portugal, Denmark, and Canada also border only one foreign state, but they are not enclosed in the geographical, political, or economic sense. They have vast access to international waters. At the same time, there are states that, although in possession of sea access, are still enclosed by the territories of a foreign state.\\" Therefore, a quantitative principle applies: the land boundary must be longer than the coastline. Thus a state is classified as a sovereign semi-enclave if it borders on just one state, and its land boundary is longer than its sea coastline. Vinokurov affirms that \\"no similar quantitative criterion is needed to define the scope of non-sovereign semi-enclaves/exclaves.\\"Vinokurov (2007), p. 29, also refers to semi-exclaves as a type of \\"mere exclave with sea connection to the mainland.\\" Examples include: * Alaska, one of the states in the United States of America, is the largest semi-exclave in the world, separated from the US by Canada. * Oecusse, a district on the northwestern side of the island of Timor, is a semi-enclave of East Timor separated from the rest of the country by Indonesia. * Ceuta and Melilla are Spanish semi-enclaves on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco. * Temburong is a Bruneian semi-enclave surrounded by Malaysia. The Temburong Bridge connects Temburong to the Brunei mainland. * Kaliningrad Oblast is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast), a semi-exclave situated on the Baltic coast. Sea access from the mainland is possible from Saint Petersburg via the Gulf of Finland without passing through other states' territory. * Cabinda (also spelled Kabinda, formerly Portuguese Congo) is a semi-exclave and a province of Angola on the Atlantic coast of southwestern Africa, separated by the only sea-access port of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. * French Guiana (a French Overseas Department), in South America, is a semi-exclave that is bounded by Suriname, Brazil, and the Atlantic Ocean. * The southern part of Dubrovnik-Neretva County in Croatia is separated from the rest of the country by Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Republic of Ragusa once gave the town of Neum to the Ottoman Empire because it did not want to have a land border with Venice; this small municipality was inherited by Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Pelje≈°ac Bridge is under construction to link the semi-exclave to the rest of Croatia. =Subnational enclaves and exclaves= Sometimes, administrative divisions of a country, for historical or practical reasons, caused some areas to belong to one division while being attached to another. Examples include: * In India: ** Dadra, enclaved within the state of Gujarat, is part of Dadra and Nagar Haveli in India. ** Pondicherry district, of the Union Territory of Puducherry, is made of 12 non- contiguous parts, many of them true enclaves entirely surrounded by the state of Tamil Nadu. Before Pondicherry, along with the other territories of French India, was absorbed into India in 1954, they were enclaved within the Union of India, and before that the British Raj. Also a legacy of the French colonial period, the Mahe district is made of three non-contiguous parts enclaved within the state of Kerala. * From 1947 to 1971, Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan as its East Pakistan exclave, separated from West Pakistan by 1,760 kilometers (1,100 miles) of India. It eventually gained independence in 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War. * In the United Kingdom: ** Before 1974, and especially before 1844, there were many exclaves of counties in England and Wales. ** The counties of Scotland before reorganisation in 1889 included dozens of exclaves. This was especially notable in the case of Cromartyshire, which was split into at least nine parts spread across Ross-shire. * In France: ** The French department of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, in the southwest of France, surrounds two enclaves of the neighbouring department of Hautes- Pyr√©n√©es. ** The French department of Vaucluse has a rather large exclave to its north that is an enclave within the Dr√¥me department ‚Äì the canton of Valr√©as (historically known as Enclave des Papes). * San Colombano al Lambro is an exclave of the province of Milan at the junction between the Pavia and Lodi provinces. The exclave arose when the province of Lodi was carved out of the province of Milan, but a referendum in San Colombano indicated the locals' wish to stay in Milan. As a result, the commune is the only wine-producing area in the mostly urbanized province of Milan. Kentucky Bend and surrounding area * In the United States: **A portion of Ellis Island is an exclave of New York City within the boundaries of Jersey City, and therefore of New York State within the boundaries of New Jersey. ** The Kentucky Bend exists because of a meander of the Mississippi River. ** West Hollywood and Beverly Hills, California, adjoin one another, but are entirely surrounded by the City of Los Angeles. ** Jeddito, Arizona, lies within a exclave of the Navajo Nation. This exclave is surrounded by territory of the Hopi Reservation, which is itself surrounded by the Navajo Nation. =\\"Practical\\" enclaves, exclaves and inaccessible districts= The term pene-exclave was defined in Robinson (1959) as \\"parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently ‚Äì in particular by wheeled traffic ‚Äì only through the territory of another country.\\" Thus, a pene-exclave, although having land borders, is not completely surrounded by the other's land or territorial waters.Melamid (1968) states, \\"Contiguous territories of states which for all regular commercial and administrative purposes can be reached only through the territory of other states are called pene-enclaves (pene-exclaves). These have virtually the same characteristics as complete enclaves (exclaves).\\" Catudal (1974) and Vinokurov (2007) further elaborate upon examples, including Point Roberts. \\"Although physical connections by water with Point Roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the United States, land access is only possible through Canada.\\" Pene-enclaves are also called functional enclaves or practical enclaves. They can exhibit continuity of state territory across territorial waters but, nevertheless, a discontinuity on land, such as in the case of Point Roberts. Along rivers that change course, pene-enclaves can be observed as complexes comprising many small pene-enclaves. A pene-enclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory, although geographically attached, inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. A commonly cited example is the Kleinwalsertal, a valley part of Vorarlberg, Austria, that is only accessible from Germany to the north, being separated from the rest of Austria by high mountains traversed by no roads. Another example is the Spanish village of Os de Civ√≠s, accessible from Andorra. Hence, such areas are enclaves or exclaves for practical purposes, without meeting the strict definition. Many pene- exclaves partially border the sea or another body of water, which comprises their own territorial waters (i.e., they are not surrounded by other nations' territorial waters). They border their own territorial waters in addition to a land border with another country, and hence they are not true exclaves. Still, one cannot travel to them on land without going through another country. Attribution of a pene-enclave status to a territory can sometimes be disputed, depending on whether the territory is considered to be practically inaccessible from the mainland or not. * Northern Ireland, an area of the United Kingdom, is bounded by the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. * Equatorial Guinea's continental portion, R√≠o Muni, is a semi-exclave surrounded by Gabon, Cameroon and the Atlantic Ocean. * The Northwest Angle in Minnesota is geographically separated from the rest of the state (and United States) by Lake of the Woods and is accessible on land only through the province of Manitoba, Canada. Additionally, Elm Point, south of the town of Buffalo Point in Manitoba, is separated from the rest of Minnesota by Lake of the Woods. * Point Roberts, Washington, is an unincorporated community in Whatcom County‚Äîlocated on the southernmost tip of the Tsawwassen Peninsula, south of Delta, British Columbia, Canada‚Äîthat can be reached by land from the rest of the United States only by traveling through Canada. * Vermont has two pene-enclaves with Canada. Province Point, a few kilometres to the northeast of the town of East Alburgh, Vermont, is the southernmost tip of a small promontory approximately 1 ha (2 acres) in size (). The promontory is cut through by the U.S./Canadian border; as such the area is a practical enclave of the United States contiguous with Canada.http://www.scoutingny.com/visiting-a-bit-of-the-continental-us-you-can- only-get-to-by-going-through-canada/ Similarly, the southern point of Province Island (), a small island mostly in the Canadian province of Quebec, crosses into the US state of Vermont. It is situated in Lake Memphremagog, near Newport, Vermont. * Walvis Bay, now part of Namibia, was a pene-exclave of the Cape Colony in German South-West Africa, created in 1878. It became part of the Cape Province of the Union of South Africa in 1910, but from 1922, it was administered as a de facto part of South-West Africa, a League of Nations Mandate.Succession of States and Namibian territories, Y. Makonnen in Recueil Des Cours, 1986: Collected Courses of the Hague Academy of International Law, Academie de Droit International de la Haye, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987, page 213 In 1977, it was separated from that territory and re-integrated into the Cape Province.The Green and the dry wood: The Roman Catholic Church (Vicariate of Windhoek) and the Namibian socio-political situation, 1971-1981, Oblates of Mary Immaculate, 1983, page 6 South Africa did not relinquish sovereignty over Walvis Bay until 1994, nearly four years after Namibia's independence.No. 203 of 1993: Transfer of Walvis Bay to Namibia Act, 1993. Subnational \\"practical\\" enclaves, exclaves, and inaccessible districts * Although the Jervis Bay Territory, which occupies a coastal peninsula in Australia, is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply to it. * The Romanian village of NƒÉmoloasa (Gala»õi county) can be accessed only through Vrancea county (where there is a bridge over the Siret river), because it is separated by the Siret River from the rest of Gala»õi county. * The southern part of the Province of Venice, Veneto, can be reached directly from the rest of the province only by boat. By land it can be reached only by traveling through the Province of Padua because territorial continuity with the main part of the province exists only through some unconnected islands and islets. * It is not possible to drive from the northern half of County Leitrim in the Republic of Ireland to the southern half without leaving the county; Lough Allen and the River Shannon present a water barrier requiring one to drive through County Cavan to the east or County Roscommon to the west. * The community of East Kemptville, Nova Scotia, Canada, is part of the Municipality of Argyle, but it can only be reached by road from the rest of the municipality by travelling through the Municipality of Yarmouth or the Municipality of Shelburne. The latter route also requires travelling through the Municipality of Barrington. * The southeastern part of the Tai Po District (northern part of the Sai Kung Peninsula), Hong Kong, can be reached directly from the rest of the district only by boat. By land it can be reached only by traveling through the Sha Tin District because territorial continuity with the main part of the district is cut off by the Tolo Harbour. In the past, when there was no road network serving the region, the residents commonly travelled by boat to Tai Po Market for their daily lives, hence the districts were drawn this way, but now most of the ferries no longer exists and residents travel by road to markets in Sha Tin District (Ma On Shan or Sha Tin) instead. * In the United States: ** Several portions of land on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River belong to Delaware. Within the Twelve-Mile Circle, Delaware's border extends to the low-water mark across the river. South of the Circle, the Delaware-New Jersey border follows the middle of the river and bay. ** The Eastern Shore of Virginia on the southern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula shares a border with Maryland but is only connected to the rest of Virginia by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which is part of U.S. Route 13. ** The city of Carter Lake, Iowa is separated from the rest of the state of Iowa by the Missouri River, which changed course during a flood in 1877, cutting the city off from the rest of the state. It is now only accessible through Omaha, Nebraska. ** The village of Kaskaskia, Illinois, the state's first capital, is separated from the rest of Illinois by the Mississippi River due to a flood in 1881, which shifted the river to flow east of the town, rather than west. This resulted in the only access to the town being from Missouri. ** The Upper Peninsula of Michigan is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, so until the Mackinac Bridge was completed in 1957, the only land routes between them were through the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana, or through the Canadian province of Ontario. ** The Marble Hill neighborhood of Manhattan was separated from the rest of the borough by the construction of the Harlem Ship Canal in 1895 and then connected to the North American mainland and the Bronx when the Harlem River was filled in on its north side in 1914. =Enclaves within enclaves= Belgian exclaves of Baarle- Hertog in the Netherlands which, in turn, has Dutch enclaves within it Former Indo-Bangladesh enclaves created by the 1947 Partition of India. These were abolished in 2015 following a treaty between India and Pakistan. It is possible for an enclave of one country to be completely surrounded by a part of another country that is itself an enclave of the first country. These enclaves are sometimes called counter-enclaves. Two such complexes containing them exist currently: *The Dutch municipality of Baarle-Nassau has seven exclaves in two exclaves of the Belgian municipality of Baarle-Hertog. * Nahwa of the United Arab Emirates is surrounded by Madha, an exclave of Oman within the U.A.E. The former complex of enclaves at Cooch Behar district included 24 second-order enclaves and one small third-order enclave called Dahala Khagrabari #51: a piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh. The Indo-Bangladesh enclaves were exchanged on 31 July 2015 by the ratified Land Boundary Agreement, and Dahala Khagrabari was ceded to Bangladesh. =Ethnic enclaves= An ethnic enclave is a community of an ethnic group inside an area in which another ethnic group predominates. Ghettos, Little Italys, barrios and Chinatowns are examples. These areas may have a separate language, culture and economic system. * Sz√©kely Land is a Hungarian ethnic enclave within Romania, with its people calling themselves Sz√©kely. Originally, the name Sz√©kely Land denoted an autonomous region within Transylvania. It existed as a legal entity from medieval times until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, when the Sz√©kely and Saxon seats were dissolved and replaced by the county system. Along with Transylvania, it became a part of Romania in 1920, according with the Treaty of Trianon signed on 4 June 1920 at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles, France. In 1938‚Äì1940, during World War II, post-Trianon Hungary temporarily expanded its territory and included some additional territories that were formerly part of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, under Third Reich auspices, the Second Vienna Award. It was later reduced to boundaries approximating those of 1920 by the peace treaties signed after World War II at Paris, in 1947. The area was called Magyar Autonomous Region between September 8, 1952 and February 16, 1968, a Hungarian autonomous region within Romania, and today there are territorial autonomy initiatives to reach a higher level of self-governance for this region within Romania. * There are several Serb enclaves in Kosovo where the institutions of Kosovo are not fully operational due to disputes. =Extraterritoriality= Diplomatic missions, such as embassies and consulates, as well as military bases, are usually exempted from the jurisdiction of the host country, i.e., the laws of the host nation in which an embassy is located do not typically apply to the land of the embassy or base itself. This exemption from the jurisdiction of the host country is defined as extraterritoriality. Areas and buildings enjoying some forms of extraterritoriality are not true enclaves since, in all cases, the host country retains full sovereignty. In addition to embassies, some other areas enjoy a limited form of extraterritoriality. Examples of this include: * Pavillon de Breteuil in France, used by the General Conference on Weights and Measures. * United Nations headquarters in the United States, used by the United Nations. * United Nations Office at Geneva in Switzerland, used by the United Nations. * INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, used by INTERPOL. * NATO (political) headquarters near Evere in Haren, a part of the City of Brussels, Belgium. * Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (NATO) at the area designated as Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), north of Mons, Belgium. * Palazzo Malta and the Villa del Priorato di Malta, the headquarters of Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Rome. In addition to extraterritoriality, Italy recognizes the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters. Therefore, Italian sovereignty and SMOM sovereignty uniquely coexist without overlapping. * Extraterritorial properties of the Holy See in Rome and surroundings. * By treaty of 2 November 1929, Czechoslovakia obtained the lease for 99 years of two plots of land (in the Moldauhafen and in the Saalehafen), both within the perimeter of the free port of Hamburg. Another plot, in the Peutehafen, was purchased by the Czechoslovak government in 1929; this plot lies just outside the free-port perimeter. ** Saalehafen ‚Äì approximately 2 ha of land on Hallesches Ufer, on the southeastern bank of the Saalehafen. ** Moldauhafen ‚Äì approximately 0.5 ha of land on Dresdener Ufer, on the southeastern bank of the Moldauhafen. ** Peutehafen ‚Äì the narrow peninsula between the Peutekanal and the Peutehafen dock, comprising 8.054 ha of land and 0.5 ha of water surface. * In Szczecin, Poland, a similar provision existed following the Treaty of Versailles for Czechoslovakia to have access to the harbor, which until the end of World War II was located in Germany. From 1945, when Szczecin became part of Poland, Czechoslovakia possessed no extraterritorial rights there. It appears that the German concession ceased at the end of the war and that no successor paid attention to the pre-war rights that Czechoslovakia had under the Versailles Treaty. Neither the Polish nor the occupying Russians appear to have assumed any of Germany's pre-war liabilities. Czechoslovakia gave up the rights to its territory in Szczecin under an agreement signed on 13 January 1956. * Saimaa Canal: the longitudinal half of the canal in Russia is leased by Finland until 2063. Russian law is in principle valid, but in reality Finland maintains the area. * Under a treaty between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a Scottish Court was established at Camp Zeist near Utrecht for the trial of those accused in the Lockerbie bombing. The premises were under the authority of the court and immune from external interference for the duration of the trial and subsequent appeal, which lasted from 1999 to 2002. Dutch law continued to apply there in principle but the court was allowed to enact superseding regulations, and court officials enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Contrary to a popular misconception, the area did not become territory of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands retained sovereignty over it as the host country, similar to the status of diplomatic missions.Agreement between the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands concerning a Scottish trial in the Netherlands, 18 September 1998. =Land owned by a foreign country= Captain Cook Monument was deeded outright to the British government by the independent nation of Hawaii in 1877 One or more parcels/holdings of land in most countries is owned by other countries. Most instances are exempt from taxes. In the special case of embassies/consulates these enjoy special privileges driven by international consensus particularly the mutual wish to ensure free diplomatic missions, such as being exempt from major hindrances and host-country arrests in ordinary times on the premises. Most non-embassy lands in such ownership are also not enclaves as they fall legally short of extraterritoriality, they are subject to alike court jurisdiction as before their grant/sale in most matters. Nonetheless, for a person's offence against the property itself, equally valid jurisdiction in criminal matters is more likely than elsewhere, assuming the perpetrator is found in the prosecuting authority's homeland. Devoid of permanent residents, formally defined new sovereignty is not warranted or asserted in the examples below. Nonetheless, minor laws, especially on flag flying, are sometimes relaxed to accommodate the needs of the accommodated nation's monument. Embassies enjoy many different legal statuses approaching quasi-sovereignty, depending on the agreements reached and in practice upheld from time-to-time by host nations. Subject to hosts adhering to basic due process of international law, including giving warnings, the enforced reduction of scope of a foreign embassy has always been a possibility, even to the point of expelling the foreign embassy entirely, usually on a breakdown of relations, in reaction to extreme actions such as espionage, or as another form of sanction. The same seems to be possible in profit-driven moving or drilling under any of the sites below, providing safeguards as the structure or a new replacement site. The same possible curtailments and alterations never apply to proper exclaves. Examples of such land other than for diplomatic missions are: * Napoleon's original grave in Longwood, Saint Helena, owned by France. * Victor Hugo's house in Saint Peter Port (Saint-Pierre-Port), Guernsey, owned by the city of Paris. * The Brest memorial in Brest, France is owned by the U.S. It commemorates World War I. * The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Normandy, France, which contains the graves of 9,386 American military dead, most of whom died during the landings and ensuing operations of World War II, owned by the United States of America.Source:American Battle Monument Commission * Pointe du Hoc, the 13-hectare site of a memorial and museum dedicated to the World War II Normandy landing at Omaha Beach, France transferred to the U.S. on 11 January 1979. * The to Russia's final Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov near G√∂schenen in central Switzerland, was erected 99 years after his death by the Russian Empire. The 449 m¬≤ of rocks and 114 m¬≤ of access road is Parcel No. 725 of the land register of Andermatt, owned by the Russian Embassy in Berne. As in almost all examples in this list the parcel remains fully, in jurisdiction, that of the host country. * The Vimy Memorial in France, which commemorates the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The French government permanently granted the about to Canada as a war memorial in 1922 in recognition of Canada's military contributions in World War I in general and at Vimy Ridge in particular. * Two cemeteries on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, United States: one on Ocracoke Island and one on Hatteras Island in the town of Buxton, are owned by the United Kingdom hosting the British seamen washed ashore after World War II U-Boat attacks of 10 April (one from the San Delfino) and 11 May 1942 (five from HMT Bedfordshire). Four graves are at Ocracoke and two at Buxton; three of the bodies were never identified; one of them could be that of a Canadian seaman. The plot of land at Ocracoke \\"has been forever ceded to England\\" and is maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. The plot was leased to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for as long as the land remained a cemetery. The graves on Hatteras Island are maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. * The Captain Cook Monument at Kealakekua Bay and about of land around it in Hawaii, United States, the place where James Cook was killed in 1779, is owned by the United Kingdom.Horwitz, Tony. Oct. 2003, Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before, Bloomsbury, An historian on the occasion of the monument's 50th anniversary recorded in 1928 that the white stone \\"obelisk monument [was] erected to the memory of Captain Cook, about 1876, and on land deeded outright to the British Government by Princess Likelike, sister of King Kalakaua, about the same year, so that that square is absolute British Territory.\\" Hawaii was a sovereign nation at the time. According to MacFarlane, \\"The land under the monument was deeded to the United Kingdom in 1877 and is considered as sovereign non-embassy land owned by the British Embassy in Washington DC. ... the Hawaiian State Parks agency maintained that as sovereign British territory it was the responsibility of the UK to maintain the site.\\" (Fellow of Royal Geographic Society) * Tiwinza in Peru: In the 1998 peace agreement following the 1995 Cenepa War, Peru ceded to Ecuador the property, but not the sovereignty, of one square kilometre within Tiwinza (where 14 Ecuadorian soldiers were buried). Ecuador had established a frontier military outpost in Tiwinza, an area that was specified in the agreement as belonging to Peru. The John F. Kennedy Memorial at Runnymede, United Kingdom, placed on land given to the United States of America in 1965 * The land under the John F. Kennedy memorial at Runnymede, United Kingdom was transferred from the Crown Estates to the United States of America by the John F. Kennedy Memorial Act 1964 (an Act of the U.K. Parliament); however, it is in the care of the U.K.-based Kennedy Memorial Trust. (free registration required to read relevant text on page 704) * The Tomb of Suleyman Shah (of Suleyman Shah, the grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire) in Aleppo Governorate, Syria, is the property of Turkey. Article 9 of the Treaty of Ankara signed between France and Turkey in 1921, provides that the tomb \\"shall remain, with its appurtenances, the property of Turkey, who may appoint guardians for it and may hoist the Turkish flag there\\". Unusual cross-border transport channels =National railway passing through another state's territory= Changes in borders can make a railway that was previously located solely within a country traverse the new borders. Since diverting a railway is expensive, this arrangement may last a long time. This may mean that doors on passenger trains are locked and guarded to prevent illicit entry and exit while the train is temporarily in another country. Borders can also be in the \\"wrong\\" place, forcing railways into difficult terrain. In large parts of Europe, where the Schengen Area has eliminated border controls when travelling between its 27 member countries, this problem no longer exists, and railways can criss-cross borders with no need for border controls or locked trains. Examples include: Africa The Mauritania Railway. The inset shows the shorter route cutting through Western Sahara and the longer route within Mauritania through difficult terrain. * Due to inability to agree in 1963 on a shorter route through easy terrain, the iron ore railway in Mauritania originally had to use a longer route through a tunnel (built through 2 km of solid granite) near Choum to avoid the territory of Spanish Sahara. The tunnel is no longer in use and trains now use the shorter route through 5 km of Western Saharan territory controlled by the Polisario Front. * In 2012, a railway route from Angola proper to the enclave of Cabinda has to cross not only the Congo River but also the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. * In 2013, in Mozambique, the shortest railway route from coal mines at Tete to a port at Nacala passes through Malawi. A route through solely Mozambique territory is circuitous. * In 1928, Congo (Belgium) and Angola (Portugal) exchanged some land to facilitate the new route of the railway to Congo-Kinshasa.[Railways Africa 2014 issue 5, p29] Americas * Bolivia is landlocked and has no access to the sea, but a rail route runs through Chile from La Paz to the port of Arica on the Pacific Ocean. The rail route was built by Chile under the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 between Chile and Bolivia, with the Bolivian section transferred to Bolivia after 15 years. Bolivia enjoyed duty-free use of the railway and the ports connected. * The International Railway of Maine was a railroad constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) between Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec, and Mattawamkeag, Maine, closing a key gap in the railway's transcontinental main line to the port of Saint John, New Brunswick. The railway was, however, at all times under American jurisdiction within the borders of the United States. * In order to avoid such a trans-border arrangement, the United States made the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico, on which it was planned to build a southern route for the transcontinental railroad. Owing to the topography of the area, acquisition of the land was the only feasible way to construct such a railroad through the southern New Mexico Territory. * The former San Diego and Arizona Railway, completed in 1919, ran between the California cities of San Diego and El Centro with 71 km of track in Mexico between Tijuana and Tecate. The Mexican segment is now operated as the short line Baja California Railroad. Asia * A very short length of the Syrian Homs‚ÄìTripoli, Lebanon line crosses the border into Lebanon. This happens because the railway was built before this border was defined. Europe = Current = * Salzburg to Innsbruck (Austria) (passes through Rosenheim, Germany). A railway line within Austria exists as well, but trains take about 1.5 hours longer than across German territory. * Trains on the Birsig Valley Line from Basel to Rodersdorf, Switzerland, which passes through Leymen, France. It is operated by Baselland Transport and serviced by line no. 10, which continues into the Basel tram network. * The Hochrheinbahn (Upper Rhine Railway) from Basel via Waldshut to Schaffhausen is part of the Deutsche Bahn network, and is mostly in Germany, but the two ends are in Switzerland and it is only connected with the rest of the German railway network via Switzerland. At both Basel and Schaffhausen the railway has extraterritorial status: one can travel by train to and from the rest of Germany without going through Swiss customs. See Basel Badischer Bahnhof. * Trains from Neugersdorf, Saxony to Zittau pass Czech territory at Varnsdorf, while Czech trains from Varnsdorf to Chrastava pass through German territory at Zittau, and then a small part of Polish territory near the village of Poraj√≥w. * Trains from G√∂rlitz to Zittau, Germany, pass the border river Neisse several times (see Oder‚ÄìNeisse line); the railway station for Ostritz, Germany, lies in Krzewina Zgorzelecka, Poland. * Belgrade‚ÄìBar railway crosses into Bosnia and Herzegovina for , between stations Zlatibor and Priboj (both in Serbia). There is one station, ≈†trpci, but there are no border-crossing facilities, and trains do not call at the station. * The Knin ‚Äì Bihaƒá railway between Croatia and Bosnia is split by the Croatian‚ÄìBosnian border several times. Similarly, the Savski Marof ‚Äì Imeno railway was split by the Slovenian‚ÄìCroatian border several times. * Luƒçenec ‚Äì Veƒæk√Ω Krt√≠≈° line in Slovakia passes through Hungary from Ipolytarn√≥c to N√≥gr√°dszak√°l. * The local trains on the Burgenlandbahn in Austria cross the area of Hungary at Sopron. During the era of the Iron Curtain, the trains had their doors locked as they traversed Hungarian territory. * The line from Ventimiglia to Limone Piemonte, Italy, via Breil-sur-Roya, France. * The railway between France and Italy briefly leaves France to enter Monaco in a 150-metre tunnel before entering France once more. * For the Belgian Vennbahn (now a cycleway) narrow strips of Belgian territory were created running through Germany, creating five German exclaves. * The former Soviet republics have numerous examples: ** Semikhody ‚Äì Chernihiv line of Ukraine passes through Belarus territory.Railway Gazette International April 2008 p 240 ** Belarus/Lithuania: Aduti≈°kis railway station straddles the Lithuania/Belarus border. Trains pass through Lithuanian territory while traveling to and from Belarus, and platforms are in both Belarus and Lithuania. The station is now mainly used for freight. ** Druzhba ‚Äì Vorozhba line of Ukraine passes through Russian territory. ** In 2009, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to transfer ownership of a cross-border section of line. = Historical = * During the Cold War, underground lines in West Berlin ran under parts of East Berlin. Ghost stations () were stations on Berlin's U-Bahn and S-Bahn metro networks that were closed during this period of Berlin's division. * In Finland, Porkkala was leased to the Soviet Union as a Soviet naval base between 1944 and 1956. Porkkala is located on the Rantarata, the main railway line between Helsinki and Turku. Initially, only Soviet traffic was permitted through, forcing Finnish State Railways to reroute the trains through a circuitous route via Toijala. However, in 1947, the Soviets agreed to let Finnish trains through. At the border, Finnish trains were shunted to a Soviet locomotive, windows were shuttered, guards were posted to the doors, and the Soviet locomotive would pull the train through the base area, to be shunted back to a Finnish locomotive at the opposite border. = Proposals = * The shortest and straightest route for a proposed east‚Äìwest high-speed railway in Austria through Linz, Salzburg and Innsbruck would pass under some mountains belonging to Germany. =Highway of one state passing through another state's territory= This arrangement is less common as highways are more easily re- aligned. Examples include: Africa * Congo Pedicle road: built to provide access for Zambia's Luapula Province to the Copperbelt through of territory of the DR Congo, requiring a change in driving on the left to driving on the right. * In Guinea, where 20 km long tunnel(s) through a hillspur at Naigaya (elevation ), Sicourou, Bokariadi and Feraya might be avoided by crossing the border into Sierra Leone at Yana (elevation ). * Senegal is practically and inconveniently divided in two by the sovereign territory of The Gambia. Until the completion of the Senegambia bridge in 2019, the easiest way to travel from northern Senegal to the southern Casamance region was through Gambia via the Trans-Gambia Highway, with a connecting ferry being the only way to cross the Gambia River. The fare for the ferry crossing is a source of contention between the two countries.http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Project-and- Operations/Multinational__The_Gambia-Senegal__-_AR_- _Construction_of_the_Trans-Gambia_Bridge_and_Cross_Border_Improvement_.pdf Americas * East Richford Slide Road in the U.S. state of Vermont crosses into the Canadian province of Qu√©bec for a distance of approximately 100 metres (300 feet) before returning to the United States. A cemetery lies directly on the border vista.Google Maps Asia * The road from Dubai to the tourist spot of Hatta, an exclave of the emirate of Dubai, passes through a small stretch of Omani territory. * The highway between Bishkek and Issyk Kul, both in Kyrgyzstan, skirts the border with Kazakhstan, with the highway and the border crossing each other for short distances at various points. Europe * Various roads cross the Republic of Ireland‚ÄìUnited Kingdom border, back and forth between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The N54 in County Monaghan (RoI) twice becomes the A3 in County Fermanagh (NI), before continuing as the N54. Similarly, the N53 in Monaghan passes through County Armagh (NI) as the A37, before resuming as the N53 at a point where County Armagh, County Monaghan and County Louth (RoI) all meet.2006 Road Atlas Ireland, AA, pp. 36‚Äì37 , no national or border signs are present: the only indication is the change in margin markings and signs to indicate a change in speed limits between mph and km/h. It remains to be seen whether Brexit will change this friendly arrangement, which has persisted since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. * Between 1963 and 2002 the N274 road from Roermond to Heerlen, part of Dutch territory, passed through the German Selfkant, which had been annexed by the Netherlands after the Second World War but returned to Germany in 1963. * Close to Narvik, a road from Norway twice enters and leaves Swedish territory, following the southern shore of the Kj√•rdavatnet lake. It does not connect with any other Swedish road in either location before it enters Norwegian land once more.Jan S. Krogh's Geosite on S√∏rdalen valley * Road 402 between Podsabotin and Solkan in Slovenia, built when Slovenia was a state of Yugoslavia, passes through Italy for 1.5 kilometres. This section of the road does not intersect any other roads and is confined by high concrete walls topped by fences. As Slovenia and Italy are now both signatories to the Schengen Agreement, the barriers are little more than historical curiosities, although there is modern signage indicating that photography is forbidden along the Italian part of the road and that stopping is prohibited. * The Saatse Boot Road in Estonia, between the villages of Lutep√§√§ and Sesniki, passes through Russian territory. The stretch of road passing through Russia is flanked by barbed wire fences and guard towers. Stopping and/or getting out of one's vehicle on the stretch of road is forbidden; the rule is enforced by Russian border guards. * The D8 coastal highway of Croatia passes through a small section of Bosnia and Herzegovina territory, at the town of Neum, as it heads south from Split, Croatia to Dubrovnik. *Geneva Airport in Switzerland has a French Sector, which, while legally and geographically in Switzerland, is a de facto French domestic terminal used solely for flights to and from destinations in metropolitan France, and manned by French officials. Thus, prior to Switzerland's accession to the Schengen Area (which entered into force for air travel in March 2009), the French Sector saved the need for border controls for flights between France and Geneva Airport. The French Sector is only accessible by a road connecting it directly to France, which passes through Swiss territory but has no junctions or other physical access to Switzerland. This road leads to a turn-off on the French side of the Ferney-Voltaire border crossing, thus bypassing Swiss passport controls when they were operational before 2009. While Switzerland's membership of the Schengen Area now renders the convenience of avoiding passport controls obsolete, there is still a small advantage gained in using the French Sector: Switzerland is not in the EU Customs Union, so customs (but not passport) checks are still carried out at Switzerland's border posts. The French Sector, with its road that leads directly to France without access to Switzerland, bypasses this requirement. EuroAirport in Basel/Mulhouse is similar. =Subnational highway passing through other internal territory=  Americas  * United States: ** Interstate 684, connecting various points in New York State, passes through Connecticut near Kensico Reservoir and Westchester County Airport but is maintained entirely by New York State. Motor vehicles cannot enter from nor exit to Connecticut roads, even though a portion of the highway is owned by Connecticut. ** A portion of New York State Route 17/Interstate 86 passes through South Waverly, Pennsylvania but is maintained entirely by New York State. This includes the roadway and traffic lights at the interchange with US Route 220 and a short portion of Pennsylvania Route 199. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania police enforce traffic laws on this short stretch, where there is one overpass built and owned by Pennsylvania. ** A portion of New Hampshire Route 153 runs along the border with and briefly passes through Parsonsfield, Maine as it sweeps around the eastern shore of Province Lake. ** Minnesota State Highway 23 passes through about of Wisconsin just west of Duluth, Minnesota. Maintained by the Minnesota Department of Transportation, it intersects only a few dead-end local roads while in Wisconsin. No state line signs are present. ** Hopkins Road north of Newark, Delaware, briefly enters Pennsylvania where the Twelve-Mile Circle meets the Mason‚ÄìDixon Line. The road is maintained by Delaware, and it appears that at one time Arc Corner Road in Pennsylvania may have intersected here. Further east, Beaver Dam Road enters Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania at the intersection of Beaver Valley Road and re-enters Delaware about 0.5 miles later. The section of road in Pennsylvania is in rough shape, and it is unclear who is supposed to maintain this section. ** Wyoming Highway 70 enters Moffat County, Colorado for approximately . The route through Colorado is maintained by the Wyoming Department of Transportation.  Asia  * India ** The highway connecting Guwahati (capital of Assam state) to Silchar (a city in Barak valley of Assam) passes through Meghalaya state. ** One has to travel through part of West Bengal while travelling from Jamshedpur (Tatanagar), Jharkhand to a few other cities of Jharkhand like Ranchi or Dhanbad. ** Kota, a city in Rajasthan surrounded by territory of Madhya Pradesh, is connected to other parts of Rajasthan by roads passing through Madhya Pradesh. ** Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh) is connected to few other cities of Madhya Pradesh by highways passing through Uttar Pradesh, covering the city of Jhansi. * Turkey: ** The main road for travel to Bartƒ±n via Zonguldak actually crosses Bartƒ±n first, traverses Zonguldak a short distance, then returns to Bartƒ±n. =Border transport infrastructure= Africa * The Kazungula Bridge (under construction) will connect Zambia and Botswana in Southern Africa. The shared border between the two countries is approximately 150 m long, in the middle of the Zambezi River, and thus very nearly forms a quadripoint between Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. Because the border between Zambia and Botswana is so short and because of the orientation of the river banks, the span of the bridge must be curved to avoid crossing the adjacent territory of Namibia or Zimbabwe. Asia * The Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor on the Hong Kong‚Äìmainland China border: the immigration control points for Hong Kong (Shenzhen Bay Control Point) and mainland China (Shenzhen Bay Port) are co- located in the same building on the Shenzhen side of the bridge in an effective pene-exclave. The Hong Kong portion of the service building and the adjoining bridge are leased to Hong Kong, and are under Hong Kong's jurisdiction for an initial period until 30 June 2047. * The Mainland Port Area in Kowloon High Speed Railway Station in downtown Hong Kong is under the jurisdiction of the Mainland Chinese authorities and courts. The 30 km long tunnel to the border is under Hong Kong jurisdiction, however, the train compartments of any train in operation (that is carrying passengers to or from the Mainland) are subject to Mainland Laws and jurisdiction.Guangzhou- Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Co-Location) Ordinance This arrangement was created to allow for immigration clearance to occur in Hong Kong for all trains travelling to and from the Mainland of China. This has stirred much controversy and multiple protests in Hong Kong. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-45612749 * As a legacy of British Malaya, the Malaysian rail network had its southern terminus at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore. The land on which the station and the rail tracks stood was leased to Keretapi Tanah Melayu, the Malaysian state railway operator. Consequently, Malaysia had partial sovereignty over the railway land. Passengers had to clear Malaysian customs and immigration checks at Tanjong Pagar before boarding the train to Malaysia, even after Singapore shifted its border control facility to the actual border in 1998 and objected to the continued presence of Malaysian officials at the station. After a 20-year long dispute, the station was closed in 2011 and the railway land reverted to Singapore. A remnant of the rail corridor is still in use; KTM trains now terminate at Woodlands Train Checkpoint in northern Singapore near the border, which houses Malaysian and Singaporean border controls for rail passengers. Europe * Several bridges cross the rivers Oder and Neisse between Germany and Poland. To avoid needing to coordinate their efforts on a single bridge, the two riparian states assign each bridge to one or the other; thus Poland is responsible for all maintenance on some of the bridges, including the German side, and vice versa.Railway Gazette: Border bridges rebuilt * The Hallein Salt Mine crosses from Austria into Germany. Under an 1829 treaty Austria can dig under the then-Kingdom of Bavaria. In return some salt has to be given to Bavaria, and up to 99 of its citizens can be hired to work in the Austrian mine. * The twin town of TornioHaparanda or HaparandaTornio lies at the mouth of river Tornio, Tornio on the Finnish side and Haparanda on the Swedish side. The two towns have a common public transportation, as well as cultural services, fire brigade, sports facilities etc. * The Basel Badischer Bahnhof is a railway station in the Swiss city of Basel. Although situated on Swiss soil, because of the 1852 treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the state of Baden (one of the predecessors of today's Germany), the largest part of the station (the platforms and the parts of the passenger tunnel that lead to the German/Swiss checkpoint) is treated administratively as an inner-German railway station operated by the Deutsche Bahn. The shops in the station hall, however, are Swiss, and the Swiss franc is used as the official currency there (although the euro is universally accepted). The Swiss post office, car rental office, restaurant and a cluster of shops are each separately located wholly within a surrounding station area that is administered by the German railway. The customs controls are located in a tunnel between the platforms and the station hall; international trains which continue to Basel SBB usually had on-board border controls, until they were abolished in 2008 when Switzerland joined the Schengen Area. * The tram network in the French city of Strasbourg was extended into the neighbouring German city of Kehl in 2017. * The railway stations of Audun-le-Tiche and Volmerange-les-Mines are both located in France but are owned, operated and maintained by the Luxembourg National Railway Company, as are the short stretches of railway between the stations and the Luxembourg border. Thus, holders of a Luxembourg railway pass can travel to these stations without requiring a French ticket. The stations are both end stations on different lines and are not physically connected to any French railway. There are no border issues, as both France and Luxembourg are in the Schengen Area. Likewise, a short stretch of narrow-gauge railway line connects Hendaye in south-western France to the rest of the Metro Donostialdea network over the border in Spain. * The bus network of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, extends to the nearby Austrian village Wolfsthal where the train S7 (Schnellbahn) from Vienna has its terminal station. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, the abandoned rail road track from Wolfsthal to Bratislava could not be reinstalled because the land had been sold for housing projects.

The building is designed as a series of chalets, up to four stories tall, and stretches for a substantial distance along the lakeshore. The building has a Swiss alpine theme both on the outside and on the inside. The foundation is made of stone, with a wood superstructure. The outside is finished with brown- painted wood siding, and the window framing and balconies have wood sawn in Swiss jigsawn patterns. On the inside, the four-story lobby is surrounded by balconies, whose railings are patterned after Swiss designs. Construction began at Many Glacier Hotel in 1914 and was finished in just 1 year on July 4, 1915. The Great Northern Railway was establishing a series of hotels and backcountry chalets in the park and the Many Glacier Hotel was the \\"Gem of the West\\". This was part of an effort by Louis W. Hill, president of the Great Northern Railway and son of James J. Hill, to establish Glacier National Park as a destination resort and to promote the area as the \\"American Alps\\". To this end, Hill chose a Swiss chalet style for the hotels and chalets. The Glacier Park Lodge (previously known as the Glacier Park Hotel) and the Many Glacier Hotel were intended to be the core structures, while the chalets and campgrounds were sited in the backcountry within an easy day's ride or hike from one of the hotels or another chalet. The chalets were intended to entice visitors to leave the hotels and see the backcountry in a more rustic manner. These chalets were especially used during the early 1900s when the Hotel first opened, and the main attraction in the park was horseback riding. Current status Today, the hotel still maintains its historic character. Most rooms either have views of Swiftcurrent Lake or the surrounding mountain scenery. The hotel is a contributing property in the National Historic Landmark, Great Northern Railway Buildings district. Many Glacier Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. center See also * List of Historic Hotels of America * Lake McDonald Lodge at West Glacier, Montana within Glacier National Park * Prince of Wales Hotel within Waterton Lakes National Park Notes References  Category:National Historic Landmarks in Montana Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Glacier National Park (U.S.) Category:Great Northern Railway (U.S.) hotels Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1914 Category:Rustic architecture in Montana Category:Buildings and structures in Glacier County, Montana Category:Tourist attractions in Glacier County, Montana Category:1914 establishments in Montana Category:Historic district contributing properties in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Glacier County, Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Glacier National Park ","title":"Many Glacier Hotel"},{"id":"4848987","text":"Worse for the Wear is the third album by The New Amsterdams, released in 2003 on Vagrant Records.

It comprises the Lake McDonald Lodge and surrounding structures on the shores of Lake McDonald. It is centered on the main lodge, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, as well as surrounding guest cabins, dormitory buildings, employee residences, utility buildings, and retail structures. The district includes several privately owned inholding structures that are contributing structures, as well as a number of non-contributing buildings. Features The Lake McDonald Lodge was built in 1913-1914 by John Lewis as the Lewis Glacier Hotel to replace an earlier structure, the Snyder Hotel. The prominent site on the lakeshore was developed as the major tourist accommodation on the west side of the park. In addition to the rustic Swiss-chalet-styled lodge building, there are a number of structures built during the early 20th century, including eleven log cabins built in 1907 near the lodge and two more built in 1918. Other buildings in the historic district include the Garden Court, a two-story frame dormitory built in 1927. The two-story frame Cobb House dormitory features rustic interior detailing and a stone fireplace. The log Snyder Hall was built in 1911 as an assembly hall and was converted to a dormitory. The log Soda Fountain, built in 1927, became a recreation hall for employees. Other buildings include the 1909 frame barbershop, a 1922 log caretaker's residence, and a 1922 frame lumber shed. The 1935 McDonald Cabin is a former private residence, built in rustic log construction. The General Store is a chalet-style structure near the main road, built about 1937. The district also includes a 1934 stone bridge over Snyder Creek and six log private residences. Mission 66 The Lake McDonald Lodge Coffee Shop was originally excluded from the list of contributing structures as a modern intrusion. It has since been listed on its own on the National Register of Historic Places as an outstanding example of Mission 66-era design. Several other structures, including a motel unit, gas station and dormitories continue to be regarded as non-contributing to the historic district. Historic designation The Lake McDonald Lodge Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1978, primarily titled as the Lewis Glacier Hotel.

Tax resistance, the practice of refusing to pay taxes that are considered unjust, has probably existed ever since rulers began imposing taxes on their subjects. It has been suggested that tax resistance played a significant role in the collapse of several empires, including the Egyptian, Roman, Spanish, and Aztec. Many rebellions and revolutions have been prompted by resentment of taxation or had tax refusal as a component. Examples of historic events that originated as tax revolts include the Magna Carta, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution. This page is a partial list of global tax revolts and tax resistance actions that have come to the attention of Wikipedia's editors. This includes actions in which a person or people refused to pay a tax of some sort, either through passive resistance or by actively obstructing the collecting authorities, and actions in which people boycotted some taxed good or activity or engaged in a strike to reduce or eliminate the tax due. Examples =Before 1500 A.D.= Jewish Zealots, 1st century A.D. In the 1st century AD, Jewish Zealots in Judaea resisted the poll tax instituted by the Roman Empire. Jesus was accused of promoting tax resistance prior to his torture and execution (\\"We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C√¶sar, saying that he himself is Christ a King\\" ‚Äî Luke 23:2). After the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD, Jews, particularly those exiled to Egypt, refused to pay the still- extant \\"temple tax\\" to Rome (which it was using to maintain pagan temples); Rome responded by destroying Jewish temples. Limoges, 578 In 578 AD residents of Limoges, encouraged by the local clergy, rioted, destroying tax- collecting paraphernalia and threatening the assessor. The government responded harshly, with punishments including torture and crucifixion, though Queen Fredegund later was said to have repented and rescinded the tax.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 57‚Äì58.

Danegeld, 1041 In 1041, residents of Worcester rebelled against the Danegeld being collected by King Harthacnut, and killed two of his tax collectors. Harthacnut responded by burning Worcester to the ground.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 71‚Äì72. Constantinople, 1197 When Alexios III Angelos tried to tax residents of Constantinople in order to come up with money to pay protection money to Henry VI, the people of Constantinople refused to pay, and Alexios was reduced to trying to collect the sum by stripping the ornaments from old tombs.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 79‚Äì80. Florence, 1289 A war tax instituted by the Florentine seigniory in 1288 and increased in 1289 led to mass tax resistance that forced the government to abandon the tax.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 93. Clericis laicos, 1296 In 1296, Pope Boniface VIII issued the clericis laicos, which prohibited secular governments from taxing churches without the permission of the Pope, and prohibited church officials from paying such taxes.

Wat Tyler‚Ä≤s rebellion, 1381 In 1381, the Peasant's Revolt occurred in England, when Wat Tyler led an uprising over a new poll tax. Tyler marched an army of tens of thousands of peasants from Kent to Canterbury, then to London, beheaded the archbishop, and exacted radical concessions from King Richard II. During the negotiations, Tyler was killed by officers of the King and was publicly beheaded, and Richard II retracted all of the concessions that he had previously made.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 128‚Äì30. * French aides uprisings, 1381 In 1381 there was widespread tax rebellion in France. > In Rouen workers in the textile trade gathered in the Old Market, chose one > of their own to represent the king, and had this mock king sign acts > abolishing the aides.

It moved through Orleans > and on to Sens, finally reaching Lyons....Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 127‚Äì28. Bundschuh movement The Bundschuh movement was in part a tax resistance movement that encouraged its followers to stop paying tithes to the Catholic Church and taxes.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 143‚Äì44. In France, a tithe-payer strike spread from 1529 to 1560 among both Catholics and Protestants.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 156‚Äì57. Flemish revolt against Maximilian of Austria, 1488 The guilds of Bruges (supported by the other Flemish cities) held later emperor Maximilian captive when he heavily disturbed the economy by raising taxes and seigniorage in order to wage war. They negotiated better terms and then released him. He then reneged on the agreement and took his armies back to Bruges in revenge. Bruges lost its administrative functions to the city of Ghent. =16th century= Revolt of the Comuneros, 1520 In Spain the people of Salamanca in 1520 refused to pay any taxes because of their belief that Charles I was sending the tax money to the Netherlands. They were joined by other towns, which eventually formed the Revolt of the Comuneros.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 145‚Äì51. Amicable Grant revolt in England 1525 Under the leadership of his chief minister Thomas Wolsey, England's King Henry VIII repeatedly raised taxes and imposed forced loans in the 1520s to pay for his large-scale wars in Europe. Finally the call for an \\"Amicable Grant\\" of non-repayable loans in 1525 went too far. Parliament had not voted it, and the English landed and financial elites refused to pay. Passive resistance was widespread and England was on the verge of violent resistance when the program was hurriedly ended. Lack of money ended Henry's plans for an invasion of France and he took England out of the war with the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525. German Peasants‚Ä≤ War, 1524‚Äì25 The German Peasants' War of 1524‚Äì25 was in part a tax resistance campaign. The rebels vowed to set their own tithes, and: > The small tithes, whether ecclesiastical or lay, we will not pay at all, for > the Lord God created cattle for the free use of man. We will not, therefore, > pay farther an unseemly tithe which is of man‚Ä≤s invention.... Henceforth no > one shall have to pay death taxes, whether small or large.Burg (2004) op. > cit. pp. 151‚Äì54. Revolt of Ghent, 1539 The Revolt of Ghent began when the city magistrates refused to pay taxes demanded by Charles V for his war with France.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 158‚Äì59. Hutterites In the 16th century, Hutterites refused to pay taxes for war or capital punishment. One wrote: > For war, killing, and bloodshed (where it is demanded especially for that) > we give nothing, but not out of wickedness or arbitrariness, but out of the > fear of God () that we may not be partakers in strange sins. Another wrote: > [When] the government requires of us what is contrary to our faith and > conscience ‚Äî as swearing oaths and paying hangman's dues or taxes for war ‚Äî > then we do not obey its command. * Gabelle revolts, 1542, 1548 Residents of La Rochelle rebelled against the gabelle, or salt tax, in 1542. \\"[A]rmed rebels thwarted the tax-collecting efforts of two successive visitations of royal commissioners sent out to enforce the [gabelle] edicts.\\"Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 160‚Äì61. A second revolt centered in Guyenne in 1548 was more organized, widespread, and violent; and was violently suppressed.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 163‚Äì64. Also in August 1548, there were violent revolts against the gabelle in Bordeaux in which tax collectors were killed and their homes burnt. The French central government sent in thousands of troops who terrorized the occupants, imposed martial law, and enforced humiliating terms; however \\"Amazingly, in the long run, the rebellion did achieve its aim. Unnerved by the riots, Henri II decided not to enforce the salt tax.\\" Tariff resistance in Holland, 1543‚Äì49 Merchants in Holland successfully resisted a variety of export duties imposed by the Holy Roman Empire via Mary of Hungary.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 162. Tax strikes in France, 1579‚Äì80 In Romans-sur-Is√®re and other parts of Dauphin√©, anti-tax leagues formed, which grew into a powerful rebellion that was crushed in the wake of the ambush and murder of many of the rebel leaders by vigilantes during the Carnival of 1580.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 174‚Äì78. The Revolt Against the Tribute, Philippines, 1589 In 1589, the provinces of Cagay√°n, Ilocos Norte, and Ilocos Sur rebelled against unjust Spanish colonial taxes and abusive tax collectors in what became known as the \\"Revolt Against the Tribute,\\" the \\"Dingr√°s Revolt,\\" or the \\"Ilocos Norte Revolt.\\" * Rappenkrieg, 1591‚Äì94 In a three-year-long tax refusal campaign called the Rappenkrieg or \\"farthing war\\" the residents of Basel, Switzerland refused to pay a tax destined for the bishop.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 179. Croquants, 1593‚Äì95 Peasant rebels in southwestern France called \\"croquants\\" included \\"refusal to pay tithes, tailles, and rents... and resistance to tax collectors and their agents.\\" A second rebellion in Vivarais at the same time also centered on refusal to pay the taille.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 180‚Äì82. * Sales tax resistance in France, 1597 A number of towns in France, notably Poitiers, resisted the imposition of a new sales tax by Henry IV in 1597. The King at first stubbornly enforced the tax by force, but eventually decided the expense and fuss was not worth the income and rescinded the tax.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 186‚Äì87. Jelali revolts The Jelali revolts were typically inspired by taxes or the action of tax collectors, and included tax resistance strategies, including \\"The Great Flight\\" ‚Äî a sort of mass emigration by peasants from their land to avoid taxes.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 185, 189. =17th Century= Bolotnikov rebellion, 1606 During the Bolotnikov rebellion, tribes in western Siberia began refusing to pay taxes to the central government.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 190. Brussels, 1619 In the city of Brussels, then part of the Duchy of Brabant in the Habsburg Netherlands, there was a tax strike in 1619. When the States of Brabant (composed of representatives of the clergy, the nobility, and the four cities Leuven, Brussels, Antwerp and 's-Hertogenbosch) met to renew the standard sales tax on the \\"four species of consumption\\" (beer, wine, bread and meat), the guilds of the city of Brussels instructed their representatives not to vote the taxes through until their grievances had been addressed. As the constitutional principle was that taxes had to be passed by \\"full consent\\", this meant the taxes could not legally be collected. After two months of constitutional impasse and fruitless negotiations (May‚ÄìJune) the government ordered the taxes to be collected notwithstanding. The guilds made this impossible, and their defiance of the government led to a military occupation of the city in September 1619. The central authorities then revised the civic constitution to limit the power of the guilds to filibuster the States of Brabant. The deans of six of the guilds, and their legal counsel, were served with sentences of lifelong banishment from the Low Countries. English Civil War In 1627, John Hampden was imprisoned for his opposition to the loan Charles I authorised without parliamentary sanction, and he also refused to pay ship money to the Royal Navy. The attempts to imprison resisters like Hampden led to the English Civil War.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 9‚Äì16. From the summer of 1646 through 1648, the city of London refused to pay taxes to the New Model Army which was occupying the city. In a celebrated 1654 case, George Cony refused to pay customs duties that had been instituted by The Protectorate without consent of parliament. 17th-century tax rebellions in France In 1615, the residents of one commune refused to pay the wine tithe and threatened to throw the collector into the Rh√¥ne. In Poitiers, France, in 1624 and again on multiple occasions in 1663, mobs attacked Inns where French tax farmers were staying, threatening to torch the building and kill those inside.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 192. The success of anti-tax rebellions in Saintonge and Angoumois led to other rebellions in France, including some in which excise officers were lynched.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 201. The most notorious incident was the massacre of tax officers responsible for collecting the gabelle at Agen in June 1635. A second \\"Croquants‚Ä≤ Revolt\\" in 1636‚Äì37 (with some outbreaks as early as 1628) concerned the taxes being raised to support France‚Ä≤s entry into the Thirty Years' War and included the lynching of tax officials, a tax strike, and a major battle at which over 2,000 people were killed. The major rebellion was defeated, but outbreaks of mass tax resistance continued as late as 1658.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 201‚Äì04. From 1638 to 1645, the residents of Pardiac refused to pay their taxes, rose up to free the officials who had been imprisoned for failure to remit the tax money, repulsed government troops sent to enforce the tax laws, and massacred a tax official and his bodyguard.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 204‚Äì05. In 1639‚Äì43, the revolt of the va-nu-pieds in Normandy included a tax strike and attacks on the homes of tax farmers.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 205‚Äì07. In 1643 there were attacks on tax collectors in multiple regions of France.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 208‚Äì09. The Fronde of 1646‚Äì53 was also marked by anti-tax riots.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 215‚Äì19. The revolt of the papier timbr√© in 1675 was centered on a new stamp tax, and included destruction of tax offices and attacks on tax- and tithe- collectors.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 224‚Äì25. In 1682, a village curate led a tax revolt in which the villagers stoned the monks and the tithe agent who had come to collect a grain tithe. Algonquian resistance, 1637 In 1637, the Algonquian resisted being taxed by Dutch colonialists to pay for improvements to Fort Amsterdam. Italian tax revolts, 1647 Residents of Palermo and of Naples revolted in 1647 and destroyed the tax offices and the homes of tax farmers.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 209‚Äì11 * Swiss peasant war of 1653 A devaluation of Bernese money caused a tax revolt and the Swiss peasant war of 1653 that spread from the Entlebuch valley in the Canton of Lucerne to the Emmental valley in the Canton of Bern and then to the cantons of Solothurn and Basel and also to the Aargau. Resistance to Cromwell's Taxes-by-Decree, 1654 In 1654, an English merchant named George Cony refused to pay customs duties that had been established by Oliver Cromwell's government without its having bothered to go through Parliament, and thereby called into question the legal underpinnings of the whole regime. * * Quaker Tithe and War Tax Resistance, 1659‚Äì George Fox‚Ä≤s Quaker movement included resistance to tithes and other mandatory fees destined for the establishment church. Soon, the movement also incorporated resistance to militia taxes and fees, and to \\"trophy money\\" (taxes for equipping soldiers). These were early examples of war tax resistance in the Quaker movement.see the excerpts from Revolt of the papier timbr√©, 1675 Scottish presbyterian dissent, 1678‚Äì88 In the 17th century, as the reformation government in Scotland reintroduced a state episcopal church and brutally cracked down on dissident presbyterian groups, members of those groups resisted the taxes that were being raised to pay for this repression, and advocated mass tax resistance.e.g. * (When the Scottish Presbyterians gained the upper-hand and became the establishment church of Scotland, the tables were turned, and members of dissident churches began to resist taxes paid for its support. * see also ) Resistance in New England, 1687 On 22 August 1687, John Wise met with some of the other \\"principal inhabitants\\" of Ipswich in New England, and decided that a new tax that had been imposed by governor Edmund Andros, without consulting the colony's General Assembly, was illegitimate and \\"that it was not the town's duty any way to assist that ill method of raising money.\\" A town meeting the next day that Andros had called for in order to select tax commissioners instead issued a declaration against the tax. A number of those at the town meeting were then arrested, hauled to a jail in another town, and then put on trial before a jury hand-picked by the prosecution and a judge who referred to the defendants as \\"criminals\\" over the course of the trial. Fines and court costs followed, and, at first, the Andros tyranny was triumphant. But Wise and company had the last laugh. On 18 April 1689, in the wake of the Glorious Revolution in the home country, a \\"Declaration of the Gentlemen, Merchants, and Inhabitants of Boston\\" was issued, which proclaimed the assault on the rights of dissenting English colonists to be part of the same plot of \\"the great Scarlet Whore\\" to crush Englishmen under the thumb of the papists (that is, James II of England) again. Then followed a revolution. Andros and Judge Dudley, who had tried the case against Wise and the rest, were overthrown and imprisoned. =18th century= Camisard revolt, 1700‚Äì03 Tax resistance was a feature of the Camisard revolt.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 229. New Jersey resistance to a Catholic assessor, 1715 In 1715, 36 New Jersey residents pledged to refuse to pay taxes \\"Because wee have been Illegally Assessed by an Asseser who being a Known & open profest Roman Catholick which is Utterly Repugnant to the Laws of Great Brittain & Contrary to ye Rights & Liberties of his Royall Majties faithfull Subjects.\\" 18th-century uprisings in Japan Successful peasant uprisings in the Fukuyama fief in 1717 (and again in 1752 and 1770), in the Tsuyama fief in 1726‚Äì27, and in Iwaki Daira in 1739, focused on the oppressiveness of taxes and tax collection.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 231‚Äì35, 241‚Äì42. Other tax revolts in Aizu in 1749, in Shinano Ueda in 1761‚Äì63, in Tenma Sodo in 1764‚Äì65, in Koyasan in 1776, in Kozuke & Musashi in 1781, and in Hokkaido in 1790, were only partially successful but also led to severe reprisals.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 241‚Äì45, 248‚Äì49, 279‚Äì80, 308‚Äì09. Malt tax riots in Scotland, 1725 A duty on malt had been imposed in England to pay for a war against France. At the union with Scotland in 1707, most taxes were made uniform, but under the Treaty of Union Scotland was given a temporary exemption from the malt tax, until the end of the war. After the war, in 1725, the House of Commons applied a new malt tax which applied throughout Great Britain, but charged at only half the rate in Scotland. Scots were unused to this tax, which increased the price of beer. Enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of their representative in parliament, who had voted for the tax. In Edinburgh, brewers went on strike, illegally. Andrew Millar, then a book trade apprentice, helped overthrow attempts by Edinburgh magistrates to control dissemination of opinion during the unrest. The pamphlet Millar refers to in the letter to Robert Wodrow dated 10 August 1725, and his actions detailed in the letter dated 15 July, emphasized contemporary doubts and challenges to the strike's \\"illegality\\". Much later, in 1806, there were malt tax riots in Llannon, Wales, in which a mob attacked 26 excise tax collectors who were searching for malt.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 322‚Äì23. Excise tax riots in England, 1733 Robert Walpole's attempts to introduce an excise tax bill led to widespread, heated protest, including mobs that invaded the House of Commons. Walpole was forced to withdraw his proposal.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 236‚Äì38. \\"Jack-a-Lents\\", 1734‚Äì49 In Gloucester and Hereford counties, England, rioters dressed in women's clothing and blackface destroyed tollbooths, a variety of resistance that would reemerge a century later in the Rebecca Riots.See for some references. A royal proclamation complained of the rebels that they \\"have made publick and open Declaration, that they would proceed to pull down ≈øeveral other Turnpikes; and that if any of the Commi≈ø≈øioners ≈øhould attempt to ≈øet up the Turnpikes again, they would pull down their Hou≈øes, and would cut down the Turnpikes as often as they ≈øhould be ≈øet up.\\" A similar outbreak took place in Bristol in 1749, in which self-styled Jack-a-Lents, \\"many naked with their faces blacked ... destroyed the gates at Bedminster, Ashton, Don John's Cross, Dundry, Backwell, Nailsea, Redcliffe, Totterdown, Teasford and Bath Roads, Hanham, Kingswood, Stoke's Croft, &c.;, &c.;\\" Porteous riots, 1736 Rioters, sympathetic to condemned smugglers who were resisting excise taxes, managed to free one, but in an attempt to free another several were killed by the Edinburgh city guard, commanded by John Porteous. Porteous was convicted of these killings, but pardoned by Queen Caroline, whereupon a lynch mob seized Porteous and hanged him.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 241. Tithe resistance in France, 1736 Peasants in disguise attacked and reclaimed the grain from the granary of a tithe collector in France in 1736. Authorities could find no witnesses willing to testify against any of the attackers. North Carolina Counties Resist, 1746 In 1746, the North Carolina colonial governor tried to rejigger the composition of the colonial Assembly, taking seats away from some counties. Those counties responded by withdrawing from the Assembly and refusing to surrender any taxes to the colonial government. Other counties, not wanting to bear the whole cost of government themselves, then responded by withholding their own taxes. This state of affairs lasted eight years. French and Indian War, 1755 In the mid-18th century, American Quaker John Woolman led many Quakers to question and refuse the payment of taxes to pay for the French and Indian War. In 1755, Woolman addressed the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting with his concern, saying in part: > Some of our members, who are officers in civil government, are, in one case > or other, called upon in their respective stations to assist in things > relative to the wars; but being in doubt whether to act or crave to be > excused from their office, if they see their brethren united in the payment > of a tax to carry on the said wars, may think their case not much different, > and so might quench the tender movings of the Holy Spirit in their minds. > Thus, by small degrees, we might approach so near to fighting that the > distinction would be little else than the name of a peaceable people. * * > Gross (2008) op. cit. pp. 20‚Äì23 * A group of several like-minded Quakers, including John Woolman, John Churchman, and Anthony Benezet then sent a letter to other meetings, which read in part: > [B]eing painfully apprehensive that the large sum granted by the late Act of > Assembly for the king's use is principally intended for purposes > inconsistent with our peaceable testimony, we therefore think that as we > cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, so neither ought we to contribute > thereto by paying the tax directed by the said Act, though suffering be the > consequence of our refusal, which we hope to be enabled to bear with > patience. The \\"Regulator\\" movement, 1767‚Äì71 The Regulator movement against the corrupt colonial administration of North Carolina from around 1767 to 1771 presaged the American Revolution. It began with organized groups of rural North Carolinans refusing to pay inflated taxes to corrupt authorities, and eventually built to an armed rebellion (which was crushed).Gross, David (2008) op. cit. A revolt in Palermo, 1773 Most Sicilians refused to pay new taxes imposed in 1770, and ripped down notices announcing the new levies. By 1773 the resistance led to a full-fledged revolt and ushered in a period when Palermo was under the de facto rule of the maestranze (guilds).Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 271‚Äì72. American Revolution Boston Tea Party, 16 December 1773. British colonists in America used various methods of tax resistance to resist the British in the years leading up to the American Revolution, including the Boston Tea Party action, the Gasp√©e Affair, \\"spinning bees\\" in which revolutionary-minded women would make untaxed domestic cloth (prefiguring Gandhi's homespun cloth campaign), and a boycott of other taxed goods. * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 81‚Äì90. After the revolution was underway, taxes instituted by the American patriot side were also widely resisted. One 1781 tax in Connecticut, for example, was designed to raise ¬£288,233 but raised only ¬£40,000 due to unwillingness to pay. Some Quaker meetings recommended that their members not pay taxes to the revolutionary governments, and other Quakers refused to use Continental currency which the revolutionary governments were using for seigniorage. * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 90‚Äì114. African American protests against taxation without representation, 1780 In 1780, African American Paul Cuffe and his brother resisted the state tax of Massachusetts. Cuffe wrote to the state legislature: \\"While we are not allowed the privilege of free men of the state having no vote or influence in the election with those that tax us. Yet many of our color, as is well known, have cheerfully entered the field of battle in the defense of the common cause.\\"Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 115‚Äì17. In 1783 free, taxpaying African Americans in Massachusetts were given full citizenship rights, including the right to vote. Revolt of the Comuneros, 1781 The Revolt of the Comuneros in Colombia began with bands of armed protesters confronting tax commissioners and state monopoly shops.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 298‚Äì92. New Hampshire secessionists, 1781 For a while, during the early days of the United States, Vermont was an independent republic of sorts, though with aspirations for statehood. Some regions of neighboring New Hampshire felt more loyal to the Vermont Republic than to the confederation of United States, and expressed this by refusing to pay taxes to the latter. York tax riot, 1786 In York, Pennsylvania, in 1786, Jacob Bixler's cow was distrained after he refused to pay a tax. Sympathizers with Bixler disrupted the subsequent auction and rescued the cow. * Tax resistance during the French Revolution During the French Revolution and its aftermath, customs houses were burned by mobs, tax rolls were destroyed, and excise collectors were made to renounce their jobs and then were run out of town (or in some cases killed). Popular tax resistance was directed both against the toppling monarchy and against the governments that would try to replace it.Gross, David (2008) op. cit., pp. 139‚Äì53. In the German Rhineland and the Southern Netherlands war taxes were levied before and after French revolutionary troops occupied these territories during the War of the First Coalition. Churches and monasteries were taxed heavily before they were dissolved. Huge amounts of gold and silver objects, many from the Middle Ages and irreplaceable, were melted down in this period in order to pay for these taxes. Protests occurred but did not help. The famous Trier Cathedral treasure suffered immensely; only twelve objects of precious metal survived. The equally rich Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht lost 80% of its treasures, even though many precious objects were hidden in private homes. Aachen Cathedral Treasury remained largely untouched because the most valuable pieces were sent away to Paderborn in time. The Whiskey Rebellion, 1791‚Äì94 There was an earlier rebellion, in 1783, against a Pennsylvania state excise tax on whiskey. In Washington County, protesters seized a fleeing tax collector, forced him to destroy his arms and paperwork, shaved his head, and paraded him through the areas he was sent to tax.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 293‚Äì94. White Lotus Rebellion, 1793 Members of the White Lotus Society refused to pay taxes, and their movement eventually grew into a full rebellion that lasted until 1803.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 309‚Äì10. Pazvantoƒülu rebellion, 1794 In the wake of the Pazvantoƒülu rebellion, peasants who had been expecting their taxes to be eliminated in the wake of the rebel victory fled their villages rather than pay the enduring taxes.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 310‚Äì12. Fries‚Ä≤s Rebellion, 1799‚Äì1800 Resistance in Mexico, 1780‚Äì1807 There was widespread resistance to the pulque tax and other taxes in Zempoala and Otumba, beginning in 1780.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 322. =19th Century= A mass tax strike in Benares, 1810‚Äì11 When the occupation British Raj attempted to impose a house tax in Bengal, 200,000 residents of Benares shut their shops, left their homes, assembled en masse in the countryside, and petitioned the occupation government to lift the tax. This massing occurred in December 1810 ‚Äì January 1811. The Raj at first made a show of force, but eventually rescinded the tax. Radical Reformers, 1819 The \\"Radical Reformers\\" were advocates of democratic reforms in England ‚Äî things like universal male suffrage and secret ballots. In the wake of a military massacre of reform demonstrators in Manchester in August, 1819, reformers vowed to refuse to buy and consume products on which the government applied an excise tax, like tea, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages. Bermuda, 1821 When residents of St. George parish refused to pay their church tithes, William Lumley, governor of Bermuda, put several in military jail. Lumley's acts were later ruled illegal (Basham v. Lumley, 1829), the court ruling that although the governor of the Bermuda colony had also been granted ecclesiastical authority by the crown, he was not authorized to use his civil authority to imprison people who refused his ecclesiastical orders; at most he could excommunicate them. Tumenggung Mohammad revolt, 1825 The followers of Tumenggung Mohammad in Indonesia practiced tax resistance, including rioting against tax collectors.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 332. Tax resistance against Charles X of France, 1829 When Charles X of France attempted to bypass the legislature and enact its own taxes in 1829, French liberals in the Breton Association organized tax resistance and created a fund to defray the costs of any tax resisters who were prosecuted. Six Parisian newspapers who printed the Association's manifesto were prosecuted by the crown. Fifteen regional organizations, including Refus de l'imp√¥t, Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera, and Association parisienne, were formed specifically to engage in tax resistance. * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 155‚Äì60. Tax resistance in Georgian England In the 1820s and 1830s, activists like William Benbow and Thomas Jonathan Wooler and groups such as the National Union of the Working Classes and National Political Union advocated and practiced tax resistance. The Tithe War, 1830‚Äì38 From 1830 to 1838, Irish Catholics conducted a mass tax strike against the mandatory tithes payable to the Anglican official state Church of Ireland. The Tithe War, as it came to be called, had both a nonviolent, passive-resistance wing, led by James Warren Doyle, and a violent one, in which bands of paramilitary secret societies enforced the strike and attacked tax collectors and collaborators. The campaign was eventually successful in eliminating the tithe system, although the government essentially converted what had been tithes on the tenants into rent due through the landlords. Resistance in Syria, 1831‚Äì54 Syrians resisted being taxed both by Egypt and later by Turkey, and refused to pay these occupation governments.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 336‚Äì37, 345, 359‚Äì60. Tax resistance for the Reform Act of 1832 Tax resistance was an important tool in the arsenal of the Birmingham Political Union and its allies who forced the crown and the House of Lords to capitulate over the Reform Act of 1832. * * The Annual Register (1832) * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 161‚Äì67. * In the spring of 1832, residents of Carmarthen, Wales, met and vowed to stop paying taxes if the Reform Act were not passed, and some stopped paying taxes in the wake of the collapse of Lord Grey's government.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 335. Tinos, 1833 In 1833, thousands of residents of the island of Tinos stopped paying their taxes in an organized campaign. The government reacted fiercely, imprisoning many leaders of the movement and forcing the local bishop to flee. U.K. resistance to \\"Assessed Taxes,\\" 1833‚Äì51 There was sporadic resistance to assessed taxes (particularly the window tax) in the United Kingdom. Resisters felt the tax was overly-regressive. Resisters formed tax resistance associations and disrupted auctions of goods seized from resisters by the tax authorities.see, e.g. * The Spectator 26 October 1833, 23 November 1833 Edinburgh Annuity/Clerico-Police Tax, 1833‚Äì61 An Annuity Tax to raise money for the establishment clergy in Edinburgh, Scotland began to be resisted by nonconformists around 1833, in particular by William Tait, publisher of Tait's Magazine who went to jail for his stand. Celebrated imprisonments like this, and occasional attempts (often unsuccessful) by the authorities to seize and auction property of the resisters, characterized the campaign. The government attempted to appease the resisters by \\"abolishing\\" the Annuity tax, but they did so by paying the clergy from funds raised by a different tax, leading the resisters to dub it the \\"Clerico-Police Tax\\" and to continue to resist it. * Tax resistance in Bulgaria, 1835‚Äì37 Peasants in the western border region of Bulgaria refused to pay taxes in hopes of autonomy and assistance from the newly autonomous Serbia.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 339. Robert Purvis, 1838, 1853 African-American activist Robert Purvis refused to pay his Pennsylvania state taxes in protest against the state's denial of equal voting rights to black citizens around 1838, and then refused to pay the part of his property tax that went towards education in 1853 when his children were refused admission to the whites-only classrooms. Rebecca Riots, 1839‚Äì43 The Rebecca Riots were a protest against the high tolls which had to be paid on the local turnpike roads in Wales, and included destruction of tollhouses and harassment of toll collectors. Corn Law protests, 1842 In February, 1842 \\"a meeting of ladies\\" in Manchester opposed to the Corn Laws signed a tax resistance pledge, in which they \\"resolve[d] that we will form ourselves into a provisional committee, to carry out a plan of passive resistance... That by passive resistance we understand that we will allow our furniture to be seized for the payment of assessed taxes without offering any resistance to the collecting officers, at the same time urging the people not to purchase the articles so seized. And further, we mean abstinence from the several taxed luxuries used in our homes. We adopt the above pledge for three months, and further pledge ourselves during that time to use our utmost exertions to preserve perfect peace among the people.\\" Poor Law protests, 1843 Opposition to the New Poor Law led to refusal to pay the taxes for its support. The campaign featured demonstrations of thousands of people, passive resistance, and noncooperation with government auction of distrained goods. In County Waterford the campaign was particularly strong, and openly threatened violence against tax collectors, leading the poor rate collector there to abandon plans to distrain and auction property in lieu of voluntarily paid taxes. * Maryland bond protests, 1843 Some residents of Maryland, as their state government went into default over canal bonds in the wake of the Panic of 1837, refused to pay taxes the proceeds of which were destined for bond-holders. In some areas, tax collectors resigned and the government was unable to find others willing to take their places. Tax resistance was promoted in part by the Locofocos, a Democratic party splinter group. \\"White Quakers,\\" 1843 The White Quakers, an Irish Quaker splinter group named for their characteristic undyed clothing, undertook tax resistance in 1843 to protest government harassment of their sect.See for links to a number of references on the \\"White Quakers.\\" Wine tax in Portugal, 1845 When tax farmers attempted to collect a new tax on wine in the Felgueiras district in the wine country on the Douro, the citizens gathered in (also known as S√£o Martinho de Penacova), armed themselves, and forced the tax collectors and the soldiers protecting them to flee. The next day, military reinforcements attacked the rebels, killing ten. Zhaowen land tax, 1845 When Zhaowen magistrate Yu Cheng delayed implementing a newly-enacted tax reduction in order to continue collecting taxes at the earlier, higher rate, 40 landowners stormed his office, destroying the furnishings there and then moving on to wreck the house of the tribute clerk. This led to an uprising that spread to Taicang and lasted into late 1846. Mexican-American War, 1846 Perhaps the most famous American example of a tax resister, Henry David Thoreau, was briefly jailed in 1846 for refusing to pay taxes in protest against the Fugitive Slave Act and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. In his essay on civil disobedience, he wrote: > I meet this American government, or its representative, the State > government, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the person > of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man situated as I am > necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly, Recognize me; and the > simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present posture of affairs, the > indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head, of expressing your > little satisfaction with and love for it, is to deny it then.... > ...If a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year, that would > not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable > the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the > definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.Thoreau (1849) > op. cit. ¬∂22 Thoreau was following in the footsteps of his fellow New England transcendentalists Amos Bronson Alcott and Charles Lane who had also been arrested for conscientious refusal to pay the poll tax. Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848 During the Sicilian revolution of independence of 1848 rebels destroyed tax records and assessments and many people stopped paying taxes.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 351. Karl Marx prosecuted for promoting tax resistance, 1848 During the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the royal and military aristocracy prohibited the first popularly elected parliament from assembling, and that parliament responded by declaring the government out-of-business: > So long as the National Assembly is not at liberty to continue its sessions > in Berlin, the Brandenburg cabinet has no right to dispose of government > revenues and to collect taxes. Karl Marx, via his newspaper, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, published this decree, adding: \\"From today, therefore, taxes are abolished! It is high treason to pay taxes. Refusal to pay taxes is the primary duty of the citizen!\\" Marx was later prosecuted for promoting tax resistance, but was acquitted after arguing that it was not illegal to promote tax resistance against an illegal government.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 239‚Äì61. Jamaica, 1848 Residents of St. Mary's parish in Jamaica launched a successful revolt against imperious tax collectors in 1848. The Great Confederated Anti-Dray and Land Tax League of South Australia, 1850 The Great Confederated Anti-Dray and Land Tax League of South Australia formed in the Spring of 1850 to resist taxes associated with a recently enacted Road Act. The League felt the taxes were excessive; oppressive to poor farmers while exempting rich merchants, mine owners, and bankers; had been imposed by a non-representative government body; and operated largely for the benefit of land-holders who were also members of the board that was imposing the tax and designing the road system.  * Resistance to the Foreign Miners Tax of 1850 in California The \\"Foreign Miners Tax\\" of 1850 required all California miners who were not American citizens to pay $20 per month. The tax was not so much a revenue raising instrument as a way of allowing citizens to monopolize mining and take over sites being worked by Chinese and Mexican miners. The tax resistance by foreign miners was successful. The tax was repealed by the end of 1850, though a smaller ($4/month) tax was reapplied to Chinese miners in 1852, and some particularly unscrupulous tax collectors continued to extort the tax from foreign miners even when it was no longer legal to do so. One person who was forced off of his mining claim by the Foreign Miners Tax was Joaquin Murieta, whose story became a Robin Hood-like myth in California. Prussian democrats, 1850,1864 In 1850 Lothar Bucher, leader of the radical democratic party in the Prussian national assembly, and others of similar views, were convicted for encouraging citizens to stop paying taxes to the autocratic government. (see also 15 February) Similarly, in 1864 the delegate Johann Jacoby served six months behind bars for a speech calling for tax refusal, delivered in the presence of the King, an early manifestation of opposition to the rule of Otto von Bismarck. Grape-growers‚Ä≤s strike in Bulgaria, 1851 In response to a tax increase on grapes and vinyards, Bulgaria‚Ä≤s grape pickers went on strike.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 355‚Äì56. Mass resistance in Jiangnan, 1853 In Qingpu, China, numerous uprisings and organized tax resistance took place around 1853, some led by Zhou Lichun.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 357‚Äì59. Zhou had been a precinct land tax collector, but rebelled when the local magistrate began trying to extort taxes that were unjustified by law. He organized landowners in twenty precincts to boycott taxes, and successfully resisted government reprisals. In other actions that year, thousands of Nanjui County taxpayers attacked government offices and made attempts on the life of the magistrate, three granary clerks were boiled alive by enraged taxpayers, and Huating County residents burned the boats of mercenaries who were helping a magistrate collect taxes. Ghana, 1854 Residents of the \\"Gold Coast\\" refused to pay a poll tax demanded by their British colonial occupiers in 1854, prompting a brutal crackdown by the British military. License Tax resistance in Australia, 1854 Miners in Australia met at a \\"monster meeting\\" in Castlemaine to launch an organized refusal to pay a mining license tax. Resistance to the bedel, 1855‚Äì60 A majority of Syrian Christians refused to pay a military commutation tax, the bedel, which was mandatory for non-Muslims who were draft-exempt.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 360‚Äì62. Chinese immigrants in Australia, 1859 Anti-Chinese sentiment in Australia led the government to try to reduce Chinese immigration through a tax on immigrants. The Chinese immigrants responded with a powerful, large-scale, well-organized tax resistance campaign that used a variety of tactics including consumer and labor strikes, petitions, mass-demonstrations, threats against collaborators with the tax system and potential strikebreakers, and prison-stuffing. They eventually convinced the government to rescind the hated tax. * see for several other sources Shantung resistance, 1860 In Shantung, tax resisters killed tax collectors and set up parallel government structures.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 360‚Äì61. Bhat resistance in India, 1861 In 1861, travelling bards of the Bhat caste, complaining that they had been traditionally exempt from taxation, reacted to being subjected to an income tax in an extreme demonstration that accompanied their refusal to pay: > [T]hey cut themselves with knives, cursed the Assessors, bespattering them > with their blood, and declared they would rather die than surrender their > birthright. When several were apprehended, their wives began to hack their > persons, and so severely that several have since died. Ferenc De√°k and Hungarian tax resistance, 1859‚Äì67 Following military defeat by the Hungarian revolution of 1848 and the subsequent war of independence led by Lajos Kossuth, Hungarians adopted a strategy of passive resistance, including boycotting of Austrian goods and refusing Austrian taxes, while the dissolved Diet (parliament) and various agricultural, trade and educational associations continued to meet informally. The symbol of this strategy was Ferenc De√°k, following his refusal to take public office under the Austrians and apparent semi-retirement in the 1850s. After Emperor Franz- Joseph issued his October Diploma in 1860, granting increased autonomy to various parts of the Austrian empire, the Hungarian county councils and Diet were reconvoked. However, the conflict with Austria continued‚Äîincluding renewed tax resistance‚Äîwith De√°k playing a more active role until the Diet's demands were conceded in 1867. * Mejba Revolt, 1864‚Äì65 The Mejba Revolt was a rebellion in Tunisia against the doubling of an unpopular poll tax (the mejba) imposed on his subjects by Sadok Bey. The most extensive revolt against the rule of the Husainid Beys of Tunis, it saw uprisings all over the country and came close to prompting military intervention by Britain and France. Don Cossack resistance, 1864‚Äì1882 The Don Cossacks refused to pay the taxes levied by their provincial zemstvo after their exemption of taxes was revoked by the Russian reforms of the 1860s.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 362‚Äì63. Resistance to the Czar's taxes in Abkhazia, 1866 In Sukhumi, Abkhazia, \\"a number of persons, irritated by the imposition of direct taxes, resisted the collecting officers, killed several of them, and then set fire to the town.\\" Georgia dockworkers, 1867 Georgia dockworkers responded to a tax specifically targeted to them by refusing to pay, even when locked out by the government. New Zealand poll tax, 1868 In 1868 residents of New Zealand were subjected to a poll tax. Some decided to resist and to form mutual insurance pacts for their defense. Louisiana, 1872‚Äì79 After a disputed election for governor in reconstruction Louisiana, the losing candidate, John McEnery, formed a shadow government and declared himself the truly elected governor. As part of this, he issued declarations saying that those people collecting taxes for the actually seated government were acting illegally and illegitimately and that citizens of Louisiana should resist these taxes. McEnery's shadow government, representing a white-supremacist Democratic party opposed to the Republican black and carpetbagger government, maintained its parallel governance until mid-1873, and then folded under pressure from the United States federal government.See for an overview, including links to contemporary news accounts. * See also Rub√≠, Catalonia, 1873 Citizens of Rub√≠, Catalonia refused to pay a war tax in 1873, shortly before the military commander of Catalonia was forced to flee in the face of a mutiny. Launceston, Tasmania, 1874 The Western Railway was a financial failure, and soon after it went into operation the government had to take it over from its bankrupt owners. Landholders in the railway district felt that the government take-over had changed the relationship between taxpayers and the railway, and that they were \\"morally exonerated from the principle of local taxation which they had endorsed when the district was polled in 1865. Since that period an entirely new principle had been adopted in the case of the Main Line Railway, and when they hesitated to pay their special rate, they acted on the conviction that it was the Government, and not they, who had broken faith.\\" The landholders launched a tax resistance campaign, forcing the government to capitulate and rescind the tax. White miners in Griqualand West, 1874 In 1874, a group of white, small-scale diamond miners at the \\"New Rush\\" in Kimberly, South Africa (then in a British colony called Griqualand West), launched a tax strike to protest the British colonial government's lack of response to their grievances. Mexican- American Tax Resistance in Texas, 1877 During the San Elizario Salt War, residents of El Paso County, Texas with loyalties to Mexico stopped paying taxes to the United States-loyal government. South Carolina, 1877 Similarly to what happened in Louisiana, white supremacists in South Carolina who disapproved of the reconstruction government practiced tax resistance\\"Political Intelligence: Tax-Payers of South Carolina\\" New York Times, 8 January 1877. and discouraged people from loaning money to the government by vowing to repudiate any such debts should they regain power. Calls to resist in Denmark, 1877 & 1885 In 1877 and again in 1885, the Left party in Denmark urged people to refuse to pay taxes levied by the Rightist government.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 377‚Äì79. Tram tax resistance in Rio, 1880 When the government of Rio increased the tramway tax and have this increase apply to every passenger, Jose Lopes da Silva Trovao and other protest organizers called on people to refuse to pay the tax.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 370‚Äì71. Inconfid√™ncia Mineira,Brazil, 1789 Tax resistance called Inconfid√™ncia Mineira was against one-fifth tax over gold. Tax resistance launches the First Boer War, 1880 The First Boer War broke out when the British occupation government seized a wagon from Piet Bezuidenhoudt who had refused to pay a tax. When the government attempted to auction off the wagon to raise the tax money, supporters of Bezuidenhoudt seized it, and met government representatives who came after them with armed force. * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 169‚Äì74. Paisley abbey manse tax resistance, 1880 Paisley instituted a tax to raise funds to repair the manse (minister's house) of Paisley Abbey. People who were not members of that church (the official Church of Scotland) did not feel they should have to pay for this, and in December 1880 they organized a tax resistance campaign. Some 200 people refused to pay the tax. The authorities took legal action against a few, but then quickly dropped the charges. Irish settlers in Canada, 1879‚Äì81 Two hundred Irish settlers in Gatineau refused to pay a county tax. According to one account: When a deputy sheriff went to make seizures, the residents threatened to string him to the nearest tree. Finally, they compelled him to eat the writs he had, and then gave him a limited time to get out of the township. The Irish Land League calls for a rent strike, 1881 In 1881, the Irish National Land League issued a manifesto calling on Irish tenants to refuse to pay rent to their absentee English landlords. * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 263‚Äì66. English hop growers, 1882 The Anglican church legally exacted \\"extraordinary tithes\\" from hop growers, who began resisting the tax and risking distraint in the hopes of prompting a change of the law. The Tswana in Bechuanaland, 1882 Montshiwa, a chief of the Rolong tribe, led a tax rebellion against the Boers in Bechuanaland in 1882. After some early successes, the rebellion was suppressed, and large hunks of territory were divided up as spoils by the victorious Boers. Resistance to Repaying Fraudulent Railroad Bonds, 1870‚Äì1913 Crooked politicians and swindlers in Missouri concocted a scheme in which the government issued bonds to pay for a railroad that never got built. Residents of the swindled areas subsequently refused to levy taxes on themselves to raise funds to pay off the bonds. The bond holders filed suit and obtained court orders that county judges institute such taxes, but the judges then went to jail for contempt rather than comply.   * In 1878, residents of Steuben County, New York, also refused to pay taxes to pay off crooked railroad bonds, and disrupted auctions at which the goods of resisters were being sold to pay resisted taxes. There was a similarly motivated tax revolt in Kentucky in 1906 in which a group of resisters raided the tax collector and reclaimed seized property. * see also Cincinnati Liquor Tax revolt, 1884 3,200 (out of 3,500) saloon owners refused to pay a liquor tax in Cincinnati in 1884. The tax was eventually held to be unconstitutional. * Egypt, 1884 Passive resistance to taxation was widespread in Upper Egypt as the population lost faith in the government there in the face of the Mahdist insurrection. Crete, 1880 Christians in Ottoman Crete organized to refuse to pay taxes in 1887. The government quickly reduced taxes and made other concessions to (temporarily) quiet the revolt. Samoa, 1887 Residents of Samoa refused to pay taxes to the German colonial occupation government in 1887. * The Welsh tithe war, 1887‚Äì88 A rebellion against mandatory tithes for the establishment church, similar to that which had raged in Ireland earlier, broke out in Wales in 1887, and featured the disruption of tax auctions by huge crowds of resisters. \\"Constable Leahy Tax\\" resistance, 1888 On 9 September 1887, police fired on rent strikers in Mitchelstown (Ireland), killing three, in what became known as the Mitchelstown Massacre. The authorities sided with the police, and awarded a ¬£1,000 judgement to a constable who was wounded in the course of the massacre, ordering that the money would be raised by an additional tax on the Irish‚Äîone that would come to be called the \\"Constable Leahy Tax.\\" The tax was widely refused, and parliamentarian Thomas Condon was prosecuted on criminal conspiracy charges for publicly advocating tax resistance. Dothan riot, 1889 Dothan, Alabama tried to tax all vehicles traveling through the town in 1889, in reaction to the decision by the Farmers' Alliance to avoid municipal taxation by building a warehouse outside of the town limits. Farmers attempted to evade the tax, but were violently opposed by law enforcement, which killed two resisters. \\"Half- Breeds\\" in Dakota, 1889 \\"Half-Breeds\\" in the Dakota territory of the United States seized already-collected taxes from a sheriff and announced that they would fight to the last man (there were roughly 4,000) against further attempts to tax them. Chatham Islands, 1891 Residents of the Chatham Islands refused to pay a dog tax in 1891 and prepared instead to submit to arrest and trial. \\"Vicars' Rate\\" rebellions in Halifax and Coventry, 1875‚Äì92 Opponents of a mandatory tithe for the establishment church in Halifax and later in Coventry, England, formed \\"Anti-Vicars' Rate Associations\\" and launched campaigns of tax refusal in 1875 and 1892 respectively.  Guerrero, Mexico, in 1892 When people in Guerrero refused to pay federal taxes in 1892, the government sent in troops, who were routed by the tax resisters who captured a General as a hostage. Montreal merchants, 1893 Merchants in Montreal, claiming that a new tax on merchants was unjustly much higher for them than for merchants in other areas, decided to refuse to pay the tax in 1893. Fasci Siciliani, 1893 The Fasci Siciliani movement reached its peak in 1893 in a series of large anti- tax demonstrations that included the destruction of tax offices and the burning of tax records. Irish Unionists Irish unionists used (or threatened) tax resistance in order to fight against home rule.e.g. Cuban War Tax, 1897 Cuban cigar workers in Florida refused to pay a Cuban war tax that was being withheld from their paychecks in 1897. Industrialist threatens to \\"shrug\\", 1897 Industrialist James F. Hathaway of Somerville, Massachusetts refused to pay a municipal tax on his corporation stock and would periodically threaten to pack up and leave town if the city insisted on pressing for payment, in a game of bluff that sometimes led to the city waiving the tax, but other times led to Hathaway's jailing. * * The Hut Tax War, 1898 In 1896, the British government decreed that the inland \\"protectorate\\" adjacent to its Sierra Leone colony should be taxed. The tax would be imposed on dwellings, at an annual rate that in some cases exceeded the value of the dwelling itself, and came to be known as the \\"Hut Tax.\\" Natives of the protectorate were unused to regular taxation of any sort, and interpreted the tax as meaning that the British were assuming ownership of all of the dwellings in the area and charging rent. They were furious at this wholesale appropriation of property, and refused to pay, then adopted armed rebellion when the colonial forces responded with violent reprisals. Tax resistance in the Philippines, 1898 In 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo's fledgling government faced tax refusal from many provinces that had expected a reduction or removal of the taxes. MƒÅori tax resistance, 1894‚Äì1933 MƒÅoris periodically refused to pay an unpopular dog tax to their colonizers. * * Crow reservation, 1897‚Äì9 Members of the Crow Nation refused to pay taxes to the state of Montana in the late 1890s, and the state seized all of the sheep on the reservation in retaliation. Tancament de Caixes, 1899‚Äì1900 Traders and industrialists in Barcelona, led by mayor Bartomeu Robert i Yarz√°bal, began a tax strike on 20 October 1899 that came to be known as the \\"Tancament de Caixes\\" (shutting the cashboxes). This was a protest to taxes the Spanish government was introducing to pay for the costs of its defeats in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and also against tax rates that discriminated against Barcelona in favor of Madrid. German East Africa, 1900 German colonial governor Eduard von Liebert was accused of having had 2,000 residents of German East Africa executed for their refusal to pay a hut tax. =20th century= Poll tax resistance in Alabama, 1901 200 employees of the Dimmick Pipe Company in Birmingham, Alabama, walked off the job in 1901 when they learned a poll tax would be deducted from their pay. Foreigners in Japan Resist a Property Tax, 1902 Starting in Yokohama, and spreading to Kobe and elsewhere, hundreds of British and other foreign residents of Japan resisted a new \\"House Tax\\" in the hopes of forcing the legality of the tax into arbitration ‚Äî passively submitting to distraint rather than paying a tax they felt to be illegal. They were backed (in the demand for arbitration, if not in the tax resistance) by the British, French, and German governments. This became one of the first cases decided by an international tribunal, with one Japanese judge, one French judge, and a Norwegian judge who turned out to be the tie-breaker, ruling in favor of the Europeans and against Japan.  Cutting off Police Pay-offs in New York City, 1902 The New York City District Attorney, its Police Commissioner, agents from the Society for the Prevention of Crime, and the president of the New York County Liquor Dealers' Association in 1902 announced a joint campaign to defend liquor dealers who stopped paying police protection money. This mostly represents a government policy change in how it was going to be taxing saloonkeepers, but because the change involved rescinding an extralegal tax extorted under-the-table by city employees, it was hard for the government to accomplish in ordinary ways. So it had to nurture a tax resistance movement and encourage solidarity among its members by offering some protection of its own (including judges who reduced fines against people arrested by the police in extortion attempts to near-nothing). British nonconformists, 1903‚Äì24 In 1903, tens of thousands of British nonconformists began resisting the part of their taxes that paid for sectarian schools. Over 170 would eventually be jailed for their tax refusal.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 291‚Äì305. Americans in the Isle of Pines, 1903 The United States took Cuba from Spain in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, including the Isle of Pines. When Cuba became independent soon after, Americans on the Isle of Pines hoped that they would continue to live under American rule, and they decided to resist paying taxes to Cuba in the hopes of bringing the issue to a head. Korea, 1903 In several Korean provinces in 1903, taxpayers rose up, reclaimed their taxes from the government treasury, and imprisoned their governors. Hut Tax resistance in Swaziland, 1903‚Äì07 Attempts to levy a hut tax in Swaziland sparked resistance led by Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo, culminating eventually in the Bambatha Rebellion. Income tax resistance in Tasmania, 1904 At open-air \\"monster\\" meetings in Tasmania in early 1904, people vowed to resist an income tax that had been instituted by the recently ousted government but unexpectedly not rescinded by the new one.Several newspaper articles from the period dealing with this tax resistance campaign have been transcribed at Sugar manufacturers in the Dominican Republic, 1905 American-owned businesses running the sugar industry in the Dominican Republic refused to pay a new tax instituted by that country's government in 1905, shortly before the United States formally appropriated the country's economy. Opposition to Creek taxes in Oklahoma Territory, 1899‚Äì1905 White Americans living in Muscogee (Creek) territory before Oklahoma became a state in 1907 resisted paying taxes to the Creek Nation government, hoping the United States federal government would back them up if push came to shove. * * The Russian Revolution, 1905‚Äì06 During the Russian Revolution of 1905 a coalition of anti-government groups in Petrograd issued a manifesto calling for mass tax resistance and other economic non-cooperation against Russia's czarist government. It read, in part, \\"There is only one way out: to overthrow the government, to deprive it of its last strength. It is necessary to cut the government off from the last source of its existence: financial revenue.\\" In 1906, when the Czar dissolved the First Duma, its members fled to Finland where they issued the Vyborg Manifesto which called upon the people of Russia to refuse to pay their taxes until representative government was restored.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 307‚Äì12. Zulus in Natal, 1906 A group of Zulus announced that they would refuse to pay the poll tax to the British colonial government in Natal. An inspector from the Natal Mounted Police killed one Zulu tax protester, and was in turn slain along with another of his party. Doukhobors in Canada, 1906 Doukhobor exiles in Canada refused to pay school taxes on their lands, saying that, as they always refused to have their children educated, lest they learn evil things, they would not pay money for school purposes. They removed their property from the district so as to evade seizure. Turkey, 1906‚Äì07 In the waning days of the Ottoman Empire, there was widespread and successful refusal to pay the sultan's poll tax. * Undertakers strike in Valladolid When the municipal authorities of Valladolid imposed taxes on hearses, the undertakers of that town organised a passive resistance strike, refusing to send out either hearses or coffins. As a result, the dead had to be conveyed to the cemeteries on stretchers, carried by porters. Winemakers tax strike in France, 1907 A winegrowers' committee in Argelliers organized a tax strike in 1907 that included the mass resignations of municipal councils, and was met by military force by the central government.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 382‚Äì83 * Greek community in Lewiston, Maine, 1907 Greek immigrants in Lewiston, Maine, organized a tax strike against a new poll tax. Silver Lake Assembly, 1908 Forty members of a Silver Lake Assembly property association launched a tax strike against what they believed to be an illegally assessed tax the town of Castile, New York was trying to subject them to, in 1908. Japanese laborers in California, 1909 Japanese-American residents of Oxnard, rebelled against being unfairly subject to both the city and county tax (one was supposed to clear the other). The county tried to pull a fast one, and swooped in on the workers while they were in the beet fields where they were temporarily working and which were outside the city limits. They declared the workers to be thereby subject to the county poll tax as well. Some of the Japanese workers left the area; others refused to pay the tax and were subjected to property seizures. Nicaragua, 1909 Shortly before the fall of president Zelaya's government to rebels backed by the United States, his government imprisoned resisters to a tax he was using to try to raise funds to prop up his regime. Italian immigrants in Pennsylvania, 1909 When Pennsylvania passed a law banning Italian immigrants from owning firearms, a number of Italians in Lanesboro began resisting their taxes in response. The Women's Tax Resistance League, 1909‚Äì1918 The British women's suffrage movement, in particular the Women's Tax Resistance League, used tax resistance in their struggle, and explicitly saw themselves in a tradition of tax resistance that included John Hampden. According to one source, \\"tax resistance proved to be the longest-lived form of militancy, and the most difficult to prosecute.\\" * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 323‚Äì25. Tax resistance among the American women's suffrage movement was less organized, but also practiced. Julia and Abby Smith, Annie Shaw, Lucy Stone, Virginia Minor, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were among those who practiced and advocated tax resistance as a protest against \\"taxation without representation.\\"e.g., * Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 325‚Äì331. Tax resistance also played a role in the women's suffrage movements of Bermuda, France, Germany, and South Africa. Unrest in China, 1907‚Äì16 The salt tax and other taxes, and conflict with organized smuggler associations, led to conflict in China, which included, in 1910, an assault on tax collectors and on the salt tax monopoly office, and the \\"Two Kitchen Knives Rebellion\\" led by He Long in 1916 in which the Salt Tax Bureau at Ba Maoqui was torched and the bureau's director was killed.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 384‚Äì87 * In 1910, also, merchants in Beijing began withholding their payments of stamp tax to pressure the monarchy to adopt republican reforms. Poll tax resistance in Grafton, Illinois, 1910 A Socialist Party activist in Grafton, Illinois, was jailed six months for his refusal to pay the city's poll tax in 1910. Party head Ralph Korngold used the case as a rallying cry for local radicals. * M√°laga, 1911 In Canillas De Aceituno, Spain, residents rioted at the sale of a tax resister's goods and took up arms against government forces. Road tax resistance in Kansas, 1911 A number of towns in Kansas organized tax resistance leagues in 1911 to combat a tax variously characterized as a road tax or a poll tax that they believed had been illegally railroaded through the legislature. * Rhodesia, 1911 In 1911, the Legislative Council passed an ordinance imposing a one shilling per month tax on farmers for each native laborer they hired, payable to the Labour Bureau, which coordinated the exploitation of African labor for colonial farmers and miners. The farmers decided to resist the tax. Hundreds were convicted and fined, and some were jailed after refusing to pay the fines. The farmers were successful in convincing the government to rescind the tax. Inishmurray, 1911 Residents of the island of Inishmurray considered themselves a tiny, independent monarchy, and would combat efforts by mainland authorities to tax them by refusing to let the officials disembark. Poll tax in Delaware, 1912 Socialist and labor groups in Wilmington joined forces and began resisting a new Delaware poll tax in 1912. Baby Carriage Tax disregarded in Brest, 1913 A tax on handcarts in Brest, France, was interpreted to apply also to baby carriages, which led to universal refusal to pay what was seen as a ridiculous tax. Indians in South Africa, 1913 The South African government imposed a tax on Indian immigrants, and, in one of Mahatma Gandhi's early forays into satyagraha he helped to organize a strike, an illegal march, and a tax refusal campaign in protest.  * The \\"Turra Coo\\", 1913 In late 1913, the government seized a cow from a Scottish resister of the taxes associated with the National Insurance Act. The government had difficulty selling the cow, as locals were sympathetic with the tax resistance. Eventually they brought in an outside auctioneer, but the auction was disrupted by protesters and the cow escaped. Today there is a statue of a cow in Turriff, Scotland commemorating the event. Master Plumbers in Joplin, Missouri, 1914 Ten master plumbers in Joplin, Missouri, signed a resolution vowing to refuse to pay a new $50 annual tax on their profession in 1914. Dog tax resistance, Yonkers, New York, 1917 Robert H. Miller stopped paying his dog license fee in 1917, complaining that \\"I consider said tax a unjust burden for owners who have dogs for their home and families' defence, not for luxuries, as the cost of living to raise five children is expensive enough without feeding a dog if he was not necessary in the wild section of this town, as we have no benefit from all the taxation with which we are burdened, no open streets, no police, no sewers, and many more necessities that I could mention.\\" World War I in the United States, 1917‚Äì18 In the United States, although the decision of whether or not to purchase war bonds to support World War I was ostensibly voluntary, those who chose not to buy them were subject to strong pressure including mob violence.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 313‚Äì21. For example, John Schrag was beaten, arrested, and prosecuted and he and his property were smeared with yellow paint by a mob for having refused to buy war bonds. One witness said: > [T]hey tried to get him to buy liberty bonds during the war, and he wouldn't > buy none.... They brought him in and he never said a word, and the questions > or anything they'd ask him, he never, never complained or never put up no > resistance whatsoever. ... I never saw so much yellin' and a cursing and > slapped him. And buffeted him and beat him and kicked him. He never offered > any resistance whatsoever. One of the fellows went and got a, a hardware > store and got a gallon of yellow paint. And pulled the lid off and poured it > over his face. He had a long beard, kind of a short heavyset man, had a nice > beard, and that run down all over his eyes, his face, and his beard, and his > clothes. Of course that was yellow.... He never offered no resistance > whatsoever and they, one man went to the hardware store again and he got a > rope and put it around, got there, and put around his neck and marched him > down to the, close to the city jail, a little calaboose there.

Possibly praying, I > don't know. But there's some kind of a glow come over his face and he just > looked like Christ. ... (inaudible). Enemies smite you on one cheek, turn > the other and brother he did it. He just kept doing it. They'd slug him on > the one side of the face and he'd turn his cheeks on the other. He > exemplified the life of Christ more than any man I ever saw in my life. * Herman Bausch was imprisoned for 28 months by the state of Montana for seditious statements he allegedly made while being held captive by a violent mob who were enraged at him for his unwillingness to buy liberty bonds. Darwin Rebellion In Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) in early 1919, citizens organized an income tax strike, and a boycott of the local (taxed) alcohol monopolist, John Gilruth, who was also the Administrator (governor). The resistance continued until Gilruth fled Darwin. Harold George Nelson, who was imprisoned for his tax resistance during this action, later became the Northern Territory's first parliamentary representative.see for a collection of contemporary news articles about the tax strike and boycott Soft drinks tax, United States, 1919 When World War I ended, people stopped paying a tax on soft drinks that had been instituted as a war funding measure, although the tax had not yet been rescinded. The Bureau of Internal Revenue threatened tax evaders with fines and imprisonment. Northern Territory and Papua, 1919‚Äì21 Tax resistance was a tactic used both by anti-capitalist labor groups and groups agitating for democratic representation in the Northern Territory and Papua in the years around 1920. Miners in Western Australia also took up tax resistance in 1921. Welsh miners, 1919 Miners in Wales went on strike rather than pay the income tax which was newly being applied to incomes below ¬£200. Russian Civil War, 1917‚Äì1923 Tax resistance was used by Russian peasants who were being taxed by multiple parties in the Civil War. European pacifists (1920s) After World War I, some European pacifists associated with the movement that would coalesce around War Resisters International, like Beatrice and Kees Boeke, adopted war tax resistance as one of their forms of resistance. * Weimar Germany (1919‚Äì33) tax resistance Tax resistance campaigns sporadically broke out in Germany between the world wars, including a tax strike in W√ºrttemberg, Stuttgart, Cologne, Essen and other areas in 1920, an income tax strike by Prussian farmers in 1922, and the tax strikes of the Rural People's Movement (Landvolkbewegung) in Schleswig-Holstein from 1928. Burma during the 1920s Burmese Buddhist monks organized tax resistance and other forms of civil disobedience against British colonial rule during the 1920s.Burg (2004) op. cit. p. 389. Dutch West Indies, 1921 Residents resisted an income tax from which Dutch settlers were exempt, then successfully disrupted an auction at which a resister's goods were being sold for back taxes. Protesting a \\"bachelor tax\\" 1921 The state of Montana applied a $3 tax on all bachelors in the state. One of them, William Atzinger, refused to pay on sex discrimination grounds. The following year the state supreme court ruled the \\"bachelor tax\\" and another poll tax applicable only to men to be unconstitutional. Sinn F√©in in 1921 Sinn F√©in organized tax resistance against home rule in Northern Ireland in 1921. Arkansas road tax rebellion, 1921 Craighead County residents forced the commissioners of a road improvement district to resign at gunpoint before they could spend tax money on a corrupt roads project. Guntur tax refusal, 1921 In an early manifestation of satyagraha, Indians from the Guntur district organized a noncooperation campaign and tax strike against British rule in 1921 that led to the government collecting less than 25% of the expected taxes.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 389‚Äì90. The Poplar Rates Rebellion, 1921 In 1921 the government of Poplar, a division of London, in protest against an unequal sharing of tax revenue between rich and poor boroughs, stopped collecting and passing on a variety of tax called \\"precepts\\" to the regional authorities. Thirty members of the Poplar Borough Council were imprisoned amid large protests. Bondelswarts Rebellion, 1922 The British colonial administrators of South-West Africa imposed a tax on the Bondels as a way of making them more dependent on taking low-wage jobs for other colonists. The Bondels refused to pay and the British responded with aerial bombardments. Income tax evasion in France, 1922 Syndicalist groups in France promoted income tax evasion and defended evaders whose goods were in danger of government seizure. The Ruhrkampf and Bavaria, 1923 When France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr to enforce German reparations payments in 1923, the German government responded by encouraging and supporting a mass nonviolent resistance campaign against the occupation, which included tax resistance. Right-wing politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, shortly after he was declared dictator of Bavaria in 1923, ordered Bavarians to stop paying taxes to the federal Reich government. French Stokers, 1923 French stokers (ship workers) who were upset that the government was including in their income, for tax purposes, incidental benefits like the food they were served on board, refused payment and went on strike when their company went along with government attempts to garnishee their wages. The strike was ended when the company agreed to pay the stokers' income taxes itself. Pennsylvania women win the vote, and the tax; Refuse the Second, 1923‚Äì27 When women won the right to vote in the United States, this sometimes also exposed them to taxes they had hitherto been exempt from. Some chose to resist these taxes. In Pennsylvania, a school tax became the target of a massive, statewide, grassroots resistance campaign. For example: * In 1923, 89 women in Pottstown said that they were not interested in voting or in paying taxes, and refused to pay a school tax they had recently become vulnerable to. * The same year, 800 women in Haverford refused to pay the tax, as did 250 in Media. * Some 1,700 women in Charleroi refused to pay the tax and, in 1924, were ordered to be arrested. * That year in Clifton Heights, exasperated tax collectors exonerated 700 women tax delinquents rather than try to pursue them for the taxes. * In 1926, 200 women in Freeland were reported as tax delinquents. * In 1927, 300 women in Darby followed suit, * * and ultimately 2,000 delinquent tax notices were sent there. Red Spear Society, 1923‚Äì38 A peasant secret mutual-defense group in China called the Red Spear Society supported tax resistance.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 391‚Äì92. Indian workers in Fiji, 1924 When Fiji added a ¬£1 a year poll tax on Indian workers (representing about 12 days' pay), they regarded this as a bait-and-switch on their contracts, and vowed to go to jail rather than pay. Indians in Kenya, 1924 British citizens of Indian ancestry were in Kenya in such numbers in 1924 that they were beginning to exercise democratic political power. This worried the white ruling class. Britain issued a \\"white paper\\" in which it said that paternalistic care for the unenfranchised African natives, rather than the democratic demands of the citizenry would be the priority of the government. Or, in less-euphemistic terms: the white ruling class would rule how it wanted without having to take into account the desires of the Indian voting bloc. Indians responded to this with an organized tax resistance campaign, which led to some of them being imprisoned. Whether from the effect of these imprisonments or from concessions made through back-channel negotiations, the protest ended in a few months. It provided rhetorical ammunition to the Indian independence movement, which used this as an example to show that Britain never intended to offer Indians under its rule equal civil rights. * Argentina, 1924 A coalition of 1,500 leading industrialists of Argentina refused to pay into a state-run pension fund following a general strike and labor lockout organized to fight the law that established the fund. London bookmakers strike, 1926 To protest a new betting tax, the bookmakers at Tattersalls Park refused to bet, thus making it impossible for the track to lay odds, and effectively shutting down business there and off-track. Cristero War, Mexico, 1926 Tax resistance was used as a tactic in the Cristero War, where some people with Catholic sympathies refused to pay taxes to the government and turned to the church for defense. Farmers in Queensland, Australia, 1927 The government of Queensland, struggling with debt, enacted a stealth tax in the form of a registration fee charged to farmers who had wells and water pumps on their farms. The farmers, organized in \\"Local Producers's Associations,\\" declared a tax strike, which forced the government to back down about a month later. American Samoa, 1927 In 1927, The Committee of the Samoan League organized tax resistance against the United States Navy's occupation of the American Samoa. Shanghai, 1927 Around the time of the Shanghai massacre of 1927, businesses were conducting a strike against municipal taxes there. (date uncertain) Western importers, backed by their governments, also refused to unload their products that were subject to a new customs duty. * Samoa, 1928 Residents of Samoa refused to pay taxes to the New Zealand occupation government in 1928. * Uri \\"bobbed hair tax\\" The canton of Uri in Switzerland instituted a tax on women's bobbed hair in 1928, and by the following year the government was reporting widespread resistance (and ridicule) of the law. Igbo Women's War, 1929 The Igbo Women's War began as a dispute over taxes and a resistance against a census that was being conducted in preparation for taxes. Further tax revolts in 1938 and 1956 grew out of the same movement. Indian independence campaign Mahatma Gandhi's independence campaign in India used a variety of tax resistance strategies, including attacking the British taxed monopolies on salt and textiles by advocating the illegal production of salt outside of the monopoly system and the home-based spinning of cloth. In 1930 this tax resistance culminated in Gandhi's famous Salt March to Dandi to harvest sea salt in contravention of British law.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 350‚Äì73. Other tax resistance campaigns persisted after this period, including resistance to the Damodar Canal tax in 1937‚Äì39.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 402‚Äì04. The Great Depression, United States In the United States, the term \\"tax revolt\\" is sometimes used to refer to a series of anti-tax state initiative campaigns. The first significant wave of these campaigns was during the 1930s. The Great Depression introduced unprecedented tax burdens to Americans. While real-estate values plummeted and unemployment skyrocketed, the cost of government remained high. As a result, taxes as a percentage of the national income nearly doubled from 11.6 percent in 1929 to 21.1 in 1932. Most of the increase took place at the local level and especially squeezed the resources of real estate taxpayers. Local tax delinquency rose steadily to a still standing record of 26.3% in 1933. Many Americans reacted to these conditions by forming taxpayers' leagues to call for lower taxes and cuts in government spending. By some estimates, there were three thousand of them by 1933. Taxpayers' leagues endorsed such measures as laws to limit and rollback taxes, lowered penalties on tax delinquents, and cuts in government spending. Partly as a result of their efforts, sixteen states and numerous localities adopted property tax limitations while three states instituted homestead exemptions.Beito, David T. (1989) op. cit. 15‚Äì16. While taxpayers' leagues usually favored traditional legal and political strategies, a few were more direct. Probably the best known of these was the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers in Chicago. From 1930 to 1933, it led one of the largest tax strikes in American history. At its height, it had 30,000 paid members, a budget of $600,000, and a weekly radio show.Beito, David T. op. cit. (1989) 60‚Äì100. By 1933, the taxpayers' leagues had entered a period of decline. Several factors undermined the conditions that had nurtured revolt. For example, economic conditions gradually improved, the federal government extended aid to homeowners, and local governments reduced reliance on real estate taxes. To some extent, the tax revolt also fell victim to an effective counterattack by municipal reformers, government officials, and the holders of municipal debt such as bondholders and bankers who formed so-called \\"Pay Your Taxes\\" campaigns throughout the country. These campaigns used a combination of door- to-door solicitation, threats of coercion, and inducements, such as installment payment plans, to collect back taxes.Beito, David T. op. cit. (1989) 140‚Äì59, 101‚Äì29. An alternative theory describing the decline of the taxpayers' leagues is that laws limiting existing taxes and new tax revenues from the manufacture and sale of alcohol due to the repeal of prohibition eliminated the need for the taxpayers' leagues. Cedar County Cow War of 1931 During the Iowa Cow War, the 700-member Farmers Protective Association vowed to refuse tax payments if the governor did not withdraw state troops and release an imprisoned resister. Women's suffragists in Bermuda, 1931‚Äì34 Women's suffragists in Bermuda, in particular Gladys Misick Morrell, refused to pay taxes unless they gained the vote. * Tithe Resistance in Britain, 1931‚Äì35 As crop prices fell during the Depression, farmers in Great Britain began refusing to pay government-mandated church tithes. Resisters used a variety of tactics to resist government retaliation.    [T]hey have made conditions very unhappy for auctioneers selling property for non-payment of tithes. They have stampeded oxen so that the sale of them could not continue. They have browbeaten bidders so that prices adequate to pay the tithes have not been reached; they have stoned auctioneers, thrown them in ponds, plastered them with mud, slashed their tires, and organized mass resistance to tithe collecting in other ways. Tyrol, Austria 1931 Peasants' federations in eastern Tyrol resolved to stop paying taxes in October 1931 to protest bloated government, agricultural policy, profiteering, and a large tax burden. Real Estate Taxpayers, 1931‚Äì33, 1977 During the Great Depression in the early 1930s, Americans throughout the United States formed thousands of taxpayers' leagues to protest high property taxes. In some cases, these groups illegally withheld taxes through tax strikes and other forms of resistance. The largest tax strike was in Chicago and led by the Association of Real Estate Taxpayers. At its height, the Association had more than thirty-thousand dues-paying members.Beito, David T. (1989) op. cit. A second, similar but smaller property tax payer's revolt hit Chicago in 1977. Puerto Rico sales tax, 1932 300 businesses in Ponce, Puerto Rico declared that they would refuse to continue to pay the sales tax after the United States governor of the island refused to repeal the tax. Meo uprising, 1932 The Meo, a group of Indian Muslims, revolted against taxes imposed by a Hindu maharaja in 1932, refusing to pay and resisting collection by force. * Elmira Taxpayers' League Over a thousand taxpayers in Elmira, New York signed a pledge to refuse to pay local taxes until the municipal budget had been reduced, and tax rates as well. New York City automobile owners, 1933 The automobile club of New York organized an auto tax strike in 1933 to protest a doubled license fee for City residents. Mennonite women in Pennsylvania, 1933 Claiming that the Bible did not sanction the taxation of women, some women in Warwick township, Pennsylvania, refused to pay a poll tax in 1933. Irish \\"Blue Shirts,\\" 1935 To protest Irish intransigence in the Anglo-Irish Trade War, the quasi-fascist \\"Blue Shirts\\" declared a tax strike. One striker was killed during a protest designed to disrupt an auction of cattle seized from a tax striker. Meat tax strike, 1935 In 1935, some Americans held a \\"Meat Strike\\" which was meant to protest New Deal-era taxes on meat processing by boycotting meat purchases. The offensive tax was eventually thrown out as unconstitutional. French \\"Peasant Front,\\" 1935 The \\"Peasant Front,\\" organized by Henri Dorg√®res, launched a tax strike in 1935. In some regions as many as 90% of the residents refused to pay their taxes, but the campaign had limited national impact. * Sales tax resistance in Montreal, 1935 Mayor Herv√© Ferland of Verdun led 164 or more shopkeepers there in refusing to collect or remit Montreal's sales tax. Sales tax resistance in Arkansas, 1935 98% of merchants in Stuttgart and 59 of 60 merchants in DeWitt signed a pledge to refuse to collect or pay a new Arkansas sales tax in 1935. Sales tax resistance in Alabama, 1936 Gadsen, Alabama merchants met and unanimously voted to refuse to collect or remit the state sales tax. Montgomery, Alabama pharmacists also resisted the tax. Anti-communist Catholic veterans, 1938 149 members of a Catholic war veterans fraternity began paying their property taxes into an escrow account rather than to the government, saying they would not turn over the funds until the local government dismissed Communist Party member Si Gerson who was an advisor to the Manhattan borough president. * Coal Township, 1939 Taxpayers in Coal Township, Pennsylvania, threatened a tax strike to protest the fact that the large coal companies in the region had been neglecting to pay their taxes, causing the township to fall behind on schoolteacher salaries and other expenses. This forced some concessions from the coal companies. * World War II During World War II, the Christian anarchist and pacifist Ammon Hennacy refused to register for the American draft and announced that he would not pay his income taxes. He also tried to reduce his tax liability by adopting a life of simple living.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 383‚Äì91. He wrote: > I [learned] the principle of voluntary poverty and non payment of taxes... > from Tolstoy and the [Catholic Worker]. When I was working a man asked me > \\"Why does a fellow like you, with an education, and who has been all over > the country, end up in this out-of-the-way place working for very little on > a farm?\\" I explained that all people who had good jobs in factories, etc. > had a withholding tax for war taken from their pay, and that people who > worked on farms had no tax taken from their pay. I told him that I refused > to pay taxes. He was a returned soldier and said that he did not like war > either, but what could a fellow do about it? I replied that we each did what > we really wanted to. Palestine, 1936‚Äì48 In 1936, in what one author called \\"the first truly grass-root rebellion/uprising by Palestinians,\\" 150 Palestinians called for a general strike and tax strike to protest the British occupation. Between 1939 and 1948, there was widespread resistance by Jews in Palestine against the income tax imposed by the British occupation, which included bomb attacks against tax offices, and many Jews instead voluntarily paid taxes to Jewish organizations. A few years after Israel gained its independence, its government became the target of widespread tax evasion and resistance, including a major tax strike in 1954. * Jews in Vichy France, 1944 Jews refused to pay taxes to the Union g√©n√©rale des isra√©lites de France (General Organization of Jews in France), which had been established by the Vichy France (Nazi-collaborationist) government. (Jewish Press Service) This Union was ostensibly meant to act as an umbrella organization that would organize social services for Jews by coordinating existing Jewish groups, but it was really a phase in the Nazi-organized obsession with bureaucratically solving the \\"Jewish Problem\\" in Europe via elimination. As in other parts of Nazi-controlled Europe, Jews in France had to make hard decisions about how much to resist such organizations outright and how much to try to participate in them as potential tools of resistance or amelioration. All French Jews were required to be members of the Union, which presumed to control all Jewish property. The Nazis might, for example, \\"fine\\" the whole of the Jews of France, and the Union in its representative capacity would borrow money to pay off the fine by pledging Jewish property as collateral, or, apparently, by taxing the membership base.

Moslem League in India, 1946 A punitive tax imposed on Muslims by the United Provinces government to discourage rioting was resisted in a refusal organized by the Moslem League. Abeokuta Women's Revolt, late-1940s The Abeokuta Women's Revolt (also called the Egba Women's Tax Riot) was a resistance movement against the imposition of unfair taxation by the Nigerian colonial government. The women of Abeokuta believed that, under colonialism, their economic roles were declining, while their taxes were increasing. Additionally, they argued that until they were granted representation in local government, they should not be required to pay taxes separately from men. As a result of their protests, four women received seats on the local council, and the taxation of women was ended. The birth of the modern war tax resistance movement, 1948 In 1948, a Chicago conference on \\"More Disciplined and Revolutionary Pacifist Activity\\" attracted more than 300 people, and resulted in the formation of the group Peacemakers and its \\"Tax Refusal Committee.\\" This is considered to be the birth of the modern organized war tax resistance movement in the United States.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 446‚Äì47. Monteverde, 1951 Several Quaker conscientious objectors from the United States left the country and founded a settlement in Monteverde, Costa Rica, in order to no longer be forced to pay taxes for the United States military (Costa Rica had abolished its own military a few years earlier). Oaxaca, 1952 A general strike in Oaxaca in 1952 was directed against the government's new tax plan. Rioters in Tlacolula stoned to death mayor Diodoro Maldonado. Pittston Township Wage Tax, 1952‚Äì53 Hundreds of residents of Pittston Township, Pennsylvania refused to pay a new wage tax in 1952. The government responded by arresting 15 of them, and the resisters switched tactics to vastly underpay the tax as a way of resisting without risking immediate criminal sanctions. * * South China, 1952 Four hundred farmers were arrested for tax refusal in southern China in 1952. The farmers claimed that the taxes would leave them hopelessly impoverished. Social Security tax protests, 1951‚Äì53 In 1952, Louisiana newspaper editor Mary Cain protested against social security taxes by refusing to pay, concealing her assets, and even sawing the lock off of her business's front door when it was closed by the tax collector and mailing the lock to the Internal Revenue Service. * From 1951 to 1954, a group of \\"Texas Housewives\\" refused to pay social security taxes on the wages of their domestic help, and took their resistance all the way to the Supreme Court (where they lost their case). Poujadism, 1955 In 1955, a right-wing, anti-tax, middle-class, populist movement led by Pierre Poujade began resisting taxes in France. The resisters used a variety of tactics, including strikes, harassment of tax collectors, disruption of government auctions, and running for office (several Poujadists were elected to the Chamber of Deputies). No Taxation Without Representation in D.C., 1955‚Äìpresent In 1955 District of Columbia resident Florence Jaffray Harriman announced that she would be refusing to pay federal income tax until the federal government enacted \\"home rule\\" (a locally elected government) for the District (something the District was not granted until 1973). In 1990, the non-voting Congressional representative from the district, Walter Fauntroy, started a similar tax resistance campaign for D.C. statehood. Former District of Columbia council member Carol Schwartz, upset at the lack of Congressional representation for people in the district, threatened to start resisting her federal income taxes over the issue in 2011 and called on other D.C. residents to join her. * * J. Bracken Lee, 1956 Utah Governor J. Bracken Lee stopped paying federal income tax in 1956 to protest what he felt was unconstitutional federal spending. He hoped to become a test case, but the Supreme Court declined to hear his case. * The Amish exemption from U.S. social insurance, 1935‚Äì65 In 1965 the United States Congress allowed the Amish to be exempt from the Social Security tax, following a persistent resistance campaign from some Amish who regarded insurance programs as mistrustful of God and therefore against their religious teachings. See and (this exemption also covers Medicare taxes). Tax resistance in Ethiopia, 1943‚Äì68 There were several outbreaks of armed resistance focused on tax complaints in Ethiopia. In some cases, farmers defaulted on their taxes and abandoned their land rather than pay, some fleeing into neighboring countries. In others, districts refused to elect or admit tax assessors, and used a mix of persuasion and coercion to prevent people from obeying the tax law.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 404‚Äì07, 409‚Äì15. Turks in Cyprus, 1958 During the struggle over the future of Cyprus in the late 1950s, Turkish communities refused to pay taxes to Greek-run municipalities. St. Regis Reservation resistance, 1959 200 Indians on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation in New York, led by Wallace \\"Mad Bear\\" Anderson, refused to pay state income taxes \\"and threatened to use summonses from the Tax Department 'to light the fires in our longhouses.'\\" Tithe resistance in Malaysia, early 1960s In 1960, the Malaysian government converted the traditional Islamic zakƒÅt (tithe) paid voluntarily by rice farmers into a mandatory tax payable through the government. Opposition to the new government-controlled tithe was, at least in some places, \\"unanimous and vehement,\\" and rice farmers developed a number of tactics to resist the tithes, successfully reducing the government's take to a fraction of what the law allowed. Tax resistance by the \\"Johnson cult,\\" 1964 In the \\"Johnson cult\\" protest in Papua New Guinea (in which locals ostensibly intended to raise money to purchase U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and install him as their political leader), the protesters raised money for their unusual plan by withholding the ¬£2 poll tax from the government. A court in the United Kingdom rejects war tax resistance, 1968 In 1968, in the UK case of Cheney v. Conn, an individual objected to paying a tax that, in part, would be used to procure nuclear arms in unlawful contravention, he contended, of the Geneva Conventions. His claim was dismissed by the court, the judge ruling that \\"What the [taxation] statute itself enacts cannot be unlawful, because what the statute says and provides is itself the law, and the highest form of law that is known to this country.\\" There remains in the United Kingdom a significant movement of people who wish to withhold the percentage of their taxes used for war and weapons, but instead contribute them into a ring fenced pool for peace-building or peacekeeping purposes. This may be either for religious or economic reasons. See the website Peace Pays or the Peace Tax campaign \\"Conscience,\\" which produces an alternative tax return form to document the withholding of the military percentage of your taxes (approximately 12% of the total tax bill in the UK). Vietnam War, 1968‚Äì72 In early 1968, 458 writers and editors put full-page ads in the New York Post, New York Times Book Review and Ramparts, declaring their intention to refuse to pay a proposed 10% Vietnam War surtax. The signatories included James Baldwin, Robert Bly, Noam Chomsky, Robert Creeley, David Dellinger, Philip K. Dick, Robert Duncan, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Leslie Fiedler, Betty Friedan, Allen Ginsberg, Todd Gitlin, Paul Goodman, Edward S. Herman, Paul Krassner, Staughton Lynd, Dwight Macdonald, Jackson Mac Low, Norman Mailer, Peter Matthiessen, Milton Mayer, Ed McClanahan, Carl Oglesby, Tillie Olsen, Grace Paley, Thomas Pynchon, Adrienne Rich, Kirkpatrick Sale, Ed Sanders, Peter Dale Scott, Susan Sontag, Terry Southern, Benjamin Spock, Gloria Steinem, Norman Thomas, Hunter S. Thompson, Lew Welch, John Wieners, Kurt Vonnegut and Howard Zinn. An estimated 70 signed on later. In 1970, five Harvard and nine M.I.T. faculty members, including Nobel laureates Salvador E. Luria and George Wald, announced that they would be resisting taxes in protest of the war. In 1972, Jane Hart, wife of U.S. Senator Philip Hart, said that she would be resisting the federal income tax. By this time, every major I.R.S. center had a staff member assigned to be the \\"Viet Nam Protest Coordinator.\\" Also in 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania decided the case of United States v. Malinowski.347 F. Supp. 347, 73‚Äì1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9355 (E.D. Pa. 1972), aff'd, 472 F.2d 850, 73‚Äì1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9199 (3d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 970 (1973). That case involved John Paul Malinowski, an instructor in theology at St. Joseph's College and a member of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer had filed a false Form W-4, and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (that is, the allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Malinowski was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied. Agbƒôkoya, 1968‚Äì69 The Agbƒôkoya Parapo Revolt was a successful tax rebellion by the Yoruba of Nigeria. Papua New Guinea, 1969 The Mataungan Organisation launched tax resistance in support of the indigenous government against a mixed indigenous/immigrant government in 1969. Students Resist El Paso Sales Tax, 1969 Calling it a tax on the poor to pay for business district improvements, delegates at the National Student Association Congress in El Paso, Texas in 1969 purchased American flags from a local retailer and refused to pay the penny sales tax on each flag, in a symbolic, media-friendly act of resistance. Resistance to the Larzac base, 1970 In 1970, when the French defense minister announced plans to expand a military base in Larzac, Jos√© Bov√© and other activists led a campaign to withhold 3% of their taxes (an amount they said was equivalent to the amount the government was spending on its base-expansion campaign) and redirect this money toward agricultural projects. Opposition to school tax in Stormont County, Ontario, 1970 Several property owners in Stormont County, Ontario, refused to pay a portion of their property tax in 1970 in a tax strike sponsored by the Ontario Federation of Agriculture to protest the burden on rural property owners caused by basing the tax on property value rather than income.\\"Stormont farmers refuse to pay education taxes in campaign of OFA \\" The Leamington Post and News 8 October 1970 Bangladesh independence movement, 1971 In March, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for mass civil disobedience in the service of the independence of Bangladesh, saying that citizens should refuse to pay taxes or to cooperate with the government in other ways. According to one source \\"The no-tax directive of the Sheikh was followed so vigorously by both individuals and organizations that no one gave any taxes and no organization dared charge any. Even the two posh hotels of Dacca became accessible to middle income people when food prices were drastically reduced for non-collection of taxes. The whole Income Tax Department was closed down making it quite impossible for the central government to assess and collect direct taxes from individuals and corporations.\\" Efforts to legalize conscientious objection to military taxation, 1972‚Äì In 1972 United States Congressman Ron Dellums introduced legislation that would legalize a form of conscientious objection to military taxation, allowing some taxpayers to designate their taxes for non-military spending only. Advocated by National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund, this legislation is regularly reintroduced in the United States Congress and has a number of cosponsors. The legislatures of other countries are also considering similar legislation. Many war tax resisters support this, but others feel that such a law would not actually address the problem that leads them to resist taxation.Gross, David (2008) op. cit. pp. 429‚Äì35. Refusing to pay an excise tax on air travel in the U.S., 1972 When a $1- to $2-per-ticket air travel tax was applied to five airports in the United States in 1972, thousands of travelers refused to pay the tax. Norwalk Taxpayers League, 1972 The Norwalk Taxpayers League, led by Vincent DePanfilis, collected pledges from taxpayers that they would refuse to pay any more tax in the 1973‚Äì74 tax year than they had in 1972‚Äì73. This was a rare example of tax resistance during the American tax revolt movement of the 1970s. Castine school tax resistance, 1975 In Castine, Maine, residents voted to illegally refuse, as a town, to pay a state school tax, in 1975. Heinrich B√∂ll refuses church tax, 1972 In 1972, Heinrich B√∂ll refused to pay a Catholic church tithe that had been made mandatory and was enforced by the German government. \\"A New Call to Peacemaking,\\" 1976‚Äì78 In 1976, 1977, and 1978, representatives from the United States' \\"peace churches\\" (Mennonites, Brethren, and Quakers) met to develop what they called a \\"New Call to Peacemaking,\\" a joint statement in which they called on members of their congregations to refuse to pay taxes that go to pay for war. Nicaragua, 1978 In the last months of the Anastasio Somoza regime in Nicaragua, the opposition organized a tax strike. United States, Proposition 13, 1978 A wave of tax revolts began in the late 1970s and were particularly popular in the West. In 1978, voters in California passed Proposition 13, sponsored by Howard Jarvis and passed overwhelmingly by voters in 1978, which drastically limited property tax levels in the state. In subsequent years, the state initiative process, initially championed by Populists and progressives, has been increasingly used for such purposes by conservative and corporate political forces. In the United States, notable examples include a series of initiatives in Oregon (see Oregon tax revolt) and Washington (see Tim Eyman), the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) in Colorado, and Proposition 2 in Massachusetts. Sales Tax Boycott in Ottawa, 1981 In 1981, a tax resistance campaign in Ontario targeted the provincial sales tax and included both merchants and consumers as participants. Palestine, doctors in 1981 Doctors in Gaza City refused to pay a 12% income tax to the Israeli occupation and were supported by a two-day general strike. Archbishop Hunthausen resists, 1982 In 1982, Catholic Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle, Washington announced that he would be refusing to pay half of his income tax in protest against the nuclear arms race. > Citing a previous pastoral letter he wrote on the subject, Archbishop > Hunthausen stated that certain laws may he peacefully disobeyed under > serious conditions, and that there may be times \\"when disobedience may be an > obligation of conscience.\\" \\"I believe,\\" he said, \\"that the present issue is > as serious as any the world has faced. The very existence of humanity is at > stake.\\" Churches resist the social security tax, 1984 The Quint City Baptist Temple in Iowa, the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, and several other churches refused to pay social security taxes on the wages of their employees, maintaining that it was unconstitutional to make them tax collectors for the government. The courts disagreed. Irish Unionists, 1986 The Democratic Unionist Party called on its supporters to refuse to pay taxes in protest against an Anglo-Irish settlement on the political status of Northern Ireland. Beit Sahour, 1988‚Äì89 In 1988‚Äì89, during the First Intifada, the Palestinian resistance urged people to stop paying taxes to Israel. At the time, The people of Beit Sahour responded to this call with an unusually organized and citywide tax strike. As a result of the tax strike, Israeli military authorities placed the town under curfew for 45 days and seized goods belonging to citizens in raids. Israel's military forces had the authority, independent from the rest of the Israeli government, to create and enforce taxes in occupied areas. As a result, they would impose taxes on Palestinians as collective punishment measures to discourage the intifada, for instance \\"the glass tax (for broken windows), the stones tax (for damage done by stones), the missile tax (for Gulf War damage), and a general intifada tax, among others\\". Among those prominent in Beit Sahour's tax resistance were Ghassan Andoni and Elias Rishmawi. Some tax resistance continued in Beit Sahour for some years after the end of the 1989 tax strike there UK Poll Tax, 1989‚Äì93 In 1989‚Äì90, the government of Margaret Thatcher reformed local taxation in Britain by replacing Domestic Rates with a new tax known officially as the Community Charge, but more widely and disparagingly known as the \\"Poll Tax\\". Whereas Rates had been, at least to some extent, a progressive tax, the Poll Tax was a flat tax irrespective of income. Many people considered the new tax to be unfair, and a major non-payment campaign saw up to 30% of the population of some council areas refusing to pay. Draconian enforcement measures caused civil unrest, and ultimately led to the Poll Tax riots. The new tax became a major electoral liability for the Conservative Party, and was a significant factor in the ousting of Mrs Thatcher by her own party. Due to its unpopularity and the disastrous impact of non-payment on local authority finances, the tax was replaced by the Council Tax in 1993. Cameroon, 1991 In 1991 Cameroon's major opposition political parties called for tax resistance in support of their campaign to end one-party rule. Native Americans in Canada, 1994 For 29 days in 1994, a group of Native Americans occupied one floor of the building housing the Revenue Canada Taxation Centre in downtown Toronto, in protest of Canada's plans to tax Native Americans who had previously been exempted from taxation as a result of treaty provisions. Many continue to resist the tax. Water tax strike, 1994‚Äì96, 2007 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, among others, promoted a non-payment campaign against the government water monopoly in 2007. An earlier \\"water war\\" in 1994‚Äì6 had led to a victory by the resisters in which the water charge was revoked. Lech Walesa in 1995 In 1995, Poland's president Lech Walesa called for people to refuse to pay any higher income tax rates. Onondaga Nation highway blockade, 1997 Protesters upset at New York state's attempt to impose sales and excise taxes on the Iroquois in Onondaga Nation led residents to blockade Interstate 81 in May, 1997. Brutal arrests followed, with New York eventually paying $2.7 million to settle lawsuits filed by those arrested. Zapatistas municipios aut√≥nomos When the Zapatista Army of National Liberation moved from organizing armed resistance to the Mexican government to establishing autonomous villages‚ÄîRebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities‚Äîfree from central government control, one of the things they did was to stop paying taxes to the outside governments. Fuel tax protests, 2000 In multiple areas of Europe, in 2000, people protested increases in motor vehicle fuel taxes by blockading ports, refineries, fuel depots, and highways.Burg (2004) op. cit. pp. 425‚Äì28 * Zimbabwe, 2000 Opposition parties in Zimbabwe urged citizens to refuse to pay taxes to protest government misuse of funds in 2000. =21st Century= Same-sex marriage rights In the United States, some gay people adopted a form of tax resistance to protest the government's lack of legal recognition of same- sex marriage. UK council tax In the United Kingdom, senior citizens in opposition to steep increases in council tax, claiming that increases of as much as 30% are not affordable to those living on a pension, refused to pay the tax in full or in part (some paying the previous year's amount plus an inflationary rise). One of these, Sylvia Hardy of Exeter, was jailed for seven days. People have also resisted the council tax on the grounds that the government was not properly discouraging travellers from setting up camp nearby, * or had failed to properly clean up hazardous waste on their property. In 2013, Christopher Coverdale began refusing to pay his council tax on the grounds that the council was investing some of the money in promoting terrorist acts and war crimes. Bin Tax protests, 2001‚Äì2005 There was a long campaign of resistance to rubbish-hauling charges in Ireland. Venezuelan opposition, 2003 The political opposition to ruler Hugo Chavez launched a tax strike aimed at ending the Chavez regime's control. \\"Flatulence Tax\\" resistance, 2003 New Zealand farmers protested a livestock tax that was ostensibly designed to discourage and ameliorate methane emissions by announcing they would refuse to pay and by sending packages of manure to government ministers. * Vandalism of traffic- ticket-generating machines, 2004‚Äì As governments around the world began to see the revenue-producing potential of traffic-ticket-generating cameras, drivers began to fight back. Examples of destruction or disabling of such machines have been registered in many countries. Nepal, 2006 Political parties in Nepal urged people to stop paying their taxes in 2006 as part of a push against the power of the monarchy. Tijuana, 2006 The Chamber of Commerce in Tijuana voted to pay taxes into an escrow account rather than to the government to protest the government's inability to provide adequate security. Organized resistance to paying Mafia, 2006 In 2006, after the arrest of Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, 100 shopkeepers in Palermo, Italy declared publicly that they would stop paying taxes to the Sicilian Mafia. They encouraged consumers to support the resisters by buycotting their stores. Tehran Bazaar, 2008 Government attempts to extend a value- added tax to cover the Tehran Bazaar were frustrated by a strike that shut down the Bazaar until the government gave in. * Nankang, China, 2009 Protesters in Nankang \\"overturned police cars and blocked roads over plans to more strictly enforce payment of taxes.\\" Delhi lawyers, 2009 Lawyers in Delhi, India went on strike in 2009 rather than pay a sales tax that the government was trying to extend to cover legal services. Chascom√∫s/Lezama secessionist struggle, 2009 Groups on both sides of the debate over the secession of Lezama from the city of Chascom√∫s used tax resistance to try to pressure the government into siding with them. * * Vecinos Autoconvocados in Paran√°, Argentina, 2009‚Äì10 In February 2009, residents of Paran√°, Argentina launched a property tax strike to protest large jumps in property assessment values. In March, residents of Justo Daract followed suit. In 2010, residents of Villa Nueva announced a tax strike to protest against inadequate government services. Residents were also urged to refuse to pay taxes for roadwork that resisters alleged had already been paid for out of federal taxes. PRD resistance in Indonesia, 2010 Members of the small Partai Rakyat Demokratik launched a tax strike against president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in early 2010. Hundreds of protesters pledged to refuse to pay a tax, and as part of their protest, burned their Nomer Peserta Wajib Pajak (taxpayer identification) paperwork. Party chairman Sunu Pajar said, \\"we refuse to pay taxes as a form of resistance.\\" Luzerne County, 2010 A Pennsylvania county government beset with corruption hiked taxes by 10% and some residents said no. One recorded a protest song entitled \\"Take This Tax and Shove It\\" and launched a tax resistance campaign. Nepalese doctors, 2010 Doctors in Nepal planned to engage in tax resistance and other acts of civil disobedience to protest the government in 2010. San Juan, Argentina shopkeepers, 2010 Shopkeepers in San Juan, Argentina, upset at being undercut by untaxed street vendors, announced a tax strike in 2010. Tax refusal protests China's one-child policy Yang Zhizhu and Chen Hong protested China's one-child policy by refusing to pay a 200,000 yuan fine on their second child. Coventry \\"Axe the Tax\\" protest, 2010 Hundreds of small businesses refused to pay a municipal tax in Coventry in 2010 and successfully had the tax (and the body that levied it) rescinded.e.g., Tax protest and strike in Romania, 2010 In August 2010 a tax strike was declared after newly introduced regulations were found to force freelancers and unincorporated companies waste over 24 man-hours each month on filling tax declarations and depositing those declarations in person at three different offices, in addition to forcing freelancers pay an unemployment insurance they cannot take advantage of. The new rules apply whether the freelancers or the unincorporated companies had any income or not, and declarations have to be submitted even for amounts less than ‚Ç¨10. Barinas, Venezuela transit licensees Licensed public transit drivers in Barinas, Venezuela who were getting undercut by unlicensed, unofficial ones launched a tax strike to protest a lack of government protection for their privilege. Ondarroa municipal tax strike, 2003‚Äì11 The government responded to an organized municipal tax strike involving hundreds of households in Ond√°rroa in the Basque region of Spain by cutting the water supply to 120 homes and businesses there. The residents were supporters of a banned Basque nationalist political party and ended their strike (though without paying any of the previously resisted taxes) when they regained government representation under the banner of a new, legal party in 2011. Ivory Coast, 2011 Alassane Ouattara apparently won the presidential election in Ivory Coast over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Gbagbo disagreed and refused to leave office. Ouattara then called on the citizens of Ivory Coast to discontinue paying taxes to the Gbagbo government, which eventually was defeated. When Ouattara took power, however, his government began pursuing those resisters for back taxes. Guinea-Bassau cashew traders strike, 2011 Cashew merchants in Guinea-Bissau went on strike in April 2011 rather than pay a new export tax on cashews. Tax resistance for Catalan Independence, 2011‚Äì In July 2011, the Catalan nationalist group √ímnium Cultural, at its 50th anniversary meeting, called on citizens to redirect their taxes from the central government to a Catalan-run fund until such time as the government concedes more autonomy to the region. * In April, 2012, some Catalan separatists started paying their federal taxes into the Catalan treasury instead of submitting the money to the central Spanish government. In October, 2012, the small town of Gallifa in Catalonia began tax resistance as a municipality by refusing to pay the income tax due on the salaries of the employees at the tax office. By 2013, some 650 municipalities had begun turning their taxes over to the Catalan government rather than to the federal government. * The tax resistance campaign is being organized by Catalunya Diu Prou (\\"Catalonia Says 'Enough'\\"), which says that some freelancers and independent businesses, which are responsible for their own tax withholding, will follow suit. In 2019, another tax resistance initiative, Ni 1 euro x a la repressi√≥ (\\"Not one euro for repression\\") was launched. Modeled on the Spanish war tax resistance movement, it urged people stop paying and then to redirect the portion of their taxes that would otherwise go to pay for the Spanish monarchy, and those elements of the Spanish government that suppress Catalan independence. By this time, some 17,000 Catalan taxpayers were paying their federal taxes to the Catalan tax agency rather than to the Spanish one, in acts of civil disobedience. A reboot of this campaign launched in 2020 under the name Prou Monarquia (\\"Enough Monarchy\\"), boosted by former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. Road toll resistance in Argentina, 2011 Argentine congresswoman Griselda Baldata noticed that nobody was maintaining the road on Route 36, but that the company in charge of maintenance was still collecting a toll. So she stopped paying and urged her constituents to do likewise. Protests against European austerity measures, 2011‚Äì In the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis, some governments raised taxes and implemented harsh austerity measures to bring down the government budget deficits and satisfy international creditors. Some people and groups who opposed these measures adopted tax resistance as a protest tactic, for instance in Spain, Germany, Greece,  * Italy, * Cyprus, and Ireland. Before the victory of the Greek Syriza party in the 2015 elections, it had sponsored a \\"Have Not, Pay Not\\" tax resistance movement targeting the Enfia tax. The party's opposition to this tax was one of the factors in its popularity, and many people stopped paying the tax when it became likely that Syriza would win the elections and do away with the tax entirely. * But Syriza found itself unable to resist raising taxes when it came into power, and citizens fought back. One anarchist / antiauthoritarian coalition sabotaged more than 200 public transit fare-enforcement machines. The government, finding it difficult to raise money through straightforward taxation, increasingly relies on increases in fares, highway tolls, and utility bills. By 2017, 40% of Greeks were unable (or unwilling) to pay their utility bills. Some Greeks used devices that interfere with electricity meters, while others enlisted Den Plirono (\\"Won't Pay\\" movement) activists to reconnect the power to their homes when they were cut off for failure to pay the electric bill. Resistance against the \\"household tax\\" in Ireland, 2012‚Äì15 A group (including Teachta√≠ D√°la Joe Higgins, Clare Daly, Joan Collins, Richard Boyd Barrett, Mick Wallace, Thomas Pringle and S√©amus Healy, European Parliamentarian Paul Murphy, and councillors Ruth Coppinger and Ted Tynan) promoted a campaign of resistance against the \\"stealth tax\\" of increased household and water rates. * A campaign spokesperson explained: \\"This is not a charge to fund your local community, it is a tax to fund private speculators, bondholders and the bailout. Our incomes and services are being decimated to pay this private debt. Now people have a chance to register their opposition by not registering for this tax. By not registering, we can make this a referendum on the bailouts for the rich and the cuts for us.\\" By the deadline, only about half of the households in Ireland that were required to register and pay had done so. On 6 May 2013, the Revenue Commissioners reported that 1.2 m households (74%) have paid the property tax. In August 2013, the Revenue said 1.58 m households have paid the tax, and over ‚Ç¨175 m has been collected. In 2014, Irish Water workers trying to install the water meters were met with blockades. * In February 2015, Murphy and three others were arrested and then released without charges, reportedly part of an investigation into a November 2014 Jobstown protest that trapped T√°naiste Joan Burton in her car for over two hours. Spanish autonomists, 2012‚Äì14 Autonomists in Spain, under the banner \\"derecho de rebeli√≥n\\" (right of rebellion), launched a multifaceted tax resistance campaign designed to redirect taxes from the Spanish government (which they felt had overstepped Constitutional bounds and unlawfully usurped power) to locally organized autonomous projects.See * * Indonesia, 2012 A tax resistance movement began in Indonesia in protest of the government's prioritizing of payments to bankers and other large bondholders during the economic downturn. * * Honduras Crime syndicates / protogovernments rule the streets in many parts of Honduras, and these often extort more money from their subjects than does the internationally recognized Honduran government. Some people resist these taxes, known locally as \\"impuesto de guerra\\" or \\"war tax,\\" but the consequences of refusal can be, and frequently are, deadly. Eight bus company employees in Choloma, for instance, were gunned down in broad daylight, a block away from a police station and by attackers in police uniforms, in retaliation against drivers who did not pay the tax. In May, 2013 bus drivers there took collective action, going on strike to demand better security. * Salta, Argentina, 2013 Guillermo Durand Cornejo, president of an argentinian consumer rights organization called CODELCO, and a legislative representative, called on Salte√±os (citizens of Salta, Argentina) to refuse to pay a municipal tax, in the wake of property tax increases and new taxes in electricity and water bills. \\"Until such time as the mayor gives a response to the people concerning the tax hike, I suggest that you do not pay this month's municipal tax,\\" he said. \\"I call for civil disobedience.\\" Cornejo said he views a thirty-day tax strike as a wake up call for the government, and suggested that strikers who restrict their strike to a single month will not be subject to government reprisals. Egypt, 2013 Egyptian activists are withholding bus and subway fares as a protest against their government's continuing repression. \\"We are calling for civil disobedience ‚Äî not to pay for the metro and buses...\\" one said. \\"They're taking that money and bringing tools to repress us. They bring bird shot, and tear gas, poison gas even.\\" Madagascar, 2013 Businesses in Madagascar refused to submit taxes to the government, depositing the money in an escrow account instead. The businesses, which represent a large percentage of the country's tax base, were reacting to a crisis of stability and perceived legitimacy in the government. According to the chair of the Madagascar's Enterprises Union, \\"We no longer know with what kind of authorities we should deal at this stage.\\" * Tax protesters in Canada The tax protester phenomenon, which had long been part of the national tax scene in the United States, emerged as a difficulty for the Canadian government as well. By 2013, about 400 cases were pending in the Tax Court of Canada ‚Äî \\"most using florid and arcane language and claiming bizarre laws that supersede or nullify Canada's regulations and laws; it prompted the Tax Court to adopt a triage approach to cope with the deluge, grouping cases and directing them to specific judges.\\" Bonnets rouges in Brittany, 2013‚Äì14 In late 2013, a nationalist movement in Brittany called the bonnets rouges began destroying highway portals that were designed to tax truck transportation in the region. They eventually destroyed hundreds of these portals ‚Äî as well as the tax office in Morlaix ‚Äî leading the French government to abandon the tax.   Pos me salto in Mexico, passe livre in Brazil, and Planka.nu in Sweden, 2013‚Äì14 When the Mexico city government hiked transit fares by two-thirds, frustrated commuters started leaping the turnstiles, both alone and in organized groups, in a form of protest they call pos me salto (\\"well, then, I'll jump\\"). * At around the same time, a similar movement called passe livre was engaged in similarly motivated actions in Brazil. The similar Planka.nu movement in Sweden went a step further, initiating a mutual insurance plan: For a ‚Ç¨12 monthly fee, the plan insures contributors against any tickets they are given for being caught without a ticket ‚Äî compare this to ‚Ç¨100 for a monthly transit pass, or ‚Ç¨150 for a fare evasion citation. The plan is running at a profit, taking in about twice as much from subscribers as it has had to pay out in fine reimbursements. Crete, 2014‚Äì16 Thousands of Cretans each paid only a single euro of their road taxes in a protest there. The action was organized by \\"People Stop Paying,\\" a group that protested against rising taxes at a time of increasing economic difficulties, and that the taxes were not actually going to crucially needed road improvements. That group also organized protests at government auctions of seized property. * Tunisian taxi drivers, 2014 Taxi drivers in Tunisia reacted to a new tax on motorists by posting signs in the windows of their cabs reading \\"I will not pay tax!\\" and daring the police to try to enforce the new taxes against them. Businesses in Apatzing√°n, 2014 Some business leaders in Apatzing√°n, a city in the Tierra Caliente region of Michoac√°n, finding that the government was giving them no protection from the Knights Templar Cartel, decided to stop paying taxes. Euromaidan, 2014 During the Euromaidan in Ukraine in early 2014, a group of business owners in Lviv announced that they would stop paying value-added and income taxes to the Ukraine central government of Viktor Yanukovych (taxes that went to maintain the military and internal security forces). \\"Protesta fiscale ad oltranza\\", 2014 In northern Italy, a group of small businesses united under the banner \\"protesta fiscale ad oltranza\\" (tax protest to the bitter end) refuse paying taxes, claiming that the Constitution requires the government to leave them enough to live on and that they should not be forced to borrow money to pay the government. For example, when bed and breakfast owner Alessandra Marazzi discovered that fully 84% of what she was bringing in was going to pay taxes and state-monopolized utility fees, she decided to stop paying taxes just so her business (and her family) could survive. Caterer Andrea Polese stopped paying and put a sign on her door reading \\"I am a tax resister.\\" Bar owner Mariano Pavanello posted a selfie with a sign saying \\"I decided to stop paying protection money to a state thief.\\" Venetian independence movement, 2014‚Äì19 After the majority of Venetians who responded to a plebiscite voted to secede from Italy and restore the Venetian Republic, one of the first acts of the organizers of the plebiscite was to decree that the people of Venice were now free from obligations to pay taxes to the Italian state. Gianluca Busato, one of the drivers behind the initiative, went so far as to say that \\"The payment of taxes to foreign governments [e.g. Italy's], as well as immoral, it's illegal.\\" * The separatists claimed that 3,407 businesses initially signed on to the tax strike, and as many as 93,000 others may be resisting less openly. In 2016, the government struck back, arresting 20 people in 19 raids in Vicenza, Treviso, and Verona and charging them with inciting tax evasion. In 2019, separatists again refused to pay their federal taxes to Italy, redirecting them instead to Veneto State. Anti-corruption resistance in Austria, 2014 Some business owners in Austria, notably Wolfgang Reichl and Gerhard H√∂ller, began paying their federal taxes into escrow accounts rather than turning them over to the government, largely in protest over the Hypo scandal. H√∂ller launched a project called Der Steuerstreik (\\"the tax strike\\") in an attempt to get more business owners to participate in tax resistance. * Wakulima market vendors, 2014 Hundreds of vendors at the Wakulima market in Nakuru, Kenya, refused to pay taxes to the county government in June, 2014 in a tax strike to protest the government's failure to provide the market the sanitation and sewage services the taxes ostensibly pay for. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, 2014 In August, 2014, Imran Khan, leader of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, a prominent political party in Pakistan, gave a speech in which he called for a \\"civil disobedience movement\\" in which \\"we will not pay taxes, electricity or gas bills,\\" to the central government, in hopes of forcing the resignation of Pakistan's prime minister Nawaz Sharif. * Khan's party was in charge of the government in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and that government itself planned to withhold its federal taxes and utility payments. Asked what they would do if the government responded by cutting off utility service to the province, province Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani said that they would retaliate by cutting off the neighboring province of Punjab from the power generated by the Tarbela Dam, which is located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Umbrella Movement, 2014‚Äì15 As Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement began to move away from the Occupy Central mode of street protests, it began to promote tax refusal and refusal to pay rent in government-run housing. Benny Tai Yiu- Ting, one of the movement's organizers, wrote: \\"Blocking government may be even more powerful than blocking roads. Refusal to pay taxes, delaying rent payments by tenants in public housing estates and filibustering in the Legislative Council, along with other such acts of noncooperation, could make governing more inconvenient. No government can govern effectively if the majority of its people are unwilling to cooperate.\\" * Puerto Rico, 2015 Foes of a new 16% value-added tax in Puerto Rico launched consumer and business strikes there, including a \\"No Consumption Day\\" on 3 March 2015. Vitebsk, Belarus, 2015 Merchants at the Polatsk marketplace in Vitebsk, Belarus went on strike and refused to pay taxes in March, 2015 to protest government harassment of traders who had not purchased enough official paperwork. Ethiopian-Jewish Israelis, 2015 Police brutality, discrimination, and mistreatment towards Israel's Ethiopian Jewish minority led Shlomo Molla, one of the few Ethiopian-Israelis to have been in the Israeli parliament, to call for tax resistance, refusal to serve in the army, and other forms of civil disobedience. Beni, D.R. Congo, 2015‚Äì20 Residents of Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo, launched a tax strike to protest the government's failure to provide them with adequate security against atrocities committed by the Allied Democratic Forces insurgency. The tax resistance was preceded by a week-long general strike, and later spread to other parts of North Kivu.  Githurai market vendors, 2015 Market vendors in Githurai, Kenya withheld taxes from the county government to protest the government's unwillingness or inability to provide basic services to the market. Prino condominiums, 2015 Fifty condominium owners in Prino, Italy, stopped paying the \\"IMU\\" municipal property tax to protest the city's neglect of public spaces, including a filthy public square with a broken fountain that's become a rubbish heap, poor upkeep of drainage that leads to flooding, and bad traffic management. Patadar community, 2015 The Patidar community in Gujarat, in pursuit of government-protected minority status, coordinated bank runs and tax resistance in an \\"economic non- cooperation\\" movement. Crickhowell, 2015 The town of Crickhowell, in a protest against the use of tax havens by multinational companies, decided to try to use the same tax haven strategies on a small scale. They teamed up with a television show to try to \\"offshore\\" the town in the hopes of spurring the government into closing the loopholes that allow such tax avoidance. Russian truckers, 2015‚Äì16 A new tax on heavy-weight truckers in Russia, and corruption in the way the tax would be administered, led to a trucking strike that unsettled the Putin regime. Mexican areas, 2015‚Äì16 Residents of Uruapan started withholding municipal taxes in 2015, using the money to fund private Neighborhood Watch groups, in exasperation at the inability of law enforcement to protect them from criminals. Resisters also refused to pay certain utility rates. Businesses in Huatulco * and Acapulco followed suit in 2016. Eastleigh, 2016 Business owners in Eastleigh, Nairobi stopped paying taxes to Nairobi County in protest against the government's failure to provide basic services. Eastleigh North Ward representative Osman Adow Ibrahim, a member of the County Assembly, wrote: \\"As your representative, I fully support the decision you have made and have engaged a lawyer to get an injunction through the courts. The law and Constitution of Kenya allows for peaceful protest to get one's rights. I hope we all stand together on this, so that we get the service we need.\\" Indian taxpayers union, 2016 Anjali Damania and Alyque Padamsee started a taxpayers union and launched a tax strike to protest government corruption in India. They were emboldened by a ruling from Justice Arun Chaudhari of the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, in which he said > To eradicate the cancer of corruption ‚Äî the \\"hydra-headed monster,\\" it is > now a high time for the citizens to come together to tell their governments > that they have had enough. That is the miasma of corruption. If the same > continues, taxpayers may resort to refuse to pay taxes by \\"non-cooperation > movement.\\" Among their tactics was to print up \\"zero rupee\\" notes, resembling currency but containing anti-corruption messages, that people could hand to government officials who demand bribes. Gay rights tax resistance in Italy Tommaso Cerno, a journalist and gay rights activist in Friuli, Italy, announced, in a letter published in Repubblica, a tax strike for gay rights. Jewelers in India, 2016 Jewelers in India staged an 18-day strike to protest a new excise tax on gold sales. The government agreed to suspend collection of the charge pending the report from a committee that was formed to look into the jewelers' grievances. The jewelers are estimated to have lost some $4.5 billion in sales during the strike. This is the third time the government has suspended the tax in response to protests. * * Terrorist victims' families in France, 2016 Families of victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks said they would refuse to pay the taxes due from their dead family members, complaining that it was insulting to tax the victims to pay for, among other things, the salaries of the public defenders representing the terrorist suspects. Trieste, 2016 Hundreds of separatists in the Province of Trieste stopped paying taxes to the Italian government in 2016. Gasolinazo resistance in Mexico, 2017 When the government of Mexico partially-privatized the state-run gasoline monopoly, gas prices rose sharply, contrary to the promises of the politicians who implemented the policy. This led to a variety of tax resistance actions from the citizenry, among other actions. In Uruapan, for example, several citizens' groups occupied the Treasury and Revenue Administration departments to prevent tax collection. Ouanaminthe workers, 2017 Workers in the Codevi (Free Trade Zone) in Ouanaminthe, Haiti went on strike in February, 2017, to protest a new 10% tax on their wages. Mass resistance to \\"Vagrants Tax\\" in Minsk, 2017 A so- called \\"Vagrants Tax\\" in Minsk, Belarus was met by widespread resistance, with fewer than 10% of taxpayers complying with the law. Coffee bootlegging in Greece, 2017 When the government of Greece attached a 20% tax to coffee imports, a group called Cafe Justicia began smuggling fair trade coffee from Guatemala into Greece to help Greeks to avoid the tax. * * GST rollout in India, 2017 India began to roll out a nationwide goods-and-services tax (GST) in 2017 to replace a patchwork of regional taxes. But not all of the regions revoked their complementary taxes, and some industries that were formerly untaxed or taxed at a low rate were newly taxed or taxed at a higher rate. This led to protests. For example, textile workers in Chandigarh shut their shops to protest the new tax structure, and a thousand movie theaters in Tamil Nadu shut to protest that state's 30% entertainment tax which applied in addition to the new 18‚Äì28% goods-and-services tax. * Textile workers went further in September, selling their products without GST fees attached, in a \\"tax denial satyagraha\\" or civil disobedience campaign. In October, filmmakers in Kollywood halted all new film releases to join the protest by Tamil Nadu theaters. Tax protest against refugee settlement in Italy, 2017 Forty business owners in Italy refused to pay taxes in 2017 to protest the government's plans to house refugees near their businesses. * Business strikes in Ethiopia, 2017 Businesses in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and nearby towns went on strike in July, 2017 to protest tax hikes on small businesses. Residents also began \\"posting pictures of damaged public infrastructures such as roads, schools, and hospitals on social media to make a point that taxes collected are simply embezzled [rather] than used to improve people's lives.\\" More than five hundred merchants were jailed in Bahir Dar for refusing to pay a tax, and many others closed their shops rather than pay. Republican Party calls for tax refusal in Seattle, 2017 When the Seattle city government enacted a municipal income tax, arguably in violation of Washington state law, the Washington State Republican Party called on citizens to refuse to pay. \\"This law is unconstitutional, illegal, and against the voter's [sic] will expressed nine (9) times at the ballot box and it deserves nothing less than civil disobedience ‚Äî that is, refusal to comply, file or pay.\\" Gurugram tax revolt, 2017 The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram was formed in 2008. It made questionable claims to be able to govern and tax various parts of the region. Representatives from 46 villages that the Corporation attempted to tax unanimously voted to refuse to pay property tax to the Corporation in August, 2017, saying that it lacks authority to tax them. Tax strike in Kasai-Oriental, 2017 In protest against the government's refusal to allow democratic elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Kasai-Oriental province chapter of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, one of the country's largest political parties, declared a tax strike in October, 2017. Taxes and duties contribute to the development and welfare of the general citizenry. This is not the case in the DRC, where taxes and duties go essentially to the enrichment of a clique, to the detriment of the national community which is subject to miseries of all kinds.... So I ask the Congolese people in general, and those of Kasai in particular, not to pay taxes from October 1 until the departure of the current administration. The call to disobedience is for us a means to defeat the power of [Congo president Joseph] Kabila. Lutte pour le changement signed on to the campaign, asking citizens to stop paying taxes, utility bills, fees, royalties, and licenses until Kabila steps down. Toll resistance in Urab√°, 2018 Demonstrators in Urab√°, Colombia, burned down two newly-installed highway tollbooths in January, 2018. Water-tax resistance in Zaragoza, 2018 Pablo Hijar, city councilor of Zaragoza, Spain, from the Zaragoza en Com√∫n Party (a left-wing alliance), tweeted out a photo of himself tearing up his bill for the regional tax ICA, claiming that the tax is a boondoggle designed to force Zaragoza residents to pay for other regions' sewer treatment plants. \\"#IWon'tPay the #ICA,\\" he tweeted \\"We want accountability... and rates that are fair (progressive) and transparent (in their purposes).\\" Early reports indicated that a third of Zaragoza households had joined Hijar in refusing to pay the tax. * Hartal in Mogadishu, 2018 Traders in the Bakaara Market in Mogadishu closed their doors in a hartal to protest tax hikes in February, 2018. Nicaragua, 2018 Tax resistance featured as one of the tactics employed in the 2018‚Äì2020 Nicaraguan protests. The Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and Academy of Legal and Political Sciences called for people to stop paying utility bills and taxes. Merchant Irlanda Jerez led a similar tax and utility bill strike in the Mercado Oriental in Managua, before her imprisonment. * Student protest leaders in the University Alliance for Democracy and Justice called on Nicaraguans to refuse to pay taxes and to boycott businesses owned by political elites. * And the Blue & White National Unity group called for a three-day consumer strike and energy strike, aiming particularly at those consumer goods like fuel, alcoholic beverages, sodas, and tobacco that are most taxed. Ambazonian separatists in Cameroon, 2018 Tax resistance, organized in part via the officially banned media outlet Ambazonia TV, has featured in the Ambazonia independence movement in Cameroon. Gilets jaunes protests in France, 2018‚Äì19 In 2018, Emmanuel Macron pursued a petrol tax in France, albeit, the tax stems from an earlier policy under his predecessor, Fran√ßois Hollande. A burgeoning grassroots movement, the Gilets jaunes protests developed throughout France in November, extending even to the overseas territory of R√©union. The movement began with mass demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people, along with traffic blockades. The blockades then extended to ports, refineries, and oil depots, leading to fuel shortages in some areas. There were also attacks on highway tollbooths. Macron's government held firm until December, attempting to crack down on the movement with measures that Amnesty International characterized as including \\"rubber bullets, sting-ball grenades and tear gas against largely peaceful protesters who did not threaten public order and... numerous instances of excessive use of force by police.\\" The government then announced it was putting the fuel taxes on hold. Meanwhile, traffic-ticket- generating speed radar outposts throughout France were being destroyed by protesters. This was a form of protest that preceded the gilets jaunes movement, but accelerated during it. Thousands of such attacks were documented in 2018. Some attacks only temporarily disabled the radars (by means such as tape, bags, or spraypaint) but hundreds resulted in their total destruction. * Eventually about two-thirds of the radar outposts across the country were attacked, costing the government more than half a billion euros. * Newly- repaired radars were being so quickly disabled that the government stopped trying to repair damaged ones. Transport strike in Kenya, 2018 When the government of Kenya added a 16% tax to petroleum products, transporters launched a strike, leading to fuel shortages in Nairobi. \\"Kenya's energy regulator has revoked the license of the Kenya Independent Petroleum Distributors Association for allegedly leading the fuel boycott,\\" a news report said, \\"equating their action to economic sabotage.\\" Luj√°n agriculturalists, 2018 In Luj√°n, Argentina, a local tax on farmers rose 1200%. In response, an assembly of farmers voted to stop paying, and the National Network of Independent Producers supported the strike. * Guanare merchants, 2019 The Chamber of Commerce in Guanare, Venezuela, declared a merchants' tax strike when the city unilaterally established a new tax without going through legal processes. Pakistan merchants, 2019 Merchants in Pakistan went on strike in July 2019 in a protest against new sales taxes. * Delta Amacuro chamber of commerce, 2019 The Delta Amacuro, Venezuela state Chamber of Commerce launched a tax strike to protest what it said were extralegal and \\"confiscatory\\" municipal taxes. Protest against Alberta fossil fuel polluters, 2020 In January 2020, David Swann, former head of Alberta, Canada's Liberal Party and former provincial legislator, announced he would go on tax strike. He was protesting the fact that economically struggling fossil fuel extraction companies in Alberta were refusing to pay their local taxes, while leaving local governments on the hook for the cleanup of their extraction facilities and sites. \\"I am not paying my provincial taxes until these companies pay theirs,\\" Swann said. \\"I urge others to join me. Our government shouldn't have one set of rules for their corporate friends, and another for the rest of us Albertans.\\" * Marche restaurateurs, 2020 Restaurant owners in the Marche region of Italy, suffering under mandated closures due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, launched a tax strike in April 2020. \\"We are going on a tax strike because we can't pay because our businesses are closed forcibly,\\" said strike organizer Lucio Pompili. *  References  External links * An International History of War Tax Resistance National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee * History of War Tax Resistance War Resisters League Category:Tax resistance Category:History of taxation ","title":"List of historical acts of tax resistance"},{"id":"4849035","text":"William Phipps Blake (June 1, 1826 ‚Äì May 22, 1910) was an American geologist, mining consultant, and educator. Among his best known contributions include being the first college trained chemist to work full-time for a United States chemical manufacturer (1850), and serving as a geologist with the Pacific Railroad Survey of the Far West (1853‚Äì1856), where he observed and detailed a theory on erosion by wind-blown sand on the geologic formations of southern California, one of his many scientific contributions. He started several western mining enterprises that were premature, including a mining magazine in the 1850s and the first school of mines in the Far West in 1864. From the 1850s on he published over 200 articles, several books, and numerous newspaper and mining magazine columns or short pieces on mining and geology. He served throughout his long career as a mining consultant for mining corporations in every western state and several foreign countries, including Japan. He also served as special ambassador for the nascent science of geology while serving as the United States' principal geologic exhibit commissioner for what now would be called World Fairs, from Paris in 1867, through Vienna and the centennial at Philadelphia, back to Paris in 1878. He ended his long and distinguished career as head of the school of mines at the University of Arizona, 1895‚Äì1905, remaining in an active emeritus status until his death. Life =Education= William Phipps Blake was born in New York City, entered Yale in 1846 under the guidance of Benjamin Silliman, Sr., and graduated in 1852, one of seven to get the newly created Ph.B. degree. (Although Blake has often been credited with graduation from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School, he graduated before it acquired that name.) =Career= Silliman helped Blake with his first appointments. Before graduation, Isaac Tyson, an early mining developer, hired Blake to work in his Baltimore Chrome Works, the largest of their kind at the time. Thus, Robert V. Bruce in The Launching of Modern American Science (p. 144) credits Blake as \\"the first college-trained chemist employed full-time in American industry.\\" Silliman later drew Blake away to help collect specimens for a mineral exhibit in New York, a path he would take many times over the ensuing decades. Benjamin Silliman's descriptions of the collection in an 1854 article in the Mining Magazine reveals Blake's travels from the gold belt in the southern Appalachians to up-state New York and New England. He was quickly becoming one of the most informed geologists in the country. One result was an honorary M.A. from Dartmouth in 1863. Through his Yale contacts and Spencer Baird of the Smithsonian Institution, he was selected as mineralogist and geologist of the Pacific Railroad Exploring Expedition of 1853, exploring a railroad route in southern California. He with Lt. John G Parke identified the San Gorgonio Pass as the best railroad route to the coast, which it became with the building of the Southern Pacific railroad twenty-four years later. More importantly to geologists, Blake saw the erosive power of wind-blown sand in the pass and contributed to the significant scientific debates about mountain building. Biographer David B. Dill, Jr. calls the exploration of the pass one of Blake's \\"crowning events\\" in a \\"long professional career rich in scientific and human values.\\" Besides identifying geologic features along the route and exploring the mining fields of California, he was author of several of the Railroad Survey reports, which included his polished field sketches that are now sought after as works of art. He returned to Washington, D.C., then Connecticut, and established a consultant business while also teaching occasional courses at the New York Medical College. From 1856 to 1859, he investigated mineral resources in the area of North Carolina. He established and edited the Mining Magazine (1858‚Äì1860). Learning of the creation of a state geological survey for California, he lobbied for the position and hurried to California, only to lose to fellow Yale graduate Josiah D. Whitney, which began a lifelong enmity between the two geologists. He established a consulting business in San Francisco, travelled to the California gold fields and newly discovered Comstock, and, in 1861, traveled to Japan with another early Arizona geologist, Raphael Pumpelly, to introduce western technology to the shogunate. In 1863, after a side trip to Alaska, Blake returned from Japan to California, took consulting trips including into the new mineral fields of Arizona, and helped organize the first school of mines in the Far West. At what would become University of California, Berkeley, he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the College of California and geologist to the California State Board of Agriculture. The response was less than overwhelming. Clark Spence in his Mining Engineers of the American West quotes state geologist Whitney's not unexpected critical assessment of Blake's school (p. 44): \\"W. P. B. is now lecturing at Oakland to the College boys & they call that a Mining School! This is the era of Mining Schools in the U. S.! Heaven save the mark!\\" Blake's first effort at a mining school ended when the College of California was absorbed by the University of California system. In 1867 he was appointed as a commissioner representing California at the Exposition Universelle (Paris Exposition). His report on the precious metals, forming one of the government volumes on the Paris exposition of 1867, is full of valuable information. He was the first to recognize the tellurides among the products of California, and was also the first to draw attention to the platinum metals associated with the gold-washings of that state. Some of his findings when reported to Whitney, enmeshed the two in continued feuds over primacy of geologic discoveries. Scientific conflicts between these scientists, especially over priority in recognizing potential oil fields tarnished their reputations. Blake, being less of a self-promoter than Whitney, fared poorly in the conflict. Returning to New York and Connecticut, he was a founding member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1871) and contributed to its conferences and \\"Transactions\\" throughout his career. In 1871, friends in the East helped with his appointment as chief of the U.S. scientific corps that visited Santo Domingo. Selected by the Smithsonian, during 1872‚Äì1876, he collected and installed the government exhibit on the mineral resources of the United States for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. As an acting commissioner, he also wrote the article \\"Glass and Glassware\\" in the Report of the United States Commissioners to the Paris Universal Exposition, 1878.William P. Blake, \\"Glass and Glass Ware\\" in the Report of the United States Commissioners to the Paris Universal Exposition, 1878 Vol.3 Iron and Steel, Ceramics and Glass, Forestry, Cotton While busy with these exhibitions and scientific corps duties, during the 1860s to 1880s, he was also a much sought-after expert witness, testifying in court over the geology of mineral deposits. Among the disputes he was called into were the multiple lode theory on the Comstock, the famed Emma mine scandal in Utah, the Silver King mine and Contention mine disputes in Arizona, over tin mines in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and many others. Clark Spence recounts how his desire for the coveted U. S. Mining Commissioner appointment was lost to Rossiter Raymond because of Blake's opinions given in court against a mine owned by one of Nevada's U.S. Senators. Blake's extensive collection of diaries now at the Arizona Historical Society archives chronicle the work performed in the interest of mining corporations. One of Blake's greatest failings was the Walnut Grove disaster in Arizona. In 1886-7, Blake was hired to design a dam and water system for a hydraulic gold mining works along the Hassayampa River in central Arizona. Blake, in conflict with the promoters, quit, but the resultant shoddy work was, by some people, blamed on him, especially after the dam burst in 1890 during an Arizona freshet and several people were killed. Throughout his career Blake taught whenever he could about his passion, geology. In 1885, he was offered and accepted the presidency of the newly- created Dakota School of Mines (now the South Dakota School of Mines, name changed in 1889) in Rapid City, SD. Unfortunately, the territorial legislature reduced the funds for his position, and he declined the move but did send books from his collection to start the school's library. In 1891, the Arizona Territory funded a new university in Tucson and in October 1895 he joined the faculty. From 1895 to 1905 he was professor of geology and director of the School of Mines at the University of Arizona. His students began their careers just at the time of rapid expansion in exploiting Arizona's world class copper deposits. He also served as the territorial geologist and prepared detailed reports on mining for the governor's annual report to the Secretary of Interior, for publication in magazines like the Mining & Scientific Press of San Francisco and the Engineering & Mining Journal of New York City, and in the local press. With his retirement he continued in an active emeritus status at the university until his death; had become recognized and revered for his geologic work and geologic collections, which he donated to institutions across the country; and became a loved Arizona pioneer elected president of the Arizona Pioneers Historical Society (now Arizona Historical Society). =Personal life= In 1855 he married Charlotte Haven Lord Hayes in Connecticut. Their home was not far from the Blake brothers hardware factory at Mill Rock. His uncle was Eli Whitney Blake, who invented in 1858 the popular Blake rock crusher. They retained the home in Connecticut while moving around the West. In 1863 they lost William Phipps Blake, Jr., age 6, in San Francisco, but raised four sons, Francis, Joseph, Danforth and T. Whitney, and daughter Constantia to adulthood. Charlotte Blake died on a visit to Connecticut in 1905. On May 22, 1910, William Phipps Blake died of exposure and resultant pneumonia in Berkeley, California, four days after, and as a consequence of, receiving an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of California.The Mineralogical Record: Biographical ArchiveCunningham, R.

Born in Hy≈çgo, Japan, Sekimoto earned his BS in physics in 1948 and his Doctor of Engineering degree in 1962 at the University of Tokyo. On 11 November 2007, he died after a series of strokes. Corporate career Sekimoto joined NEC, now a globally active Japanese information technologies conglomerate and member of the Sumitomo Group, in 1948. He started his career at the company's Central Research Laboratories, where he advanced to chief of basic research in 1965. In August 1965 he was appointed to a two-year assignment at COMSAT in Washington, DC, where he engaged in research on digital transmission technologies used in satellite communications. On his return to NEC in 1967, Sekimoto was appointed to manage the company's Communications Research Laboratory. He rose to general manager of NEC's Transmission Division in 1972 and, in 1974, was elected to the NEC board of directors. He was appointed senior vice president in 1977 and executive vice president with portfolio for sales in Japan in 1978. In this position, he enhanced the company's sales operations in the Japanese domestic market by creating structures conducive to marketing mass-produced electronics products. In 1980, Sekimoto was appointed president of NEC and launched NEC's C&C; concept for integrating computers and communications, which resulted in significant sales increases. Finally, Sekimoto served as chairman of the board from 1994 to 1998, when he resigned from the post (as well as from his chairmanship of the Keidanren Board of Councilors) to apologize for NEC's role in a scandal involving the Japan Defense Agency, Japan's de facto defence ministry.http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9810/2302.html Contributions to communications technologies Sekimoto, in addition the accomplishments of his corporate career, made significant contributions to the advancement of communications technologies over more than 50 years.http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/about/awards/bios/2004moh.html During his 17 years at NEC's Central Research Laboratories he designed early pulse- code modulation equipment down to the coding and decoding circuitry. During his two years at COMSAT, he set up a communications processing laboratory and oversaw or helped oversee numerous projects covering voice-, data-, and video- processing technologies, including the development of single-channel-per- carrier pulse-code-modulation multiple-access demand-assignment equipment and assigned it the acronym SPADE because \\"the ace of the spades in card games was regarded as almighty\\".http://www.i-ise.com/en/column/column_top.html Later, in the early 1970s, Intelsat commercialized SPADE technology, which is credited with allowing developing countries to join global networks by making satellite communications affordable to them. A time-division multiple access (TDMA) system and an automatic routing system Sekimoto developed were not only hugely significant for satellite communications, but also became indispensable elements of cellular mobile communications thirty years on. Seminal in their day, many technologies and applications Sekimoto worked on at NEC and COMSAT are integral to modern telecommunications systems, and they helped lay the groundwork for the global networks that many societies now depend on. Sekimoto has also authored numerous works, both technical publications and books written for a wider audience, and he has 35 Japanese and five non-Japanese patents to his credit. Recognition for accomplishments Sekimoto, an IEEE Life Fellow and a foreign associate of the National Academy of Engineering in the U.S., has been recognized for his contributions to communications with numerous awards. In addition to its Medal of Honor, the IEEE also awarded him its Alexander Graham Bell Medal, and he is a recipient of the IEEE Communication Society‚Äôs Edwin Howard Armstrong Award. He has also received the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics‚Äô Aerospace Communications Award. He was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour of France in 1995 and an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1996. The Japanese government honoured him with a Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in 1982 and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1997; he was posthumously granted the third degree of precedence in official rank in 2007.Japanese Wikipedia When speaking, Sekimoto invariably credits his mentor, Koji Kobayashi‚Äîalso an engineer who served as president and then chairman of NEC, for inspiring him to pursue his interests. Sekimoto was lately active in promoting research on relations between Japan and other countries and ways to solve Japan's own social problems through his role at the IISE.

Hsu explained in 2010 that his Chinese-language fluency is akin to a \\"third grader.\\" Hsu started skateboarding in the early 1990s and he explained what he was attracted by in a 2013 interview: \\"I remember the reason I started skating was because I saw these kids with green hair and big pants and they looked so stupid, and I wanted to be that.\\" His mother brought home a discarded concrete parking block during his early period of skateboarding and he later regarded the gesture as \\"very thoughtful.\\" Professional skateboarding =1996‚Äì2001: Maple, The Storm and Tilt Mode Army= Hsu's first skateboard deck sponsor was Maple, where he was a team member alongside Johnson, who facilitated his recruitment, Louie Barletta, Chad Bartie, and Chad Knight, among others. After he joined Maple, Hsu appeared in a promotional video for the northern California retail outlet NC Board Shop's clothing line, called \\"NC Clothing,\\" alongside other sponsored riders, such as Gershon Mosely and Pancho Moler. Released in 1996, Montage runs for a duration of 30 minutes and also indicates that Hsu was sponsored by a brand named \\"Sutters\\" at the time. The first Maple advertisement announcing Hsu's professional status with the brand was published in 1999, when he was 17 years old, and featured the tag line: \\"Not another brick in the wall.\\" Hsu appeared in the 1999 Maple video Black Cat, which also featured Johnson and Barletta. Around the same period, Hsu was first sponsored by the Osiris Shoes company, which had rebranded itself after it was first launched as \\"Evol Casuals\\" during the preceding two years. Although he was not yet a professional for Osiris, Hsu appeared in the 1999 Osiris video The Storm. His video part garnered attention for a never-before- seen trick that became known as a \\"Storm flip,\\" in which the skateboarder performs a \\"nollie hardflip,\\" combined with a 180-degree body rotation and \\"late flip\\" (a nollie trick is executed at the front end of the skateboard). In a May 2013 interview, Hsu explained that he is still asked to perform the trick on a frequent basis, but he tries not to perform Storm flips, as they are \\"too busy\\" and he feels embarrassed. Hsu also said that he enjoyed this time period with Osiris, as he was able to constantly travel, including international trips, and participate in the benefits that the company was reaping from market success. Hsu membership of the Tilt Mode Army was first revealed in 2000 with the release of the inaugural TMA video Tilt Mode!. Described as a group of skateboarder friends from the San Jose, California area, TMA's membership also consists of Johnson, Barletta, Matt Eversole, Steve Caballero, and Jose Rojo. =2002‚Äì2006: enjoi and Bag Of Suck= Prior the dissolution of Maple, Hsu joined the enjoi company, which had been started by Johnson, who recruited both Barletta and Hsu, as they were all close friends at the time. Hsu explained that Johnson was primarily interested in Barletta to begin with, but Hsu was later included as part of a \\"package deal.\\" Regarding Hsu's recruitment, Johnson said in a 2013 interview: \\"We stole the fuck out of this guy.\\" Commencement on the production of the inaugural full-length enjoi video commenced after Johnson's departure in 2003. Entitled Bag Of Suck, the video was released in 2006 and features a two- section part from Hsu as the conclusion. With a duration of just under eight minutes, the first section of the part is accompanied by Cass McCombs's \\"Sacred Heart\\", while Sonic Youth's cover version of The Carpenters' song \\"Superstar\\" is used for the second section. Hsu also joined the Ricta skateboard wheel team during the same year. =2007‚Äì2012: Emerica, \\"Epicly Later'd\\" and Stay Gold= Following the notability and success from Bag Of Suck, Hsu underwent significant sponsorship changes, leaving WeSC clothing and Osiris for Emerica, which offered him both a shoe and apparel deal, in 2007‚Äîthe tag line \\"GuessHsu?\\" was used in the promotional material. Hsu revealed in a September 2012 online interview, for the RIDE Channel's \\"Weekend Buzz\\" series, that he was offered a sponsorship deal with Nike, Inc. following the end of his contract with Osiris; however, Hsu declined the offer in favor of Emerica, due to the effect of a questionnaire that he was emailed as part of the recruitment process: > I was asked if I would want to ‚Ä¶ well, I was sent, like, a email > questionnaire, that was like pre-written. Like it seemed just like it was > this pre-written thing, towards ‚Ä¶ like it was totally impersonal. It was, > ah, like, \\"What do you like about Nike? What do you think you can bring to > Nike? What like, ah, blah, blah, blah, blah, bah. Like I don't even know if > it was, like, a serious consideration that I could ride for them, but, yeah, > when I read that thing, like, this was kinda, like, if this is their deal, > then I don't really, I'm not really into it. The Vice web video series \\"Epicly Later'd\\" published its \\"Jerry Hsu\\" episode in May 2007, which is hosted and created by Hsu's friend Patrick O'dell, who was previously a staff photographer at Thrasher Magazine. Hsu received attention after the episode was released, as Hsu shows O'dell his family home‚Äîincluding footage of his parents‚Äîand VHS footage of Hsu skateboarding at the age of 13 years, leading O'dell to use the description \\"child prodigy.\\" Johnson is also interviewed by O'dell and his high regard for Hsu is obvious: > The way that Jerry [Hsu] lives his life is, like, he lives it on his own > terms. He wears what he wants to wear, he sleeps when wants to sleep‚Äîhe does > whatever he wants to do. And, when you're in a \\"business\\" situation, they > either don't like that because they can't do that, or, they don't like that > because it's not marketable, or whatever. He's kind of like an \\"old soul\\" ‚Ä¶ > He's the guy that's younger than you and you look up to him. Hsu released his first signature shoe with Emerica, the \\"Hsu\\" (including a lowtop variation that was released at a later stage, named the \\"Hsu Low\\"), in 2008. Hsu was then sponsored by the MOB skateboard griptape brand in early 2010. Hsu followed up his first Emerica shoe with the \\"Hsu 2 Fusion\\" in 2011, which is a mid-top design that incorporates the Sole Technology invention, \\"STI Fusion Technology\\" (Sole Technology is the parent company of Emerica). Hsu explained in a corresponding promotional video that he prefers the mid-top design because it provides him with ankle protection. The fourth TMA video, Bonus Round, was released in 2009 and also featured other enjoi riders, such as Caswell Berry, Nestor Judkins and Clark Hassler. The following year, Hsu then appeared in his first-ever Emerica full-length video, Stay Gold, for which he skated solely in switch stance during a period in which he sustained significant injuries. Stay Gold filmer Jon Miner identified Hsu's part as one of the most difficult aspects of the video's production in a 2011 interview: > There were a number of challenges, the ones that came closer to the deadline > stand out the most just because of the level of stress. Jerry Hsu's constant > knee/ankle injuries and what direction to take his part in was a pretty > heavy one. Jerry went through hell to film that part, He got ankle surgery > and two or three knee surgeries. He skated switch because he didn't have the > strength in his knee to skate regular. That's how good Jerry is; he filmed > an amazing part on a bad knee going the wrong way. =2013‚Äì2017: Leaves Enjoi and joins Chocolate= New York La La La, a fashion video directed by Aaron Rose and featuring Hsu, was published on the Nowness website on September 25, 2013. Alongside fellow professional skateboarders Austyn Gillette and Josh Harmony, Hsu was dressed in designer garments for the short film, and a portrait of the three was photographed by L'Officiel Hommes editor Andr√© Saraiva. In September 2013, Hsu announced his departure from the enjoi brand. Hsu explained in an interview that was published on October 12, 2013, that his decision was spurred by the departure of longtime brand manager Eversole who, according to Hsu, grew tired of protecting the brand from the profit-driven demands of shareholders. Barletta will take Eversole's place as enjoi's brand manager and Hsu stated: \\"Louie understands what enjoi is all about, so I think they can still make something really great and I wish them the best.\\" Hsu later clarified that he received \\"generous\\" paychecks while he was with enjoi and his teammates, whom he respects \\"very much,\\" were not a factor in his decision, which took a long time to make. He also revealed that the discussions about his departure mostly involved just himself and Barletta, and those conversations were \\"emotional and shitty\\" for him. On November 12, 2013, a video was published on the Crailtap YouTube channel, the official channel of the Girl Distribution Company, in which Hsu is officially revealed as the new professional for Chocolate Skateboards, a sub-brand of Girl. The video skit features Johnson, Mike Carroll, Stevie Perez, Elijah Berle, and Gino Ianucci. Hsu explained in an interview why he wanted to join the Chocolate team: \\"It‚Äôs a family. When I walk into Rick [Howard]‚Äôs office and there are printouts of graphics on the floor and he‚Äôs hand picking them, I know this is where I wanna be.\\" To commemorate Chocolate's 20th anniversary in 2014, O'dell filmed a four-part retrospective for \\"Epicly Later'd\\" and enlisted Hsu as a cohost. In the first episode, published in October 2014, O'dell filmed Hsu with Girl co-owners Carroll and Rick Howard, and also asked Hsu to explain what is important about the Chocolate brand for him: > You just feel an immediate cool, like: \\"Welcome!\\" So everyone's just like, > \\"Welcome to the family\\"-type thing. And all of a sudden, you're just looking > at Chocolate boards, and then you're looking at Chocolate boards with your > name on it. It's like a dream come true ‚Ä¶ Your name's next to Marc Johnson, > Gino Iannuci, Chico [Brenes]‚Äîyour heros! =2017‚Äìpresent: Starts Sci-Fi Fantasy, leaves Chocolate and Emerica= In the summer of 2017 Jerry started a clothing company, \\"Sci-Fi Fantasy,\\" selling out multiple limited releases within hours in early 2018. According to him it is his primary source of income as he has no sponsors for skateboarding by October 2018. Jerry left Chocolate Skateboards in September 2017. In March 2018 his long term shoe sponsor Emerica ended its business relationship with Hsu.https://skatenewswire.com/jerry-hsu-cameron-adair-podcast/ Video games Hsu is a playable character in the Skate video game franchise‚ÄîSkate (2007), Skate 2 (2008) and Skate 3 (2010)‚Äîdeveloped by the Electronic Arts (EA) and Black Box companies. Hsu was selected to film his own introduction for the first installment, and then appeared in the cinematic trailers for all three games. Photography Hsu's photography career has gradually developed since the commencement of his professional skateboarding career. Hsu contributes work to Vice magazineVice magazine: Photo Issue Leftovers ‚Äì Jerry Hsu and, in September 2010, he exhibited a body of photographic work at the Steinsland Berliner Gallery in Stockholm, Sweden under the title \\"Vatican Gold,\\" alongside Ed Templeton, Kevin Long and Jonnie Craig. Hsu's photography project \\"Table For One\\" was published as a zine of the same name in January 2013. Sold by San Jose's Seeing Things Gallery, the zine documents Hsu's obsession with people who eat by themselves and a corresponding Tumblr blog, also of the same name, remains online as of November 2014. Grape Magazine described the \\"Table For One\\" as Hsu's \\"ode to being alone.\\" The Killing Season, Hsu's first-ever photography book was released as a limited edition product (150 copies) in March 2013 by SPA, a publishing company owned by Hsu's friend. The book is based on a Vietnam skateboarding trip, in which a group traveled from the north to the south of the country on mopeds, and was the online video of the trip was released on the SkateBoarder magazine website in mid-2012. The opening of Hsu's solo photographic exhibition \\"The Observable Universe\\" occurred in Los Angeles, California, U.S. on July 2, 2013. The exhibition was held at the Family Bookstore and consisted of eleven curated photographs. Emerica asked Hsu to curate a photography book for the DVD release of the 2013 video Made. Released in September 2013, the 80-page book features Hsu's own photographs, as well as those he obtained from other photographers, including Templeton, Mike Burnett and Brian Gaberman. Hsu then released a zine of photographs (limited to 300 copies) taken of the people who photograph him as a professional skateboarder, titled \\"Our Moment Together,\\" in October 2013 through Deadbeat Club. =\\"Rolling Through the Shadows\\"= Leica Camera AG, a German camera, lens and optics manufacturer, initiated an interview series with skateboard journalist Mark Whiteley (former editor of SLAP magazine) in January 2013. The series was introduced through the company's blog and is entitled \\"Rolling Through the Shadows\\"‚ÄîWhiteley explains in the introduction that he will interview a selection of skateboarders that \\"have gravitated towards Leica M equipment\\", including Hsu and others, such as Templeton and Arto Saari. However, as of November 2014, Hsu was not yet interviewed for the series. Awards and accolades Hsu won the \\"Best Video Part\\" award at the 2007 Transworld Skateboarding awards, for his part in Bag Of Suck, in addition to the \\"Readers' Choice\\" award.9th Annual TWS Awards Best Video Part: Jerry Hsu, Bag Of Suck Transworld writer Mackenzie Eisenhour described Hsu's award- winning part in a 2009 retrospective of the first 10 recipients of the Best Video Part award: \\"This is what Tiltmode looks like when the gloves come off. Jerry, like Heath [Kirchart], is one of the few guys who can finesse impact- heavy skating.\\" Professional skateboarder Jimmy Cao selected Hsu's Black Cat video part for Thrasher Magazine's \\"Classics\\" series. Cao introduced the video by saying: \\"I picked Jerry's part, because he's got good style, sick trick selection, and he's just fun to watch.\\" The magazine called the part \\"gnarly.\\" Personal life Due to the physical toll of his skateboarding, Hsu identified photography as a vocation that he would like to eventually transition into. In 2013, Hsu explained that his body is \\"constantly thrashed\\" and admitted that he is \\"broken.\\" In 2011, on \\"Epicly Later'd,\\" Hsu's mother expressed her opinion of Hsu's skateboarding career: \\"Well I'm happy for him, as I said.

Biography Little is known about Raphson's life, and even his exact years of birth and death are unknown, although the mathematical historian Florian Cajori provided the approximate dates 1648-1715\\\\. He was likely of Jewish and Irish descent. Raphson attended Jesus College at Cambridge, graduating with an M.A. in 1692. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 30 November 1689, after being proposed for membership by Edmund Halley. Raphson's most notable work is Analysis Aequationum Universalis, which was published in 1690. It contains a method, now known as the Newton-Raphson method, for approximating the roots of an equation. Isaac Newton had developed a very similar formula in his Method of Fluxions, written in 1671, but this work would not be published until 1736, nearly 50 years after Raphson's Analysis. However, Raphson's version of the method is simpler than Newton's, and is therefore generally considered superior. For this reason, it is Raphson's version of the method, rather than Newton's, that is to be found in textbooks today. Raphson was a staunch supporter of Newton's claim, and not that of Gottfried Leibniz, to be the sole inventor of calculus. In addition, Raphson translated Newton's Arithmetica Universalis into English. Raphson coined the word pantheism, in his work De Spatio Reali, published in 1697, where it may have been found by John Toland, who called Raphson's work \\"ingenious\\".De Spatio Reali In De Spatio Reali, Raphson begins by making a distinction between atheistic panhylists (from the Greek pan 'all' and hyle 'wood, matter'), who believe everything derives from matter, and pantheists who believe in ‚Äúa certain universal substance, material as well as intelligent, that fashions all things that exist out of its own essence‚Äù.De Spatio Reali, page 2 Raphson further believed the universe to be immeasurable in respect to a human's capacity of understanding, and that humans will never be able to comprehend it.The Closed World to the Infinite Universe by Alexandre Koyre Notes References * External links * Category:1640s births Category:1710s deaths Category:English mathematicians Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Place of death unknown Category:English people of Irish-Jewish descent ","title":"Joseph Raphson"},{"id":"4849096","text":"Aurel A. Babe»ô (11 December 1886 ‚Äì 7 August 1962) was a Romanian scientist and one of the discoverers of the vaginal smear as screening test for cervical cancer. Biography Aurel Babe»ô was born in 1886, in Bucharest. His father, Aurel V. Babe»ô (1852‚Äì1925), was the son of Vincen»õiu Babe»ô; he studied under Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg University and was a chemistry professor at the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Bucharest. His paternal uncle was Victor Babe»ô, co-author (with Victor Andr√© Cornil) of the first treaty of bacteriology. After attending Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School, Babe»ô enrolled in 1905 at the Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, graduating in 1911. He received his Doctorate magna cum laude in 1915 with thesis Cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and experimental study, which was awarded the Hillel Award of the Faculty of Medicine and the LazƒÉr Award of the Romanian Academy of Sciences. After specializing in pathology, he was appointed in 1921 assistant lecturer in the gynecological clinic at Col»õea Hospital headed by Constantin Daniel (1876‚Äì1973). Daniel and Babe»ô conducted the first studies that demonstrated that cervical cancer could be diagnosed via smears, which led some to refer to Col»õea Hospital as the \\"birthplace of cervical smear\\". In 1929 Babe»ô became Assistant Professor at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy, a position he held until 1941. Subsequently he worked at the Center for Diagnosis and Care of Cancer until 1948, and then as a pathologist and researcher at the Institute of Endocrinology. Babe»ô married fellow gynecologist Lucia »òerbƒÉnescu in 1930. They adopted a daughter, who settled in Gala»õi and became an acclaimed opera singer. Babe»ô was 75 years old when he died in Bucharest in 1961. He is buried at Bellu Cemetery. Scientific discoveries Babe»ô and Georgios Papanikolaou discovered independently and almost simultaneously the cervical test now known as the Pap test. Although Papanikolaou is generally credited for the invention of the cervical cancer screening test by cervical cytology, Michael O'Dowd and Elliot Philipp believe that Babe»ô was the true pioneer in the cytologic diagnosis of cervical cancer. He discovered that if a platinum loop was used to collect cells from a woman's cervix, and the cells were then dried on a slide and stained, it could be determined if cancer cells were present. This was the first screening test to diagnose cervical and uterine cancer. Babe»ô presented his findings to the Romanian Society of Gynaecology in Bucharest on 23 January 1927. His method of cancer diagnosis was published in a French medical journal, La Presse M√©dicale, on 11 April 1928, but it is unlikely that Papanikolaou was aware of it. Moreover, the two techniques are different in their design according to Diamantis et al. Even though Babe»ô preceded Papanikolaou, the design of the Pap test belongs to Papanikolaou. This breakthrough in cervical cancer diagnosis has saved the lives of over 6 million women. It is said that Babe»ô was very aware of the great international reputation that Papanikolaou had gained in contrast to his own. In a spirit of recognition and fairness, Romania refers to cervical testing as \\"M√©thode Babe»ô‚ÄìPapanicolaou\\" in honor of Babe»ô.

This term came about after the demolition of the old Cold Storage supermarket building and construction of The Centrepoint in 1982-1983, after which a growing number of teenagers went there to \\"hang out.\\" Origins/sociology Seen as public nuisance, they were labelled the \\"Centrepoint Kids.\\" By 1986, some were sociologically studied with a focus on their personal and family backgrounds. Other similar moral panics that appeared in the Singapore media include the McDonald Kids (early 1980s), the Far East Plaza Kids (1980-3; re-lapse in mid-1990s), the Daimaru Kids (1983-6), and the Marina Square Kids (early 1990s). Most kids started off in Far East Plaza in the early 1980s before migrating to Centrepoint when the building was completed. During its peak period, membership reached above 2000 members (checked through sub-grouping). In a survey done in December 1985 by a group of volunteers headed by Vincent Lam, a police officer with the Singapore Police Force, the youngest Centrepoint Kid interviewed was 10 years old and the oldest was 23 years old. They were easily identified by their outlandish outfits and avant-garde hairdos. While some of the youths had been found committing crimes such as smoking, glue-sniffing, fighting, and shoplifting, most were only there to make friends. However, shopkeepers complained that the youths were blocking passageways at shopping centres and frightening away potential customers. Rehabilitation efforts Lam set up an organisation (later named \\"Youth Challenge\\") to cater to the needs of the so-called \\"Centrepoint Kids\\" and resigned from the police force to concentrate on his efforts to nurture them into socially responsible citizens. Lam managed his social efforts with a team of volunteers, and his successful efforts were highlighted in AsiaWeek, a regional Asian magazine published in Hong Kong. To educate students about social responsibility, Lam visited more than 100 schools to talk about the danger of falling into \\"street gangs.\\" Some school principals had even issued orders forbidding students from forming or joining such groups.

The book is based on \\"Dark Alliance\\", Webb's three-part investigative series published in the San Jose Mercury News in August 1996. The original series claimed that, in order to help raise funds for efforts against the Nicaraguan Sandinista government, the CIA supported cocaine trafficking into the US by top members of Nicaraguan Contra Rebel organizations and allowed the subsequent crack epidemic to spread in Los Angeles. The book expands on the series and recounts media reaction to Webb's original newspaper expos√©. Dark Alliance was published in 1998 by Seven Stories Press, with an introduction by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters. A revised edition was published in 1999. The same year the book won a Pen Oakland Censorship Award and a Firecracker Alternative Book Award. It served as part of the basis for Kill the Messenger, a 2014 film based on Webb's life.  Synopsis  According to Webb, in the 1980s when the CIA exerted a certain amount of control over Contra groups such as the FDN, the agency as well as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) granted amnesty to and put on the agency‚Äôs bankroll important Contra supporters and fundraisers who were known to the US Government to be cocaine smugglers. Later, at the behest of Oliver North, the Reagan Administration began to use Contra drug money to support the anti-communist Nicaraguan rebels' efforts against the Sandinista government. The Sandinistas were hated by successive Democratic and Republican U.S. administrations for the 1978-79 Sandinista Revolution (the overthrowing of the U.S.-sponsored brutal dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua) and for their support of worker and peasant revolutions developing throughout Central and South America. Blandon, a cocaine smuggler who founded an FDN chapter in Los Angeles, was a major supplier for Freeway Ricky Ross. With access to cheap, pure cocaine and the idea to cook the cocaine into crack, Ross established a major drug network and fueled the popularity of crack. By 1983, Ross was purchasing 10 to 15 kilos of cocaine a week from CIA-backed Contra supporter Blandon - according to Blandon. All the while, Webb alleges, the CIA was supporting the Contras supplying him with the cocaine. Meanwhile, the US Justice Department and its agencies - who were aware of the Contra- linked drug trafficking operations of the FDN supporters - derailed local police investigations and blocked the prosecution of the Contra-linked cocaine traffickers. Webb also discusses his experiences writing the investigative series that the book expands on. He notes that the use of the Internet and the uploading of the documents on which his assertions rest \\"made it possible to share [the files the story was based on] directly with your readers. If they cared to, they could read and hear exactly what you had read and heard, and make up their own minds about the story. It was raw interactive journalism, perhaps too interactive for some.\\" The release of the \\"Dark Alliance\\" series on the San Jose Mercury News' state-of-the-art website, complete with images and facsimiles of the copious official US Government documentary record assembled by Webb and his colleagues broke new ground for both journalism and the Internet. Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia enthused that \\"The unlimited space of the Web allowed the Mercury News to move forward into a whole new kind of journalism... the Web... let intelligent readers review the source materials and draw their own conclusions. This step, far beyond the traditional role of newspapers, attracted attention and readers from all over the world.\\" The number of visits or \\"hits\\" to the \\"Dark Alliance\\" website rapidly climbed to 500,000, then 800,000 and topped out at 1,000,000 a day - phenomenal for this early stage of the development of the modern Internet. In October 1996, two months after the release of the series, a Boston Globe reporter wrote \\"that the story was 'pulsing through [L.A.'s] black neighborhoods like a shockwave, provoking a stunning, growing level of anger and indignation. Talk-radio stations with predominantly black audiences are deluged with calls on the subject. Demonstrations, candle-lighting ceremonies and town-hall meetings are becoming regular affairs. And people on the street are heatedly discussing the topic.'\\" \\"Nonetheless, the media slowly turned against Webb and attempted to discredit him. Notably, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times ran articles calling his argument unfounded. The Mercury News originally stood by Webb‚Äôs reporting, but, amidst the denunciations by other news sources, executive editor Jerome Ceppos published an apology for much of the series‚Äô content in May 1997.  Critical reception  Reviewers' opinions of the book were mixed. David Corn, Washington editor for The Nation magazine, reviewed the book in The Washington Post. Corn had previously been critical of aspects of the \\"Dark Alliance\\" newspaper series, and he found that the book \\"reflects the positives and negatives of the original series.\\" He noted that Webb \\"deserves credit for pursuing an important piece of recent history and forcing the CIA and the Justice Department to investigate the contra-drug connection\\", but remained critical of several aspects of the book, observing that Webb's \\"threshold of proof is on the low side\\". Michael Massing, an investigative reporter and associate editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, reviewed Dark Alliance in the Los Angeles Times. Massing found that Webb \\"seems on solid ground in arguing that money from Nicaraguan traffickers ended up in Contra coffers,\\" but observed that \\"the sums involved are in question.\\" He believed that Webb does not demonstrate that the CIA was involved in or sanctioned these activities, but did show that agency officials \\"heard allegations ... but did little to intervene.\\" For the claim that the CIA and the Contras \\"helped to set off the nation's crack explosion, Massing claims \\"Webb's account is at its most shaky\\", and that Webb's overall thesis \\"seems fantastic.\\" He is also critical of Webb's contacts with Ricky Ross's lawyer Alan Fenster, as recounted in Dark Alliance. James Adams, Washington correspondent for the Sunday Times, wrote a largely negative review for The New York Times. Adams was critical of Webb's \\"failure\\" to contact the CIA to \\"cross-check sources and allegations,\\" and concluded that \\"For investigative reporters determined to uncover the truth, procedures like these are unacceptable. Neither the editors of the San Jose Mercury News nor the publishers of these books should have allowed their writers to take such relaxed approaches to a serious subject.\\" One of the most negative reviews was written by Glenn Garvin in Reason magazine. Garvin, a reporter who served as Managua bureau chief for the Miami Herald, was highly critical of Webb's treatment of sources and evidence: \\"No subject is too great, too small, or too far afield for Webb to distort or falsify,\\" Garvin claimed. While Garvin said that \\"a few contra pilots and their associates, particularly on the so-called south front\\" were involved with narcotraffickers, he rejected Webb's account of contra involvement with cocaine trafficking, which he said is \\"almost entirely drawn from the claims of a few Nicaraguan traffickers facing long jail terms who were using a the- CIA-made-me-do-it defense.\\" According to Garvin, Webb substantially overstated both the importance of these dealers to the Contras and their actual role in the cocaine trade.

Publication history  Snake Tales was originally titled The Old Timer and was first published in The Daily Telegraph on 25 April 1974. The initial group of characters featured: The Old Timer, an elderly bloke with a long thirst and a reluctance to shout for beers; The Con Man; The Kangaroo, who constantly avoids being killed for food; the Flyin' Doc; and The Last Lost Tribesman and his Wife, who are determined to stay lost. In July 1975 The Sun News-Pictorial published the strip as a replacement for Les Dixon's Bluey and Curley. Sols gradually added characters including Crazy Croc, Lillie (the Old Timer's distant admirer), a devious butcher, a group of duck hunters, the comic strip didn't make a great impression until the introduction of the character Snake. Snake was first introduced in 1975http://www.snakecartoons.com/school.htmhttps://visualhumor.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/best- of-intro-cartoons-02.jpg and gradually gained greater prominence to the point where the name of the strip was changed to Snake Tales in 1978. The strip has now been internationally syndicated and appears in over 450 newspapers (both daily and Sunday editions) worldwide.

Salisbury's other creations include Lennie the Loser and Fingers and Foes, the latter helping to establish Salisbury in the United States. Allan John Salisbury was born in 1949 in Kyabram, Victoria, after completing his secondary school education Salisbury took a job at the Cyclone Company in Melbourne, where he eventually became the company's advertising officer. It was there that he began working on a comic strip, The Ludicrous Life of Lenny the Loser. He then went to see William Ellis Green ('Weg') at The Herald, who suggested that he get an agent to represent him, recommending Sol Shifrin. Shifrin agreed to represent him but suggested he develop a strip with dialogue. As a result, Salisbury created Fingers and Toes (sub-titled The Little League of Disorganised Crime), an American gangster strip set in the 1930s. It became the first Australian comic strip to be purchased by a US syndicate, Publishers-Hall, without being published in Australia. The strip debuted in March 1974, appearing in the Chicago Sun-Times, Dallas News, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Miami Herald, Vancouver Sun and Winnipeg Tribune. Fingers and Toes, however, encountered a number of problems with its US publishers, including its portrayal of a drunken judge, occasional muggings and US anti-violence campaigns (which resulted in the gangsters guns being painted out). The strip was dropped by mutual agreement towards the end of 1974. Salisbury then created a new set of characters with an Australian background. His strip, Old Timer, made its first appearance in The Daily Telegraph in October 1974. In July 1975 The Sun News-Pictorial included it as a trial replacement for Les Dixon's Bluey and Curley, following Dixon's retirement. Over time Salisbury introduced a range of new characters including Snake, in 1976, who gradually took over the comic to the point where in 1978 the name of the strip was changed to Snake Tales. The comic has been cited as the \\"first new Australian comic since the 1930s\\" and also as \\"the start of a different era in Australian cartooning\\". His work was the basis for the \\"Art and Sols\\" exhibition at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery in late 2006, which in turn formed the basis for the education guide of the same name.Archived 2008-07-30. His strips are held by the Michigan State University Libraries in their collections. In 2000, the American basketball team Rio Grande Valley Vipers adopted his character 'Snake' as their official mascot, the first time an Australian cartoon character has been so adopted. He currently resides in Launceston, Tasmania in Australia.

The Brethren of Purity (; also The Brethren of Sincerity) were a secret societyThey are generally considered a secret society because of their closed and private meetings every 12 days, as mentioned in the Rasa'il. of Muslim philosophers in Basra, Iraq,Al-FƒÅr≈´q?, I. R. (1960), \\"On the Ethics of the Brethren of Purity\\", The Muslim World, 50: 109‚Äì121. in the 8th or 10th century CE. The structure of this mysterious organization and the identities of its members have never been clear.\\"Having been hidden within the cloak of secrecy from its very inception, the Rasa'il have provided many points of contention and have been a constant source of dispute among both Muslim and Western scholars. The identification of the authors, or possibly one author, the place and time of writing and propagation of their works, the nature of the secret brotherhood, the outer manifestation of which comprises the Rasa'il ‚Äì these and many secondary questions have remained without answer.\\" pg 25, Nasr (1964)William Bayne Fisher, Richard Nelson Frye, John Andrew Boyle, The Cambridge History of Iran, Published by Cambridge University Press, 1975, , p. 428 Their esoteric teachings and philosophy are expounded in an epistolary style in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (Rasa'il Ikhwan al-safa'), a giant compendium of 52 epistles that would greatly influence later encyclopedias. A good deal of Muslim and Western scholarship has been spent on just pinning down the identities of the Brethren and the century in which they were active. Name The Arabic phrase IkhwƒÅn a·π£-·π¢afƒÅ æ (short for, among many possible transcriptions, ', meaning \\"Brethren of Purity, Loyal Friends, People worthy of praise and Sons of Glory\\") can be translated as either the \\"Brethren of Purity\\" or the \\"Brethren of Sincerity\\"; various scholars such as Ian Netton prefer \\"of Purity\\" because of the group's ascetic impulses towards purity and salvation. A suggestion made by Ign√°c Goldziher, and later written about by Philip Khuri Hitti in his History of the Arabs, is that the name is taken from a story in Kalilah waDimnah, in which a group of animals, by acting as faithful friends (ikhwan al-safa), escape the snares of the hunter. The story concerns a Barbary dove and its companions who get entangled in the net of a hunter seeking birds. Together, they leave themselves and the ensnaring net to a nearby rat, who is gracious enough to gnaw the birds free of the net; impressed by the rat's altruistic deed, a crow becomes the rat's friend. Soon a tortoise and gazelle also join the company of animals. After some time, the gazelle is trapped by another net; with the aid of the others and the good rat, the gazelle is soon freed, but the tortoise fails to leave swiftly enough and is himself captured by the hunter. In the final turn of events, the gazelle repays the tortoise by serving as a decoy and distracting the hunter while the rat and the others free the tortoise. After this, the animals are designated as the \\"Ikwhan al-Safa\\". This story is mentioned as an exemplum when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one risala (epistle), a crucial part of their system of ethics that has been summarized thus: Meetings The Brethren regularly met on a fixed schedule. The meetings apparently took place on three evenings of each month: once near the beginning, in which speeches were given, another towards the middle, apparently concerning astronomy and astrology, and the third between the end of the month and the 25th of that month; during the third one, they recited hymns with philosophical content.\\"The liturgy of the first night consisted of personal oratory; that of the second of a 'cosmic text', read under the starry heavens facing the polar star; and that of the third night of a philosophical hymn (implying a metaphysical or metacosmic theme) which was a 'prayer of Plato', 'supplication of Idris', or 'the secret psalm of Aristotle'.\\" pg 35 of Nasr 1964 During their meetings and possibly also during the three feasts they held, on the dates of the sun's entry into the Zodiac signs \\"Ram, Cancer, and Balance\\" (which double as the Vernal Equinox, Summer Solstice, and Autumnal Equinox), beyond the usual lectures and discussions, they would engage in some manner of liturgy reminiscent of the Harranians.\\"...the liturgy described by the Ikhwan seems to be more closely related to the religion of the heirs of the prophet Idris, that is, the Harranians who were the principal inheritors in the Middle East of what has been called \\"Oriental Pythagoreanism\\" and who were the guardians and propagators of Hermeticism in the Islamic world.\\" pg 34 of Nasr 1964 Ranks Hierarchy was a major theme in their Encyclopedia, and unsurprisingly, the Brethren loosely divided themselves up into four ranks by age; the age guidelines would not have been firm, as for example, such an exemplar of the fourth rank as Jesus would have been too young if the age guidelines were absolute and fixed. Compare the similar division of the Encyclopedia into four sections and the Jabirite symbolism of 4. The ranks were: # The \\"Craftsmen\\" ‚Äì a craftsman had to be at least 15 years of age; their honorific was the \\"pious and compassionate\\" (al-abrƒÅr wa 'l-ruhamƒÅ). # The \\"Political Leaders\\" ‚Äì a political leader had to be at least 30 years of age; their honorific was the \\"good and excellent\\" (al-akhyƒÅr wa 'l-fudalƒÅ) # The \\"Kings\\" ‚Äì a king had to be at least 40 years of age; their honorific was the \\"excellent and noble\\" (al-fudalƒÅ' al-kirƒÅm) # The \\"Prophets and Philosophers\\" ‚Äì the most aspired-to, the final and highest rank of the Brethren; to become a Prophet or Philosopher a man had to be at least 50 years old; their honorific compared them to historical luminaries such as Jesus, Socrates, or Muhammad who were also classified as Kings; this rank was the \\"angelic rank\\" (al-martabat al-malakiyya).pg 36, Neton 1991 Identities There have been a number of theories as to the authors of the Brethren. Though some members of the Ikhwan are known, it is not easy to work out exactly who, or how many, were part of this group of writers. The members referred to themselves as \\"sleepers in the cave\\" (Rasail 4th, p. 18); a hidden intellectual presence. In one passage they give as their reason for hiding their secrets from the people, not as fear of earthly violence, but as desire to protect their God-given gifts from the world (Rasail 4th, p. 166). Yet they were well aware that their esoteric teachings might provoke unrest, and the various calamities suffered by the successors of the Prophet may have seemed good reason to remain hidden. =Ismaili theories on the Brethren= Among the Isma'ili groups and missionaries who favored the Encyclopedia, authorship was sometimes ascribed to one or another \\"Hidden Imam\\"; this theory is recounted in al-Qifti's biographical compendium of philosophers and doctors, the \\"Chronicle of the Learned\\" (AkhbƒÅr al-HukamƒÅ or TabaqƒÅt-al-HukamƒÅ).pg 193 of Lane-Poole's Studies in a Mosquepg. 25 of Nasr 1964pg 1; \\"It can be easily understood too that the IsmƒÅ'ilis, among whom the Rasa'il enjoyed a quasi- canonical authority, ascribed to someone or other of their \\"Hidden Imams\\".\\" Here Stern is drawing upon Dr. H. HamdƒÅnƒ´'s \\"The Rasail Ikhwan al-Safa in the Ismaili Literature\\", published in Der Islam in 1936. Compare also this quote from pg 7 of the \\"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research\\" (by A. L. Tibawi,as published in volume 2 of The Islamic Quarterly in 1955; pgs. 28‚Äì46): \\"It tends, however, to prove one thing, namely, that theRasa'il were popular with later Isma'ili missionaries who read, copied, and summarized them to suit their own purpose. But, as stated above, it has yet to be proved that Isma'ili bent of the tracts and of the genuine ar-RisƒÅla al-JƒÅmi'a was itself a proof of early Isma'ili connexion. Indeed, the tracts speak in two voices on this Isma'ili bent.\\" Stern (1947) Some modern scholars have argued for an Ismaili origin to the writings. Ian Richard Netton writes in \\"Muslim Neoplatonists\\" (London, 1982, p. 80) that: \\"The Ikhwan's concepts of exegesis of both Quran and Islamic tradition were tinged with the esoterism of the Ismailis.\\" Whilst according to Yves Marquet, \\"It seems indisputable that the Epistles represent the state of Ismaili doctrine at the time of their compositions\\" (vide, \\"Encyclopaedia of Islam\\", 1960, p. 1071) Bernard Lewis in \\"The Origins of Ismailism\\" (London, 1940, p. 44) was more cautious than Fyzee, ranking the Epistles among books which, though \\"closely related to Ismailism\\" may not actually have been Ismaili, despite their batini inspiration. Ibn Qifti (d.646/1248), reporting in the 7th/13th century in \\"Tarikh-i Hukama\\" (p. 82) that, \\"Opinions differed about the authors of the Epistles. Some people attributed to an Alid Imam, proffering various names, whereas other put forward as author some early Mutazilite theologians.\\" Among the Syrian Ismailis, the earliest reference of the Epistles and its relation with the Ismailis is given in \\"Kitab Fusul wa'l Akhbar\\" by Nurudin bin Ahmad (d. 233/849). Another important work, \\"al-Usul wa'l-Ahakam\\" by Abul-Ma'ali Hatim bin Imran bin Zuhra (d. 498/1104), writes that, \\"These da'is, and other da'is with them, collaborated in composing long Epistles, fifty-two in number, on various branches of learning.\\"quoted by Arif Tamir in \\"Khams Rasa'il Ismailiyya\\" (Salamia, 1956, p. 120) It implies the Epistles being the product of the joint efforts of the Ismaili da'is. Among the Yemenite traces, the earliest reference of the Epistles is found in the fragments of \\"Sirat Ibn Hawshab\\" by Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, who writes, \\"He (Imam Taqi Muhammad) went through many a difficulty and fear and the destruction of his family, whose description cannot be lengthier, until he issued (ansa'a) the Epistles and was contacted by a man called Abu Gafir from among his dais. He charged him with the mission as was necessary and asked him to keep his identity concealed.\\" This source not only asserts the connection of the Epistles with the Ismailis, but also indicates that the Imam himself was not the sole author (sahibor mu'allif), but only the issuer or presenter (al-munsi). It suggests that the text of the philosophical deliberations was given a final touching by the Imam, and the approved text was delivered to Abu Gafir to be forwarded possibly to the Ikhwan in Basra secretly. Since the orthodox circles and the ruling power had portrayed a wrong image of Ismailism, the names of the compilers were concealed. The prominent members of the secret association seem to be however, Abul Hasan al-Tirmizi, Abdullah bin Mubarak, Abdullah bin Hamdan, Abdullah bin Maymun, Sa'id bin Hussain etc. The other Yemenite source connecting the Epistles with the Ismailis was the writing of the Tayyibi da'i al-mutlaq Ibrahim ibn al-Husayn al-Hamidi (d. 557/1162), who wrote \\"Kanz ul-Walad.\\" After him, there followed \\"al-Anwar ul- Latifa\\" by Muhammad ibn Tahir (d. 584/1188), \\"Tanbih al-Ghafilin\\" by Hatim ibn Ibrahim al-Hamidi (d. 596/1199), \\"Damigh al-Batil wa hatf ul-Munaazil\\" by Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid al-Anf (d. 612/1215), \\"Risalat al-Waheeda\\" by al- Hussayn inn Ali al-Anf (d. 667/1268) and \\"Uyun'ul-Akhbar\\" by Idris Imad al-Din (d. 872/1468) etc. =al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´= Al-Qifti, however, denigrates this account and instead turns to a comment he discovered, written by Ab≈´ HayyƒÅn al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´ (d. 1023) in his KitƒÅb al-ImtƒÅ' wa'l-Mu'ƒÅnasa (written between 983 and 985),pg 345, Hamdani a collection of 37 s√©ances at the court of Ibn Sa'dƒÅn, vizier of the Buyid ruler Samsam al-Dawla. Apparently, al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´ was close to Zaid ibn Rifa'a, praising his intellect, ability and deep knowledge ‚Äì indeed, he had dedicated his KitƒÅb as-Sadiq wa 'l-Sadaqa to Zaid ‚Äì but he was disappointed that Zaid was not orthodox or consistent in his beliefs, and that he was, as Samuel Miklos Stern puts it: For many years, this was the only account of the authors' identities, but al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s comments were second-hand evidence and so unsatisfactory; further, the account is incomplete, as Abu Hayyan mentions that there were others besides these 4.348, Hamdani This situation lasted until al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s KitƒÅb al-ImtƒÅ' wa'l-Mu'ƒÅnasa was published in 1942.pg. 3, Stern 1947 This publication substantially supported al-Qifti's work, although al-Qifti apparently toned down the description and prominence of al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s charges that the Brethren were Batiniyya, an esoteric Ismaili sect and thus heretics, possibly so as to not tar his friend Zaid with the same brush. Stern derives a further result from the published text of the KitƒÅb al-ImtƒÅ wa 'l-Mu'anasa, pointing out that a story al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´ ascribes to a personal meeting with Qadi Abu'l-Hasan 'Alƒ´ b. HƒÅr≈´n az-ZanjƒÅni, the founder of the group, appears in almost identical form in one of the epistles.pg. 4, Stern 1947 While neat, Stern's view of things has been challenged by Tibawi, who points out some assumptions and errors Stern has made, such as the relationship between the story in al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s work and the Epistles; Tibawi points out the possibility that the story was instead taken from a third, independent and prior source.pg 12-13 of \\"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research\\", by A. L.Tibawi, as published in volume 2 of The Islamic Quarterly in 1955;pgs. 28‚Äì46 Al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s testimony has also been described as thus: The last contemporary source comes from the surviving portions of the KitƒÅb Siwan al-Hikma (c. 950) by Abu Sulaiman al-Mantiqi (al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´'s teacher; 912-985),349, Hamdani which was a sort of compendium of biographies; al-Mantiqi is primarily interested in the Brethren's literary techniques of using parables and stories, and so he says only this little before proceeding to give some extracts of the Encyclopedia: al-Maqdisƒ´ was previously listed in the Basra group of al-Tawhƒ´dƒ´; here Stern and Hamdani differ, with Stern quoting Mantiqi as crediting Maqdisi with 52 epistles, but Hamdani says \\"By the time of al-Man·π≠iqƒ´, the RasƒÅ'ƒ´l were almost complete (he mentions 51 tracts).\\"350, Hamdani The second near-contemporary record is another comment by Shahraz≈´rƒ´ as recorded in the TawƒÅrikh al-HukamƒÅ or alternatively, the Taw√°rykh al-Hokam√°; specifically, it is from the Nuzhat al-arwah, which is contained in the TawƒÅrikh, which states: Hamdani disputes the general abovegoing identifications, pointing out that accounts differ in multiple details, such as whether Zayd was an author or not, whether there was a principal author, and who was in the group or not. He lays particular stress on quotes from the Encyclopedia dating between 954 and 960 in the anonymous (Pseudo-Majriti) work GhƒÅyat al-Hakƒ´m; al-Maqdisi and al-Zanjani are known to have been active in 983, He finds it implausible they would have written or edited \\"so large an encyclopedia at least twenty-five to thirty years earlier, that is, around 343/954 to 348/960, when they would have been very young.\\" He explains the al-Tawhidi narrative as being motivated by contemporary politics and issues of hereticism relating to the Qarmatians, and points out that there is proof that Abu Hayyan has fabricated other messages and information.351, Hamdani Amusingly, Aloys Sprenger mentions this in a footnote: The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity The Rasa‚Äôil Ikhwan al-Safa‚Äô (Epistles of the Brethren of Purity) consist of fifty-two treatises in mathematics, natural sciences, psychology (psychical sciences) and theology. The first part, which is on mathematics, groups fourteen epistles that include treatises in arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, geography, and music, along with tracts in elementary logic, inclusive of: the Isagoge, the Categories, De Interpretatione, the Prior Analytics and the Posterior Analytics. The second part, which is on natural sciences, gathers seventeen epistles on matter and form, generation and corruption, metallurgy, meteorology, a study of the essence of nature, the classes of plants and animals, including a fable. The third part, which is on psychology, comprises ten epistles on the psychical and intellective sciences, dealing with the nature of the intellect and the intelligible, the symbolism of temporal cycles, the mystical essence of love, resurrection, causes and effects, definitions and descriptions. The fourth part deals with theology in eleven epistles, investigating the varieties of religious sects, the virtue of the companionship of the Brethren of Purity, the properties of genuine belief, the nature of the Divine Law, the species of politics, and the essence of magic. They define a perfect man in their Rasa'il as \\"of East Persian derivation, of Arabic faith, of Iraqi, that is Babylonian, in education, Hebrew in astuteness, a disciple of Christ in conduct, as pious as a Syrian monk, a Greek in natural sciences, an Indian in the interpretation of mysteries and, above all a Sufi or a mystic in his whole spiritual outlook\\". There are debates on using this description and other materials of Rasa'il that could help with determination of the identity, affiliation (with Ismaili, Sufism, ...), and other characteristics of Ikhwan al-Safa.Seyyed Hossein Nasr, An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines: Conceptions of Nature and Methods Used for Its Study by the IkhwƒÅn Al-·π¢afƒÅ º, Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, and Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ, Edition: revised, Published by SUNY Press, 1993, .

It breeds in highlands from southern Mexico south to northwestern Bolivia. It is sometimes considered to be conspecific with the similar warbling vireo. The adult brown-capped vireo is 12‚Äì12.7 cm in length and weighs 12 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a brown crown. There is a brown line from the bill through the eyes, and a white supercilium. The face and throat are off-white, and the underparts are otherwise yellow with some olive on the flanks. Young birds are buff-brown above with a weaker supercilium. The brown-capped vireo has a sharp call and the song is a rich warbled here you see me hear me sing so sweet, reminiscent of that of the warbling vireo. This vireo occurs in the canopy and middle levels of light woodland, the edges of forest, and other semi-open habitats at altitudes from 500 to 2500 m.Hilty (2003), Strewe & Navarro (2004) Brown-capped vireos feed on caterpillars and other insects gleaned from tree foliage. They also eat small fruits. They will join mixed- species feeding flocks. The nest is undescribed. Footnotes References * Hilty, Steven L. (2003): Birds of Venezuela.

He was a member of the Italo-Norman Drengot family which dominated the Principality of Capua for most of the century between 1050 and 1150. Ranulf's wife, Matilda, was the sister of King Roger II of Sicily. Ranulf II was the son of Robert, count of Alife and Caiazzo. and Gaitelgrima. His grandfather was Ranulf I of Caiazzo, a brother of Prince Richard I of Capua. His great-grandfather was Asclettin, count of Acerenza. Asclettin was a brother of the Ranulf Drengot, the first Norman fiefholder in Italy. As the third Ranulf in his family, Ranulf of Alife is sometimes called \\"Ranulf III\\". Rise to influence In July 1127, Duke William II of Apulia died.Matthew, p. 31 Count Roger II of Sicily believed that the duchy passed to him. However, this was opposed by many of the largely Norman nobility on the mainland, and in this they had the support of Pope Honorius II. A rallying-point for this opposition might have been the only other independent prince in southern Italy, Count Jordan of Ariano, but he also died on 12 August 1127. His heir was the short-lived Prince Jordan II but, on his death in November, his son Robert II of Capua became Prince.Matthew, p. 32 His leading lord was Ranulf of Alife. In December, Honorius visited Capua, a longtime papal ally, and there organised the resistance to Roger's claim, recruiting both Ranulf and Robert to his cause. He promised them that all who took part in the campaign against Roger would earn remission of their sins.Houben, p. 46 Robert's leadership was less than stellar and Ranulf was soon the effective military leader of the opposition. When Roger arrived on the peninsula with an army, Ranulf tried to organise resistance, especially in Troia, but gave up when Roger threatened to invade his lands.Houben, p. 47 Eventually, the rebels' negotiations with Roger led to a truce by which Honorius invested Roger as Duke of Apulia and Calabria in August 1128. Ranulf appeared loyal to Roger after his coronation as King of Sicily on 30 December 1130. In 1131, he and Robert took a force of 200 knights at Roger's bequest to Rome in a show of force in support of Antipope Anacletus II. However, while Ranulf was away at Rome, his wife, Matilda, along with her son, fled to her brother Roger in Salerno alleging marital cruelty. Roger summoned Ranulf to court but he refused to appear.Houben, p. 61 Roger was particularly concerned with Ranulf thinking he could carry on much as he had always done in or near his own power-base. Roger was forced by his vassal's contumacy and perfidy to annex the county of Avellino from Richard, Ranulf's brother. Ranulf demanded the restitution of both wife and comital title. Both were denied and Ranulf left Rome, against orders. Roger gave him the opportunity to submit to a formal proceeding at Salerno, but Ranulf instead went to Robert, who also left Rome, and the two began planning another insurrection. Rebel leader Southern Italy in 1112. Numerous smaller city- states, usually under the suzerainty or vassalage of the larger states, are not shown. The two great battles of Ranulf's generalship are shown: Rignano and Nocera, indicated by crossed sabres.Soon most of the peninsular baronage was behind the rebel leaders. Roger II was distracted temporarily by a rebellion in Apulia, but with the surrender of Grimoald, Prince of Bari, he could turn to face the Capuan renegades. They took Benevento, an ally of both pope and king, and turned towards Roger's royal army. Roger moved to besiege Nocera, but was met by the rebel army: Robert on the left, Ranulf on the right. On 24 July, the armies met at the Battle of Nocera. The rebels were victorious and Roger fled. A large army under Lothair of Germany was expected, but instead the Emperor left Italy after his coronation, despite Ranulf's attendance. Therefore, that year, 1133, Roger was able to return to the peninsula from his stronghold in Sicily and reverse many of the rebel successes. But new revolts opened up. Ranulf supported Tancred of Conversano with men under Roger of Plenco, but otherwise, kept a lower profile, awaiting reinforcements from Pisa and Genoa. Ranulf failed to deliver Nocera from a siege and Robert of Capua fled north. By June 1134, Ranulf's own supporters had melted away and he was forced to make peace with the king. According to Alexander of Telese, the two kissed and embraced such that \\"those that were present were seen to be shedding tears for very joy.\\" Ranulf's gains since the outbreak of rebellion were taken back, but his wife and son returned to him amicably (his cruelty being apparently not so egregious). In 1135, a Pisan fleet with Robert of Capua laid anchor in Naples. With rumours of Roger's death circulating, Ranulf joined Robert and Duke Sergius VII of Naples in that city and prepared for a siege. In 1136, Lothair II and the duke of Bavaria, Henry the Proud, descended the peninsula to support the three rebels. Ranulf, with Robert and Henry, took a large contingent of troops to besiege the peninsular capital of the kingdom, Salerno. Salerno surrendered and the large army of Germans and Normans marched to the very south of Apulia. Having thus left most of southern Italy under his control, Lothair decided to appoint a new duke of Apulia and since Robert and Sergius were already powerful potentates, Ranulf was raised to that position. Lothair claimed the right to investiture, but so did Pope Innocent II; the former on the grounds that Emperor Henry III had appointed Drogo of Hauteville in 1047 and the latter on the grounds that Pope Nicholas II had raised Robert Guiscard to ducal status in 1059. Together, pope and emperor handed power to Ranulf in Salerno and the Germans departed for home, leaving Ranulf to defend his hard-won duchy. Ranulf accompanied the emperor as far as Aquino and received 800 knights for his fight. Dukedom and death On 30 October 1137, at the Battle of Rignano, Ranulf met his chief foe, Roger's son Roger, whom the king had named as Duke of Apulia in 1134. Though the younger Roger fought valiantly, the elder fled the field and their ally, Sergius VII of Naples, died in the fray. Rignano was the second great victory of Ranulf over Roger (after Nocera), but it, like the first, had no lasting effect. Roger's campaign of 1138 was a failure and Ranulf for a moment appeared secure in his title, even without Salerno. However, Ranulf fell sick with fever at Troia, his capital, and died on 30 April 1139. He was buried in the cathedral of that city, whence Roger exhumed him and threw him in a ditch, only to later rebury him decently. While the modern scholar John Julius Norwich says that \\"the sorrow that attended his death was more than he deserved\\", the contemporary chronicler Falco of Benevento records that the death of this virum bellicosum et magnanimum (\\"bellicose and magnanimous man\\") was accompanied by the wailing of virgins and tearing of hair.

Some such objects are abstractions, literary concepts, or fictional scenarios. Closely related are intentional objects, which are what thoughts and feelings are about, even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts about unicorns, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled).Tim Crane - Intentional Objects However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment). Mathematical objects Mathematics and geometry describe abstract objects that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are objects of the mind. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations. Many more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the Klein bottleBurger, E. B., & Starbird, M., \\"A One-Sided, Sealed Surface‚ÄîThe Klein Bottle\\", in E. B. Burger, M. Starbird, T. Stonebarger, & T. Dunton, Joy of Thinking: The Beauty and Power of Classical Mathematical Ideas (Chantilly, VA: The Teaching Company, 2003). is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the M√∂bius strip).Ben-Menahem, A., Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences (New York: Springer, 2009), p. 2029. Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary. Logical sequences If-then arguments posit logical sequences that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a counterfactual argument proposes a hypothetical or subjunctive possibility which could or would be true, but might not be false. Conditional sequences involving subjunctives use intensional language, which is studied by modal logic,Modal Logic. Springer Online Reference Works. whereas classical logic studies the extensional language of necessary and sufficient conditions. In general, a logical antecedent is a sufficient condition, and a logical consequent is a necessary condition (or the contingency) in a logical conditional. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as material conditionals. In contrast, indicative conditionals, sometimes known as non-material conditionals,Payne, W. Russ The non-material conditional attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals. Truth tables for if- then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. Strict conditionals assign a positive truth-value to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind. =False antecedent= A false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.Murray, R., with Walker, J. J., & Wheeler, G. B., Murray's Compendium of Logic‚Äîwith an Accurate Translation, and a Familiar Commentary (Dublin: M. W. Rooney, 1852; London: Simpkin and Marshall, 1852), pp. 150‚Äì151. The subjects of literature are sometimes false antecedents. For instance, the contents of false documents, the origins of stand-alone phenomena, or the implications of loaded words. Moreover, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as \\"nothing\\", or \\"nonexistent\\", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.Nickerson, R. S., Conditional Reasoning: The Unruly Syntactics, Semantics, Thematics, and Pragmatics of \\"If\\" (Oxford & New York: Oxford University Press, 2015), pp. 5‚Äì258. Art and acting often portray scenarios without any antecedent other than an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods and goddesses. =False consequent= A false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a non sequitur, which literally means out of sequence. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent. As an example, the name of a team, a genre, or a nation is a collective term applied ex post facto to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by consensus or reference, but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different social or political significance. Philosophy =Nonexistent objects= In metaphysics and ontology, Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a \\"theory of objects\\". He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects. Starting with the \\"principle of intentionality\\", mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object. People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist. Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever‚Äîif not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\"Nonexistent Objects: Historical Roots\\", 2006. =Philosophy of mind= In philosophy of mind, mind‚Äìbody dualism is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by Ren√© Descartes in Meditations on First Philosophy. Invented sources Many objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is based on an imaginary book. In the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien's characters name the Red Book of Westmarch as the source material for The Lord of the Rings, which they describe as a translation. But the Red Book of Westmarch is a fictional document that chronicles events in an imaginary world. One might imagine a different translation, by another author. Convenient fictions Social reality is composed of many standards and inventions that facilitate communication, but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, money is an object of the mind which currency represents. Similarly, languages signify ideas and thoughts. Objects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, acting is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. Charades is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts. Imaginary personalities and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the verisimilitude of fictional universes, and/or the immersion of role-playing games. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames. Science fiction is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed. Calendar dates also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In The Transformers: The Movie, which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, \\"It is the year 2005.\\" In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, The Transformers: The Movie is retro-futuristic. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change. Deliberate invention also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of deception is usually referred to as lying, in contrast to invention for entertainment or art. Invention is also often applied to problem solving. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the mental invention of fictions. Convenient fictions also occur in science. Science The theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere objects of the mind by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include phlogiston and ptolemaic epicycles. This raises questions, in the debate between scientific realism and instrumentalism about the status of current posits, such as black holes and quarks. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct? The situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose‚Äîconvenient fictions. Examples include field lines, centers of gravity, and electron holes in semiconductor theory. Self-reference A reference that names an imaginary source is in some sense also a self-reference. A self- reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference. In their respective imaginary worlds the Necronomicon, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the Red Book of Westmarch are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to pretend or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.

V. A. Ivanov, in The Alleged Founders of Ismailism (Bombay, 1946), says that \\"I would be inclined to think that this was a kind of camouflage story being circulated by the Ismailis to avoid the book being used as a proof of their orthodoxy.

While it is generally accepted that it was the group who authored at least the 52 rasa'il,Unsurprisingly, other authors have been proposed: \\"Between these two extremes there have been the views expressed over the centuries that the Rasa'il were written by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, al- Ghazzali, Hallaj, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, or various Isma'ili da'is, or \\"missionaries\\".\\" Nasr (1964), pg 26 the authorship of the \\"Summary\\" (al- Risalat al-Jami'a) is uncertain; it has been ascribed to the later Majriti but this has been disproved by Yves Marquet (see the Risalat al-Jami'a section). Since style of the text is plain, and there are numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often of Persian origin, it has been suggested that the authors of the encyclopedia were of Persian descent.Baffioni, Carmela. \\"Ikhw√¢n al-Saf√¢‚Äô\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), First published April 22, 2008; Retrieved May 12, 2012. Some philosophers and historians such as Tawhidi, Ibn al-Qifti, Shahrazuri disclosed the names of those allegedly involved in the development of the work: Abu Sulayma Bisti, Muqaddasi, 'Ali ibn Harun, Zanjani, Muahmmad ibn Ahmad Narhruji, 'Awfi. All these people are according to Henry Corbin, Ismailis Further perplexities abound; the use of pronouns for the authorial \\"sender\\" of the rasa'il is not consistent, with the writer occasionally slipping from third person to first-person (for example, in Epistle 44, \\"The Doctrine of the Sincere Brethren\\").\\"The Prophets and those of the Philosophers who have the right view...maintain that the body is only a prison of the soul, or a veil, an intermediary path or an isthmus...The sages of India called Brahmins cremate the bodies of the dead, but ignorant and cunning as they are, they do not do it for the reasons I have given. It would be proper to say that the term \\"sages\\" applies to only a few among them.\\" van Reijn (1995), pages 24-25. This has led some to suggest that the rasa'il were not in fact written co-operatively by a group or consolidated notes from lectures and discussions, but were actually the work of a single person. Of course, if one accepts the longer time spans proposed for the composition of the Encyclopedia, or the simpler possibility that each risala was written by a separate person, sole authorship would be impossible. Contents The subject matter of the Rasa'il is vast and ranges from mathematics, music, logic, astronomy, the physical and natural sciences, as well as exploring the nature of the soul and investigating associated matters in ethics, revelation, and spirituality.From the introduction of Muslim Neoplatonists: An Introduction to the Thought of the Brethren of Purity, Ian Richard Netton, 1991. Edinburgh University Press, Its philosophical outlook was Neoplatonic and it tried to integrate Greek philosophy (and especially the dialectical reasoning and logic of Aristotelianism) with various astrological, Hermetic, Gnostic and Islamic schools of thought. Scholars have seen IsmailiSome have claimed that the Brethren were Ismaili, though this may be unlikely because of their very lukewarm embrace of the Imamate and other aspects of Ismailian theology, in addition to the lack of solid evidence in favor of such a hypothesis. * This is not to say that there aren't some suggestive links between the Brethren and the Isma'ili. Heinz Halm notes in his \\"The cosmology of the pre-Fatimid Isma'iliyya\\" (as printed in Medieval Isma'ili History and Thought, ed. Farhad Daftary, 1996, ) that the Sunni theologian Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) asserted that the doctrines of the Brethren were exactly identical to the Ismaili's in one of his fatwas. Halm further notes that Paul Casanova had shown that the infamous Hashshashin had approved of the Encyclopedia and that their missionaries in Yemen even made use of it. Other sects apparently drew upon the Encyclopedia as well: \\"The theological treatises of the Tayyibi Ismailis of the Yemen contain ample quotations from the Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa', and in the 'Uyun al-akhbar by the Yemenite da'i Idris 'Imad al-Din (d. 1468), Ahmad b. 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Ja'far al-Sadiq, the ninth imam and the second of the leaders of the Isma'ili da'wa residing in Salamiyya, is explicitly named as the author as the Rasa'il.\\" (pg 76) Indeed, the respect of some Ismaili was great indeed, some referring to it as \\"a Quran after the Quran\\" (Nasr, 1964, pg. 26). V. A. Ivanov remarks in his The Alleged Founders of Ismailism (Bombay, 1946), that \\"the work is accepted by the Isma'ili as belonging to their religion, and is still regarded as esoteric...\\" * But there are more reasons to reject an identification of the Brethren with Isma'ili, such as the failure of Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani, an extremely important Islamic theologian, to make any mention of them. And other authors agree with this: \\"...the well-known modern Isma'ili scholar, H. F. al-Hamdani, although emphasizing the importance of the Rasa'il in the Isma'ili mission in the Yemen, disclaims Isma'ili authorship of the work and instead attributes the treatises to the 'Alids.\\" (Amusingly, V. A. Ivanov attributes sponsorship of the work to the 'Alids' enemies, the Fatimids, instead, in his A Guide to Ismaili Literature, London 1933) From pg 26-27 of Nasr (1964). * From pg 8 of Tibawi: \\"There is sufficient evidence in the tracts themselves to prove Isma'ili sympathies. Indeed, such sympathies have long been pointed out by Muslim authors, medieval and modern, who tried to turn sympathy into actual relationship. However, the balance of evidence tends to show that such relationship was a later development. There is as yet no proof that the formation of Ikhwan as-Safa and the publication of their Rasa'il was an Isma'ili movement, or even a movement concerted with any of the contemporary agitation of the Shi'a.\\" From page 9: \\"A glaring example of the Ikhwan's independence is their advocacy of the principle that the office of imam need not be hereditary, for they argue that if the desired good qualities are not found in one single person but scattered among a group, then the group and not the individual should be 'the lord of the time and the imam. More surprising still is the denouncement of the belief in a concealed imam as painful to those who hold it and the discredit of the significance of 'number seven' and those who believe in it as contrary to the Ikhwan's creed.\\" * Compare this extract from one of the later rasa'il Netton provides on pg 102 of his Muslim Neoplatonists: \\"Know, O Brother, that if these qualities are united simultaneously in one human being, during one of the cycles of astral conjunctions, then that person is the Delegate (al-Mab'uth) and the Master of the Age (Sahib al-Zaman) and the Imam for the people as long as he lives, If he fulfills his mission and accomplishes his allotted task, advises the community and records the revelation, codifies its interpretation and consolidates the holy law, clarifies its method and implements the traditional procedures and welds the community into one; if he does all that and then dies and passes away, those qualities will remain in the community as its heritage. If those qualities, or most of them, are united in one in his community, then he is the man suited to be his successor in his community after his death. But if it does not happen that those qualities are united in one man, but are scattered among all its members, and they speak with one voice and their hearts are united in love for each other, and they cooperate in supporting the faith, preserving the law and implementing the sunna, and bearing the community along the path of religion, then their dynasty will endure in this world and the outcome will be happy for them in the next.\\" and Sufi influences in the religious content, and Mu'tazilite acceptance of reasoning in the work. Others, however, hold the Brethren to be \\"free-thinkers\\" who transcended sectarian divisions and were not bound by the doctrines of any specific creed. Their unabashed eclecticism\\"No one system satisfied these Brethren. They were too well acquainted with other creeds, and too well trained in the logical use of thought, to accept the common orthodox Islam which had contented the desert Arabs. Yet all other creeds and systems equally appeared open to doubt or refutation. In this confusion they found their satisfaction in an eclectic theory. All these conflicting views, they said, must be only different ways of looking at the same thing...\\" or \\"These fragments of truth were to be found in every system of faith and every method of philosophy; if men failed to detect them, the fault lay in their own imperfect intelligence - it was only the skill to read between the lines that was wanted to build up a harmonious whole out of the fragments of truth scattered about in sacred books and the writings of wise men and the mystic doctrines of saints.\\" Stanley Lane-Poole (1883), pgs. 189, 190. is fairly unusual in this period of Arabic thought, characterised by fierce theological disputes; they refused to condemn rival schools of thought or religions, instead insisting that they be examined fairly and open-mindedly for what truth they may contain: In total, they cover most of the areas an educated person was expected to understand in that era. The epistles (or \\"rasa'il\\") generally increase in abstractness, finally dealing with the Brethren's somewhat pantheistic philosophy, in which each soul is an emanation, a fragment of a universal soul with which it will reunite at death;\\"The world in relation to Allah is like the word in relation to him who speaks it, like light, or heat or numbers to the lantern, sun, hearth or the number One. The word, light, heat and number exist by their respective sources, but without the sources could neither exist nor persist in being. The existence of the world is thus determined by that of Allah...\\" Nasr (1964), pg 54-55 (based on \\"Dieterici, Die Lehre von der Weltseele, R., III, 319.\\") in turn, the universal soul will reunite with Allah on Doomsday. The epistles are intended to transmit right knowledge, leading to harmony with the universe and happiness. =Organization= Organizationally, it is divided into 52 epistles. The 52 rasa'il are subdivided into four sections, sometimes called books (indeed, some complete editions of the Encyclopedia are in four volumes); in order, they are: 14 on the Mathematical Sciences, 17 on the Natural Sciences, 10 on the Psychological and Rational Sciences, 11 on Theological Sciences. The division into four sections is no accident; the number four held great importance in Neoplatonic numerology, being the first square number and for being even. Reputedly, Pythagoras held that a man's life was divided into four sections, much like a year was divided into four seasons. The Brethren divided mathematics itself into four sections: arithmetic was Pythagoras and Nicomachus' domain; Ptolemy ruled over astronomy with his Almagest; geometry was associated with Euclid, naturally; and the fourth and last division was that of music. The fours did not cease there- the Brethren observed that four was crucial to a decimal system, as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10; numbers themselves were broken down into four orders of magnitude: the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands; there were four winds from the four directions (north, south, east, west); medicine concerned itself with the four humours, and natural philosophers with the four elements of Empedocles. Another possibility, suggested by Netton is that the veneration for four stems instead from the Brethren's great interest in the Corpus Hermeticum of Hermes Trismegistus (identified with the god Hermes, to whom the number four was sacred); that hermetic tradition's magical lore was the main subject of the 51st rasa'il. Netton mentions that there are suggestions that the 52nd risalah (on talismans and magic) is a later addition to the Encyclopedia, because of intertextual evidence: a number of the rasa'il claim that the total of rasa'il is 51. However, the 52nd risalah itself claims to be number 51 in one area, and number 52 in another, leading to the possibility that the Brethren's attraction for the number 51 (or 17 times 3; there were 17 rasa'il on natural sciences) is responsible for the confusion. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the origin of the preference for 17 stemmed from the alchemist JƒÅbir ibn HayyƒÅn's numerological symbolism. Risalat al-Jami'a Besides the fifty- odd epistles, there exists what claims to be overarching summary of the work, which is not counted in the 52, called \\"The Summary\\" (al-Risalat al-Jami'a) which exists in two versions. It has been claimed to have been the work of Majriti (d. circa 1008), although Netton states Majriti could not have composed it, and that Yves Marquet concludes from a philological analysis of the vocabulary and style in his La Philosophie des Ihwan al-Safa (1975) that it had to have been composed at the same time as the main corpus. =Style= Like conventional Arabic Islamic works, the Epistles have no lack of time-worn honorifics and quotations from the Qur'an,\\"But in spite of the anthropomorphic image of a Creator sitting on his Throne and looking down on his creation, the thought of the Sincere Brethren repeatedly breaks through the structures of traditional Islamic theology- a fact the numerous Qur'anic quotations (sometimes quite unrelated to the subject under discussion) barely disguise....\\" van Reijn (1945), pg vii but the Encyclopedia is also famous for some of the didactic fables it sprinkled throughout the text; a particular one, the \\"Island of Animals\\" or the \\"Debate of Animals\\" (embedded within the 22nd rasa'il, titled \\"On How The Animals and their Kinds are Formed\\"), is one of the most popular animal fables in Islam. The fable concerns how 70 men, nearly shipwrecked, discover an island where animals ruled, and began to settle on it. They oppressed and killed the animals, who unused to such harsh treatment, complained to the King (or Shah) of Djinns. The King arranged a series of debates between the humans and various representatives of the animals, such as the nightingale, the bee, and the jackal. The animals nearly defeat the humans, but an Arabian ends the series by pointing out that there was one way in which humans were superior to animals and so worthy of making animals their servants: they were the only ones Allah had offered the chance of eternal life to. The King was convinced by this argument, and granted his judgement to them, but strongly cautioned them that the same Qur'an that supported them also promised them hellfire should they mistreat their animals. Philosophy More metaphysical were the four ranks (or \\"spiritual principles\\"), which apparently were an elaboration of Plotinus' triad of Thought, Soul, and the One, known to the Brethren through The Theology of Aristotle (a version of Plotinus' Enneads in Arabic, modified with changes and paraphrases, and attributed to Aristotle);\\"Isma'ilism developed a complex and rich theosophy which owed a great deal to Neoplatonism. In the 9th century, Greek-to-Arabic translations proliferated, first by the intermediary of Syriac then directly. The version of Plotinus' Enneads possessed by Muslims was modified with changes and paraphrases; it was wrongly attributed to Aristotle and called Theologia of Aristotle, since Plotinus (Flutinus) remained mostly unknown to the Muslims by name. This latter work played a significant role in the development of Isma‚Äòilism.\\" From the article at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy first, the Creator (al-BƒÅrƒ´) emanated down to Universal Intellect (al-'Aql al-Kullƒ´), then to Universal Soul (al-Nafs), and through Prime Matter (al-Hay≈´lƒÅ al-≈™lƒÅ), which emanated still further down through (and creating) the mundane hierarchy. The mundane hierarchy consisted of Nature (al-Tabƒ´'a), the Absolute Body (al-Jism al-Mutlaq), the Sphere (al- Falak), the Four Elements (al-ArkƒÅn), and the Beings of this world (al- MuwalladƒÅt) in their three varieties of animals, minerals, and vegetables, for a total hierarchy of nine members. Furthermore, each member increased in subdivisions proportional to how far down in the hierarchy it was, for instance, Sphere, being number seven has the seven planets as its members. Another area in which the Brethren differed was in their conceptions of nature, in which they rejected the emanation of Forms that characterized Platonic philosophy for a quasi-Aristotelian system of substances: The 14th edition (EB-2:187a; 14th Ed., 1930) of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described the mingling of Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism this way: =Evolution= The text in the \\"Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity\\" describes biological diversity in a manner similar to the modern day theory of evolution. The contexts of such passages are interpreted differently by scholars. In this document some modern day scholars note that ‚Äúchain of being described by the Ikhwan possess a temporal aspect which has led certain scholars to view that the authors of the Rasai‚Äôl believed in the modern theory of evolution‚Äù.Nasr (1992) p71: Der Darwinisimuseim X and XI Jarhhundert (Leipzig, 1878) According to the Rasa‚Äôil ‚ÄúBut individuals are in perpetual flow; they are neither definite nor preserved. The reason for the conservation of forms, genus and species in matter is fixity of their celestial cause because their efficient cause is the Universal Soul of the spheres instead of the change and continuous flux of individuals which is due to the variability of their cause‚Äù.See Nasr (1992) p72 wherein the text has been quoted from Carra This statement is supporting the concept that species and individuals are not static, and that when they change it is due to a new purpose given. In the Ikhwan doctrine there are similarities between that and the theory of evolution. Both believe that ‚Äúthe time of existence of terrestrial plants precedes that of animals, minerals precede plants, and organism adapt to their environment‚Äù,Iqbal, Muzaffar Islam and Science (Great Britain: MPG Books Ltd, 1988) 117 but asserts that everything exists for a purpose. Muhammad Hamidullah describes the ideas on evolution found in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa) as follows: English translations of the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity were available from 1812, hence this work may have had an influence on Charles Darwin and his inception of Darwinism.Muhammad Hamidullah and Afzal Iqbal (1993), The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity, p. 143-144. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad. However Hamidullah's \\"Darwin was inspired by the Epistles of the Ihkwan al-Safa\\" theory sounds unlikely as Charles Darwin comes from an evolutionist family with his well-known physician grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, author of the poem The Origin of Society on evolution, was one of the leading Enlightenment evolutionists.Zirkle, Conway (April 25, 1941). \\"Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species'\\". Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. Literature The 48th epistle of the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity features a fictional Arabic narrative. It is an anecdote of a \\"prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a corpse with his bride. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul's pre-existence and return from its terrestrial sojourn\\".

Executable UML supports model-driven architecture (MDA) through specification of platform-independent models, and the compilation of the platform-independent models into platform- specific models.Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 1.5.Raistrick et al. 2004, sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4.  Overview  Executable UML is a higher level of abstraction than third-generation programming languages. This allows developers to develop at the level of abstraction of the application.Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 1.1. The Executable UML aims for separation of concerns. This is supposed to increase ease of reuse and to lower the cost of software development. This also enables Executable UML domains to be cross- platform. That means it is not tied to any specific programming language, platform or technology. Executable UML also allows for translation of platform-independent models (PIM) into platform-specific models (PSM). The Executable UML method enables valuing the model as intellectual property, since the model is a fully executable solution for the problem space. Actions are specified in action language. This means that the automatic generation of implementation code from Executable UML models can be output in an optimized form. Executable UML is intended to serve as executable code as well as documentation. The models are a graphical, executable specification of the problem space that is compiled into a target implementation. They are also intended to be human-readable.  Executable UML building blocks  A system is composed of multiple subject matters, known as domains in Executable UML terms. Executable UML is used to model a domain at the level of abstraction of its subject matter independent of implementation concerns. The resulting domain model is represented by the following elements: * The domain chart provides a view of the domain being modeled, and the dependencies it has on other domains. * The class diagram defines the classes and class associations for the domain. * The statechart diagram defines the states, events, and state transitions for a class or class instance. * The action language defines the actions or operations that perform processing on model elements. =Domain Chart= Executable UML requires identification of the domains (also known as: aspectsMellor and Balcer 2002, section 3.4. or concerns) of the system. \\"Each domain is an autonomous world inhabited by conceptual entities\\"Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. 14. Each domain can be modeled independent of the other domains in the system, enabling a separation of concerns. As an example, domains for an automated teller system may include the following: * The application domain model of the automated teller's business logic. * The security domain model of various issues regarding system security (such as authentication and encryption). * The data access domain model of methods for external data usage. * The logging domain model of the various methods through which the system can or must log information. * The user interface domain model of the user interactions with the system. * The architecture domain model of the implemented of the Executable UML model on the system's hardware and software platforms. The separation of concerns enables each domain to be developed and verified independently of the other domains in the system by the respective domain experts. The connections between domains are called bridges. \\"A bridge is a layering dependency between domains\\".Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. 35. This means that the domains can place requirements upon other domains. It is recommended that bridges are agreed upon by the different domain experts. A domain can be marked as realized to indicate that the domain exists and does not need to be modeled. For example, a data access domain that uses a MySQL database would be marked as realized. =Class diagram= Conceptual entities, such as tangible things, roles, incidents, interactions, and specifications, specific to the domain being modeled are abstracted into classes. Classes can have attributes and operations. The relationships between these classes will be indicated with associations and generalizations. An association may require further abstraction as an Association Class. Constraints on the class diagram can be written in both Action Language and Object Constraint Language (OCL). The Executable UML method limits the UML elements that can be used in an Executable UML class diagram. An Executable UML class diagram is meant to expose information about the domain. Too much complexity in the statechart diagrams is a good indicator that the class diagram should be reworked. =Statechart Diagram= Classes have lifecycles which are modeled in Executable UML with a statechart diagram. The statechart diagram defines the states, transitions, events, and procedures that define a class' behaviour. Each state has only one procedure that is executed upon entry into that state. A procedure is composed of actions, which are specified in an action language. =Action Language= The class and state models by themselves can only provide a static view of the domain. In order to have an executable model, there must be a way to create class instances, establish associations, perform operations on attributes, call state events, etc. In Executable UML, this is done using an action language that conforms to the UML Action Semantics. Action Semantics was added to the UML specification in 2001. The Action Semantics RFP was based on previous work in action languages supporting the Shlaer‚ÄìMellor method. Existing action languages are Object Action Language (OAL), Shlaer‚ÄìMellor Action Language (SMALL), Action Specification Language (ASL), Modified Action Specification Language (MASL), That Action Language (TALL), Starr's Concise Relational Action Language (SCRALL), Platform- independent Action Language (PAL) and PathMATE Action Language (PAL). SCRALL is the only one that is a graphical action language. =Model testing and execution= Once a domain is modeled, it can be tested independent of the target implementation by executing the model. Each domain can be verified and validated independent of any other domain. This allows errors detected to be associated with the domain and independent of other system concerns. Verification will involve such things as human review of the models, performed by experts in the relevant domain, and automated checking of the Executable UML semantics. i.e., checking that the Executable UML model complies with the Executable UML metamodel. Validation will typically involve use of an Executable UML tool to execute the model. The execution can occur either before or after model compilation. =Model compilation= In order to support execution on the target implementation, the domain model must be translated into a less abstract form. This translation process is called model compilation. Most model compilers target a known programming language, because this allows reuse of existing compiler technologies. Optimizing the domain models for target implementation reasons will reduce the level of abstraction, adversely affect domain independence, and increase the cost of reuse. In executable UML, optimizations are done by the model compiler either automatically or through marking. Marking allows specific model elements to be targeted for specific lower-level implementations, and allows for broader architectural decisions, such as specifying that collections of objects should be implemented as a doubly linked list. In MDA terms, the model compiler creates the PSM. The separation between the PIM and PSM in Executable UML disables the ability to round-trip engineer the model, and deters modifications to the PSM.Mellor and Balcer 2002, chapter 9. Executable UML Key Aspects Executable UML defines execution semantics for a subset of the UML. Key aspects of the Executable UML subset include the following: * No support for implementation specific constructs, like aggregation and composition.Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. xxx. * Generalizations are always notated as {complete, disjoint}. * Associations between classes are always named, have verb phrases on both ends specifying the roles, and have multiplicity specified on both ends. * Multiplicities on association ends are restricted to 0..1 (zero to one), * (zero to many), 1 (exactly one), or 1..* (one to many). * Data types are restricted to the following core data types: boolean, string, integer, real, date, timestamp, and arbitrary_id, or one of the following domain-specific data types: numeric, string, enumerated, and composite. Domain-specific numeric and string data types can represent subsets of the core data types. The domain-specific composite data type is to always be treated as a single unit within the domain. e.g., a MailingAddress composite data type could be declared, but city information couldn't be extracted from it. * Constraints on the Executable UML models can either be represented as Object Constraint Language (OCL) or action language.  fUML and ALF  The Object Management Group has standardized the Foundational UML (fUML), which was strongly influenced by Executable UML. Action Language for Foundational UML (ALF), is a standard action language specification by the Object Management Group.

It is located on the south eastern foothills of the Samogitians highland, some north from the Kaunas‚ÄìKlaipƒóda highway. History =Grand Duchy of Lithuania= Raseiniai is one of the oldest communities in Lithuania ‚Äì the name of the settlement was mentioned for the first time in 1253. Its name was mentioned in Chronicles of the 13th and 14th centuries under various names, including Rushigen, Rossyen, and Rasseyne. In 1253 Grand Duke Mindaugas ceded one part of the Samogitia territory, including some of the district around Raseiniai, to the Livonian Order, and the rest to the first bishop of Lithuania, Kristyan. In the 14th‚Äì18th centuries, Raseiniai was one of the most important towns in the Samogitia region. At the end of the 14th century the city became important centre, and its representative participated with others from the region in signing the peace treaty of K√∂nigsberg in 1390. At the end of the 15th century, Raseiniai was granted Magdeburg Rights. In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth the city became important in the region. Government institutions were located there, and it served as a mercantile center for the area. In 1580 the local aristocrats met there in order to choose their representatives to the General Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw. From 1585 Raseiniai served as the permanent location of the county parliament. In 1792 city Magdeburg rights were renewed. =After the partitions of the Commonwealth= Following the third partition of the Commonwealth in 1795, Raseiniai was annexed by the Russian Empire and its city rights were annulled. In the Russian Empire, the town was the center of a Rossieny County. From 1801 to 1843, the county was in the Vilna Governorate, and from 1843 on it became part of the Kovno Governorate. Historically, the chief articles of commerce were wood and grain for export. Because of its geographic position and distance from the railroad and the main highways, it became economically isolated. A fire in 1865 which almost destroyed the town also contributed to the city's decline in the latter half of the 19th century. In 1831, an insurrection against Tsarist oppression began in Raseiniai. On March 26, the rebels took Raseiniai and formed a provisional district government. Within a few days the insurrection spread throughout the entire country ‚Äì and was later known as the 1831 Rebellion. The town long had a large Jewish presence. It was among the first Jewish communities established in Lithuania, and the city, which is known in Yiddish as Raseyn, became known as the \\"Jerusalem of Zamut.\\" Jews continued to settle there in large numbers throughout the 17th century. During most of the 19th century, the greater proportion of the town's population was Jewish and it was a center of the Jewish Haskalah (Enlightenment) movement. In 1842 the city had 7,455 inhabitants, the majority of whom were Jews. In 1866 the town had 10,579 inhabitants, of whom 8,290 were Jews. In 1897 the population of the district, excluding the town, was 221,731, of whom about 17,000 were Jews. After World War I, however, the Jewish community was smaller. By 1926, 2,226 Jews lived in Raseiniai, and approximately 2,000 (40% of the general population) in 1939. During most of the World War I, the town was occupied by the German army. In the spring of 1915, the Germans concentrated Army Group Lauenstein in the area of Tilsit, with three infantry and three cavalry divisions opposing one infantry division and units of border police and Russian volunteers. The Bavarian cavalry division swept through Raseiniai on April 14 en route to ≈†iauliai. Refugees from Raseiniai appeared in ≈†iauliai on the morning of April 15 warning of the German advance. =After World War I= When Lithuania regained Independence in 1918, Raseiniai became a district capital. During World War II, Raseiniai was virtually ruined ‚Äì approximately 90% of the buildings were destroyed. One survivor of the war is the Church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary, which was built in 1782. The remains of the 17th‚Äì18th century monastery buildings also serve as a monument of Renaissance architecture. Tourists invariably pause at The Samogitian statue in the central town square. The sculpture serves as a symbol of the Samogitia ethnographical zone ‚Äì a strong man resolutely stepping forward after having tamed a bear (an allusion to the 1831 Rebellion). On the sides of the base there are three bas-reliefs depicting the struggle against Tsarist oppression. The sculpture, which is the work of Vincas Grybas (1890‚Äì1941), was erected in Raseiniai in 1933‚Äì1934. =World War II= In June 1941, near Raseiniai, roughly 20 Kliment Voroshilov tanks (KVs) of the Soviet 3rd Mechanized Corps met the assault of the 6th Panzer Division, with approximately 100 vehicles. A single KV-2 tank managed to hold off the German advance for a full day while being pummeled by a variety of antitank weapons, until finally the KV-2 ran out of ammunition and was knocked out. Raseiniai was captured on 23 June 1941 by troops of the German Army Group North. On 25 July 1941, the city was placed under the administration of the newly created Reichskommissariat Ostland. Raseiniai was recaptured on 9 August 1944 by Soviet troops of the 3rd Belorussian Front in the course of the Kaunas Offensive. =Famous places= ≈†iluva town. Where to find: John Paul II House, M.

He is best known for his association with Colt Studio which he, using the pseudonym Rip Colt,Blasius, Mark; Phelan, Shane (1997). We are everywhere: a historical sourcebook in gay and lesbian politics. Psychology Press, (and with business partner Lou Thomas) created in late 1967. Thomas parted from the endeavor in 1974 leaving French to continue to build what would become one of the most successful gay male erotica companies in the U.S. French left a legacy of homoerotic images in artwork, illustrations, photo sets, slides, film, fine- art photographs, magazines, books and calendars that presented his work exclusively and set a new standard in photography of men.Falkon, Felix Lance; Waugh, Thomas (2006). Gay Art: A Historic Collection (reprint of 1972 ed.) Arsenal Pulp Press, French began drawing and photographing male erotica in the mid-1960s while working as an illustrator and artist for Madison Avenue advertising agencies. His first published book, Man, was issued in 1972. Other books include Another Man, Jim French Men, Quorum, Opus Deorum, Masc., The Art of Jim French and The Art of the Male Nude. Publication of Colt magazines began in 1969 with the digest-size \\"Manpower!\\". During the 1970s, French began marketing his short films in 8mm format; they were soon collected on video- cassette format, which were remastered for DVD format in the 1990s. French's artwork and photography has been hailed as ‚Äúiconic, groundbreaking, and singularly influential.‚Äù French died in his home in Palm Springs, California, at age 84. Early life French was formally trained at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art from 1950 to 1954 and went on active duty in the United States Army in 1955, having been in the reserves for two years prior to his enlisting. He was honorably discharged from the service in 1957. French settled in New York and pursued a successful career as an illustrator and artist for Madison Avenue advertising agencies. His work appeared in advertisements for Neiman Marcus and other high-end department stores. He also created designs for textiles for the noted designer, Tamis Keefe. French also created a number of portrait drawings for use as album art for Columbia Records. Those portraits included Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mathis, and Maria Callas. L√ºger Studio At the suggestion of an Army contact who had seen some of his early unpublished homoerotic drawings done under the name Arion, he and French formed a partnership to start a mail order company named \\"The L√ºger Studio.\\" \\"Kurt L√ºger\\" became the pseudonym for French. The name was chosen for its implied association with the German Luger pistol. While the Arion drawings had been playful sketches of Fire Island life and similar scenes (influenced by two of his favorite artists, George Petty and Alberto Vargas), the drawings created as \\"L√ºger\\" featured more hypermasculine subjects: construction men, men in leather, surfers, cowboys, wrestlers, and sailors. The first appearance of a L√ºger Studio drawing (two drawings from his \\"Cowboy\\" series) was in the May‚ÄìJune 1966 issue of The Young Physique. Photographic copies of the drawing sets were offered for purchase through mail order and were advertised in various magazines available at the time: The Young Physique, Mars, Muscleboy, Sir Gee, Male Classics, and Fizeek Art Quarterly. These copies were offered as thematic sets of either six or eight drawings. L√ºger Studios also produced four different photographic sets of various male models. To avoid legal troubles, L√ºger Studio offerings contained minimal frontal nudity but were nonetheless erotic and humorously creative in their suggestiveness. French's artwork was favorably received and was commended for its \\"unbridled imagination and a fantastic technique.\\" Colt Studio Eventually French's partner bought out his share of L√ºger Studio, freeing French and a new partner, Lou Thomas, to establish another business called Colt Studio (a reference to American west firearm imagery, although the company soon adopted a logo of a stallion.) Having worked for nearly a year to produce the first drawings and photographs to be offered by the new company, Colt was begun in late 1967. Once more the images were offered in sets of prints by mail and the company quickly became successful. But after fifteen years in New York, often traveling to California to take advantage of the weather and abundance of models, French decided to move west. In 1974 he bought out his partner's share of the business leaving Lou Thomas to start his own company (Target Studio). French made his home in the Hollywood Hills. From the Colt Studio offices in San Fernando Valley, he continued to run the most successful male physique photography company in America, marketing his work to gay men. For thirty-six years, Colt Studio offered the highest quality male erotica commercially available. In 2003, French sold Colt Studio to former Falcon Studios director John Rutherford and his business partner Tom Settle. The rebranded company, \\"Colt Studio Group,\\" continues to operate, adding new content, but with digital rights to the drawings, photographs, and films created by French. Plagiarism of work  One illustration of French's, entitled 'Longhorns - Dance', achieved worldwide notoriety when it was appropriated by the late Sex Pistols manager and fashion designer Malcolm McLaren in 1975 as the basis for artwork for a T-shirt sold through Sex, the King's Road boutique McLaren operated with Vivienne Westwood. Depicting two cowboys facing each other, each naked from the waist down apart from their boots, 'Longhorns ‚Äì Dance' was initially sold as one of a pack of six 5‚Ä≥ x 7‚Ä≥ prints in 1969. Reproduced in the book The Colt Album, published in Britain by John S. Barrington in 1973, its appearance in issue 7 of French's magazine Manpower!, published in 1974, piqued McLaren's interest when he acquired a copy in a shop on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village. McLaren added imagined dialogue between the two figures to express ‚Äúthe frustration and boredom I felt at the time‚Äù. Alan Jones, a friend of McLaren's, was the first person to wear the design in public, and was promptly arrested and charged with ‚Äúshowing an obscene print in a public place‚Äù under the Vagrancy Act of 1824.'They had the shirt off his back', Nicholas de Jong, The Guardian, August 2, 1975 The following day Sex was raided by the police, who impounded shirts bearing the design. Indecency charges were levelled at McLaren. The uproar became a freedom of speech issue when Labour MP Colin Phipps called on Home Secretary Roy Jenkins to review the outmoded law. ‚ÄúIt would appear to me to be more logical for a prosecutor to have to demonstrate a specific public hurt in matters of taste rather than being able to rely on antique laws,‚Äù Phipps wrote to Jenkins.'MP attacks t-shirt charge', The Guardian, August 5, 1975 Despite the outcry, Jones was fined and McLaren was arraigned to appear in court and was also later fined. Subsequently, when the 'Cowboys' T-shirt was worn by members of the Sex Pistols such as Sid Vicious, French's illustration became one of the key visual provocations of the punk movement, though French was not impressed when Westwood continued to reproduce the image with McLaren's dialogue. In 2011, French's spokesman Nat Gozzano told blogger Paul Gorman: ‚ÄúThe whole drawing was simply jacked. The illustration was drawn by Jim French well before McLaren and Westwood made a whole bunch of money (and still do apparently) stealing it.‚Äù State of Man publications French published eight volumes of fine art male photography under his own publishing imprint, State of Man. * Man (1972) * Another Man (1974) * Quorum (1976) * The Art of Jim French: the Nude Male (1989) * Men (1990) * Opus Deorum (1992) * The Art of the Male Nude (1993) * Masc.: The Color Photography of Jim French (1999) Other publications Felix Lance Falkon, A Historic Collection of Gay Art (San Diego: Greenleaf Classics, 1972.)

He is best known for winning the first Daytona 200 race in 1937, riding an Indian Sport Scout. Kretz, Sr. was a rough rider, who strove to finish, and win, every race. He rode #38, usually on an Indian motorcycle. Early life Ed Kretz, Sr. was born in San Diego, California. Unlike many top motorcycle racers who often began riding at a young age, Kretz didn't start riding until he was 20. It was out of necessity during the Depression and a motorcycle was the only form of transportation that Kretz, Sr. could afford. While driving a truck transporting produce to Los Angeles, Kretz, Sr. began attending Southern California motorcycle field meets as a spectator. Eventually, he entered a few races and quickly became one of the top riders. Motorcycle racing career Kretz, Sr. largely dominated the sport for over a decade. He won the first 200-mile Savannah Nationals at Langhorn (1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, and 1948) and Laconia (1938 and 1945). He was voted most popular rider of 1938 and 1948. He raced a 100-lap TT race in Ascot Park, Gardena, California, winning the lap money, the heat race, and the trophy race. Ed ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù Kretz retired from racing in 1959.

His second project, Ayla, was created in 1995 along with the single of the same name: the track became a hit in the clubs and entered the UK Singles Chart at #22 in September 1999. After \\"Ayla's\\" success, Kunzi produced \\"Atlantis\\", \\"Ayla Part II\\" and \\"Liebe\\", which is a cover of the Cosmic Baby classic. Ayla's fifth single, \\"Angelfalls\\", was released in 1999, reaching the top 3 of the German dance chart. In the same year, Ayla released his first album, Nirwana. His remix of Lange's \\"I Believe\\", which was released under the name DJ Tandu, was included in the first installment of Ti√´sto's popular series In Search of Sunrise as well as in Gatecrasher Wet, the third compilation album by Sheffield-based club Gatecrasher. Kunzi went on to produce two more Ayla tracks (\\"Singularity / Brainchild II\\", \\"Sun Is Coming Out\\"), before taking a break on the project in 2002. He has also co-produced for several known successful electronic acts such as Safri Duo and DJ Encore. After putting his Ayla project on hiatus for many years, Kunzi released the digital single, \\"Ayla 2010\\", in 2010. On 23 February 2011, the second Ayla studio album, Unreleased Secrets, was released. Together with friends and colleagues Torsten Stenzel (York (group)) and Ralph-Armand Beck (DJ Taucher), Ingo - as Ayla - released two singles in 2015 'Kings & Queens' and 'Free Yourself'. In 2018 Ingo released his debut Tandu album 'Faces', a collaboration with long-term friend and colleague Ralph-Armand Beck (aka. Taucher).

In late 1999 and early 2000, while touring in support of Orange Rhyming Dictionary (1998), the band debuted new material. Between March and May, they recorded at Inner Ear Studios with producer J. Robbins. The album was the inclusion of piano instrumentation and lyrics sung from the first- person perspective. Though it was pushed back a few times, Four Cornered Night was eventually released on September 11, 2000 through independent label Jade Tree. It reached number 19 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, later going on to sell over 48,000 copies in the US. It received a mainly favourable response from music critics, many of which found it superior to Orange Rhyming Dictionary. The band supported it with two US tours (one following its release and the other in early 2001) and one stint in Japan. Background and production With the addition of former the Van Pelt guitarist Brian Maryansky, Orange Rhyming Dictionary was released in October 1998; multiple tours of the US, Europe and Japan followed. In September 1999, the group performed at the Jade Tree/CMJ showcase in New York City, and a handful of east coast dates around this. At these shows, the group debuted new material. Schwarzenbach spent some time between his apartment in New York City and his mother's farm in Nova Scotia, Canada. He played her upright piano ‚Äì a change from his Roland digital keyboard when working on songs ‚Äì and viewed it as a different way of playing. In February 2000, the group went on an east coast tour; following the stint's conclusion, the band finished working on material for their next album. They began recording it in March at Inner Ear Studios with producer J. Robbins, and finished in May. Robbins was \\"not afraid of the theatricality that the album seemed headed toward. Instead of ducking that, we kind of embraced it\\", according to Schwarzenbach. Composition Musically, the sound of Four Cornered Night has been described as emo in the vein of the Juliana Theory, while the softer tracks were reminiscent of Elvis Costello. The majority of the album featured Schwarzenbach playing a piano, which he had been using for a year and half. Schwarzenbach theorised the instrument \\"changed a lot ‚Ä¶ I think it ended up affecting the songs and making them a little more orchestral, or a little more involved.\\" As a result, it is heard on four of the album's tracks;Martin 2000, p. 32 the inclusion of the instrumental drew a comparison to Summerteeth (1999)-era Wilco. Schwarzenbach's vocals were reminiscent of Cracker frontman David Lowery, and the Psychedelic Furs frontman Richard Butler. A cello is heard on three of the album's tracks. The members spent time listening to albums that were influential to them; for Schwarzenbach: Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) (1969) by the Kinks. While some of Orange Rhyming Dictionary was sung in third-person, a lot of Four Cornered Night is done in first- person. Schwarzenbach explained that \\"felt ready, I felt a growing confidence in myself to tell my story.\\" \\"You're Having the Time of My Life\\" incorporated arpeggios and chord progressions that recalled new wave. Schwarzenbach wrote \\"One Summer Last Fall\\" as an open letter of fans that were still clinging to Jawbreaker. The guitar pop track \\"Air Traffic Control\\" was compared to the Byrds and Fountains of Wayne. The song discusses a fear of flying, and utilizes the guitar riff heard in \\"Ticket to Ride\\" by the Beatles. \\"Pale New Dawn\\", \\"In the Summer's When You Really Know\\" and \\"Empty Picture Frame\\" were reminiscent of 52nd Street (1978)-era Billy Joel, Running on Empty (1977)-era Jackson Browne and Night Moves (1976)-era Bob Seger, respectively. \\"Pale New Dawn\\", as with \\"You're Having the Time of My Life\\", is about a failed relationship. The piano-driven track \\"In the Summer's When You Really Know\\"Martin 2000, p. 33 tackles the theme of love, while \\"Empty Picture Frame\\" is about being lonely and smoking dope. It is followed by the acoustic-based mid-tempo track \\"Little Light\\", which drew comparison to Costello. \\"\\"Your X-Rays Have Just Come Back from the Lab and We Think We Know What Your Problem Is\\"\\" is initially a guitar-and-vocal only effort until the full-band comes in; its guitar parts were reminiscent of Duran Duran. \\"Milk and Apples\\" showcases the rock-centric side of the band's sound, with a comparison to AC/DC. \\"Mid- Day Anonymous\\" was a mix of Pavement and a church organ. \\"*******\\" is an acoustic track in the vein of the Who guitarist Pete Townshend. \\"Orange Rhyming Dictionary\\" included Smithes-esque guitar effects. With its sparse piano arrangement, the closing track \\"All Things Good and Nice\\" was compared to \\"Mother\\" by John Lennon; the track discusses people loving everything. Release and reception Jets to Brazil performing live in April 2001. =Promotion and touring= In May 2000, Four Cornered Night was planned for release in mid-August; by July, it was pushed back to late August due to a manufacturing delay. In early August, the album was delayed again due to a manufacturing error; it was eventually released on September 11. It reached number 19 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, eventually going on to sell over 48,000 copies in the US. Throughout September and October, the group toured across the US, and played a showcase for CMJ. The band were supported by Cave In, Shiner, J Majesty, Hey Mercedes and Turing Machine. Jets to Brazil spent some time recuperating, before on a US tour in April and May 2001 with the Love Scene and New End Original. Following this, they embarked on a Japanese tour in June with Robbins' band Burning Airlines. =Critical response= Four Cornered Night received favorable reviews from music critics. Ox-Fanzine reviewer Joachim Hiller said the album was \\"even better than expected\\", calling it a \\"masterpiece.\\" CMJ New Music Report Tad Hendrickson viewed it as a \\"remarkable follow-up\\" to Orange Rhyming Dictionary, adding that it will \\"surprise many with its honesty and directness.\\" Peter Buchberger of Seattle Weekly said the record \\"challenges the listener\\", leaving \\"no apologies\\" with its \\"sincere, piano-infused anthems that are catchy and raspy at the same time.\\" Rolling Stone reviewer James Hunter said Schwarzenbach's emotions \\"adds up to extremely circular music, bold enough to drive some rock fans mad and to enthrall others.\\" Exclaim! writer Stuart Green said that while the album was \\"a far cry from the aggressive\\" Orange Rhyming Dictionary, it ultimately beats it, \\"at least in terms of songwriting and cohesiveness.\\" Ink 19 Marcel Feldmar said it took a few more plays for the album to capture his attention \\"within its brilliance\\" than Orange Rhyming Dictionary. The minimal nature of the album \\"threw me off at first\\", though thankfully, \\"the intensity is still there, the voice is still there, almost breaking at times, stronger than steel at times.\\" AllMusic reviewer Adam Bregman said Schwarzenbach \\"indulges in the sort of over-the-top sentimentality that is more reminiscent of a lengthy novel by Proust than anything you'd expect from a rock band.\\" Modern Fix found the guitars not as \\"grating\\" as on Orange Rhyming Dictionary, and noted that the \\"tempos are slowed, and Schwarzenbach‚Äôs angst\\" is partially swapped for a cello and a piano. In a brief review for The Stranger, Kris Adams said it was a \\"decent, if disappointing follow-up to a good debut.\\" Track listing # \\"You're Having the Time of My Life\\" ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"One Summer Last Fall\\" ‚Äì 5:03 # \\"Air Traffic Control\\" ‚Äì 2:45 # \\"Pale New Dawn\\" ‚Äì 4:59 # \\"In the Summer's When You Really Know\\" ‚Äì 6:17 # \\"Empty Picture Frame\\" ‚Äì 3:59 # \\"Little Light\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"\\"Your X-Rays Have Just Come Back from the Lab and We Think We Know What Your Problem Is\\"\\" ‚Äì 4:18 # \\"Milk and Apples\\" ‚Äì 2:54 # \\"Mid- Day Anonymous\\" ‚Äì 4:01 # \\"*******\\" ‚Äì 1:23 # \\"Orange Rhyming Dictionary\\" ‚Äì 5:48 # \\"All Things Good and Nice\\" ‚Äì 5:32 References Citations Sources * External links *Four Cornered Night at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2000 albums Category:Jets to Brazil albums Category:Jade Tree (record label) albums Category:Albums produced by J.

It was published in the United States and distributed internationally since April, 1975. Together with the other magazines of the Mavety Group, such as Black Inches, it folded in 2009.See Kit Christopher & Joe Thompson, \\"Mavety Media: The Rise and Fall of Socially Redeeming Content,\\" Unzipped (October, 2009), 10‚Äì11. History Modernismo Publications, Ltd. (MP) were publishers of Mandate, Honcho, and Playguy, popular gay men's magazines. MP was founded in 1974 by George Mavety with the publication of Dilettante, which folded in March 1975. The following month, its successor, Mandate, appeared on the newsstands under the editorship of John Devere. Mandate was conceived as a magazine of erotica, news and entertainment for gay men. Each monthly issue, in addition to exhibiting artistic displays of male nudes and erotic fiction, contained reviews of books, motion pictures and sound recordings of interest to the gay community and reported on social, political and cultural events related to the movement for gay liberation. Joseph Arsenault succeeded Devere as editor. By the time Sam Staggs succeeded to its editorship, following Arsenault, Mandate claimed a circulation of over 100,000 and enjoyed a reputation as the most important gay men's magazine in America. Staggs' dream was to make it the gay equivalent of Playboy. Following the death of editor and novelist Stan Leventhal, the neglected Mandate was revitalized by Doug McClemont. McClemont was appointed Editor-in-Chief during the crucial period of the mid-1990s when gay sexuality was arguably at its most transitional point. The AIDS crisis had altered the way porn and same-sex relations were perceived by the general public.
