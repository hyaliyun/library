It runs from the Town Hall Square in the east to Fasanvej in the west, along the north side of Frederiksberg Town Hall and Frederiksberg Park, linking Gammel Kongevej with Peter Bangs Vej. On the other side of the Town Hall is Bredegade (literally \\"Broad Street\\"), now smaller than Smallegade, which after a while joins Smallegade at M√∏stings Hus, an 18th-century country house-turned-exhibitions space, which overlooks a small pond. History Smallegade viewed from All√©gade in about 1800 Smallegade seen from Falkoner All√© in c. 1890. The house to the left has not yet been demolished to make way for the new Town Hall Smallegade in 1899 It is believed that Bredegade was the main street of Solbjerg, a village inhabited by Dutch farmers until the 1620s when it was shut down by Christian IV. Smallegade was also one of the original \\"Dutch\\" streets but more open than Bredegade, with fields on its north side in between the scattered buildings. A brickyard was found at the far end of Smallegade until the 17th century. The Brickyard House (Teglv√¶rksg√•rden) survived until 1890 when it was demolished. On a neighbouring site, Nobel opened a tobacco Factory in 1860. Eight years later that site was taken over by the faience manufactury Aluminia. They build a large factory complex where they were joined by the Royal Porcelain Manufactury in 184. Before the Town Hall was built in the 1940s, its site was home to a neighbourhood with some 30 houses of which many dated from the 18th century. Notable buildings and residents The most distinctive building in Smallegade is M√∏stings Hus which is located on the other side of a small pond (Andebakkedammen, \\"Duck Stream Pond\\"), which is believed to be the former village pond in Medieval Solbjerg. The house was built in 1800 and for 27 years served as summer residence for J.S. M√∏sting. It was originally located on another site in Smallegade but dismantled in 1959 and rebuilt in its current location in 1976. It is now used as an exhibition space. Porcel√¶nshaven Bredegade boasts some other examples of 18th century country houses. No. 11 was built in the 1790s and was for a while owned by Prime Minister P.G. Bang. Ot is today used by the Municipality. No. 13 was built in 1805 by master carpenter Boye Junge. The widow after Carl Hassager, a pastor converted into a hall of residence for ten students in 1897. The building where Copenhagen Ceramics is based Royal Copenhagen retired their production site in 2004. It has now been transformed into a mixed-use development, now known as Porcel√¶nshaven (literally \\"Porcelain Garden\\"), which retains many of the original factory buildings, including a landmark chimney, which is visible from the street. Copenhagen Ceramics at No. 46 is an exhibition space dedicated to temporary exhibitions of Danish ceramic art. It was opened by a group of artists in 2012 and is located in a courtyard away from the street. Transport The first part of the street is served by the Frederiksberg Copenhagen Metro station.

It was the first town in the region of Tucum√°n, occupied from 1550 to 1553. El Barco was founded in mid-1550 by a conquering expedition from Upper Peru under the command of Captain Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado, who had been sent by Pedro de la Gasca, President of the Real Audiencia de Lima. The settlement was named in honor of La Gasca's hometown, El Barco de √Åvila. Nunez de Prado distributed land, appointed members to the council and ordered the construction of a fort to protect the settlement from the Calchaqu√≠s. The site was poorly chosen, and the next year N√∫√±ez de Prado ordered it moved about a kilometer to the north. In 1553 Francisco de Aguirre with a group of sixty well-armed men from Chile deposed N√∫√±ez de Prado and expelled him along with his deputy Juan V√°zquez and the two Dominican friars who had accompanied him, fathers Gaspar Carvajal and Alonso Trueno. Soon after Aguirre ordered the transfer of the settlement to a new location, calling it Santiago del Estero del Nuevo Maestrazgo, the present Santiago del Estero. Many of the residents of El Barco were the first inhabitants of Santiago del Estero. Santiago del Estero was the main center for colonization of the region for a long time, until in 1699 the capital of the Governorship of Tucum√°n was moved to Salta, and some time later to C√≥rdoba.

At the time of signature, the borders of the former empire were not clear and to remedy the problem an Armenian businessman named Calouste Gulbenkian, took a red pencil to draw in an arbitrary manner the borders of the divided empire. The expression remained significant to global diplomacy and was reused during the UN's founding after the WWII, especially in the English-speaking world. Uniquely, in France one would \\"cross the yellow line\\" (franchir la ligne jaune).Alexander Melnik, Professor of Geopolitics. Diplomatie : d'o√π vient l'expression \\"franchir la ligne rouge\\" ? History of usage In Israel, the phrase was notably used as a political metaphor by Foreign Minister Yigal Allon, in 1975, when said that Washington \\"has managed to draw a red line which all the Arab countries know they must not cross - that America is not going to sacrifice Israel for the sake of Arab support.\\" Yitzhak Rabin later used the phrase to refer to the line past which the Syrian army should not be allowed to cross after the 1976 occupation of Lebanon. On September 27, 2012 at the 67th United Nations General Assembly at the U.N. Headquarters in New York in a speech addressing Iran's nuclear program Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly added a red line to a prepared bomb cartoon.Jeffrey Heller, Associated Press. Netanyahu draws \\"red line\\" on Iran's nuclear program According to Ben Yagoda, a professor of English and journalism at the University of Delaware, in 1987, there are references to \\"red lines\\" in conflicts between Chad and Libya, and in a 1999 New York Times article, Muslim clerics in Iran are reported to draw a \\"'red line for the revolution' that no one should cross.\\" These references occurred earlier as well, appearing a Milwaukee Sentinel article of 26 January 1984 regarding French intervention in Chad and a \\"red line\\" held by French forces in southern Chad.\\"French plans attack invading Chad rebels,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, 26 January 1984. The phrase has been used by U.S. diplomats going back to the 1990s. For example, U.S. officials, quoted by Reuters news agency in May 1994, used the term in reference to negotiations with North Korea over the withdrawal of reactor fuel; and Martin Walker in The Guardian used the same phrase in June, in reference to statements by United States officials.Steve Pagani, \\"U.N. Nuclear Experts in North Korea,\\" Reuters wire article, 19 May 1994; Martin Walker, \\"North Korea 'has crossed red line' \\" The Guardian, 1 June 1994. Secretary of State Warren Christopher used the phrase in reference to NATO control over the peace-keeping mission in Bosnia on the CBS program Face the Nation on 22 October 1995.\\"1,000 Muslims start trek home as Bosnian truce finally holds,\\" Toledo Blade, 23 October 1995. Barack Obama used the phrase on August 20, 2012, during the Syrian civil war in relation to chemical weapons, saying that \\"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\\" In the US, the phrase then became a source of contention when political opponent John McCain said the red line was \\"apparently written in disappearing ink,\\" due to the perception the red line had been crossed with no action. On the one year anniversary of Obama's red line speech the Ghouta chemical attacks occurred. Obama then clarified \\"I didn't set a red line. The world set a red line when governments representing 98 percent of the world's population said the use of chemical weapons are abhorrent and passed a treaty forbidding their use even when countries are engaged in war,\\" in reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Thin Red Line The Thin Red Line (1881) by Robert Gibb, depicting the 93rd Regiment fighting off Russian cavalry at the Battle of Balaclava in 1854 From British English, an entirely different figure of speech for an act of great courage against impossible order or thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack, or the \\"thin red line\\", originates from reports of a red-coated Scottish regiment at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. A journalist described a \\"thin red streak tipped with a line of steel\\" with the appearance of the 93rd (Highland) Regiment and parts of the Turkish army as they stood before (and repelled) a vastly superior force of Russian cavalry. The reference was soon shortened into the thin red line,Dot Wordsworth, The Spectator magazine, dated 8 June 2013 and famously described by Rudyard Kipling in the poem Tommy as \\"the thin red line of 'eroes [heroes].\\" Notable literary uses included George Orwell who in A Clergyman's Daughter invented a book-within-a-book called the \\"Hundred Page History of Britain, a 'nasty little duodecimo book' of 1888, which declared anachronistically that Napoleon 'soon found that in the ‚Äúthin red line‚Äù he had more than met his match.'\\" American author James Jones later used The Thin Red Line as the title of his 1962 novel about a World War II battle, helping to further popularize its usage. Its popularity of this use in the USA has increased since the Andrew Marton's 1964 movie and Terrence Malick's 1998 movie of Jones's novel, the latter of which was ranked as one of the 10 best action and war films of all time. The basic idea has been extended in the 20th century to apply to police officers, as The Thin Blue Line, in reference to the frequently blue color of police uniforms.

It was built by Bhagwant Das for his younger son Madho Singh. The fort and its precincts are well preserved. Geography The Bhangarh Fort is located on the border of the Sariska Reserve in the Aravali range of hills in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The nearest village is Gola ka Baas.The fort is situated at the foot of the hills on sloping terrain. The ruins of the king's palace are located on the lower slope of the hills; trees surround the pond area and a natural stream falls into the pond within the premises of the palace. The fort is located from Delhi and the approach to the entrance gate of the fort in the last stretch of the road is unpaved. The fort is from Thana Ghazi. The nearest airport is Jaipur International Airport, which is 88.2 Km from the fort. Legends Notice by Archaeological Survey of India. Exterior of Bhangarh Fort According to legend, a sadhu named Baba Balak Nath lived within the fort area, and it was his injunction that any house built in the precinct of the fort should not be taller than his own, and if the shadow of any such house fell on his, it would result in destruction of the fort town. According to another tale, a wizard adept in black magic named Sinhai fell in love with Ratnavati, a beautiful Bhangarh princess with many suitors. One day, the wizard followed her to the marketplace and offered her a love potion; however, she refused it, throwing it onto a large rock that consequently rolled onto the wizard and crushed him to death. Tourism Entering through the main gate of the completely ruined fort city, one can find temples, palaces, and havelis. In addition, there are four more points of entry to the fort ‚Äì the Lahori Gate, the Ajmeri Gate, the Phulbari Gate, and the Delhi Gate. At the entrance of the main gate are many Hindu temples such as Hanuman Temple, Gopinath Temple, Someshwar Temple, Keshav Rai Temple, Mangla Devi Temple, Ganesh Temple, and Navin Temple. The Gopinath Temple is built above a 14 ft raised plinth, and yellow stones are used for the exquisite carvings of the temple. The residence of the priest, called the Purohitji Ki Haveli, is located in the precincts of the temple complex. Next in order is the Nachan Ki Haveli (dancer's palace) and Jauhari Bazar (market place), followed by the Gopinath Temple. The Royal Palace is located at the extreme end of the fort's limits.

The resulting explosion destroyed a two-story mixed commercial and residential building, killing seven people and injuring another four. Enbridge and several other companies were fined for the disaster in 2011. A memorial garden was dedicated at the site of the explosion in 2008. Cause On April 24, 2003, road work was being conducted to fix flooding concerns. Enbridge contracted Precision Utility to locate natural gas pipelines along Bloor Street, west of Kipling Avenue. A pipeline leading into a plaza was not identified and an employee struck the pipeline with a backhoe, causing natural gas to leak into the basement of a two-story strip mall with businesses and residential housing. The workers immediately noticed the error and went to their vehicles to obtain tools to fix the leak. Explosion At around 1:30pm, the gas leaking out from the pipeline ignited, destroying the strip mall and damaging nearby buildings. The explosion also caused a fire which also damaged an adjacent house. 100 people and 25 fire trucks were used to extinguish the fire. Windows in stores across the street were blown out, windshields were damaged on cars and one vehicle was destroyed. Seven people were killed in the explosion. Robert Fairley was a resident of the building while Adele Brown, Elizabeth Roy and Lillian Guglietti were clients at a salon in the strip mall. Dora Carambelas, Tina Kirkimtzis, and Irene Miyama were also in the building when it exploded. Four people were also injured by falling debris. After Hurricane Hazel, this explosion was the second-highest loss of life for a single event in Etobicoke. This is also the highest loss of life for an incident involving a pipeline in Canadian history. Outcome In April 2004, charges were laid concerning this incident but were dismissed in 2007. The dismissal was appealed and the case was reconsidered in 2011. Warren Bitulithic Limited pled guilty to one charge under the Technical Standards and Safety Act in 2006. The charge was for damaging a natural gas pipeline without permission. The company was fined $225 000. Enbridge pled guilty to one charge under the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act and fined $350 000. They also pled guilty to another charge under the Technical Standards and Safety Act, requiring Enbridge to pay another $350 000 fine. The charges were for not evacuating gas services and not locating and marking the gas services before excavation. Four additional charges placed against Enbridge were withdrawn. Precision Utility pled guilty and was fined $200 000 for not properly supervising an employee while they were locating the natural gas lines. An investigation by the Ministry of Labour found that the Precision employee did not use locate the pipelines by using available information and did not act when they should have noticed the presence of natural gas. Each fine included a victim surcharge where an additional 25% of their fines would be paid to help the victims of this incident. By 2011 townhouses had been built on the site of the explosion. Milano‚Äôs Pizza, one of the businesses in the strip- mall, reopened across the street. Peter Roy, the son of Elizabeth Roy, campaigned for gas companies to regularly install excess flow valves on pipelines to protect against runaway gas and high flow rates. He reported that Enbridge has begun doing this on their projects. Volunteers also established a scholarship for a student attending Humber College who is going to have a job in the gas sector. Five years after the explosion, a memorial plaque, garden and two benches were placed at the site of the explosion during a memorial service. The service was organised by then-Toronto City Councillor Peter Milczyn.

He played for Essex between 1919 and 1932 and was captain of the team between 1929 and 1932. Morris was educated at Repton School, where he captained the First XI, and Cambridge University, where he was unable to find a place in the cricket team.Wisden 1987, p. 1244. He was a regular member of the Essex side in the 1920s, batting usefully and fielding superbly. In 1927 he scored 143 against Somerset and, a couple of weeks later, 166 against Hampshire, when he added 233 in 140 minutes for the fourth wicket with Jack Russell. Although Morris played only three matches in 1928, the Essex committee chose him to captain the team for the 1929 season, replacing Johnny Douglas. The 46-year-old Douglas opposed the appointment on the grounds that Morris was unqualified both as a cricketer and a captain, but Morris captained the team with reasonable success for the next three seasons. In 1930 the county finished sixth in the County Championship, owing in part to the \\"infectious enthusiasm\\" of Morris's captaincy.The Cricketer Annual 1930-31, p. 18. Although he was appointed captain for the 1932 season he was unavailable for all but two matches, and resigned the captaincy. His Wisden obituary described him as \\"a good stylist, who drove and cut well, [who] looked at his best capable of more than he in fact accomplished\\".

The spring was once part of a 19th-century health resort and the surrounding area is a notable archeological site. After more than 20 years of effort to acquire and develop the site, the park finally opened in September 2008. Description Green Springs Park is located near the north shore of Lake Monroe, approximately east of Interstate 4 in Enterprise, Florida. The spring supplies fresh water to Lake Monroe from the Florida aquifer. The spring basin is about wide by about deep. The water varies in color depending on the time of year, changing from green in the spring to more of a turquoise color in summer, back to green in the fall and finally to jade in the winter. The park's ecosystem is primarily a hardwood hammock, host to several rare species of plant life, including Epidendrum magnoliae, or Green-fly orchid. A paved path and numerous primitive paths cross and loop though the park, under cover of Live oak, Magnolia, Cedar and Pine. The park is also a trail head for two bicycle routes: the East Central Regional Rail trail and the Spring-to- Spring trail. Green Springs Park is a significant archaeological and historical site. A huge shell midden existed near the spring run before being depleted for road building and fertilizer prior to 1885. The few remaining deposits contain primitive tools, pottery sherds, as well as remains of humans and animals. History =Early history= Green Springs was once an important site for Native Americans such as the Mayaca and the Seminole, who favored for the supposed healing properties of its sulfur water. The area near the spring was first settled in 1841 by Cornelius Taylor. Taylor constructed a hotel on a large shell mound near where the spring run empties into Lake Monroe. He promoted his hotel as a health spa, offering the spring's \\"restorative\\" powers to people with illnesses. By 1883, the spring was on property owned by wealthy New York wine importer Frederic DeBary, whose DeBary Hall guests used the spring recreationally. =Land acquisition = In December 1984, Bill Canty, who owned an adjacent five acre parcel, introduced a proposal to the Volusia County Council seeking to rezone the Green Springs site for a 250 unit condominium complex. At the urging of local residents, the Council denied Canty's proposal and decided instead to explore the possibility of acquiring property for use as an ecotourism site. In 1985, U.S. Representative Bill Chappell attempted to secure federal funds to purchase the spring and of surrounding land from its private owner, Inga Friend, who had owned the property since 1954. Negotiations began between Friend and the county, but broke down largely because of Friend's desire to exclude the spring from the purchase. In 1986, DeLand lawyer Larry Sands purchased the property from Inga Friend and her daughter, Lani, for $250,000. The purchase did not include the spring, but did include a first right of refusal agreement, should the Friends consent to sell it in the future. By 2001, plans were made to create a passive park at the site, with mulch or shell paths and minimal parking. =Park development= After nearly 24 years of planning, negotiation, grant seeking and negotiation, Green Springs Park neared completion in 2008. Prior to opening, county staff, Florida Native Plant Society members, master naturalists, and other volunteers canvassed the site, removed exotic and invasive plants species that would threaten the delicate native ecosystem. The park was officially opened on September 27, 2008, the result of near $1 million invested in land acquisition and improvements.

Guo graduated from the Oil painting Department of Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in 2004. After graduation, he created a style of painting based on old photographs of the artist himself and his family. To create blurry reproductions of the original images, Guo Hongwei would dilute oil paint with turpentine. These works were later exhibited together at Dissolving Memories, his first solo exhibition at Connoisseur Art Gallery, Hong Kong, in 2007. Guo Hongwei is known for his similarly unique application of watercolour: in ‚ÄòChiaroscuro‚Äô series (2009), which is also based on old photographs, the artist painted with watercolour on wet paper to create hazy and ambiguous forms. In 2009, Guo Hongwei began to use varnish instead of turpentine to thin oil paint. Resulting paintings show that the paint has dried with crystallised edges. His subject matter also started to expand, moving away from old photographs to include natural specimens‚Äîbotanical, animal, mineral‚Äîprecisely replicated in watercolour. In recent works, Guo has ventured into collage and started to experiment with new dimensions in visual art within a given flat surface. \\"From the physical perspective, Guo's practice neither bolsters nor weakens the informational capacity of the 2D print medium‚Äî he simply records it.\\"Sun, Dongdong, \\"Guo Hongwei: Editing.\\" LEAP.

The construction of the new offshore patrol vessel was slightly delayed and Turva began her first sea trials on 25 February 2014. About a month later, on 21 March, the vessel left for the second sea trials. Turva was completed and handed over to the Finnish Border Guard on 9 May 2014.Ulkovartiolaiva Turva luovutettiin Rajavartiolaitokselle. Aamulehti, 9 May 2014.

The old vessels were not strengthened for navigation in ice and their oil spill prevention and response capability was not deemed adequate for dealing with the increased traffic in the Gulf of Finland. On 16 September 2013, STX Finland decided to close the shipyard in June 2014 and for a while it looked like Turva would be the last new vessel built in Rauma where ships have been constructed for over 300 years.Musta maanantai: STX:n Rauman telakka lopetetaan.

Taloussanomat, 12 June 2014.  Design  Starboard side view of Turva. Compared to the other photograph, the helipad can be seen folded open in this picture. = General characteristics = Turva is long and wide, making her the largest vessel ever commissioned by the Finnish Border Guard as well as longer than any existing or past vessel commissioned by the Finnish Navy. Fully laden, she draws of water. At design draught, the vessel has a deadweight tonnage of 660 tonnes while her maximum deadweight is around 1,800 tonnes. Her complement will be approximately 30. The main purposes of the new offshore patrol vessel are open sea patrol and ensuring border safety. Turva carries a rigid-hulled inflatable boat and a larger patrol boat, both stowed in covered recesses, that can be used to carry a vessel inspection teams to intercepted ships. While the vessel does not have a hangar, the forward helipad with folding \\"wings\\" is large enough for receiving and refueling a Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma, the largest type of helicopter operated by the Finnish Border Guard, during search-and- rescue operations at sea. Turva is the first Finnish patrol vessel fitted with such capability. For surveillance, Turva has a Cassidian TRS-3D radar‚Äîthe same used in the Hamina-class missile boats and H√§meenmaa-class minelayers of the Finnish Navy‚Äîand extensive command and control systems which allow the ship to direct large rescue operations both in the air and on the surface.Perjantaina nimen saanut Rajan ulkovartiolaiva Turva on kopteritukialus.

Although no details have been released, the vessel is also fitted with underwater surveillance systems. Turva is also equipped for rescue operations, firefighting, emergency towing and demanding environmental duties. She can perform mechanical recovery of spilled oil with built-in recovery systems in open water, either by using conventional outriggers and booms in calm seas or a stiff steel boom and a special wave- dampening channel in heavy weather. The oil recovery system has been manufactured by the Finnish company Mobimar which has also provided equipment for other Finnish patrol vessels. Furthermore, the vessel is also fitted for but not with equipment capable of recovering oil in ice conditions. The internal storage tanks are dimensioned for of recovered oil and of recovered chemicals.Valtion √∂ljyntorjunta-alukset. Suomen Ymp√§rist√∂keskus.

For diving support and oil recovery tasks, Turva carries a small workboat.Vko 40: Ty√∂vene tuli Norjasta. Rajavartiolaitos, 17 December 2013. Like all Finnish offshore patrol vessels, Turva can be armed and used for national defense purposes in a crisis. However, during peacetime the vessels carry only small arms. The blue-and- white colouring, inspired by the flag of Finland, is a departure from the traditional green hull utilized by Finnish Border Guard. Following the construction of Turva, it became the standard for all Finnish patrol vessels. = Power and propulsion = Turva is powered by three environmentally friendly W√§rtsil√§ 34DF series dual-fuel engines capable of burning both diesel fuel as well as liquified natural gas (LNG). For redundancy and safe return to port, the engines are arranged in two independent engine rooms divided by a watertight bulkhead. In the aft engine room, a 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V34DF producing is mechanically coupled to a controllable-pitch propeller. In the forward engine room, two 6-cylinder 6L34DF generating sets with an output of each produce power for two electrically driven Rolls-Royce Azipull AZP120CP Z-drive azimuth thrusters. If the forward engine room is damaged, the shaft generator coupled to the bigger engine can be used to produce electricity for the azimuth thrusters, which are required for steering the vessel as she has no separate rudders, and other onboard systems.Monik√§ytt√∂inen Turva. Reservil√§inen 6/2013, page 14. Since the azimuth thrusters are powered by electric motors and the centerline shaft is mechanically coupled to the main engine, the propulsion system as a whole could be referred to as \\"combined diesel-electric and diesel\\" (CODLAD). Turva is the first ship fitted with this type of propulsion arrangement‚Äîtwo azimuth thrusters and a centerline shaft‚Äîwhich was originally developed for icebreakers and icegoing LNG carriers.Niini, M. (2013): Last year's achievements and the way ahead. Aker Arctic Technology. For maneuvering and DP2 class dynamic positioning, the ship has a transverse bow thruster and a retractable azimuth thruster in the bow.Vko 30: Potkurille lavat. Rajavartiolaitos, 24 July 2013. Turva is the first LNG-powered offshore patrol vessel as well as only the second LNG- powered ship (after Viking Grace) to enter service in Finland. Unlike in the ferry, which has two deck-mounted LNG storage tanks, the single fuel tank in Turva is built inside the vessel.Vko 19: Lohkoja varustellaan. Rajavartiolaitos, 4 June 2013. The service speed of the vessel will be and despite her bulbous bow she will also be capable of breaking level ice up to in thickness. With a bollard pull of approximately 100 tonnes, Turva is capable of towing even the largest tankers regularly sailing in the Baltic Sea.

On 20 June 2020, Turvas Watercat 1000 Patrol daughter craft sank after running aground off Loviisa on the Midsummer Day evening. Two members of the three-man crew managed to escape the rapidly sinking boat while the third person was trapped in the cabin and later died in the hospital.

Background Beasley was born in London in to an Irish racing family. His father, Harry, also known as \\"HH\\" Beasley, was an outstanding flat jockey and rode the winner of two Irish Derbys. Beasley's grandfather, also named Harry, trained and rode Come Away to victory in the 1891 Grand National. His great-uncle, Tommy, was twice Irish Champion Jockey and won the Grand National at Aintree on three occasions (Empress 1880, Woodbrook 1881 and Frigate 1889). Jockey He was reared in Ireland. His first winner was as an amateur came at Leopardstown when he was sixteen years of age. Three years later he enjoyed his first winner as a professional at Naas. In 1960 he captured the Champion Hurdle on Another Flash. In 1961 he was victorious in the Grand National with Nicolaus Silver at odds of 28/1. He was among the leaders from early on the second circuit and gradually drew clear over the final two fences to win by five lengths. Nicholas Silver became the first and only grey to win the race during the 20th century. In 1963 he was victorious in the Mackeson Gold Cup on Richard of Bordeaux. In 1966 he won the Triumph Hurdle aboard Black Ice. =Roddy Owen= Beasley rode Roddy Owen in the 1959 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was trained by Danny Morgan and owned by Lord Fingall. The horse was named after amateur rider Roddy Owen who won the 1892 Grand National aboard Father O'Flynn. Roddy Owen was joint second favourite at odds of 5/1. The outright favourite was Taxidermist, the winner of the 1958 Hennessy Gold Cup. Coming to the final fence Pas Seul was in the lead with Linwell and Lochroe in hot pursuit. Roddy Owen was in fourth just behind the leaders. Despite an otherwise flawless jumping performance Pas Seul fell at the last coming down in Linwell's Path. As a result, he came to a standstill, hampering Lochroe. Taking full advantage of the others' misfortune, Beasley steered Roddy Owen into the lead and won by three lengths from Linwell. Alcoholism However Beasley struggled with his drink problem. As a result, he was let go as stable jockey to Fred Winter who was one of the most successful trainers of the day. He retired as a jockey in 1969. His recovery began when his friend Nicky Rackard convinced him to join Alcoholics Anonymous. Comeback In February 1971, aged 35, he resumed his career riding Norwegian Flag to victory at Leopardstown. Captain Christy He captured the Irish Sweeps Hurdle on Captain Christy Beasley was aged 38‚Äîand had been sober for five years‚Äîwhen trainer Pat Taaffe, gave him the ride on Captain Christy at Cheltenham. During his brief career, Captain Christy had fallen on a number of occasions, and was a novice when he ran in the Gold Cup. During the race Captain Christy made a terrible mistake at the final fence, but Beasley remained composed and drove his mount past The Dikler, who had won the race the previous year, to win by five lengths. The Times described his victory as \\"the greatest comeback since Lazarus\\" Retirement Beasley retired for a second time and began training in England with his second wife, Linda, at Lewes and Marlborough. He also managed a pub and worked in a vineyard. Personal life In 1960 Beasley married Shirley Thompson, a daughter of jockey Arthur Thompson, who triumphed in the Grand National in 1948 and 1952.

Known mostly for vocal music, he has also composed orchestral, chamber, and solo instrumental works. His opera, Glory Denied, has been performed to critical acclaim in New York, Washington, and Texas.  Early life  Tom Cipullo was born into a musical family on Long Island, New York. His father, a jazz bassist playing under the name Ray Carle, performed throughout the New York area and hosted a successful radio show in the late 1950s and early 1960s, broadcasting with a quartet from the Caf√© Rouge of the Statler Hilton Hotel. Cipullo‚Äôs brother, Chris, was a drummer in Los Angeles. Cipullo‚Äôs father named him after the bandleader Tommy Dorsey. Dorsey, who appeared frequently at the Caf√© Rouge, died just a few days after Cipullo‚Äôs birth. Cipullo attended Hofstra University, Boston University, and the City University of New York Graduate School. His teachers included David Del Tredici, Elie Siegmeister, Albert Tepper, Thea Musgrave (orchestration), and Graham Forbes, a highly regarded jazz pianist and the accompanist for Frank Sinatra during a period in the 1950s.  Professional career  Cipullo‚Äôs song cycles may be said to have entered the standard repertoire. He has composed over 225 songs, one evening- length chamber opera, six works for voices and chamber ensemble, solo piano pieces, and works for chorus and orchestra. Several of his song cycles are published by Oxford University Press, and others are distributed by Classical Vocal Reprints. His music appears on over a dozen commercially-released compact discs on the Albany, CRI, PGM, MSR Classics, GPR, Centaur, and Capstone labels.  Musical style and critical reception  Cipullo is a composer of tonal music, though his use of harmony may occasionally stretch to include bitonality and extremely dissonant passages. His vocal music is lyrical in the extreme, but marked by large leaps, lengthy phrases with surprising breaths, numerous shifts in meter, virtuosic piano accompaniments, and a love of musical allusion. Writing for the New York Times, Allan Kozinn said, ‚ÄúMr. Cipullo‚Äôs vocal writing is fresh and natural, and he amplifies it with thoughtful, sometimes picturesque commentary in the piano line.‚Äù Cipullo‚Äôs compositions are text-driven, and Fanfare magazine noted that ‚Äúhe excels by pulling off the conjuror‚Äôs trick mastered by all the great writers of poem-based song from Schubert forward‚Äîthe blurring of the demarcation between where the word ends and the music begins.‚Äù In presenting him with its ' Arts & Letters Award, the American Academy of Arts & Letters cited Cipullo's music for its \\"inexhaustible imagination, wit, expressive range and originality.\\"  Personal  Cipullo is married to the Belgian artist Hedwig Brouckaert.

The opera, based on the oral history by journalist Tom Philpott, tells the true story of Colonel Jim Thompson, an American soldier held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam from 1964-73. The story deals not only with Thompson‚Äôs suffering in the jungles of southeast Asia, but also chronicles the personal struggles that followed his liberation and repatriation. In short, Glory Denied is the story of an American family during one of the nation‚Äôs most turbulent eras. Richard Bernstein, in reviewing Philpott‚Äôs book for the New York Times, stated, ‚ÄúIndeed it is not too much to say that Glory Denied‚Ä¶ encapsulate[s] something of the moral essence of the Vietnam War and the imperishable bitterness of its legacy.‚Äù Some of the opera's success is no doubt due to the resonance audiences have found with the subject matter. As Allan Kozinn of the New York Times neatly summed up, ‚ÄúHow is this for a story with operatic potential? A prisoner of war held for nearly a decade returns home to find that his wife has moved on, his nation has changed beyond recognition, and he is unable to find his bearings in the society he fought to defend. It is Monteverdi‚Äôs ‚ÄúRitorno d‚ÄôUlisse in Patria‚Äù in reverse: the story of the returning warrior, but in this thoroughly modern version, everything has gone wrong, and redemption is out of reach.‚Äù Glory Denied is written for a cast of four (two sopranos, a tenor, and a baritone) and the score exists in three different orchestrations, from nine players to full orchestra. The work was recorded live by Fort Worth Opera and released on Albany Records in August of 2013 (Troy 1433). Critical reaction to the opera has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The following examples are typical: * ‚Äútense, nervous and gripping theater‚Ä¶intimate in its presentation (minimal sets and costumes and a nine-musician ensemble) and epic in its scope and effect‚Ä¶From hope to despair, from love to hatred to forgiveness, the dramatic tension was relentless.‚Äù - Opera News * ‚Äú‚Ä¶a powerful drama of great music and acting intensity.‚Äù* - Fort Worth Star-Telegram * ‚Äú‚Ä¶a powerfully realistic thriller and an unabashedly honest commentary on the America of the 1960s and ‚Äô70s.‚Äù - Fort Worth Weekly * \\" [an] intimate operatic masterpiece.‚Äù- D Magazine * ‚ÄúMr. Cipullo‚Äôs vocal writing is angular and declamatory at times, but he has a keen sense of when to let that modernist approach melt into glowing melody, and he has an even keener ear for orchestral color.‚Äù- New York Times * ‚Äú‚Ä¶a luminous score that offered vivid embodiments of the protagonist‚Äôs mental states.‚Äù - Washington Post * ‚ÄúDramatic is an understatement. In its operatic form, it is horrifying, riveting, involving, shocking, inspiring, overwhelming, appalling and devastating‚Äîin that order.‚Äù - Theater Jones * ‚Äú‚Ä¶a work of our time‚Ä¶It holds its own against the greatest of the classical repertoire, while helping to redefine it at the rarer scale of chamber opera.‚Äù - DC Arts Beat The Parting An opera by Cipullo to a libretto by David Mason based on the life and poems of Mikl√≥s Radn√≥ti.

It was built for Sir Basil Dixwell between 1635 and 1638. In the early 20th century it was the country home of Lord Kitchener of Khartoum until his death at sea in 1916. Now a country club, Broome Park is a Grade I listed building. History The house was built between 1635 and 1638. Commissioned for Sir Basil Dixwell, 1st Baronet, who had been Member of Parliament for Hythe, it passed down through various generations of Dixwell baronets until it was inherited by Sir George Oxenden, 5th Baronet, who took on his mother's surname of Dixwell.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1751 (25 Geo. 2). c. 1 It then passed down through various generations of Oxenden baronets to Sir Percy Dixwell Nowell Dixwell-Oxenden, 10th Baronet. In 1911 the estate was bought by Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener. Kitchener commissioned Detmar Blow (1867-1939) and Fernand Billerey to carry out a major remodelling and to create the formal gardens and a formal carriage approach. Contractors involved included George P. Bankart, W. Bainbridge Reynolds (\\"sconces in silver copper\\"), Cowtan & Sons (wood panelling), Shanks (heaters) and Maples of London (panelling and a table design). Because of the extensive work being carried out on the property and Kitchener's professional commitments as Sirdar in Egypt and subsequently Secretary of War in London, he only lived in Broome Park for brief periods: notably for six weeks while on home leave immediately prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Full-time occupancy of the house was intended for his retirement. However between 1914 and 1916 Kitchener spent his limited spare time in what his aide-de-camp described as \\"the one relaxation which Lord Kitchener allows himself - the building of his house. It gives him such intense pleasure every Saturday when he comes down and sees the good work that has been done\\".letter dated June 1915 from Lt Col Oswald Fitzgerald to the chief steward at Broome In the early 1930s the estate was bought by Mr G C Jell who transformed the house into a country house hotel. During the Second World War the estate was requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence. In or before 1979 the Park was acquired by Gulf Shipping, for the purposes of developing a timeshare and leisure complex. The development was the subject of litigation, which went to the UK Supreme Court in 2018. Today Broome Park is a timeshare hotel and club house for a golf course.

The front cover features the 1959 painting Orange and Black Wall by Franz Kline. In Australia the album appeared on the Coronet label. It was re-released, for the first time in digital format, in 2004 as part of a compact disc collection titled Dave Brubeck: For All Time. It was again released as part of the box set The Dave Brubeck Quartet: the Columbia Studio Albums Collection 1955-1966. Both CD re-releases feature a bonus track titled \\"Fatha\\". Recording Dedicated to astronaut John Glenn the album was another in a series of concept albums studying the exploration of unusual meters and polytonality within a jazz context. Recorded between May 3, 1961 and February 12, 1962, it was put on tape in many of the same sessions that appear on Time Further Out. Brubeck encouraged the quartet members towards development of new time signatures for this album. The first track, \\"Countdown\\", is based on a typical \\"8 to the bar\\" boogie, stride piano in the manner of Earl Hines or Teddy Wilson, but with two extra notes added in, giving a meter count of 10. AC/DC's song Whole Lotta Rosie has an opening riff directly mimicking this track. Michael Katzif considers the track so smoothly played that some people may be unaware of the unusual time signature. \\"Eleven Four\\" uses a pattern of five beats, then two sets of three to create the feel of eleven. In the track \\"Why Phillis\\" some players stick to 3/4 time, others adhere to 4/4, while others move between the time signatures. \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" had been previously recorded by the Quartet, juxtaposing triple and quadruple meters in the album Dave Digs Disney, but the track was re-done on this album to further realize the rhythmic possibilities of poly-rhythm, including adding a rhythm of 2/4 to the mix. \\"Castilian Blues\\" and \\"Castilian Drums\\" have time signatures of 5/4, the latter being unsurprisingly a percussion showpiece. The next four tracks, \\"Fast Life,\\" \\"Waltz Limp,\\" \\"Three's a Crowd,\\" and \\"Danse Duet\\" were written for a ballet entitled \\"Maiden in the Tower.\\" Different characters in the performance have themes with different time signatures, and as they interact the interplay and contrasts of the various rhythms are paraded. The album's final track, as originally issued, is a standard blues in 4/4 time, hence the title \\"Back to Earth.\\" Reception On release, Billboard expected the album to be \\"another smash\\" because of the \\"persuasive and exciting performances\\". Both the monaural and stereo version appeared on the respective Billboard charts. Countdown's first appearance on the Billboard chart was on June 16, 1962. It reached a peak position of No. 24 and remained on the chart for 21 weeks.The Billboard Albums, 6th ed. Joel Whitburn. 2006. Record Research Inc. p. 149. The St. Petersburg Times called the album \\"modern jazz at its finest.\\" Louise Stone recommended the album but found it inferior to Brubeck's Fantasy recordings and Jazz Goes to College. The album has been cited as a superior example of utilizing \\"off\\" time signatures. The Age stated that the album \\"breaks new ground.\\" The Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it one of Brubeck's most creative records.

The name Dara Jingga in old Malay means \\"scarlet dove\\". Early life Dara Jingga was the daughter of King Srimat Tribhuwanaraja Mauliawarmadewa of Dharmasraya Kingdom in Sumatra, and was sent to Java to be presented to Singhasari King. This Sumatran kingdom was held as vassal of Singhasari in 1286. According to Pararaton, ten days after the expulsion of Mongol forces from Java, the Pamalayu expedition led by Mahisa Anabrang returned to Java. The expedition was sent by Singhasari King Kertanegara in 1275 to conquer Sumatra. The returning Javanese troops brought two Malay princesses, two siblings Dara Jingga and Dara Petak to be presented for Kertanagara. The two princesses was originally intended for Kertanagara, however because the Singhasari King has died, his heir Raden Wijaya took Dara Petak in hand of marriage instead.

Attack The bomb exploded near the Exit B at the second floor of Terminal 3 in Beijing Capital Airport. Ji was distributing flyers and was then stopped from doing so by the police; after, he detonated the device. Witness exclaimed to have seen a man in wheelchair warning them to step back before the explosion. The man then took the bomb out of a bag with him and set it off, although the police were trying to stop him. The explosion only injured the bomber himself, who was taken to a hospital soon after, but shocked travelers and sent authorities scrambling. The exit was then closed temporarily.

It was raced between 2002 and 2007, competing in the LMP2 class of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in the last two years of its usage. A GC21, entered by MYZ, won the LMP2 category of the Japan Le Mans Challenge in 2006. History In 2002, the Fuji Grand Champion Series was revived, under the GC21 name. Dallara were tasked with building a car for the series, and converted one of their Formula Three cars into the Le Mans Prototype-style Dallara GC21. The GC21 featured the distinctive air intake of a F3 car, but was fitted with a 2-litre, turbocharged Toyota 3S-GTE straight-four engine, in place of the naturally- aspirated units used in F3. The car's first race came in July 2002, the first of four races that year, all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway circuit. Jerome Dalla Lana, driving for Inging, became the first driver to win in the car, with all five entries finishing the twelve lap event. By the final race of the season, held in November, the grid had expanded to eight cars, with Ronnie Quintarelli, also driving for Inging, winning the event. Only once did a GC21 retire in 2002; Naozumi Itou retired from race three after three laps. 2003 saw the series expand to a five-race event, all of which were held at the Fuji Speedway track. Shinsuke Yamazaki, driving for Aim Sports, won the first event, held in March, with six cars being entered. Each of the following events had seven entries. The final race of the season saw the first mechanically-attributed retirement; the privateer Kazuhiko Yatsu suffered a gearbox failure after five laps, in a race where Yamazaki won again. Yamazaki won three races that year, and took two further second places on the way to securing the title. For 2004, the closure of Fuji Speedway as part of a Hermann Tilke redesign of the circuit forced the series to move. As a result, four races were held at the road course of Twin Ring Motegi, as well as one at Sportsland Sugo. Hiroki Saga, driving for MYG, won four races on the way to the title, with the other race being won by Nova Engineering's Katsuaki Kubota. However, the entry list had decreased, with no more than five drivers competing in any of the races. Fuji Speedway reopened in 2005, and the GC-21 series returned there for all five races of the season. Team I Line's Hiroaki Ishiura was dominant, winning all five races. In 2006, the Japan Le Mans Challenge (JLMC) was run for the first time, and the GC21 competed in that series in the LMP2 category, as well as the GC-21 series, which continued for one final season. Yasuo Miyagawa won two races of the GC21 series whilst driving for RS Serizawa whilst Atsushi Katsumata won three races driving for MYG. In the JLMC, MYZ entered two GC21 in the season opener, which was the Sugo 1000 km, whilst Aim Sports entered a single GC21. The MYZ entries didn't have any success; the #3 car, driven by Masayuki Yamamoto, Syougo Suhou and Jun'ichirou Yamashita retired, whilst the #4 car, driven by Yuuya Sakamoto, Yoshihisa Namekata and Tomonobu Fujii wasn't classified. However, the Aim Sports car, driven by Shinsuke Yamazaki, Yuuji Asou and Masaru Tomizawa, took the LMP2 class win, and finished second overall. At the Motegi 1000 km, the two team's finishes were reversed: the Aim Sports entry retired due to engine failure, whilst both MYZ entries finished; the #4 MYZ car took the class win, and finished second overall, whilst the #3 MYZ car finished third overall. The #4 MYZ car won the LMP2 category again at the season finale, which was the Okayama 1000 km, whilst both of the other GC21s retired. As a result, MYZ won the LMP2 Team's Championship, and Sakamoto, Namekata and Fujii won the LMP2 Driver's Championship. 2007 saw the JLMC expand to a four-race series, whilst the GC21 was discontinued. For the season opener, which was the Sugo 1000 km, two GC21s were entered; one by Kazuyoshi Takamizawa, and one by Aim Sports, who entered Tomizawa, Asou and Yoshitaka Kuroda. Although Takamizawa did not attend the event, Aim Sports did, and finished fourth, winning the LMP2 category. Aim Sports were the only GC21 in the Fuji 1000 km, and once more won their class, finishing second overall. Three GC21s were entered in the Motegi 1000 km; the regular Aim Sports car was complemented by an entry from Forward Racing, who had Takuya Shirasaka and Takeshi Itou driving for them, as well as an entry from Rs Serizawa, who ran Hiroshi Koizumi, Tsubasa Kurosawa and Hiroaki Ishiura in their GC21. For the first time in the series, the LMP2 category was won by another car; the Max Racing-entered RS KK-LM won the class. The Aim Sports GC21 finished fifth overall, and second in class, whilst the Forward Racing entry was not classified, and the Rs Serizawa entry retired. Aim Sports were once again the only entry in the season finale, which was the Okayama 1000 km; the team took an overall victory for the first time, beating the Team Mugen Courage LC70 LMP1 by just over 28 seconds. This would prove to be both the car's, and the series', last race, as the JLMC was cancelled shortly after the Okayama 1000 km had finished.

He is known for various work related to the field of energy and has also been credited as an early pioneer of electron beam lithography, which has become a key mask-making technology for modern microelectronics. He has additionally been attributed the title, ‚ÄòFather of Vacuum of Microelectronics‚Äô and been known as a founder of microelectronic field emission devices. Career In the 1950s, Shoulders worked as a researcher at MIT in applied research on microminiature data-processing components and systems and worked with Dudley Allen Buck in making thin-film cryotron integrated circuits.Dudley Allen Buck In 1958, he moved to California to work as a Senior Research Engineer, Applied Physics Laboratory created by Charles Rosen at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Shoulders established SRI‚Äôs microelectronics program. Early in his career at SRI, Shoulders made the first 12 quadrupole mass spectrometers and then later worked with others such as mouse inventor, Douglas Engelbart and Jerre Noe. During his time at SRI, Shoulders also worked on ideas for a flying car, the Gyrodyne Convertiplane. It combined features of a car, a helicopter (a rotor on the roof for take-off and landing) and a small airplane (rigid wings and a rear propeller). Shoulders developed preliminary sketches and specifications, promoting the idea of a ground-to-air vehicle that could rescue long-distance commuters from hours of grid-lock traffic. In 1963, Shoulders asked the California State Senate‚Äôs Transportation Committee for permission to use his invention on public roads, and in 1964 they agreed. However, a number of nearby municipalities banned the Convertiplane from their airspace. Unable to get the flying car off the ground, Shoulders created his own company, Vertitek, and began developing remote-controlled drones. He imagined a wide variety of drone applications, from children's toys to agricultural crop dusters. One example, the Boomerang, sent out sound waves to detect and avoid collisions, and looked like giant maple seed. In the 1980s, Shoulders moved to Austin, Texas to work at Jupiter Technologies as Chief Inventor and focusing on electron condensed charge technology (referred to as EV's) along with Hal Puthoff. In 2000, Shoulders' work related to high energy electron charge clusters was incorporated into a Future Energy Technologies briefing presented to The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

It was supposed to have been a despatch prepared in Nyasaland by the Governor of that protectorate, Robert Perceval Armitage, but was in fact prepared in London by a working party that included Armitage, British government ministers and senior Colonial Office officials, in an attempt to counteract various criticisms contained in the Report of the Devlin Commission. Both reports accepted that a State of Emergency was necessary in view of the level of unrest in Nyasaland, but the Armitage Report approved of the subsequent actions of the police and troops, whereas the Devlin Report criticised their illegal use of force and stigmatised the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism as justifying it being called a \\"police state\\". Although the Armitage Report was used by the government of the day to discredit the Devlin Report initially, and to justify its rejection of many of the Devlin Commission's findings, in the longer term the Devlin Report helped to convince the British Government that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was not acceptable to its African majority and should be dissolved. Devlin was vindicated and approached for advice on constitutional change, but Armitage was seen as an obstacle to progress and asked to leave Nyasaland prematurely. Unrest in Nyasaland In the 1940s and early 1950s, the most pressing problem in Nyasaland was that of African access to land. Between 1892 and 1894, about 15% of the total land area of the Nyasaland, including over 350,000 hectares of the best land in the Shire Highlands, the most densely populated part of the country, had been turned into European-owned estates.B. Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875‚Äì1975, pp. 36‚Äì7. Africans who were resident on these estates were required to pay rent, normally satisfied by undertaking agricultural work for the owner under the system known as thangata, which later developed into a form of sharecropping.B. Pachai, (1978). Land and Politics in Malawi 1875‚Äì1975, p. 84. By the 1940s, very little land on these estates, except for tea estates, was farmed directly by the estate owners: elsewhere the land was farmed by African tenants. Tensions between estate owners and tenants remained high up to the early 1950s. There were riots in some overcrowded districts in 1945 and between 1950 and 1953 related to evictions and rent increases, and riots in August 1953 led to eleven dead and seventy-two injured.R Palmer, (1986). Working Conditions and Worker Responses on the Nyasaland Tea Estates, 1930‚Äì1953, pp. 122‚Äì3, 125. The Abrahams Commission (also known the 1946 Land Commission) was appointed by the Nyasaland government to inquire into land issues in Nyasaland following these riots and disturbances. Abrahams proposed that the Nyasaland government should purchase all unused or under-used freehold land on the estates, which would be allocated to African smallholders as Native Trust Land.S Tenney and N K Humphreys, (2011). Historical Dictionary of the International Monetary Fund, pp. 10, 17‚Äì18. The programme of land acquisition accelerated after 1951, and by 1957 the government had negotiated the purchase of most of the land it had targeted for purchase.B Pachai, (1973). Land Policies in Malawi: An Examination of the Colonial Legacy, pp. 691‚Äì2 . In the same period, the political aspirations of Nyasaland's Africans received a set-back. Agitation by the Southern Rhodesia government led to a Royal Commission (the Bledisloe Commission) on future association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland: its report in 1939 did not rule-out some form of future association between Southern Rhodesia and the two territories north of the Zambezi.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 232‚Äì6. The threat of Southern Rhodesian rule channeled African political demands into the Nyasaland African Congress.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 101, 192. From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to a federal solution for Central Africa, not the full amalgamation that the Southern Rhodesian government preferred. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition.A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 62, 65‚Äì6. The main African objections to the Federation were that political domination by the white minority of Southern Rhodesia would prevent greater African political participation and that control by Southern Rhodesian politicians would lead to an extension of racial discrimination and segregation.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, London, Pall Mall Press, pp. 114‚Äì5. In 1957, some members of the Nyasaland African Congress invited Hastings Banda, then living in the Gold Coast to return to Nyasaland, which he did in July 1958, becoming the president of Congress. Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise quite moderate and far less radical that younger Congress members. In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, he combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as opposition to agricultural practices imposed on Africa farmers, which aimed to promote soil conservation, and also the remnants of thangata. Banda's strategy was to use these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, demonstrations, disobedience and protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 344‚Äì5, 347‚Äì49. The Emergency and the Devlin Commission In December 1958, Banda presented Congress proposals for an African majority in the Legislative Council to the governor, Sir Robert Armitage. Armitage was not opposed to limited constitutional development, envisaging autonomy for Nyasaland with the Federation, with African majority rule deferred to some distant future date, but Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, rejected any plan for the protectorate having local autonomy and, in early January 1959, the Colonial Office made it clear that, as the protectorate would not be allowed to leave the Federation, Banda and Congress would have to be neutralised.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 346-8 The governor therefore rejected the Congress proposals that would inevitably lead to a demand for withdrawal from the Federation. This breakdown in talks led to Congress demands for an escalation of anti- government protests and more violent action. Action by Congress supporters became more violent and, on 21 February, and, in the days immediately following, police or troops opened fire on rioters in several places, leading to four deaths.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 296‚Äì7. Armitage decided against offering any concessions to Congress, and drafted plans for mass arrests covering of almost the whole of the Congress organisation. He later claimed to have been influenced by reports of a meeting of Congress leaders (held in Banda's absence) on 25 January 1959, which approved a policy of strikes, retaliation against police violence, sabotage and defiance of the government. Reports by police informers formed the basis for the claim by the Head of Special Branch that there were plans for the indiscriminate killing of Europeans, Asians and of those Africans opposed to Congress (the so-called \\"murder plot\\").J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 349‚Äì51. However, the Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda or other Congress leaders in January 1959, and continued to negotiate with them until late February. The governor also made no specific reference to the \\"murder plot\\" until after his declaration of a State of Emergency had failed to restore order quickly. However, Banda and his colleagues refused to condemn the violent actions of Congress members, which were increasingly directed against Africans who failed to support Congress.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 349‚Äì51, 357. After the breakdown of talks in late February, Armitage made preparations for a State of Emergency in Nyasaland, which were approved by the Colonial Office. After consulting the Federal Prime Minister, Roy Welensky and the Southern Rhodesia Premier, Edgar Whitehead, and with the approval of the Colonial Office, over 1,000 European troops of the Rhodesia Regiment were flown into Nyasaland, the first arriving on 27 and 28 FebruaryC Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 105, 29.C Baker, (1998). Retreat from Empire: Sir Robert Armitage in Africa and Cyprus, p. 223. On 3 March 1959 Armitage, as governor of Nyasaland, declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Dr. Banda, the Congress president, and other members of its executive committee as well as over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Over 2,000 more were imprisoned for offences related to the emergency, including rioting and criminal damage. The stated aim of these measures was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increasing lawlessness following Dr Banda's return. However, they failed to calm the situation immediately and a significant number of Africans were killed and wounded up to 19 March.C Baker, (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28. The arrests were made as part of \\" Operation Sunrise\\", so called because the State of Emergency was declared just after midnight on 3 March and arrest squads were sent out at 4.30 am. By 6 am most principal Congress leaders had been arrested and detained, by 9 pm that day 130 had been arrested. Some were released quickly, but 72 prominent detainees, including Dr Banda, were flown to Southern Rhodesia later on 3 March. Others were detained in Nyasaland. In immediate aftermath of Operation Sunrise, 21 people were killed on 3 March.C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 40‚Äì2, 48. In the debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959, the day that the State of Emergency was declared, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, stated that it was clear from information received that Congress had planned the widespread murder of Europeans, Asians and moderate Africans, \\"... in fact, a massacre was being planned\\". This was the first public mention of a murder plot and, later in the same debate, the Minister of State at the Colonial Office, Julian Amery, reinforced what Lennox-Boyd had said with talk of a \\"... conspiracy of murder\\" and \\"a massacre ... on a Kenyan scale\\". It was subsequently difficult for ministers to repudiate these statements.C Baker, (1998). Retreat from Empire: Sir Robert Armitage in Africa and Cyprus, pp. 224‚Äì5. However, opposition politicians made allegations of collusion between the Federal Prime Minister, Welensky, and Armitage to arrest Congress supporters in order to preserve the Federation rather than to secure peace and order in Nyasaland. This was denied by the government despite Welensky providing the troops that made declaring the Emergency possible and the Colonial Office plan to eliminate Congress.C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, p. 95. Within two days of the declaration of the state of emergency, the British cabinet under Harold Macmillan decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances. In addition, a wider Royal Commission on the future of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was to be held in 1960. The chairman of the Commission of Inquiry was Patrick Devlin, who had been born in 1905 and made a High Court judge in 1948. Its three other members included a former colonial governor, the head of an Oxford College and a Scottish Lord Provost.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, p. 357. Macmillan, who was out of the country at the time, did not choose Devlin and later criticised his appointment on the basis that his Irish ancestry and Catholic upbringing made him too sympathetic to the Nyasaland African Congress. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival Armitage Report, which was prepared very quickly, mostly in the course of a weekend, so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report.A Horne, (2008) Macmillan: The Official Biography, pp. 180‚Äì1. Although Devlin had been a Conservative supporter and the other Commissioners were Conservatives party members, the Commission went about its work in a way that concerned the Nyasaland government, which had hoped that its declaration of the State of Emergency and the subsequent actions of the police and troops would be vindicated.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356‚Äì8. The Commission concentrated on three areas: the State of Emergency, the murder plot and African opposition to Federation. It found that the declaration of a State of Emergency was necessary to restore order and prevent a descent into anarchy, but it criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops, including burning houses, destroying property and beatings. It also found that the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism and of support for Congress justified calling it being called a \\"police state\\". Its strongest criticism was over the \\"murder plot\\", which it said not exist, and it condemned the use made of it by both the Nyasaland and British governments in trying to justify the Emergency. It also declared that Banda had no knowledge of the inflammatory talk of some Congress activists about attacking Europeans. Finally, it noted the almost universal rejection of Federation by Nyasaland's African people and suggested the British government should negotiate with African leaders on the country's constitutional future.J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966, pp. 356, 359.C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40‚Äì1. The Armitage Report A few days after Devlin arrived in Nyasaland, Armitage received advice from the Colonial Office on the action to be followed when a Governor dissented from the findings of a Commission of Inquiry, and was told that he could dissent if he felt it was justified. At the end of May, Armitage thought the Commission was satisfied that the State of Emergency was necessary, but that it did not accept that there was a massacre plot, and that it had concentrated on the use of firearms and the burning of houses by government forces, ignoring events leading up to such incidents. He suspected that the Commission's report would be highly critical. The Commission's use of the phrase \\"a police state\\" caused deep offence, particularly as it was placed on the first page of his report. Armitage was incensed by this allegation, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd, thought the claim was grossly unfair.C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 41‚Äì2. In May and June 1959, a number of issues caused Armitage and the Colonial Office concerns, in case the Devlin Commission should take note of them in producing its report. The most significant was the publication of the Nyasaland Government Information Department‚Äôs Bulletin, which stated that it was ‚Äú‚Ä¶the government‚Äôs intention to clean the country of Congress now and keep it clean always‚Ä¶‚Äù, a reference to the political objective in declaring the State of Emergency, which both British and Nyasaland governments had consistently deniedC Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959p. 139 The Colonial Office obtained an early draft of the Commission's report and passed a copy to Armitage, which he used to prepare a document attacking its findings. Armitage and two senior Nyasaland civil servants then flew to London, where they joined a high level working party which drafted a despatch, often known as the Armitage Report, to counter the Devlin Report.C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 36‚Äì8. The working party consisted of three British ministers, Julian Amery, Reginald Manningham-Buller, the Attorney-General and Lord Kilmuir the Lord Chancellor and senior civil servants, together with Armitage and his two aides. It met at Chequers on 18 July 1959 and worked through the weekend to consider the British government‚Äôs response to the draft of the Devlin Report it had.C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959 pp. 154-5 In the Commons debate on the Devlin Report, the government noted that the Commission had found the declaration of a State of Emergency justified, but it attacked their use of the expression \\"police state\\" and its rejection of any talk about killings and beatings of Europeans as no more than rhetoric. The government also minimised Devlin's criticisms of handcuffing and gagging prisoners, burning houses and other illegal acts on the grounds of necessity. It made full use of the Armitage Report to support its attack, claiming it represented the considered views of Nyasaland-based officials with a better grasp if realities than a Commission that visited Nyasaland only briefly. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the government had the right and a duty to reject any of the Devlin Commission's conclusions or recommendations where it disagreed with them, and used this argument to justify accepting only what little in its report was favourable and rejecting all that was unfavourable, instead of rejecting the whole report.C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40‚Äì4. The opposition rejected the claim that the government did not have to accept the conclusions of the Commission on the basis that it had set out the relevant facts objectively and that it made no recommendations.Hansard (1959). House of Commons, Vol. 610 Columns 336-338, 343. The Devlin Report is the only example of a British judge examining whether the actions of a colonial administration in suppressing dissent were appropriate.C Parkinson, (2007) Bills of Rights and Decolonization, p. 36. The Nyasaland government had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have been very difficult. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice.C Baker, (1997). Nyasaland, 1959: A Police State? p. 23. Armitage, on the other hand, was discredited. Iain Macleod saw Armitage as an obstacle to rapid constitutional advancement, and he was advised to go on leave pending retirement in August 1960. Glyn Smallwood Jones became acting Governor until Armitage retired in April 1961.C Baker, (2000). Sir Glyn Jones: a proconsul in Africa, p. 90. References Sources *C Baker, (1993).

She represented Hungary in many international team matches. She reached the quarterfinal of the Wimbledon doubles event in 1939. Early life and family Somogyi was born in 1913 in Arad. Her great-great-grandfather was cavalry captain in the Anglo-German legion of the Napoleonic Wars. Her great- grandfather J√≥zsef Somogyi (1807‚Äì1872) was a Honv√©d Major from Marosv√°s√°rhely who fought in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Her father was Jen≈ë Somogyi, an architect, who designed the Traian bridge in Arad. She fell in love with tennis at the age of fifteen. She studied in a German school in Sibiu (Szeben). At the age of seventeen she finished third in the second class mixed doubles at Cluj. Meanwhile, the Treaty of Trianon had transferred her region from Hungary to Romania, and she had to move to Budapest in 1938 to further compete for Hungary. Tennis career In 1928 she found early success in the Romanian national championships where she finished second in doubles and third in mixed doubles. By 1932 she was already a two-time Romanian national champion. She clinched two more consecutive national mixed doubles titles up to 1937 with the same pair Arnulf Schmidt. After moving to Hungary she was crowned Hungarian National Champion as well in singles in 1938 and 1939 and doubles in 1939 and 1944. Her first international challenge came at the Central Europe Tennis Team Cup, which Hungary grabbed after an overwhelming victory over Italy. Somogyi had an easy match against Wally San Donnino. On international individual level her breakthrough came in the 1937 edition of the German International Championships doubles, a semifinal accomplishment alongside Vittoria Tonolli, which was only spoiled by her opponents Madzy Rollin Couquerque and Hilde Krahwinkel preventing her the final. At the same tournament she was a mixed doubles quarterfinalist with Hungarian champion partner Ott√≥ Szigeti. In early 1939 she reached the final of the German Covered Courts tournament in Bremen only being defeated by Grace Wheeler, the same occurred in the doubles where Wheeler and Hamel triumphed over Somogyi and Kov√°cs. The same year she reached the mixed quarterfinals of the Queen's Club Championships teaming with Szigeti but lost to Henner Henkel and Wheeler. Next week at the Wimbledon Championships they were dropped out in the early second round by Cam Malfroy and Betty Nuthall. Although Somogyi found success in the Ladies' doubles where she and Wheeler lost only to first-seeded Sarah Fabyan and Alice Marble. A month later in the German International Championships in Hamburg she was a doubles quarterfinalist and a singles semifinalist. In the latter she met Krahwinkel and lost in straight sets. In August she competed in B√•stad where she came short against Wheeler in the singles championship match but were victorious in the doubles partnering her. Still in August she played a final in Ostende losing to eventual champion to Madzy Rollin Couquerque in three struggling sets. Somogyi got tired for the third set after Rollin Couquerque broke her baseline gameplan with a smart netplay and forced her to run from corner to corner. She got less lucky in the doubles only reaching the semifinal stage. Personal life She married and had a daughter named Judit. During the Siege of Budapest the family hid in the humid basement to survive the air strikes. Her joints got cold, and as a result of the relating health issues including arthritis, she was unable to play any more and subsequently abandoned tennis. Because of her alleged German affiliation like participating in the wartime German Championships and having German language knowledge she was labelled as \\"untrustworthy\\", a term used to people who had some sort of German connection by the government of the People's Republic of Hungary. Thus she couldn't find a job and so started a small weaving business. She moved to Velence and got involved in self- supporting agriculture. After her husband's death she went back to Hegyvid√©k and lived there for the rest of her life.

Plot The story takes place in Capernaum and Jerusalem during the two years leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and follows the lives of Judas Iscariot (Arthur Maude) and Mary Magdalene (Constance Crawley), who indulge in their own selfish pursuits and care little about the plights of others. But when Mary hears Jesus preach an outdoor sermon, she learns the power of Christ's love and abandons her reckless ways to become one of his most ardent followers. Production Charles Urban, the Anglo-British promoter of the Kinemacolor process of making color motion pictures, acquired worldwide rights to Maurice Maeterlinck's play Mary Magdalene with plans to produce a color film. Maeterlinck's mistress Georgette Leblanc, who had appeared in the title role of the original production of play, was retained to star in the movie. Although Urban planned an Autumn 1913 release in London, and actual filming did take place in Europe, a final product never reached the screen. Instead, Aubrey Kennedy of Kennedy Features in Los Angeles, California, released his own version of Mary Magdalene in February 1914 that was filmed at cameraman James Crosby's J.A.C. Studio near downtown Los Angeles. Kennedy Features sought investors (state- right buyers) for the film by advertising that Mary Magdalene was \\"a stupendous production that will create a sensation wherever shown.\\" One theater ad that appeared after the 4 February 1914 release of the film even billed it as \\"the most magnificent melodramatic feature America has ever seen.\\" Although reviews of the film were generally positive, and it was still being shown in theaters as late as November 1915, little mention of Mary Magdalene appears in motion picture trade journals such as The Moving Picture World and Motography in the months after the film was released.The following trade journals make virtually no mention of the film in the months following its February 1914 release: Motography (Jan-Jun 1914), v. 11; Motography (Jul- Dec 1914), v. 12; Motography (Jan-Jun 1915), v. 13; and The Moving Picture World 1914 Cast *Constance Crawley as Mary Magdalene *Arthur Maude as Canis Proculas *William Nigh as Syrius Superbus *Joe Harris as Judas Iscariot *Jefferson Osborne Notes and references External links * Category:American silent short films Category:1914 films Category:Portrayals of Mary Magdalene in film Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film Category:American films Category:Films based on the Gospels Category:American films based on plays Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films based on works by Maurice Maeterlinck Category:Films set in Jerusalem Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"Mary Magdalene (1914 film)"},{"id":"40031066","text":"Ionu»õ Ursu (born 21 March 1989) is a Romanian footballer who plays as a centre back for Liga II club Farul Constan»õa.Un nou funda≈ü la Farul!

Prolacertoides means 'like Prolacerta', in reference to Prolacerta, another genus of archosauromorph which Prolacertoides was once believed to have been closely related to. Prolacertoides is known from a single partial skull, IVPP V3233, which was discovered in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The locality of its discovery belongs to the Cangfanggou Group of the Jiucaiyuan Formation, which is dated to the Induan age of the very early Triassic.  Description  A reconstruction of the skull of Prolacertoides IVPP V3233 is a partially flattened and incomplete skull, with some bones being well preserved and others being badly damaged. The snout is tapering and lacks antorbital fenestrae. The anterodorsal edge of each maxilla is convex, in contrast to the concave edge of other basal archosauromorphs. The ascending process of each maxilla is tall and anteroposteriorly broad, reaching the edge of the skull roof. The anterior process of each jugal is long and thin, forming the lower edge of the orbit, unlike in basal saurians. A moderate number of maxillary teeth (approximately 19) are present, but the tooth row does not reach as far back as the orbits. The teeth themselves are straight, conical, and lack serrations, with only the rear teeth being slightly compressed. The nares are long and situated on the edge of the snout. Each nasal widens towards the rear of the skull, forming an anterolaterally-oriented suture with the prefrontal. Each lacrimal is wide and slit-like while the prefrontals are well exposed, traits similar to those of Prolacerta. Each prefrontal is dorsally smooth and convex, possessing a large lateral pit as well as a triangular medial projection which restricts the nasal-frontal suture. This restriction is also found in Trilophosaurus and Gephyrosaurus. Unlike in Prolacerta and basal archosauriforms, there is extensive contact between the pterygoids. The pterygoids and palatines were seemingly toothless, although this observance may be due to poor preservation. The tip of each ectopterygoid expands into a fan-shaped structure, and the suborbital fenestra is very short.  Classification  Prolacertoides was named in 1973 and classified in the family Prolacertidae. The first phylogenetic analyses to include Prolacertoides (published in 1988 and 1997) found it to be more closely related to the Late Triassic archosauromorph Trilophosaurus rather than prolacertids. Another analysis published in 1997 included Prolacertoides but its relationships with other archosauromorphs could not be resolved because few distinctive anatomical characteristics are known. The exact relationships of Prolacertoides were still considered unknown in 2007. Prolacertoides was redescribed in a 2016 study of archosauromorph and archosauriform systematics. The study also included a set of phylogenetic analyses in an effort to clarify the classification of certain archosauromorphs. However, the large amount of missing data for Prolacertoides forced it to be excluded from most of the analyses, which focused on more complete taxa. The phylogenetic analyses which did include Prolacertoides found that it was an archosauromorph forming a polytomy with Allokotosauria, Tanystropheidae, and Jesairosaurus. In more precise analyses which exclude incomplete or problematic taxa such as Prolacertoides, this polytomy was resolved, with Allokotosauria forming a clade with more advanced archosauromorphs (such as rhynchosaurs and archosauriforms), and Tanystropheidae forming a more basal clade with Jesairosaurus. Due to its omission from these more specific analyses, it is unclear whether Prolacertoides is closer to Allokotosauria or the Tanystropheidae-Jesairosaurus clade. Nevertheless, Prolacertoides was not found in any analysis to be a particularly close relative of its namesake Prolacerta.

Nationwide this region features the highest density of star-rated restaurants, similar to the neighbouring region Alsace which does the same for France. Due to the physio-geographical situation, the Upper Rhine Plain with Germany's warmest climate, fruitful volcanic soils, already in the Roman period used medicinal springs and spas with very good infrastructural features, the proximity to France and Switzerland Baden had better prerequisites to develop a high quality gastronomy than Wurttemberg or Bavaria. Special plant crops such as tobacco, wine, fruit and horticulture are of supranational importance and offer the inhabitants and visitors a diverse and wide selection of local products. Asparagus and chestnuts are as skilfully used in the kitchen as tripe and escargot and a variety of fruity desserts and pastries is provided for the traditional German \\"Kaffee und Kuchen\\" (lit. \\"coffee and cake\\", similar to the British tea time). Considering these important gastronomical traditions it may be surprising how small the amount of dishes is that are really specifically and distinctively from Baden. First of all it does evince great regional differences and many basic recipes and ingredients were adapted and modified from neighbouring countries. This happened with an ease that is much greater as in other German regional cuisines and as one of the greatest influences came from the French cuisine, the cuisine of Baden is lighter than the cuisines of e.g. Swabia, the Palatinate or Bavaria which feature heartier dishes and have a peasant background. Genuinely from Baden are the high quality and broad selection of local products and pronounced culinary tradition that incorporates and combines many different influences. The Baden cuisine indulges in fruit, herbs and vegetables, game, poultry, fish, smoked products and sausages, wine, Edelbrand, beer and juices from local producers. Sp√§tzle and egg pasta are prepared with more egg than in neighbouring Swabia. The legend tells that the traditional and internationally famous Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte was first prepared in the city of T√ºbingen (which is in Wurttemberg) but is based on a simple but very tasty dessert from the Black Forest featuring cherries, Kirschwasser and cream. The bohemian, home-cooking Baden cuisine did incorporate many influences from the Alsace and Switzerland. Specialities such as Baeckeoffe and Flammkuchen, Sauerkraut or Sch√§ufele are as famous for Baden as for the Alsace and in both region it is typical to use much flour and fat in the recipes. The unusual combination of sweet and hearty dishes was adapted from Palatine cuisine as was the generous usage of many different wines in a meal.

Published in 2013, it is Barry's fifth novel, following Machine Man, published two years earlier. Plot summary In a school in Virginia, children are taught the art of persuasion instead of usual subjects. They learn in detail how to handle the power of language to control other individuals by breaking them down into psychographic markers. The most successful students graduate and join a nameless, powerful and secretive organization whose members are called \\"poets\\". This society believes that revealing one's identities and feelings is extremely dangerous because it can make the mind susceptible to manipulation. Emily Ruff, a witty orphan from San Francisco, is recruited by members of the organization and taken to the school. After passing the strange and rigorous entrance exams, she is taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell, who have adopted pseudonyms to conceal their true identities. Emily gradually becomes a prodigy in the school, until she commits the fatal mistake of falling in love. Wil Jamieson, an apparently innocent man, is ambushed by two men in an airport bathroom, who claim that he is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets. Wil eventually discovers that his entire past is a lie and must travel to the decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia to uncover the truth about who he is. At the point in which Emily's and Wil's narratives conjoin, the shocking plot of the poets is revealed in full, the number of deaths increases, and the world nears a crisis event in which all language will become meaningless.

Biography El Feki was born in Great Britain to a Welsh mother and an Egyptian father. She grew up in Canada, visiting her grandmother in Cairo on a regular basis. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a BSc in immunology in 1991, then obtaining an MPhil and PhD in immunology from the University of Cambridge, she joined The Economist as healthcare correspondent in 1998. After the 2001 WTC terror attacks, she learned Arabic and started to research the Middle East, in particular, the issues of emancipation and women's sexuality, spending much of her time in Egypt. In 2005, she left the Economist, and from 2006 to 2008, she hosted weekly shows, People & Power and The Pulse, on Al Jazeera International. From 2010 to 2012, she was vice- chairwoman of the United Nations‚Äô Global Commission on H.I.V. and the Law. In 2013, El Feki published Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World, which has been translated into Dutch, Bahasa Indonesia, French and German, with Spanish and Arabic translations forthcoming. \\"Sex and the Citadel\\" has been nominated for the Guardian First Book Award and The Orwell Prize; El Feki's TED talk on sexuality in the Arab region has received almost 1 million views since 2014. The book surveys sexual attitudes of women and men in Egypt and the wider Arab world, and presents results of her five years of research. El Feki concludes that taboos around sexuality are starting to be challenged in the Arab societies, and that such debates in personal life are key to change in the politics, economics and the broader public sphere. However, she warns that such change comes \\"by evolution, not revolution\\" over a generation at least.

The peak lies east of Mount Degenhardt, and east of Inspiration Peak. The subpeak known as East McMillan Spire () is east of McMillan Spire and they are collectively referred to as the McMillan Spires. The Terror Glacier lies to the west of the peak. Climate McMillan Spire is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Optical braille recognition is the act of capturing and processing images of braille characters into natural language characters. It is used to convert braille documents for people who cannot read them into text, and for preservation and reproduction of the documents. History In 1984, a group of researchers at the Delft University of Technology designed a braille reading tablet, in which a reading head with photosensitive cells was moved along set of rulers to capture braille text line-by-line. In 1988, a group of French researchers at the Lille University of Science and Technology developed an algorithm, called Lectobraille, which converted braille documents into plain text. The system photographed the braille text with a low-resolution CCD camera, and used spatial filtering techniques, median filtering, erosion, and dilation to extract the braille. The braille characters were then converted to natural language using adaptive recognition. The Lectobraille technique had an error rate of 1%, and took an average processing time of seven seconds per line. In 1993, a group of researchers from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven developed a system to recognize braille that had been scanned with a commercially available scanner. The system, however, was unable to handle deformities in the braille grid, so well-formed braille documents were required. In 1999, a group at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University implemented an optical braille recognition technique using edge detection to translate braille into English or Chinese text. In 2001, Murray and Dais created a handheld recognition system, that scanned small sections of a document at once. Because of the small area scanned at once, grid deformation was less of an issue, and a simpler, more efficient algorithm was employed. In 2003, Morgavi and Morando designed a system to recognize braille characters using artificial neural networks. This system was noted for its ability to handle image degradation more successfully than other approaches. Challenges Many of the challenges to successfully processing braille text arise from the nature of braille documents. Braille is generally printed on solid-color paper, with no ink to produce contrast between the raised characters and the background paper. However, imperfections in the page can appear in a scan or image of the page. Many documents are printed inter- point, meaning they are double-sided. As such, the depressions of the braille of one side appear interlaid with the protruding braille of the other side. Techniques Some optical braille recognition techniques attempt to use oblique lighting and a camera to reveal the shadows of the depressions and protrusions of the braille. Others make use of commercially available document scanners.

The film was released on June 10, 2016, by Starz Digital. Its plot is heavily inspired by the 1981 movie Body Heat. Plot Doug Martin (Nick Jonas) is a young adult spending the summer with his parents at their lake house. When rich investment banker Elliot Harper (Dermot Mulroney) moves in next door, Doug finds himself immediately drawn to Elliot's young wife, Lena Harper (Isabel Lucas). Elliot hires Doug to work on his sailboat, and this gives Doug an excuse to interact with Lena, who is often alone due to Elliot traveling for business. Eventually Lena and Doug begin an affair, starting with Doug losing his virginity to Lena. Lena gets them pre- paid cellphones to communicate on, and constantly warns Doug about Elliot's possessive and jealous nature. Lena also shows signs of physical abuse, which she says are from Elliot. One night Lena calls Doug over to house, where he finds Elliot dead on the floor. Lena claims he attacked her and she accidentally killed him when she fought back. After some major trepidation on Doug's part, Lena convinces him to help her cover up her part in Elliot's death. Soon after an insurance investigator named Angie Alvarez (Kandyse McClure) shows up to investigate Elliot's death, due to the large settlement of 10 million dollars Lena is now set to receive from his life insurance. Suspicion quickly falls on Doug, and he grows nervous from the increased attention on him by both Angie and the town Sheriff (Paul Sorvino). Eventually he realizes that Lena has been manipulating him this whole time, intending to frame him for Elliot's murder; she claims that instead of a consensual affair Doug had been stalking her and raped her, and then killed Elliot in a jealous rage. Doug's attempts to prove his innocence are thwarted at every turn, presumably by Lena. For example, a gardener of the Harper's who had seen Doug and Lena together turns up murdered before the police can talk to him. With the police ready to arrest him and with Lena having received the insurance money, Doug follows her to a hotel she is at with Angie, intending to retrieve one of the pre-paid cellphones he and Lena used from her person for evidence. It is there that Doug realizes that Angie is actually Lena's lover and has been her accomplice since the beginning. At first it seems that Lena will leave Doug to take the rap, however in a last gesture of love she decides to leave Doug the cell phone, which contains the exonerating evidence he needs. Angie and Lena flee the country on a private plane. In the closing voice-over, Doug explains how he was eventually sent to prison, but on reduced charges for a short period of time. Lena and Angie are still on the run. He contemplates if he would do it all over again.

Located in the south unit of the park, Snowfield Peak is east of the summit known as Horsemans Pack and the Neve Glacier descends from the north slopes of the mountain. Climate Snowfield Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, p. 15 Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Snowfield Peak seen from the south near Isolation Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The site is the location of an abandoned American Civil War fort on the south side of the James River across from Fort Eustis/Mulberry Point. It was named for Major General Benjamin Huger, commander of the Confederate States Army's Department of Norfolk at the time it was built. Fort Huger was an integral part of the Confederate Army's James River defenses in late summer 1861 through spring 1862. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History Fort Huger's site on Harden's Bluff (or Hardin's/Hardy's Point)Fort Huger (2) at American Forts Network was selected by Virginia's state engineer Colonel Andrew Talcott in August 1861 to supplement Fort Boykin, also on the south bank of the James, and the Mulberry Point battery on the north bank. The fort was also designed by him.Fort Huger (2) at FortWiki.com Construction began immediately under Capt. E.T.D. Myers and Capt. John Clarke. The fort was completed in March 1862 with positions for 15 guns, 13 of which were occupied. A Confederate Engineer Bureau report of March 12, 1862 lists one 10-inch columbiad, four 9-inch Dahlgren shell guns, two 8-inch columbiads (all on barbette carriages) and six hot-shot 32-pounders on ship carriages. All of these weapons were smoothbores. The fort included a hot-shot furnace and was enclosed at the back by an earthen wall facing a swamp. The garrison was Lt. Col. Fletch Archer's 5th Virginia Infantry Battalion. This included two companies as artillery in the fort and three companies as infantry outside the fort. There was confusion of command at the fort between Archer and CSA Capt. De Lagnel, a former naval officer who commanded the fort's artillery companies. Generals John B. Magruder and Robert E. Lee wrote letters to address this confusion, essentially placing Archer in overall command and De Lagnel in charge of the artillery. Correspondence between Lt. Col. Henry Cabell and Brigadier General Lafayette McLaws indicated other deficiencies at the fort. There was no \\"clear zone\\" in the woods behind it that attackers would have to cross under fire, wooden structures in the fort might catch fire under bombardment, and there were no bomb-proof shelters. The lack of proper fortress carriages for the 32-pounders was also a deficiency, and the gun crews were not being drilled in reloading their weapons. In April 1862 Capt. J. M. Maury took command of the fort's artillery.Fort Huger Project at Archaeological Consultants of Carolinas, Inc. On May 8, 1862 Fort Huger was attacked by a Union Navy squadron that also attacked Fort Boykin. The warships included USS Galena, Aroostook, and Port Royal under Commander John Rodgers as part of the Peninsula campaign, an unsuccessful Union offensive from Fort Monroe to Richmond. Fort Boykin was soon silenced and abandoned, as its guns lacked the range to reply to the bombardment.Fort Boykin at American Forts Network The Union ran low on ammunition firing against Fort Huger and withdrew, but returned on the 16th reinforced by the ironclads USS Monitor and USRC Naugatuck. This bombardment resulted in the Confederates spiking their guns and abandoning Fort Huger. A report by Union Navy Lt. John Waters after examining the fort showed that many of the concerns noted in mid-March were addressed, including clearing the woods behind the fort and building bomb- proofs. Present The site was acquired by Isle of Wight County Parks and Recreation in 2005 and opened to the public as a park in 2007. Archaeological investigations are ongoing. Five replicas of Civil War-era cannons are at the fort.

Artistry Although she exhibited in many of the venues of her contemporaries, such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes, she maintained an independent trajectory. Although her techniques varied widely, she was best known for her paintings and drawings of nature, especially fruit, flowers, vegetables and tubers. In his book, critic Enrique F. Gual states that her work has ‚Äúa deep affinity with surrealism, through which the author is able to extract a special metaphysics from her themes, to crown the universal panorama of Mexican still life.‚Äù References Category:1937 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century Mexican painters Category:20th-century Mexican women artists Category:Mexican women painters Category:People from Campeche City ","title":"Olga Dond√©"},{"id":"40032078","text":"Battisborough Cross is a village in the parish of Holbeton near Plymouth on the south coast of Devon, England .

According to The Guardian, Cloud Peak Energy Inc was responsible for 0.1% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions from 1988-2015. In May 2019, Cloud Peak Energy filed for bankruptcy. An analyst pointed to severe declines in demand for Powder River coal from markets in East Asia and the United States. Operations The firm operates three open pit mines from thick deposits in Wyoming and Montana. Crow Nation The firm has contracted with the Crow Nation to mine 20 million tons of coal annually on its reservation for shipment by rail to coal terminals in the Pacific Northwest for shipment to Asia.

The facilities of Cloud Peak's Spring Creek Mine are located directly to the east of the reservation and will be available for the use of Big Metal.  Funding of climate change denial  Documents that have become public after the bankruptcy show that the company has funded several organizations that are known for spreading climate change denial. Among them are the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that denies the scientific consensus on climate change and opposes renewable energy, the Center for Consumer Freedom, the pro- fossil American Legislative Exchange Council, which says that climate change is uncertain, the Montana Policy Institute which claims that earth is cooling, Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, dark-money-groups such as Crossroads GPS and several other groups and organizations.

It is known for its former abundance of East African mahogany trees as well as being home to a population of chimpanzees. An exceptionally large mahogany tree is still found here, and is more than 80 meters tall and some 20 meters in circumference. Setting and conservation The area, situated between 1¬∞ 37 N - 2¬∞ 03 N and 31¬∞ 22 - 31¬∞ 46 E, is 435 km¬≤ in extent and is composed mainly of moist, medium-altitude, semi-deciduous forest, with patches of savanna and woodland. It covers a gently rolling landscape, sloping down to the East African Rift. Four streams, Waisoke, Sonso, Kamirambwa and Siba, drain the forest and flow into Lake Albert. Annual rainfall in the area is between 1200 and 2200 mm, the rainy season being from March - May and again from September - November, the dry season being December - February. The nearest town is Masindi, and much of the land around the forest is given over to crops, dwellings and villages, placing continuous pressure on the forest margins, and leading to exploitation for building materials and bushmeat, the snares set by poachers causing mutilation of the chimpanzees and other animals. The mahogany trees that still remain are cut and removed by itinerant pit sawyers. Wildlife Recorded from Budongo are more than 360 bird species, some 290 butterflies, 130 moths, 465 trees, and 24 mammals, of which 9 are primates. Chimpanzee tracking has become an activity popular with eco-tourists, necessitating behavioural guidelines for visitors in order to avoid undue disturbance of both animals and forest. Trails have been cut criss-crossing the forest, initially to ease access for research workers and since then used by eco-tourists, forest animals and poachers. Wildlife research Vernon Reynolds first studied chimpanzees in this forest in 1962 and he eventually founded the Budongo Conservation Field Station.http://www.budongo.org/ He wrote a book about the forest and its chimpanzees in 1965.http://www.primate- sg.org/storage/PDF/PC21.budongo.review.pdf Reynolds was one of a trio of pioneer field researchers - the others being Jane Goodall and Adriaan Kortlandt. During the 1970s and 1980s civil war raged in the country, with an accompanying breakdown of law and order. Chimpanzee mothers were shot and the infants taken from the forest and smuggled to collectors in Asia, Europe and America. Reynolds returned to Uganda in 1990 to determine whether a viable population of chimpanzees still existed in Budongo. By 1995 some fifty individuals had been identified, and this figure remained constant until 2000 when the numbers started rising, thought to be due to an influx of chimpanzees from other areas. The research team renovated and occupied buildings that had been constructed for the Budongo Sawmills Ltd. In 2005 funding for the project was provided by the RZSS at Edinburgh Zoo, as well as a number of other sources. The Budongo Forest Project became a Ugandan NGO and was renamed the Budongo Conservation Field Station.http://www.murchisonfallsnationalpark.com/budongo-forest-uganda.html Richard Byrne, Cat Hobaiter and colleagues have been based at the Field Station to studying chimpanzee communication in the twenty-first century.

It was directed and written by Andrew P. Jones. The film premiered on July 20, 2013 at the Goodrich Capital 8 Theaters in Jefferson City, Missouri where most of the movie was filmed. Plot A ghost hunting crew from Los Angeles, California is told by their boss, Ms. Simon, that if they are not able to better their ratings, their show, Ghost Sightings will be cancelled. The crew is visited by a man named Mr. Gaffney, who tells the leader of the crew, Joel, that he knows of property back home where he fears evil spirits haunt the halls and attack humans. Mr. Gaffney asks them to get rid of the ghosts, though Joel tries to explain to him that they only investigate them and getting rid of ghosts is much more difficult. The crew travels to the area and they stop at a restaurant before heading to the haunted location, which is revealed to be an abandoned prison. Once at the prison, they are given a tour by Clive, a former worker. He also warns the crew to leave and not to proceed with their investigation. Clive tells them the story of a prisoner escaping from his cell and murdering another inmate by snapping his neck before biting off flesh. Clive then takes the crew down to the infirmary where he tells the story of a doctor who paralyzed his inmate patients and then performed illegal experiments on them in hopes to fix their psyche. He explains that the legend says the doctor was eventually sent to prison himself and was killed by the inmates. The crew then begins their overnight investigation of the prison. When investigating the cell block, Roger is attacked by the ghost of a former prisoner. The ghost possesses Roger's body and creates large gashes and bruises on the side of his head. Berger and Joel rush Roger back to the video control room with Kate and decide to leave the prison, but discover that they are chain-locked in. They bandage up Roger, but realize that they don't have enough medical supplies, so they decide to go to the infirmary, where Berger is also attacked by ghosts and taken away. Joel goes back to Kate and they decide it's best to go look for Berger, then come back for Roger. Kate is attacked by ghosts while searching for Berger in the cell block, but escapes by using a new device Roger purchased that disrupts ghost energy. The ghost possesses Roger's body, cornering Kate and Joel on the third floor of the prison. The ghosts want the crew to bring them the doctor who tortured them. Joel and Kate try to tell the ghost that the doctor had been killed, but the ghost ignores them. Roger fights internally with the ghost and is able to speak with Joel and Kate, telling them that he can't have them hurt on his watch and ultimately hangs himself. After mourning the loss of Roger, Joel and Kate begin their search for Berger again, finding him near the entryway. He tells Joel and Kate that he may have found a second way out. They follow Berger to an area of the grounds outside the prison, though still fenced in. Kate is able to find a signal on her cell phone out there and calls the police. The next morning, the crew is let out of the prison and confronts Clive for locking them inside, but he insists it was not him. After the paramedics and police leave the area, the crew calls in Mr. Gaffney and asks him to come inside the prison to see if he notices any difference in the energy. He walks inside and explains that it felt different from the time he worked there. It is revealed that Mr. Gaffney was in the fact the doctor who tortured and sexually molested the inmates. He then begins to get angry at Joel and Kate when they explain that they did not get rid of the ghosts. After the confrontation, Joel and Kate trick Mr. Gaffney, locking him inside the prison, where the ghosts are seen dragging him away from the doors. Joel, Kate, and Berger drive back to Los Angeles and vow to end the Ghost Sightings series.

The film was shot at the local Missouri State Penitentiary, which is an abandoned prison in Jefferson City that was closed in 2004 and now runs tours, including a ghost tour where the prison is believed to be haunted to former inmates, much like in the film. In a press release held at the prison that same day, director Andrew P. Jones explained that it is very difficult to get films in theaters, so Apparitional will not be getting a theatrical release, exclaiming that the cast and crew loved Jefferson City so much that they all agreed to give the locals a date to go out and view the film in theaters before it was released to DVD. He then went on to say that the film would likely see a DVD release around July 2014.

Located in the south unit of the park, Austera Peak is about north of Klawatti Peak and the same distance south of Primus Peak. The North Klawatti Glacier, Klawatti Glacier and the north section of McAllister Glacier all descend from the slopes of Austera Peak. Austera Peak is the highpoint along an ar√™te known as Austera Towers. Climate Austera Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, p. 15 Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Austera centered with Primus Peak upper left The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He is most famous for his service on the staff of Ulysses S. Grant during the American Civil War and his subsequent three-volume biography of Grant. Badeau enjoyed a successful career as a writer, and assisted Grant with the research, fact checking, and editing when Grant authored Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. A native of New York City, Badeau was raised and educated in Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, and became clerk in the New York City Street Department while studying law. In addition to practicing after he was admitted to the bar, Badeau became a writer, and his early work as a theater critic was carried by Noah's Sunday Times. Badeau joined the Union Army during the American Civil War, and his abilities as a writer led to his prominence as a staff officer, first for Thomas W. Sherman, and later for Ulysses S. Grant. He took part in several campaigns, and rose from captain to brevet brigadier general. After the war, Badeau became the longtime U.S. Consul in London (1870-1881), and turned down appointments as a U.S. Minister in order to remain in England. From 1882 to 1884, he was the U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba. Badeau continued to work as a writer, and was a prolific contributor of essays and articles to newspapers and magazines, in addition to being the author of several books, both fiction and non-fiction. In the mid-1880s, he worked with Grant during the preparation of Grant's memoirs, but left the project before it was complete after a dispute about how much Badeau would be paid, and how he would be credited in the book for his research, fact-checking, editing, and proofreading. He later successfully sued Grant's heirs to obtain payment. Badeau died in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. Early life Parker, Badeau, Grant, Babcock, Porter Adam Badeau was born in New York City on December 29, 1831. He was first educated by private tutorsPublishers Weekly, Vol 47, 1895, p. 492 before moving to Tarrytown where he attended boarding schools. Later he moved to North Tarrytown (now Sleepy Hollow), and became a clerk in New York City's Street Department.Cutter, 1918, p. 45 He also studied law, and attained admission to the bar in 1855.Rice, 1893, p. 387 In addition, Badeau was a writer, and his work as an essayist and theater critic was published in Noah's Sunday Times.Fitch, 1916, p. 64 Family Badeau was married on April 29, 1875, to Marie Ely Niles.New York Times, April 30, 1875New York Times, May 19, 1915 Her father, Dr. Nathaniel Niles (1791-1869) was a prominent physician who served as secretary of the U.S. legation and acting charg√© d'affaires in Paris, special diplomatic agent to the Austrian Empire, and charg√© d'affaires in Sardinia.Philadelphia Times, April 30, 1875 Her grandfather, Nathaniel Niles (1741-1828) was a member of Congress from Vermont.Hemenway, 1871, p. 912 Her cousin, also named Nathaniel Niles (1835-1917), served as Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly in 1872.Sherwood, 1898, p. 124 Civil War Ulysses S. Grant & Adam Badeau In 1862, Badeau joined the Union Army during the American Civil War and was commissioned as a captain. As a member of the staff of Thomas W. Sherman, he took part in the Siege of Corinth, Mississippi, the defense of New Orleans, and the Siege of Port Hudson.Cutter, 1918, p. 46Flood & Bray, 1895, p. 235 where he was severely wounded.Mcfeely, 1981, p. 497 After his recovery, in March 1864, on the personal recommendation of Grant's adjutant, General John A. Rawlins,Fitch, 1916, p. 65 Badeau joined the staff of Ulysses S. Grant as a brevet lieutenant colonel and military secretary. During this time Badeau and Grant became close friends. Badeau took part in the Wilderness and Appomattox campaigns, and received promotion to brevet colonel.Perry, 2004, p. 72 He remained on Grant's staff until 1869, and left the Army for disability caused by his Port Hudson wound; he held the permanent rank of captain and the brevet rank of brigadier general. Post- Civil War Badeau, still on the staff of General Grant, began the first volume of a military history of the general, who vetted the manuscript as it was being written. Soon after Grant assumed the Presidency, General Badeau was sent to London and served as Secretary of Legation in the United States embassy in London, England, from May to December 1869, where he could continue working on Grant's military history. Early in the next year he was made bearer of government dispatches to Madrid, then in May he was returned to London as Consul in 1870 and served in that capacity until September, 1881. and U.S. During that time he was granted a leave of absence from 1877 to 1878, when he accompanied Grant on a portion of Grant's trip around the world.Twain, 2010, p. 477 While Badeau lived in England, he received Grant as a visitor on several occasions during the trip.Young, 1879Remlap, 1885, pp. 45, 52 In 1875 Badeau was nominated as Minister to Belgium,Journal of the Senate, 1875, p. 69 and in 1881 he received appointment as Minister to Denmark,The School Herald, The Senatorial Resignations, Vol 1, p.66 but he declined both. From 1882 to 1884 he was U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba.Hope Valley Advertiser, April 3, 1895 Badeau resigned this appointment after alleging that officials in the State Department were corrupt in their dealings with Cuba and Spain, and stating that the department took no action after he made his charges.New York Times, April 15, 1884Baltimore Sun, April 17, 1884 Badeau then aided Grant in the preparation of Grant's memoirs, but Grant dismissed him before the book was finished after they argued over the details of the legal agreement specifying how much Badeau would be paid and how he would be credited for his editing, research and fact checking.Brands, 2012, p. 625 A bitter quarrel lay behind the creation of this agreement - one that would continue even after Grant's death. Grant was surprised when Badeau expressed his complaints and made demands of Grant. Among other concerns, Badeau had two main points of contention with Grant. The first, having committed much of his time and effort in assisting Grant, Badeau maintained that he had been detained from many of his other involvements for several months. The second, realizing that Grant's memoirs was going to be a monumental success, he feared that his multi-volume work on Grant would be obscured in the wake of their publication and release. Grant had earlier thought that it would be unfair to publish anything that would detract from Badeau's work.White, 2016, p. 645 : Grant signed on 7 February 1885. A month later Badeau added his signature, and recorded the receipt of Grant's first payment: \\"Received of Genl. U. S. Grant $250, my share of $1,000 received by him this day on account of his book. 3 East 66th St. New York. March 2, 1885.\\" As Grant's Memoirs approached completion, having benefited from Badeau's extensive rewriting and additions to its earlier sections, he became convinced that sales would likely go far higher than the $30,000 envisioned in this agreement. With Grant failing badly, Badeau proposed a new arrangement in April 1885: he would complete the work at the price of $1,000 a month, plus 10% of the profits. Grant thought the offer too advantageous to Badeau and was additionally annoyed by press leaks that painted Badeau as the true author of the forthcoming work. Grant broke off relations with his long-time aide and refused to pay him the $10,000 called for in their agreement. When the sales of the Memoirs skyrocketed past $30,000‚Äîthey eventually brought $450,000‚ÄîBadeau sued to get his money. Eventually Mrs. Grant paid him the originally agreed upon $10,000 plus interest of $1,200 (see Brooks D. Simpson article on Badeau in American National Biography). (He subsequently settled with Grant's son Frederick for $10,000, or about $250,000 in 2012 dollars.)New York Times, October 31, 1888 Author and editorialist Badeau was acquainted with many famous people and celebrities of his day, including Ulysses S. Grant and Edwin Booth.Shattuck, 1969, p. 18 He was a prolific author of both fiction and non-fiction, and besides newspaper columns and magazine articles, his works included: The Vagabond (1859);Badeau, 1859, The Vagabond, title page a three volume Military History of Ulysses S.

Stanton, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, and others.Badeau, 1987, Grant in Peace: From Appomattox to Mount McGregor, title page Badeau wrote for the New York Sunday times under the assumed name, The Vagabond. Final years Illustration of Adam Badeau in later years In his final years Badeau continued writing, frequently contributing to various magazines and periodicals and chronicled the various war time events he participated in. His frequent involvement as a writer caused strain on his eyes and he soon developed cataracts during the winter of 1894-1895 where he subsequently underwent successive operations for their removal, which undermined his physical strength. He finally succumbed to apoplexy, and died suddenly on March 19, 1895, in Ridgewood, New Jersey, at the age of 63New York Times, March 21, 1895 and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery's Old Dutch Churchyard, Section D, Lot 65.

She had previously been Le Superbe, a 56-gun warship of the French Navy, until her capture off Lizard Point by in July 1710. Commissioned into the Royal Navy in September 1710, HMS Superb served throughout Queen Anne's War and the War of the Quadruple Alliance, during which she participated in the destruction of the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Passaro in 1718. She was broken up in 1732. Construction Le Superbe was designed by Pierre Blaise Coulomb and constructed between August 1708 and March 1709 at Lorient, a French naval base on the coast of Brittany in north-west France. She was launched on 12 December 1708 and measured along her gundeck, had a beam of and drew from at the bow, to at the stern. With a depth in the hold of , she had a capacity of 1,020 tons (bm). Career (Royal Navy) On 29 July 1710 Le Superbe was captured off The Lizard by HMS Kent. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Superb on 23 September 1710 and sailed under Commander, later Captain, William Elford. In 1711 she passed to Captain James Moneypenny and was ordered to the Mediterranean. In September 1712, HMS Superb together with , and , assisted Admiral John Jennings with the landing of troops at Barcelona before being sent to Genoa with dispatches. In May 1713 she sailed with from Sicily to Leghorn via Naples before being ordered home later that year. On 24 September 1716, while anchored in The Downs off Deal, Superb was blown off station in a violent storm. She returned without serious damage, however, on 3 October. In 1717 HMS Superb was in the Baltic commanded by Captain George Sanders but by the middle of the following year she was back in the Mediterranean after a refit at Chatham. Under Captain Strensham Master, and attached to George Byng's fleet, Superb spent the next few months cruising and delivering dispatches before playing an active role in the Battle of Cape Passaro. =Battle of Cape Passaro= The Battle of Cape Passaro, painted in 1767 by Richard Paton. The action is shown at around 4.00pm and to the right, Superb can be seen raking the Real San Felipe as the Spanish flagship strikes her colours. On 10 August 1718 the British were off the Calabrian coast when they spotted two vessels, which they presumed to be Spanish scouts. Hoping they would lead to the main fleet, Byng ordered his ships to follow and they located the enemy at around noon. On seeing the British, the Spanish fleet turned away. To prevent losing contact with the enemy during the night, Byng sent his four fastest ships on ahead. HMS Superb, , and kept up with the Spanish fleet, who were rowing their heaviest ships in the light wind. When dawn broke the following morning, the Spanish discovered the proximity of the British and split their fleet; sending the smaller vessels, store ships, bomb ketches and fire ships towards the shore. In response, Byng sent eight ships in pursuit, including and HMS Argyll. Meanwhile Superb, Kent, Grafton and Orford, were ordered to overtake the remaining, larger, Spanish ships, which included Real San Felipe (St Philip the Royal) with Vice-Admiral Castagneta aboard. At around 1300hrs, Superb engaged the enemy flagship and two others, and a running battle ensued. After two hours Kent joined the fight and Superb was able to force the Spanish admiral to surrender. In total, 17 Spanish ships were either taken or destroyed by the British fleet. =Later career= On 3 April 1719, HMS Superb and HMS Dragon (previously HMS Ormonde), then in Menorca, were sent by Admiral Byng to join Captain Cavendish, who was charged with making peace with the Moors. While en route to rejoin Byng at Naples in August 1719 HMS Superb captured an 8-gun Spanish privateer. In April 1720, Superb was sent back to Woolwich for substantial repairs and subsequently served under Captain Arthur Field as a guard ship at Sheerness and then at Chatham. She was fitted out at Portsmouth before being sent to the West Indies in 1725, where she later joined Admiral Francis Hosier's fleet and during the Anglo-Spanish War took part in the unsuccessful blockade of Porto Bello. In 1726 Commander, later Captain, John Price took command. He died in December 1727. Captain Edward St. Lo succeeded Price, initially just as Captain of the ship but then also as Commodore of the squadron, but St Lo also died while in command, on 22 April 1729. Captain Peter Solgard took over and Superb returned to home waters at the end of hostilities, where she remained for the rest of her career. Fate Superb was taken to Woolwich in October 1732 to be rebuilt or repaired, but was instead broken up there in September 1733. The name Superb was given to a new ship, the larger but lower-rated 60-gun , launched in 1736. This ship served in the Mediterranean for much of her career but also took part in the capture of Louisburg in 1745.

It runs from Frederiksberg Town Hall Square in the south to √Ögade on the border with N√∏rrebro in the north, linking All√©gade with Jagtvej. The street takes its name from the Royal Falconry which was located in the area. Remains of the buildings are still found behind the buildings at No. 112-120\\\\. Notable buildings on the street include the Frederiksberg Centret shopping center and the Falkoner Center hotel and conference centre. History =The king's falconry= Map of Falkonerg√•rden and N√∏rre All√©enlyst and the land under these estates, c. 1805 The street was established in about 1670 as a driveway to Falkonerg√•rden, Christian V's new facility for stabling of peregrine falcons for falconry. The falcons, peregrine falcons brought home from Iceland, were used as gifts for foreign rulers by the Danish kings on their journeys abroad. The road was originally gated at each end but it was opened to the public after H√∏marken (literally \\"Hayfield\\"), an area to the north belonging to Ladeg√•rden, a farm under Copenhagen Castle, was auctioned off in lots to wealthy citizens from Copenhagen who built their country houses on the land. The Royal Falconry closed in 1810 and the last falcons were gifted to the Portuguese court. The bridge between Falkoner All√© and Jagtvej viewed from the east The Falkon√©rg√•rden property was acquired by Carl Adolph Feilberg. He initially used it as a country house but established a soap and wax candle factory at the site in 1842. The but were later torn down except for a single wing which is still seen in the alley between No. 112 and No. 120. =Late 19th-century urbanization= H.G.F. Holm The first houses along the tree-lined avenue were built around 1850, but until 1859 Falkoner All√© And Jagtvej marked the so-called Demarcation Line which enforced restrictions on construction of buildings outside Copenhagen's City Walls. An illustration from Illustreret Tidende showing the Ruben Textile Factory in 1879 The east side of the street was dominated by factories and small workshops: The Ruben Textile Factories opened in 1859 on the corner with Rolighedsvej, employing more than 500 workers by 1890. Frederiksberg Iron Foundry existed from 1872 to the mid-1950s. Further north, also on the east side between Rolighedsvej and Ladeg√•rden, was a beer garden and entertainment venue, founded in about 1850, which survived until 1907. Frederiksberg All√© School, which opened in 1865 Frederiksberg's two first public schools were built in the southern end of the street on the west side. They were joined in 1886 by Frederiksberg's first town hall which later took over the buildings. The first apartment buildings in the street were built around 1880. Many of the earliest buildings, typically just two storeys tall, were soon replaced by taller structures. By 1910, the street appeared fully developed. =20th century changes= A fairly large number of the old buildings disappeared in the middle of the 20th century to make way for modern ones. The Ruben Textile Facctory was demolished in 1938, while the old town hall and Frederiksberg Iron Foundry survived until the 1950s. Notable buildings and residents Hostrups Have anno 1936 Falkoner Center, a hotel and conference venue, has replaced Frederiksberg's old town hall on the corner with Howitzvej.

He was undefeated in three races in 1931 when he was rated the equal-best two-year-old of the year in Britain. In 1932 he was regarded as a major contender for the British Classic Races but was injured in training and was restricted to one race in late autumn. In 1933 Mannamead was unbeaten in three further races before being retired to stud. He had limited success as a sire of winners in Britain, but had more success after being exported to Hungary. He disappeared during the Soviet occupation of Hungary in 1946. Background Mannamead was a bay horse with no white markings bred by his owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. He was one of the first crop of foals sired by the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby winner Manna. His dam was Pinprick who also produced two influential broodmares: Point Duty was the ancestor of the classic winners Sodium and Ambiguity, while the descendants of So Quick include Black Caviar. Pinprick was a granddaughter of Conjure, a mare which Astor had purchased when he was still a student at Oxford University. The colt was sent into training at Manton in Wiltshire with Joseph Lawson. Racing career =1931: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old, Mannamead did not appear on the racecourse until September, but was undefeated in three races, and was never seriously challenged. He recorded an easy victory on his debut when he won the Malton Plate at York Racecourse. He then started odds-on favourite for the Clearwell Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and won by four lengths. He ended his season by winning the Autumn Foal Plate at Doncaster by three lengths. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds, he was given a weight of 133 pounds, making the equal top-rated juvenile of the year, level with his stable companion the unnamed Golden Hair colt. =1932: three-year-old season= At the end of February, Mannamead pulled up lame after a training gallop and was ruled out of competing in the British Classic Races. At the time he was the second favourite for the Derby. On his only appearance of the year he won a weight-for-age race at Manchester Racecourse in November by six lengths. =1933: four-year-old season= Mannamead returned as a four-year-old and won all three of his races. In spring he won the Chippenham Stakes and the Burwell Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket. At Royal Ascot in June he retained his unbeaten record in the Rous Memorial Stakes over one mile. The closing stages of the contest saw Mannamead and his principal rival Loaningdale racing on opposite sides of the course and the racecourse judge declared a dead heat. Despite the performances of the three-year-old Hyperion, Mannamead was described as \\"the best horse in training\\" in mid 1933. He was to be aimed at the Champion Stakes in autumn but the prevailing firm ground made him difficult to train and he was retired from racing. Stud record Mannamead was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion, starting his stud career at a fee of ¬£98. He made little impression as a sire of winners in Britain, with the best of his progeny being the Chester Vase winner Cave Man. He was sold and exported to Hungary in 1937. Mannamead was an immediate success in his new country and was champion sire with his first crop of foals. He disappeared during the Soviet occupation of Hungary which followed the Second World War.

The film only tells the biblical parts of the novel though. It was broadcast by the British Channel 4 on 31 March 1991. Background Author and director Paul Bryers wrote and directed many factually-based dramas for television, radio and theatre and adapted and directed films by outstanding playwrights such as Arthur Miller and Mikhail Bulgakov. His TV-film Incident in Judaea was the first real drama Paul Bryers ever directed and it's still one of the best experiences he‚Äôs had as a director. Bryers got a budget of ¬£230,000, which was not much, but he could work with star actors like John Woodvine, Lee Montague and Mark Rylance. Story In the novel The Master and Margarita by the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov, on which the film is based, three story lines are interwoven: a satirical story line in which Satan, called Woland here, goes to the city of Moscow in the 1930s to deal in hilarious manner with the corrupt lucky ones, bureaucrats and profiteers from the Stalin era, a second one describing the internal struggle fought by Pontius Pilate before, during and after the conviction and execution of Yeshua Ha Nozri (Jesus from Nazareth), and a third one telling the story of the love between the master, an unnamed writer in Moscow during the 1930s and his beloved Margarita, which goes to the extreme to save her master. The master has written a novel about Pontius Pilate, and is addressed by the authorities because this was an issue which in the officially atheistic Soviet Union was taboo. =Differences from the novel= The film Incident in Judaea only tells the biblical story of the novel: the story of Pontius Pilate and Yeshua Ha Nozri (Jesus from Nazareth), but follows faithfully the story and the dialogues. The film starts with the first paragraph of Chapter 2 of the novel: \\"In a white cloak with blood-red lining, with the shuffling gait of a cavalryman, early in the morning of the fourteenth day of the spring month of Nisan, there came out to the covered colonnade between the two wings of the palace of Herod the Great' the procurator of Judaea, Pontius Pilate\\".

It is possible that the site was known to Pre-Columbian Norse explorers from Greenland and Iceland. It may be in the region of Helluland, spoken of in the Icelandic sagas (Greenland Saga and Saga of Erik the Red). The Helluland Archaeology Project is a research initiative that was set up at the Canadian Museum of Civilization, now the Canadian Museum of History, to investigate the possibility of an extended Norse presence on Baffin Island with trading with the indigenous Dorset people.

After the defeat, trial and execution of Charles I, he set out on what proved to be a difficult journey to Virginia, where a cousin (Sir William Berkeley) was governor. He returned to England, became active as an agent attempting to aid Royalist uprisings, and spent a significant time imprisoned in the Tower for his pro-Royalist activities. Upon his release he was involved in Booth's Uprising and, subsequently, acted as a messenger between Charles II of England and Edward Montagu, Earl of Sandwich. He was appointed deputy governor in Dunkirk a little after the Restoration and, when Dunkirk was sold to Louis XIV of France, he was sent to Tangier, where he rose to become governor. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Gloucester 20 April 1675. He died in Leckhampton in 1689, and was buried in St Peter's Church, Leckhampton. Family and early life ;Early life and Civil War He was the second son of Henry Norwood, of West Camel, Somerset, and his wife, Elizabeth Rodney (widow of James Kirton), and was born in about 1614: His elder brother Charles was born in 1613, and his father died in 1616. Little is known of his life until, in 1637, he was admitted to the Inner Temple, listed as of Bishampton, Worcestershire. It is likely that the outbreak of the English Civil War intervened to halt a potential legal career: In 1647, Norwood's name was listed as owing debts and duties to the Inn; but on 30 May 1660, the day after the Restoration, he was finally called to the bar. Nevertheless, by then, Norwood was first and foremost a soldier, and there is no record that he was ever active as a lawyer. Norwood joined the Royalist forces in the early days of the Civil War and was commissioned in December 1642 to raise a troop in Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. In 1643, he was a Captain in Colonel Washington's force under Prince Rupert at the Storming of Bristol and appears to have remained with Washington until the surrender of Worcester in July, 1646. The garrison was given passes, on parole never to bear Arms any more against the Parliament of England, to return to their homes (or other places) or to go overseas within two months. Norwood evidently chose to go overseas: He met, in Holland, other Royalists (in particular, Majors Francis Moryson or Morrison and Richard Fox) and (according to Norwood's account) came to an agreement to pursue their fortunes in Virginia. Norwood was second cousin to the Governor of Virginia, Sir William Berkeley, their grandmothers being Margery and Elizabeth Lygon, and Moryson held a commission from Charles II as Captain of Fort Comfort (where, in fact, his brother Lieutenant Robert Moryson was already in charge). Other Norwoods had already emigrated to Virginia. Strangely, perhaps, in the light of those connections, Norwood himself says my best cargaroon (usually illicit cargo) was his Majesty‚Äôs gracious letter in my favour, which took effect beyond my expectation, because it recommended me (above whatever I had or could deserve) to the governor‚Äôs particular care. He does not say how he had earned the specific recommendation. ;Virginia Some time after the January 1649 beheading of King Charles, Norwood, Moryson and Fox met in London and secured passage on a ship, The Virginia Merchant, Captain John Lockyer, bound for James River, Virginia. It is not clear why the three were in London at that time: One source, not especially reliable, suggests that they had intended a mission to rescue Charles I from Carisbrooke Castle but arrived too late. Norwood appeared before the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents in June 1949, and is recorded as never sequestered nor engaged in the last war. Whatever the reason for being back in England, the three (in company with about 130 other emigrants) set out from the Downs on 23 September 1649. The tale of the voyage, with dolphins, shipwreck, cannibalism, and (friendly) Indians, was told by Henry Norwood in A Voyage to Virginia published many years later, in 1732.There are many versions; the first, perhaps, in Awnsham Churchill's Collection of Voyages and Travels. The details given here are from the version at The ship, under-provisioned, called at Fyall, left there on 22 October, and crossed on the trade winds to Bermuda (where they could not land) and Cape Hatteras where the ship grounded, but got back out to sea. Storms struck for some days and the ship was dismasted, except the mizzen; a mighty sea struck the ship and removed the fo'c's'le. The disabled ship survived and made land on 4 January 1650. Moryson went ashore with the ship's mate, found fresh water, and was thereafter followed by Norwood and others. The location has been generally identified as what is now Ocean City, Maryland, just offshore from the Chesapeake Peninsula. The ship sailed off, unexpectedly, on the next day, leaving those onshore marooned. After about ten days (during which the supposed cannibalism - of the corpses of those who died - occurred) the party were found by friendly Native Americans, and taken by canoe to their own village of (or in) Kickotank. There, when the word Accawmacke (probably referring to the nation after which the town is named) was recognised by Norwood (as the English settlement in Virginia) the king or chief sent word to that settlement. Meanwhile, The Virginia Merchant had made it on to James River. Guided by a planter or trader, Jenkin Price (later, surveyor in Somerset County, Maryland) who had been sent to find them, Norwood trekked over to Price's base at Littleton's Plantation in (or on the edge of) Accomac (at that time Northampton County). From there, he travelled on to Yeardley's plantation and across Chesapeake Bay to York River at Ludlow's Plantation (which seems to have been where Yorktown power station is now). There (or rather, at neighbouring Wormeley's, across the creek) he met with old acquaintances before moving on, borrowing a horse, to Jamestown, finally reaching his destination, Sir William Berkeley's house at Green Spring Plantation, about the middle of February. There is independent verification of the disastrous voyage, although different in several details from Norwood's account, in a petition to the High Court of Admiralty in 1650, by dependents of crew members, against the captain and owners of The Virginia Merchant.HCA 15/5 f.99 . Prescilla Lockier's (most descriptive) petition is at By Norwood's own account, Berkeley provided him with money to purchase the office of Treasurer of Virginia and, in May 1650, he went to Holland to do that. Although the King Charles II was in Scotland following the Treaty of Breda, he apparently granted a patent appointing Norwood as Escheator, Treasurer and Receiver of Quit Rents in Virginia. That closes Norwood's account of his purpose to seek (his) fortune in Virginia and it is not clear whether he ever returned there. The tension between Virginia and the Parliament in England culminating in the surrender of the colony on 12 March 1652 (but not ending then) probably precluded that, at least until the re-election of Sir William Berkeley in 1660. However, after the Restoration (if not before) Norwood continued to receive the benefit of the quit rents for some years, an income difficult to estimate because of the collection difficulties, but several hundred pounds each year until 1669, and a smaller amount thereafter. Moryson acted as his agent (and, in effect, as Treasurer of Virginia). The url is given for identification only. ;English Interregnum After his departure for Holland in May 1650, little is known of Norwood's movements for a short spell. His appointment as Treasurer in Virginia is recorded as dated 22 September 1650. Charles II left Holland on 2 June 1650 (it being, thus, unlikely but not impossible that Norwood could have seen him before then) and landed in Scotland on 24 June. It is very unlikely that Norwood went to Scotland, as some secondary sources suggest; the Scots severely restricted the English (and others) who were allowed access to the king. Nevertheless, it is said that the appointment was sealed at St Johnstoun, Perth.Trye, Capt J H, as above, says Fort Johnstown, but St Johnstoun is given in the Treasury Calendar. The Calendar record is of a later investigation; there does not appear to be a surviving record of the warrant itself. The translation (Latin to English) in The Virginia Historical Magazine, Volume XIV (1907) at page 268, does not show the place. on 22 September 1650. The King was there: he had been taken to Perth after the Scots had been heavily defeated at Dunbar on 2 September 1650. Hence, the issue of a patent at the given place and time is possible; the presence of Norwood, the patentee, is highly unlikely. It is more likely that he was in England, as others suggest. There is no (known) record of Norwood's activities in the latter part of 1650 or in 1651. The assertion that he returned to Virginia seems to be based on the account given later by Edmund Custis on examination by John Thurloe in 1655 but that was to some extent a cover story for their firearms activity, and is nowhere corroborated. On 9 April 1652 Norwood was in England: He was under arrest in Kent, under suspicion of complicity in the assassination of Dr Isaac Dorislaus. Dorislaus, regarded as a regicide for his role in the trial of Charles I, had been killed at the Hague on 12 May 1649. Again, if Norwood's Virginia account is truthful, he could not have been involved in that, and no direct link has been shown. He was released some time later without trial. In late December 1654, Norwood was involved in the purchase and transport of firearms to Sir Henry Lyttelton (and, perhaps, others), almost certainly as part of the preparation for risings in conjunction with the Penruddock uprising. He was imprisoned in the Tower, questioned several times by Thurloe, and (reportedly) by Cromwell himself. No charge was brought (as no charge was brought against Lyttelton) but he was imprisoned in the Tower and in September 1656 he petitioned Thurloe for his release. He was in a state of some poverty and, in March 1657, his debt to the warders was paid by the state. Thereafter, he was granted an allowance of 10 shillings per day for his subsistence. While in the Tower, Norwood was able to correspond with William Rumbold, who was one of Ormonde's and Chancellor Hyde's agents in London. At some point, Cromwell ordered him taken to Jersey, and he was imprisoned there until his release was authorised by Richard Cromwell in February 1659 (when Parliament ordered Robert Overton to be brought back from Jersey).. The warrant cited in Burton is probably incorrectly dated as 8 January 1655/56; Norwood and Overton were delivered there on 9 February 1658 (CSP Navy). Norwood's release from Jersey was conditional; he was not to come into England without leave; he was not to act abroad against the Commonwealth; and he was required to put up a surety for ¬£500. He was soon in England (without leave) and was in frequent contact with Hyde and the Court in exile. He went to Shropshire (attempting to raise troops) and Cheshire in July 1659 and was captured, with Sir George Booth at Winnington Bridge. However, his identity was not revealed, and he was soon released. In March 1660, Norwood went from England to Brussels, to the king, and returned with letters. At about that time (on 24 March 1660) he was given a warrant as an Esquire of the Body (which required him, later, to attend the Coronation of Charles II). On 21 April 1660 Samuel Pepys met him, and was instructed (by his patron, Edward Montagu) to give Norwood a convoy to Brill but not to enter it in the record, Pepys deducing that he was going to the King, then at Breda., at 21 April 1660 and 3 May 1660. Upon the Restoration, in addition to being an Esquire of the Body, he was made Captain (for life) of Sandown Castle, a largely honorary title (but carrying a stipend) the Castle being partly ruinous with a merely nominal garrison. In September 1661, he was commissioned Lieutenant-Colonel in Rutherfurd's Regiment in Dunkirk, then an English possession and in about March 1662 became Deputy Governor there. ;Tangier In 1664 he was posted to Tangier as Colonel of the Queen's Royal Regiment, the known as the Tangier Regiment of Foot, who provided a garrison for the town. Tangier had been part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Charles II of England in 1662, but was constantly under threat of attack by native forces. In June 1666 he took over as Governor of Tangier from John, Baron Belasyse, who as a devout Catholic had felt unable to accept the Act of Uniformity and resigned. He returned to England himself in 1669, replaced as colonel and governor by John Middleton, Earl of Middleton. ;Parliament Leckhampton Court, Gloucestershire Once back in England he disposed of his Virginia Treasury post on terms which ensured a continuing share of the profits and acquired instead the position of Warden of the Fleet Prison, employing a deputy to deal with the actual functions of the office. He bought Leckhampton Court, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire from his cousin Francis Norwood and moved in, becoming thereafter involved in the somewhat divisive local politics. He was elected an alderman of Gloucester for life in April 1672 and elected Mayor of the city later that year. In a disputed by- election in 1675 he was returned as the Member of Parliament for Gloucester but was not declared duly elected for another three years. Not a very active member, he did not seek re-election in 1679. He was also appointed a Deputy- Lieutenant for the county in 1683, serving as such, with a short break, until his death. He died unmarried on 14 September 1689 and was buried in St Peter's churchyard, Leckhampton, having devised his Leckhampton estate to the sons of the cousin from whom he had bought it.

He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Gloucester in 1679 and 1689 to 1695. Biography Highnam Court William Cooke, the eldest son of Sir Robert Cooke of Highnam Court and his first wife Dorothy Fleetwood, was born c. 1620.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/cooke- william-1620-1703 His mother was the daughter of Sir Miles Fleetwood of Aldwinkle, Northamptonshire, Receiver of the Court of Wards, and his wife Ann Luke. His younger brother, Edward Cooke, was a Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury. Cooke was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1636. His father's political affiliations drew the ire of the Royalists during the English Civil War. The family manor at Highnam was attacked by the Royalists, and the elder Cooke withdrew with his family to Gloucester, where he died that same year, in 1643. William Cooke succeeded his father to the manor of Highnam, which was just west of Gloucester. The Cooke family had been at Highnam Court since 1597, when his grandfather, Sir William Cooke, married heiress Joyce Lucy, daughter of Sir Thomas Lucy. On 30 March 1648, Cooke married Anne Rolle, daughter of Dennis Rolle of the manor of Stevenstone in Devon. The couple had nine sons and seven daughters. After the civil war ended, William Cooke began rebuilding Highnam Court, which had been demolished in the attacks. The manor at Highnam was built in 1658. While its architect is unknown, it is believed that it was designed by Inigo Jones or his student, Francis Carter. Cooke served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1663. That year, his wife died. She was interred adjacent to the small chapel that had been built five decades previously by Cooke's grandfather, Sir William Cooke, near the southwest corner of the house. In 1668, both Cooke and Edward Cooke held office as two of the four Verderers of the Forest of Dean; both retained that position for many years, although there is some disagreement as to whether the Edward in question was William's son or brother. He became a freeman and alderman for Gloucester in 1672. He was a Commissioner of Inquiry for the Forest of Dean in 1673, 1679, 1683, and 1691. Cooke served as Mayor of Gloucester three times. He was first elected in 1673, serving until 1674. His second term started in November 1688, following the resignation of the Roman Catholic mayor, and continued until the following year. In April 1699, the mayoral incumbent died, and Cooke assumed the office of mayor for the third time, until September of that year. William Cooke was elected to the House of Commons, as Member of Parliament for Gloucester, and served from March 1679 to July 1679 and, again, from 1689 to 1695. Both Cooke and his son Edward were put on the Royal Commission of 1692. William Cooke died in 1703, and was succeeded by his son Edward.

Projects * Huron Plaza Office and apartment building, 30 East Huron Street, Chicago, IL (1983) 1983 PTI Award of Excellence \\"A unique design resulting in a very slender structure in which the lightness of post-tensioned slabs were blended with an innovative method for reducing lower story moments through the use of outrigger supports.\\" Huron Plaza is 56-story high-rise with an adjacent 10-story garage located north of downtown Chicago. The structural system is a post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete frame that forms the exterior of the building with exposed architectural concrete columns and spandrel beams. Type of Project The typical floor is 70' X 130' yielding 9,100 square feet for a total of 510,000 square feet for the tower. The garage is 80' X 180' or 14,400 square feet for a total of 144,000 square feet. Special Design Features The design program asked for 8 office floors with a column- free area around a compact center core below 48 apartment floors. Due to the narrow tower, it was necessary to provide three lines of \\"couple\\" shear walls to maintain acceptable stiffness. The shear walls, however, could not be permitted within the 8 commercial floors at the lower level of the tower where only the shaft could be accommodated. By modifying the \\"coupled-shear wall\\" design, it was possible to determine the effect of the \\"outriggers,\\" resulting in a moment diagram for the shear wall, center core. These moments were readily handled by the shear wall system. The slabs were designed as a combination of oneway-banded design post-tensioned slabs. The architectural layout did not lend itself to a straight and disciplined column layout. This, however, was easily overcome by deflecting the banded-tendon runs in the traverse direction laterally to correspond to the column layout. The longitudinal tendons were generally uniformly spaced except where they had to be deflected laterally around slab openings and mechanical obstructions. Advantages of Post-Tensioned Concrete Whereas the selection of post-tensioning was a natural choice for the 10-story parking garage, the decision to use post-tensioned design for the tower was based upon a number of circumstances. The need for a column-free floor plan for the 8 commercial floors at the lower level of the tower, plus the need to place concrete shear walls on the dividing lines between the apartments, pushed the layout toward long-span designs with the typical spans in the order of 27'6\\". With weigh at a premium, only with post-tensioned design was it possible to achieve these spans with a 7\\" thick slab. In order to allow casting of two floors each week, three days per floor, a slight upgrading of the concrete design strength was necessary, from fc'=4000 psi to 4600 psi. On the other hand, with improved concrete strength, and relatively low shear stresses, it was possible to show that the post-tensioning greatly reduced the need for shoring and re-shoring, which allowed the finishing work to closely follow the casting of the concrete frame. The more subtle advantage of post-tensioned construction is the resulting flatness of the slabs, making it easier for the finishing trades to install drywalls, shower bases, bathtubs and tiles, kitchen cabinets, and to align trims and moldings. Also, the crack-free exterior spandrel system is to a great extent to be credited to the compression introduced by the pre- stressing tendons. *East Ohio Street 400 East Ohio Street, Chicago, IL (1982) 400 East Ohio Street is a 50-story apartment building containing 85 flights of Saether Staircast stairs.

A launching truss consisting of individual, adjustable rigid steel frames interconnected to the precast stair flights, holds the stairs above the floor being constructed. As the adjustable shores leapfrog upward, their load-bearing capacity is replaced as needed by standard shores, while the newly placed stair-run is supported at the top of the truss. The stairs are adjustable to within 1/16 inch by manually activating screw-jacks at the top of the launching truss.Saether, K., \\"Precast Stairs Speed Concrete Building Construction,\\" PUBLICATION #C840970, Copyright ¬© 1984, The Aberdeen Group http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Precast%20Stairs%20Speed%20Concrete%20Building%20Construction_tcm45-341098.pdf *Sky-Fork System 250px As shown, double Sky-Forks with seven-ton capacity are suspended in perfect equilibrium from a single crane hook.

Conventional lift-slab systems consist of flat-plate floors reinforced with either post-tensioned steel or mild steel reinforcing bars. Floors are cast at ground level one on top of the other, then raised a few at a time. Each is secured to the columns of the structure at their respective levels. The MLCS method departs from this by raising the entire stack of concrete floor slabs in one smooth operation. *Roof Lifting When existing warehouses and shops no longer have adequate headroom, the Saether approach of lifting the roof offers a simple solution at a fraction of the cost of new construction. The lifting is done in large units. All mechanical and electrical equipment hung from or supported on the roof is included in the lift. Where vertical runs are involved, they are cut and later rejoined. Swivel joints may be provided where continuous service is required. Publications and Reports Kolbj√∏rn Saether produced a number of refereed technical journal publications together with numerous reports on specific projects he worked on.

First Police Master was Pyotr Prokopievich Khomyakov, who was soon replaced by Stepan Kozminovich Novoselov. In 1893 the Khabarovka city renamed to Khabarovsk, and on 1 January 1895 the Armed Police Department (–û–∫—Ä—É–∂–Ω–æ–µ –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ü–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ) has been formed under the command of Alexander Mikhailovich Chernov, who was known in Russian Far East as successful fighter against crime and as Chairman of Sanitary Executive Commission and the founder of local fire-fighters force. In 1906, Lev Tauz has been appointed as Head of Police, he was the head of police during the last days of the Russian Empire and continue to fill his duty after the Russian Revolution, until 1917. He was replaced by Fyodor Barinov who was arrested on 5 March 1917. In November 1917 the Czarist police became the People's Militsiya. The militia become part of NKVD until the end of WWII. The police of Khabarovsk Krai has been re-formed officially on 26 October 1956 after governmental decision to improve the police activities. Before 1956 the police forces were subordinated to the national police, the Militsiya. According to the new status the police has become part of the local government. In February 1969, the police was re- organised, and during the process, the following departments were established: * Criminal Investigations Department * Direction against Economic Crimes * State Traffic Police * Special Police force After the Cold War and the Soviet Union has been dissolved, The police continue to carry out the soviet name, Militsiya, until the Dmitry Medvedev's police reform from 2011, when all the police forces in Russia's territory return their previous, historic name: the Politsiya.

The building dates from about 1721, and was constructed as a result of a bequest from Thomas Powis, a vintner who was probably born in the town. The almshouse is a Grade II* listed building. History Thomas Powis was probably born in Chepstow in or about 1675, the son of Grevill Powis who may have been attached to the garrison at Chepstow Castle. Nothing is known of Thomas Powis' later life other than that, in 1716, he was a vintner in Enfield, Middlesex, and in his will gave ¬£1,800 to establish an almshouse in Chepstow for twelve poor men and women. He died in 1716, but because of legal ambiguities over the interpretation of the will it was not settled until 1718. The land for building the almshouses was acquired by its trustees in 1721 from the Duke of Montagu, and included the remains of a mediaeval hospital and cellar. The almshouses were built soon after then; although a plaque above the door gives a date of 1716, this refers to the date of the endowment rather than their completion. Initially they were known as the \\"New Almshouse\\", to distinguish the building from the \\"Old Almshouse\\" a few yards away on Church Street, now known as the Montague Almshouses.John T. Hopkins, Charity in Chepstow: The Almshouse of Thomas Powis, Gwent Local History, no.47, 1979, pp.22-31 The number of inmates was set at twelve, originally with an equal number of men and women, although vacancies did not have to be filled until the number of inmates became less than eight. This provision was modified in 1923, to allow for married couples to be included as residents. Applicants for accommodation were required to have been resident in Chepstow for three years, be of good character, and to be able to support themselves financially. Residents were expected to keep their rooms \\"clean and in neat order\\", and to behave responsibly. Several residents were removed from their rooms for misdemeanours including drunkenness, riotous and improper behaviour, and in one case in 1847 for \\"admitting an improper woman into his room.\\" There were originally also twelve Trustees, reduced to eleven in 1878 with a stipulation that they should live within three miles of Chepstow. By 1923, considerable additional resources had been secured to run the Almshouse through the sale of farms that had been bought by the trustees from Thomas Lewis of St Pierre in 1727 as an investment. The properties were located in the parishes of Usk, Gwernesney and Llandenny. Thomas Powis' bequest also provided for a sermon to be given each year on 10 November, in St Mary's Priory Church. In 1916 the vicar gave the sermon without having first received approval from the Trustees, who refused to pay him; the Trustees sought advice from the Charity Commission who insisted that the fee had to be paid. The building The building is described by architectural historian John Newman as \\"a delightfully artless and unspoilt ensemble... built of roughly squared local limestone.\\"John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.186 It forms an L shape, with one arm of eight bays and the other of five bays. Three doorways give access to the accommodation. Information about the bequest is set out on a plaque positioned above the doorway in the shorter range, beneath a sundial. The mediaeval cellar was incorporated into the building and continued to be used as a wine cellar by local vintners until, during the Second World War, it was converted into an air raid shelter. The building has been renovated several times over the centuries, but with little change to its external appearance. The railings that originally enclosed the raised courtyard in front of the building were replaced by a stone wall in 1830.Ivor Waters, The Town of Chepstow, Moss Rose Press, 1972, pp.102-103 The Almshouses were given Grade II* listed building status on 24 March 1975.

Before the Lewis‚ÄìJohnson fight could take place, Johnson was forced to pull out with a chest injury.https://www.questia.com/library/1P2-1765395/boxing-injured-johnson- pulls-out-of-lewis-fight As such, Lewis and Klitschko agreed to face one another on June 21, rather than later in the year as originally planned. The fight Though Klitschko came into the fight as the underdog, he was able to get off to a great start in the fight. Klitschko was the aggressor through the first two rounds and landed many hard shots to the head of Lewis, winning both rounds on all three judge's scorecards. In the second round, Klitschko was able to stagger Lewis with two hard right hands that opened a cut under Lewis' left eye. In the third round, Lewis came out aggressively and landed a strong right hand within the first 10 seconds that opened up a deep cut above Klitschko's left eye. Despite his injury, Klitschko fought a close round with Lewis as the two fighters traded jabs and power punches throughout the round though Lewis was able to win the round on the scorecards. Klitschko rebounded to take round four in which both fighters appeared to be fatigued. In round five, Lewis landed several consecutive hard punches to Klitschko's ribs with his right hand while in a clinch with Klitschko, with HBO commentators disagreeing on the legality of the punches. By the time round five had ended, the condition of Klitschko's eye had grown worse, with the corner camera broadcasting the severe open wound, but he was nevertheless allowed to continue into round six. Lewis took advantage of Klitschko's impaired vision to land a monstrous uppercut in the sixth round. By now both fighters looked exhausted, often staggering after coming together. Between rounds six and seven, it was determined by the ringside doctor that the damage to Klitschko's eye had become too severe and the fight was stopped. Because Klitschko's injury was a result of punches from Lewis, Lewis was named the winner of the fight by technical knockout.Cut Short, Sports Illustrated article, 2003-06-30, Retrieved on 2013-07-21 Klitschko was ahead 58‚Äì56 on the scorecards with two judges giving Lewis only rounds three and six and the other rounds five and six. The crowd proceeded to boo Lewis, and cheer Klitschko, presumably unhappy with the stoppage. Aftermath Due to the controversial ending, there was much demand for a rematch between the two.

Then he played for six months for Am√©rica Futebol Clube (PE) in Brazil. After this he returned to Suriname. Following his transfer in 1956 to Utrecht club USV Elinkwijk, he received a signing-on fee of $15,000 while his club received a transfer fee of 3000 guilders. The club contracted four more Surinamese footballers; his brother Frank Mijnals, Erwin Sparendam, Michel Kruin and Charly Marbach, collectively known as the \\"five-leaf clover\\". He was then transferred to VV DOS, remaining in Utrecht. He debuted in the Dutch national football team on 3 April 1960 in a home match against Bulgaria. Mijnals, nicknamed Minna, is best known for clearing a Bulgarian attempt on goal with an overhead kick. In total, Mijnals played just three matches for the Netherlands, including a match against Suriname, because he came into conflict with the KNVB. The conflict arose after a training trip to South and Central America; he complained about the game and selection policy to a journalist, which resulted in him being placed on the list of unwanted players by the association. Then he played 45 times in the Suriname national football team. In 1999, he was elected Surinamese footballer of the century.

History There is evidence of a Norse-Gaelic settlement in Bannow in general and Clonmines in particular.Colfer 2004, p.30 In the early thirteenth century, after the Norman conquest of Ireland, a borough and port was established at Clonmines by William Marshal.Colfer 2004, p. 74 Colfer suggests that Marshal chose the site in spite of its shallow harbour and poor hinterland, to offer a sheltered winter port alternative to New Ross.Colfer 2004, pp. 35‚Äì37 After the partition of Marshal's Lordship of Leinster around 1249, Clonmines was a detached manor of the liberty of Kildare.Colfer 2004, p. 39 It was a notable town with a provost and bailiff in the fourteenth century, and still considered a town in the sixteenth.Colfer 2004, p. 38 In 1552, king Edward VI funded a scheme to mine silver in nearby Barrystown, which was abandoned after five months. The name \\"Clonmines\\" predates these mines; its origin is uncertain. Herbert F. Hore in 1859 suggested the Irish Cluainmain \\"Ecclesiastical retreat on the plains\\". Patrick Weston Joyce in 1913 suggested Cluain-m√≠n \\"smooth meadow\\". T. C. Butler in 1986 suggested Cloch-Maighean, \\"a stone enclosure around the dwelling of a chief\\". Colfer suggests that Clonmines' isolation from the rest of Kildare, and competition from New Ross, contributed to its decline. Sandbars had rendered the port unnavigable by the 17th century. The site was subsequently deserted, and no record exists of any charter. Clonmines Borough, like the nearby Bannow Borough, remained a rotten borough represented in the House of Commons of Ireland until the Act of Union 1800. Although Clonmines remains a civil parish, in 1785 the Church of Ireland parish was united by Walter Cope, Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, with those of Tintern and Owenduff to form the Union of Owen Duff. Ruins A 1684 account describes the ruins of a church, an abbey, and \\"4 or 5 ruined Castles\\"; in the nineteenth century, \\"the seven castles of Clonmines\\" were still proverbial, although only some still had visible remains. Colfer in 2004 characterises the remains as two tower houses, one incorporated into a more modern dwelling; a fortified seventeenth-century house; the parish church of Saint Nicholas; another fortified church; and the Augustinian priory. The poorer people's buildings of wood and clay have disappeared. Excavations have revealed traces of the medieval defensive ramparts. The site is private property and not open to the public.

The series starred Sangeeta Ghosh and Ruslaan Mumtaz. The series was dubbed into Tamil as Kadhal Mayam and broadcast on Polimer TV. Plot summary The story revolves around the life of 34-year-old Sanchi who struggles to manage her deceased father's strawberry farm in Panchgani, secure the futures of her two younger siblings and care for her grandmothers. Dhruv Goel, a 27-year-old, charming, wealthy lawyer, arrives on holiday from Mumbai and stays with Sanchi's neighbour. Sanchi initially finds Dhruv irritating but they later become friends. Dhruv realizes he loves Sanchi during her sister Prachi's marriage. However, Prachi's uncle-by-marriage seeks to marry Sanchi. This engagement is avoided when Dhruv reveals the uncle's bad intentions. Sanchi's elder brother, Pradeep, files a lawsuit for control of the farm, which he wants to sell to an industrialist. Dhruv tries to console her but inadvertently confesses his love. Sanchi becomes upset, fearing another man is trying to take advantage of her. Dhruv tries to convince Sanchi that she loves him, but becomes frustrated at her refusals. Only when he sets to return to Mumbai does Sanchi stop him and confess her love. They share romantic moments before her family break them apart, and try to marry Sanchi to a 50-year-old man. Dhruv becomes enraged with how Sanchi is treated and gets into a fight over her honour, moving her to stand with him. The next threat to their future comes from Dhruv's family, as his mother schemes to marry him to his childhood friend, Ankita. Sanchi becomes jealous, though Dhruv insists he loves only her. When Ankita learns of their relationship, she tells Sanchi that Dhruv had several ex-girlfriends, and Sanchi fears that Dhruv might leave her. Dhruv is upset she would think this, but Sanchi makes up with him. Dhruv is called to meet with the industrialist, who turns out to be his older brother. It turns out that Dhruv is a silent partner in the company buying the farm. He is unable to explain the situation and, feeling betrayed, Sanchi calls-off their engagement. Dhruv tries to convince his father to stop the sale and accept Sanchi as his bride, but his father instead tries to buy-off Sanchi with ‚Çπ20 crore and the farm if she will leave Dhruv forever. Sanchi refuses; and the father apologizes, saying it was a test. However, at a family dinner, Dhruv's mother tells Sanchi that their marriage will create a rift between Dhruv and his brother, tearing their family apart; she asks Sanchi to leave Dhruv forever. Sanchi capitulates and accepts ‚Çπ25 crore from Dhruv's father, telling Dhruv nothing as she leaves for Panchgani. Dhruv calls Sanchi demanding the truth, and she claims that after seeing the cheque she could not stop herself from taking it. Dhruv cannot hide his disappointment as he disconnects the call. But then Dhruv comes to know that Sanchi had not encashed the cheque and had done all this on his mother's insistence and therefore he apologizes to Sanchi for not trusting her and marries her.

The two- story, fourteen-room cabin, which was built in 1914, is located at Sylvan Lake near Rome City in Noble County, Indiana. Stratton-Porter lived full-time in the cabin from 1914 through 1919, then relocated to homes in California, where she continued to write and founded a movie studio. She returned to Wildflower Woods in Rome City for brief visits until her death in 1924. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Stratton-Porter began her literary career in 1900 and wrote several books while living at the historic cabin. These included novels, Michael O'Halloran (1915) and A Daughter of the Land (1918); a book of nature studies, Homing with the Birds (1919); and Morning Face (1916), a children's book. Her Father's Daughter (1921) was published shortly after Stratton-Porter moved to California. Scenes for a moving picture adaptation of Stratton-Porter's book, The Harvester (1911), were filmed on location at Wildflower Woods in 1927. History In 1912, after the Limberlost Swamp was drained and developed for commercial purposes, Gene Stratton-Porter, a noted Indiana author, naturalist, and nature photographer, made the decision to move from her Limberlost Cabin in Geneva, Indiana, to a new location for inspiration for her writing projects. She initially purchased a small home on the north side of Sylvan Lake near Rome City in Noble County, Indiana, about from her cabin in Geneva. It served as a temporary residence while she looked for property to build a year-round home at the lake. Stratton-Porter hoped that a lakeside home would provide more privacy and a new venue for her to observe wildlife. She had first visited Sylvan Lake in the mid-1880s to attend the Island Park Assembly. It was also where she first met Charles D. Porter, whom she married in 1886. With the wealth she had attained from her successful writing career, Stratton-Porter used profits from her books to purchase wooded property overlooking the lake. Her estate home eventually encompassed about of land. In 1913 Stratton-Porter helped design and build a fourteen-room lakeside home. She named the new two- story, cedar-log cabin \\"Wildflower Woods,\\" although she also referred to it as the \\"Limberlost Cabin\\" because of its similarity to her previous home. In addition to assisting with cabin's construction, Stratton-Porter also wrote Laddie (1913).Long, p. 199. Stratton-Porter moved into the cabin at Wildflower Woods in February 1914 and lived there on a full-time basis until 1919.Boomhower, p. 188. Her husband, Charles, who remained at their home in Geneva, commuted to Sylvan Lake on weekends. Stratton-Porter's daily routine at Wildflower Woods included working on writing projects in the morning. She also worked with Frank Wallace, a tree surgeon who later became Indiana's state etymologist, to develop the grounds of her estate into a private wildlife sanctuary. Stratton-Porter was involved in planting about 90 percent of the more than 14,000 trees, wildflowers, vines, and shrubs on her property, including vegetable and flower gardens and an orchard behind the house.Long, pp. 196‚Äì97.Morrow, pp. 86, 95, and 99. The natural setting along the lake provided her with the privacy she desired, at least initially; however, her continued success as an author brought unwanted visitors and trespassers to her woodland retreat.Bennett, ed., pp. 7, 11‚Äì12. Stratton-Porter had intended to spend the remainder of her life at Wildflower Woods, but it eventually attracted too many uninvited visitors.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 335.Long, p. 237. She moved to California in 1919, and never returned to live at Wildflower Woods on a full-time basis. Stratton-Porter retained ownership of the Indiana property and returned for periodic visits until her death in California in 1924.Long, pp. 220‚Äì21, 240‚Äì41.In 1923 Stratton-Porter offered to sell Wildflower Woods to the State of Indiana to establish a state nature preserve, but representatives of the state government did not respond. See Bennett, ed., p. 9. Several of Stratton-Porter's books were published during her six-year residency at Wildflower Woods. Between 1914 and 1920 she published two novels, Michael O'Halloran and A Daughter of the Land (1918); a book of nature studies, Homing with the Birds (1919); and Morning Face (1916), a children's book. Her Father's Daughter (1921) was published shortly after her move to California. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. In 1927 scenes for a film adaptation of Stratton-Porter's book, The Harvester (1911), were filmed on location at Wildflower Woods. In 1940 the Gene Stratton-Porter Association purchased Wildflower Woods from Stratton-Porter's daughter, Jeannette Porter Meehan, the sole heir of her estate. In 1946 the association donated of property to the State of Indiana, including the cabin, its formal gardens, orchard, and a pond. The present-day Gene Stratton-Porter State Historic Site of nearly includes that were part of her original estate.Boomhower, p. 195.Morrow, pp. 139 and 161. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites maintains and operates the Sylvan Lake property, which includes a visitor center, Stratton-Porter's cabin, and grounds. It is open to the public from April through December. The grounds are open daily from dawn until dusk; guided tours of the first floor of the fourteen-room home are available for a small admission charge. The site also hosts special events throughout the year. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.Morrow, pp. 161‚Äì62. In May 1999 Stratton-Porter's descendants returned her remains and those of her only daughter, Jeannette Porter Meehan, to Wildflower Woods for burial. The graves of Stratton-Porter and Meehan are in the woods near the cabin. It was the author's wish to have a tree planted to mark her gravesite; she is buried near her favorite treeBoomhower, p. 194. Description Front of the Cabin in Wildflower Woods The design of the Sylvan Lake cabin was inspired by the Forestry Building at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which the Porters visited in 1893,Bennett, ed., pp. 5 and 8. The Sylvan Lake cabin closely resembles Stratton-Porter's Limberlost Cabin at Geneva. The exterior of the fourteen-room, two-story cabin was built with Wisconsin white cedar-logs on a stone foundation. The home also includes an L-shaped, two-story porch overlooking the lake. Another two-story porch was constructed across the home's rear facade. The second-story porches were screened to provide open-air sleeping rooms when the weather was warm enough. The property eventually included about of land and featured a formal flower garden, orchards, and a small pond.Morrow, p. 161. The cabin's interior provided living spaces and workspaces for Stratton-Porter's literary projects. The first floor includes an entrance hall, a living room, dining room, library, kitchen, conservatory, and a photographic darkroom. The entrance hall and dining room were covered in wild cherry-wood panels. The living room's stone fireplace, one of three on the first floor, contains a number of carved stone Aztec Indian heads which were brought from Mexico by Mr. Porter. The second floor has seven bedrooms, one and a half baths, and sleeping rooms above the porch. The home was initially lit with gaslights. Electric lights were installed after Stratton-Porter's move to California in 1919.Long, pp. 195‚Äì96. See also: All of the electricity was sent through the cabin in electrical conduits, with the closest wires being a couple of hundred feet away. See The present-day cabin, which the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites operates as a historic house museum, includes Stratton-Porter memorabilia, many pictures that she colored by hand, her reference books, and pottery that she collected over the years. Built-in cabinetry houses her various collections. In addition to the cabin, visitors may explore the site's formal garden, as well as wooded paths and a nearby wetlands and prairie site that are undergoing restoration.

The NBT toolbox has so far been used in seven peer-reviewed research articles, and has a broad user base of more than 1000 users. The NBT toolbox provides unique features for analysis of resting-state EEG or MEG recordings. NBT offers a pipeline from data storage to statistics including artifact rejection, signal visualization, biomarker computation, statistical testing, and biomarker databasing. NBT allows for easy implementation of new biomarkers, and incorporates an online wiki (the NBTwiki) that aims at facilitating collaboration among NBT users including extensive help and tutorials. The standardised way of data storage and analysis that NBT proposes allow different research projects to merge, compare, or share their data and biomarker algorithms.  Features  Neuronal oscillations are generated at many spatial and temporal scales of neuronal organization, and thought to provide a network-level mechanism for the coordination of spatio-temporally distributed spiking activity. For an adequate understanding of quantitative changes in neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), as a consequence of disease, experimental manipulations, or genetic variability there is a need to apply multiple biomarker algorithms. The aim of the NBT toolbox is to make biomarker research easier at all levels. From having raw data, cleaning it, calculating biomarkers, to performing advanced statistics. The NBT toolbox includes biomarkers, such as: * Standard spectral biomarkers * Phase locking value * Detrended fluctuation analysis The toolbox has a standard template for how biomarkers should be implemented, which makes it relatively easy to implement new biomarkers. Originally the toolbox was aimed at biomarkers based on EEG or MEG signals, recently however the toolbox has moved towards supporting almost any type of biomarker data. The biomarker data and associated meta information is stored in a Matlab-based database; the NBT elements database. The NBT toolbox works as a plugin to the open-source Matlab toolbox EEGLAB Commercial EEG analysis mainly targeting large clinical research studies or clinical trials are provided as an service to NBT toolbox by NBT Analytics.  History  The development of the NBT toolbox was started in 2008 by Simon-Shlomo Poil and Klaus Linkenkaer-Hansen from the VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Later the developer team was joined by Rick Jansen, Richard Hardstone, Sonja Simpraga, and Giuseppina Schiavone. The toolbox has also received contributions from many other people. The toolbox and its associated tutorial website has served as a major part of courses at the VU University Amsterdam; such as, the Human Neurophysiology course (with on average 100 students each year), and the advanced human neurophysiology. 18\\\\. April 2012 the first public release of the toolbox was made (release candidate R1). The toolbox has been downloaded more than 1200 times (March 2014). The most recent public version of the NBT toolbox is 5.0.2-alpha (released 13 November 2014).

It refers to a type of houses made of adobe with rounded corners. These houses were usually found around the plantations. The few structures that still exist are the oldest structures that are left standing in the country. The technique probably came over from the Venezuelan Paraguan√° Peninsula in the 18th century. Existing houses date back 150 years. Until 1925 many houses on Aruba were built using this technique, afterwards it fell into disuse. In 2005 there were 62 cas di torto houses left, of which only four were in good condition. The skeleton of the houses is made up of round wooden poles placed with distances of 1.5 feet between them. Branches are interwoven between them, completing the structural support. On this basis, loam is applied, mixed with sand, water and para grass. This is then coated with aloe vera juice, which gives the white colour and helps to protect against the weather. On top of the poles pieces of wood are fitted that serve as the base for the roofbeams. Until 1815 the roofing usually consisted of maize stems, afterwards the nuclei of columnar cacti were used. The floor is made of loam, mixed with cement or cow dung. The houses were usually divided into a kitchen, a living room, a porch and a bedroom. In the kitchen would be a wooden or metal barrel for storing water that was collected in small rain ponds. Around this barrel a thick loam wall would be erected. Often large families would live in these houses; people would sleep on mats on the floor. In the Arikok National Park some cas di torto houses can be visited.

The song was sent to radio stations in August 2013, as the third official single from Cole's second studio album, Born Sinner (2013). \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" was produced by Cole himself and features a guest appearance from frequent collaborator and fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, who contributes vocals to the song's hook. The song features a sample of American jazz musician Ronnie Foster's \\"Mystic Brew\\", most recognized from its use on hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest's \\"Electric Relaxation\\". The song was met with mixed reviews from music critics. \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" would peak at number 46 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Background J. Cole performed \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" on his \\"Dollar and a Dream\\" tour. \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" was the last song recorded and produced by J. Cole for his second album, Born Sinner (2013). It was recorded as a replacement for another song which Cole was forced to remove from the album's track listing after failing to obtain sample clearance from the estate of Jimi Hendrix. The song's production is based around a looped sample of American jazz musician Ronnie Foster's \\"Mystic Brew\\", which was also famously sampled by hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest on their 1993 song \\"Electric Relaxation\\". Cole was inspired to incorporate the Foster sample into \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" after hearing \\"Electric Relaxation\\", saying: American rapper Kendrick Lamar is featured on \\"Forbidden Fruit\\", which is the only track on the standard edition of Born Sinner with a fellow rapper credited as a featured artist. Lamar does not rap a verse on the song; he instead contributes vocals to its refrain. \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" contains lyrics referencing Born Sinner release date coinciding with that of Yeezus by American rapper Kanye West. Release and promotion At the June 24, 2013 stop in Houston, Texas on the Dollar and a Dream concert tour, J. Cole brought out Kendrick Lamar to perform the song, along with the J. Cole-produced \\"HiiiPower\\". In June 2013, MTV reported that \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" would be released as the third single from Born Sinner. On August 1, 2013, the song impacted American mainstream urban radio. Critical reception \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Erin Lowers of Exclaim! cited the song as one of the album's standout tracks, saying that it \\"embodies a silent confidence, paying homage to a legendary group while speaking on releasing an album the same day as Kanye West, bringing Born Sinner full-circle.\\" Julia Leconte of Now praised Cole's sampling of \\"Mystic Brew\\" as done \\"exceptionally well\\" and named \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" the best track from Born Sinner. David Jeffries of AllMusic expressed a similar sentiment, writing that \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" is driven by its \\"Blue Note-inspired\\" backbeats. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times gave the song a negative review, commenting that \\"Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole gets in the song\\". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that \\"[the song's] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge to hear anything other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals in the space between the beat and the new raps.\\" Mlynar further stated that \\"Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely ‚Äî he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there.\\" Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: \\"[He] didn't like try to do what was already done.

The group formed in 2010, originally as Whirl, but had to legally change its name after a woman performing acoustic covers of Black Sabbath songs trademarked the name and threatened a lawsuit. Whirr's shoegaze sound is often compared to My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive. Founding guitarist Nick Bassett also played in the band Deafheaven surrounding and including the release of their 2011 album Roads to Judah. History Whirr self-released a demo cassette and the EP Distressor before signing to Tee Pee Records in 2011. The band released June that year, followed by their 2012 debut album, Pipe Dreams. The latter was met with a generally positive reception from music critics. Whirr released the Around EP on July 9, 2013, and toured to support it that August with the band Nothing. As a result of touring together, members of Nothing and Whirr formed a side project called Death of Lovers, and Whirr and Nothing released a split EP. Bassett then joined Nothing on bass and toured with them. Bassett also started a new indie pop project with former Whirr vocalist Alexandra Morte called Camera Shy, while guitarist Joseph Bautista joined Best Coast. On September 23, 2014, Whirr released their second studio album, Sway, on Graveface Records. On October 25, 2019, it was announced by Time Well Recordings and Whirr drummer Devin Nunes that the band would be releasing their third studio album, Feels Like You. It has been rumored that this is their final record, although there is yet to be any confirmation of this online by the band or recording studio. Initially intended as a vinyl only release, the album was made available through the new Whirr website as a limited pressing of 650 copies which sold out within the first day. Following this, the album was leaked online and the band opted to do an official digital release made available on their Bandcamp and was included with orders of the vinyl. While there has been no announcement of a tour in support of the record, there has been speculation that this would occur in 2020 alongside claims that Dominic Palermo of Nothing would be acting as their tour manager. =Controversies = On October 19, 2015, a series of derogatory remarks towards the Washington-based hardcore punk band G.L.O.S.S. were posted on Whirr's Twitter account, including one that read: \\"[G.L.O.S.S. is] just a bunch of boys running around in panties making shitty music\\". These tweets were interpreted as transphobic and resulted in a backlash on social media; Graveface, who released the band's Sway, and Run for Cover Records, who released three of their EPs, severed ties with the band. Bassett admitted to posting the first tweet toward G.L.O.S.S. (which read: \\"Lol @ G.L.O.S.S.\\"), in response to hearing a rumor that the band was only permitting certain types of people to attend their shows and buy their merchandise. According to Bassett, the remaining tweets were posted by a friend of the band and did not reflect the views of band members. Whirr posted a public apology to their Twitter account the following morning and claimed to have severed ties with the person responsible for the offensive tweets. Whirr's online social media presence has otherwise been notoriously inflammatory toward its own fans, an action that the band described in a 2014 interview as \\"weeding out the pussies\\".

Tired of living with his overprotective and meddling parents Sam and Pearl, he secretly moves out on his own for the first time - \\"busting loose\\" from them - into a low-rent apartment in a rundown apartment building in New York City where his neighbor is Melody Feebeck, a beautiful, voluptuous, older redheaded woman who works for an escort service. Lacking the money even to replace the duck-covered wallpaper in his new apartment and still looking for work as an engineer, he temporarily takes a menial job at the Wearwell Shoe Store, operated by Ralph Cabell, where his coworker is Raymond St. Williams, a \\"hip\\" young African American man. His childhood friends Lester Bellman, Allan Simmonds, Vinnie Mordabito, and Woody Warshaw frequently visit him; they play poker together and get involved in various escapades.

Early life and education Cardim was born in 1596 in Viana do Alentejo, the son of Jorge Cardim Frocs and Catherina de Andrade. He entered the University of √âvora, where he was admitted into the Society of Jesus on February 24, 1611, at 15 years of age. As a sign of his devotion to Saint Francis Xavier, Cardim added the name \\"Francisco\\" to his own last name. After requesting to be sent to the Far East as a missionary, Cardim sailed to Portuguese India in 1618 in the company of Bishop Diogo Correia Valente (1568-1633). He completed his studies in theology at Goa, where he was ordained as a Jesuit priest on February 1, 1621. Career Map of Japan, from Fasciculus e Japponicis floribus by Cardim, first published in 1646. This map is an adaptation of one produced by Bernardino G√≠nnaro in 1641. In 1623, after entering the Chinese empire at Guangzhou, Cardim settled in Macau. From 1626 until 1629, he lived in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, where he learned enough of the Thai language to write a catechism and a small treatise on the Christian faith. Together with Pedro Morej√≥n and Rom√£o Nishi, Cardim founded the Jesuit mission in Ayutthaya in 1626. They built a church there, in which they administered the sacraments to hundreds of residents of that city. In 1629, he returned to Macau to inform the local authorities about problems at the mission in Ayutthaya. In February 1631, Cardim was sent to Tonkin along with Miguel Matsuda and Pedro Kasui (two Japanese missionaries who were later martyred in Japan), where they were received with honor by King Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng. Learning of the existence of the Kingdom of Lan Xang, Cardim wanted to go to explore the possibility of establishing a mission there. However, the King of Ayutthaya would not allow Cardim to enter Lan Xang from Ayutthaya. Cardim later tried to enter through Tonkin, but fell seriously ill and was forced to return to Macau. In Macau, Cardim served as rector of St. Paul's College from August 1632 to May 1636. Elected prosecutor of the region in 1638, he went to live in Rome. He remained there for several years and participated in the Eighth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus (1645-1646) which elected Vincenzo Carafa as the 7th Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Back in his native Portugal, Cardim received strong support from King John IV for the missions. Cardim translated some of his works from Latin into Portuguese and Italian, and composed several important monographs on the missions of the Society of Jesus. Notable among these is Fasciculus e Japponicis floribus, which was first published in 1646. The book contains detailed accounts of at least 54 of the Christians martyred in Japan from 1597 through 1640. The book also contains, in addition to eighty-eight engravings, a detailed map of Japan. In 1640, four Portuguese ambassadors who had gone from Macau to Nagasaki were called upon to renounce their faith, and when they refused they were executed without further trial. Thirteen of their followers were sent back to Macau with this warning: \\"While the sun warms the earth let no Christian be so bold as to enter into Japan. Let this be known to all men. Though it were the King of Spain in person or the God of the Christians or Shakya himself, whosoever will disobey this prohibition will pay for it with his head.\\" Cardim documented this episode in Mors felicissima quatuor legatorum Lusitanorum quo Japponiae Imperator occidit in odium Christianae religionis, which was first published in 1646. Later life and death On April 15, 1649, he boarded S√£o Louren√ßo, a galleon which was subsequently wrecked off the coast of Portuguese Mozambique, where he passed the following winter. He finally arrived back in Goa at the end of May 1650. He wrote a report on his travels, entitled Batalhas da Companhia de Jesus na sua gloriosa provincia do Jap√£o, which he dedicated to King John IV. On June 15, 1652, during the crossing from Goa to Macau, his ship was intercepted off Dutch Malacca by Dutch privateers and he was subsequently held prisoner for two years and seven months. After his ransom was paid, he finally arrived at Macau, exhausted by the long and arduous adventure. Cardim died in Macau on April 30, 1659, at 63 years of age.

It is long. The stream and its tributaries are acidic and contain aluminum. The area in the vicinity was first settled in the late 18th century. Course East Branch Fishing Creek looking upstream East Branch Fishing Creek primarily flows in a largely westward direction, from its source at State Game Lands #13, slightly west of Ricketts Glen State Park, to its mouth slightly north of Grassmere Park. The creek starts at the confluence of Sullivan Branch and Big Run. It starts flowing southwards for approximately one mile before picking up Heberly Run, its longest tributary. Further on, it receives Lead Run and turns southwest towards Jamison City. Shortly after the turn, the creek receives Trout Run, one of its shortest named tributaries. In Jamison City, the creek receives Blackberry Run and several unnamed tributaries before flowing into West Branch Fishing Creek. The total elevation change between East Branch Fishing Creek's source and its mouth is . Hydrology At one location, East Branch Fishing Creek's discharge is 19.7 cubic feet per second. The average discharges of the streams in the creek's watershed range from 63 gallons per minute at the headwaters of Heberly Run to 15,498 gallons per minute at East Branch Fishing Creek's mouth. The creek's watershed is acidic. One contributing factor to this may be the presence of acidic bogs. It is a freestone stream. The average pHs of the streams in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed range from 4.32 to 5.76. The lowest pH occurs on Meeker Run and the highest pH occurs on Shanty Run. At two sites on East Branch Fishing Creek itself, the creek's pH is 5.34 (at its confluence with Lead Run) and 5.63 (at its mouth). The average amount of aluminum in the streams in the watershed ranges from 0.024 milligrams per liter to 0.366 milligrams per liter. The highest concentration occurs on Ore Run and the lowest concentration occurs on the mouth of East Branch Fishing Creek. One stream in the watershed, Big Run, has a pH range of less than 3 to slightly under 7. The main stem has a pH range of slightly over 4 to slightly over 6. During a study of the waters of East Branch Fishing Creek and its tributaries, no stream miles in the watershed have been rated as very good. 27% (9.23 stream miles) have been rated as good, 30% (10.21 stream miles) have been rated as fair, 14% (4.8 stream miles) have been rated as poor, 3% (1.07 stream miles) have been rated as very poor, and 26% (8.85 stream miles) have been rated as severe. The lowest-quality water tends to be on Meeker Run, Blackberry Run, Sullivan Branch, Ore Run, and Lead Run. Big Run, Quinn Run, and the East Branch Fishing Creek mouth have the highest-quality waters. East Branch Fishing Creek receives an average of 39.16 tons of calcium carbonate per year. The number of pounds of acidity that flow through various streams in the watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek per day ranges from at the headwaters of Sullivan Branch to downstream of the confluence of East Branch Fishing Creek with Trout Run. The number of pounds of acid per day flowing through East Branch Fishing Creek itself ranges from downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Lead Run to downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Trout Run. The number of pounds of aluminum that flow through various streams in the watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek per day ranges from at the headwaters of Heberly Run to downstream of East Branch Fishing Creek's confluence with Lead Run. The number of pounds of aluminum per day flowing through East Branch Fishing Creek itself ranges from at the creek's mouth to on East Branch Fishing Creek downstream of its confluence with Lead Run. The average water temperature on East Branch Fishing Creek in 2009 ranged from to at various sites along the creek and its tributaries. Geology East Branch Fishing Creek in the winter The rock underneath the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed consists of sandstone and interbedded sedimentary rock. However, there is little limestone bedrock in the watershed, unlike many watersheds in Pennsylvania. Most of the watershed is in the High Plateau Section of the Appalachian Plateau Province, but a small part of it is in the Ridge and Valley Province. There are a number of rock formations in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed. These are the Burgoon Sandstone, the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Catskill Formation, and the Mauch Chunk Formation. The Burgoon Sandstone primarily occurs in the northern, eastern, and western parts of the watershed. The Huntley Mountain Formation occurs in the southeastern part of the watershed, as well as on most of the main tributaries of the creek. The Catskill Formation largely occurs along the main stem. The Mauch Chunk Formation occurs in a small area in the northern part of the watershed. There are ten main soil associations in the East Branch Fishing Creek watershed. These include the Dystrochrepts/Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga, the Oquaga, the Lackawanna, the Lackawana-Oquaga, the Wellsboro, the Barbour, the Morris, the Norwich, the Udifluvents, and the Basher. There are also rock outcroppings and several minor soil associations. The soils in the watershed are all strongly acidic, except on East Branch Fishing Creek itself. The Dystrochrepts/Deep- Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association occurs in close proximity to East Branch Fishing Creek and its tributaries themselves. The Oquaga soil association occurs in the Blackberry Run, Trout Run, Lead Run, Heberly Run, and Piegon Run sub-watersheds. It also occurs in the northwestern corner of the watershed. The Lackawanna soil association occurs in the southern part of the watershed, starting just below Blackberry Run's confluence with East Branch Fishing Creek. The Wellsboro soil association occurs near the headwaters of Blackberry Run, Lead Run, Big Run, and Heberly Run. The Barbour soil association occurs on East Branch Fishing Creek near its mouth. The Morris soil association occurs in scattered areas in the northern part of the watershed. The Norwich soil association occurs in some areas at the headwaters of Heberly Run, Lead Run, Piegon Run, and Blackberry Run. The Udifluvents soil association occurs near the confluence of Heberly Run and East Branch Fishing Creek. The Basher soil association occurs in the southeastern portion of the watershed. Watershed The watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek is entirely within the boundaries of Sullivan and Columbia Counties. There are a total of 34.16 stream miles in the watershed. As of 2010, there are 100 people in the watershed. 93.03% of the watershed consists of forest, 6.86% of the watershed is grassland, 0.06% of the land is agricultural, and 0.03% is water or wetlands. None of the watershed is barren. The entire watershed has an area of 19.5 square miles. History One of the first settlers in the vicinity of East Branch Fishing Creek was Thomas Fritz, who arrived there in 1795 from Philadelphia. In 1864, a group of Union Army troops searched for deserters and draft evaders in East Branch Fishing Creek. This event is known as the Fishing Creek Confederacy. In 1907, the community of Jamison City was supplied with fish and fish eggs from East Branch Fishing Creek. United States president Theodore Roosevelt had a 700-acre mountain resort near to the creek. Fauna and flora 23.8 of the stream miles in East Branch Fishing Creek's watershed are a high-quality cold-water fishery. However, due to the low pH of the tributary Heberly Run, there are not many fish there.

ROW itself was not formed until 1964, when two sports clubs, G√≥rnik Rybnik and G√≥rnik 23 Chwa≈Çowice, from nearby Chwa≈Çowice, merged. In its heyday (1970s), ROW Rybnik had 13 departments, including the most popular: football and speedway. ROW Rybnik was officially created on August 6, 1964, upon the decision of local authorities. Its first manager was an influential coal magnate from Upper Silesia and chairman of Rybnik Union of Coal Industry, Jerzy Kucharczyk. ROW originally had 13 departments, including ski-jumping. Each department was financially supported by a different factory: ROW‚Äôs football team was sponsored by the Chwalowice Coal Mine. In the 1966/67 season of Upper Silesian Third Division, ROW emerged as a winner, and was promoted to the 2nd division. In the summer of 1968, ROW won promotion to the Ekstraklasa, finishing below Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych, but ahead of Zawisza Bydgoszcz and Lech Poznan. After one year, the team was relegated, to once again win promotion to the first level of Polish football, after the 1969/70 season. Once again, ROW was relegated in the summer of 1971, to return to the Ekstraklasa in mid-1972 and remain there for five years. In the 1974/75, ROW managed to reach the final of the Polish Cup, beating Metal Kluczbork, Legia Warsaw, Polonia Bytom, Lech Pozna≈Ñ and G√≥rnik Zabrze in the semifinal. Final game, versus Stal Rzesz√≥w, ended in a draw, and after penalty shootout, Stal won the Polish Cup. ROW was relegated from the Ekstraklasa after the 1976/77 season, never to return to the top division. After several years in the Second Division, the team was in 1983 relegated to the Third Division. In the late 1980s., ROWs football team was dissolved. Among top players, who put on ROW‚Äôs jersey were Henryk Wieczorek, Piotr Mowlik, and Eugeniusz Lerch. Altogether, ROW played seven years in Ekstraklasa: 198 games, 50 victories, 65 draws, 83 losses, 165 goals scored. It played in the Intertoto Cup three times. The football section was re- founded in 2003 on the basis of Energetyk Rybnik, a small local team, and was subsequently renamed Energetyk ROW Rybnik, and although continuing the traditions of the original club, is considered a new entity.

It was also known as the Salle des Machines, because of its elaborate stage machinery, designed by the Italian theatre architects Gaspare Vigarani and his two sons, Carlo and Lodovico.Coeyman 1998, pp. 45‚Äì46. Constructed in 1659‚Äì1661, it was originally intended for spectacular productions mounted by the court of the young Louis XIV, but in 1763 the theatre was greatly reduced in size and used in turn by the Paris Opera (up to 1770), the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise (from 1770 to 1782), and the Th√©√¢tre de Monsieur (from January to December 1789). In 1808 Napoleon had a new theatre/ballroom built to the designs of the architects Percier and Fontaine. The Tuileries Palace and the theatre were destroyed by fire on 24 May 1871, during the Paris Commune. Salle des Machines The auditorium, designed and decorated by the architects Charles Errard, Louis Le Vau, and Fran√ßois d'Orbay, was housed in a pavilion located at the north end of the palace as originally built by the architect Philibert de l'Orme for Catherine de M√©dicis.Wild 1989, p. 404. Estimates of its seating capacity range from 6,000 to 8,000.Coeyman 1998, p. 53. According to Wild 1989, p. 406, the number of places was 4,000 \\"d'ap. A. Donnet\\", but the latter author actually gives the capacity as 6,000 (Donnet 1821, p. 261). The unusually deep stage was located in a gallery situated between the auditorium and a new, more northern pavilion, later designated as the . The hall was inaugurated on 7 February 1662 with the premiere of Cavalli's Ercole amante. The costs of the project, including construction of the theatre, came to 120,000 livres, yet the opera was only performed eight times.Coeyman 1998, pp. 46, 55. The theatre was not used again until January 1671, when Psych√©, a scenically spectacular play with music and ballet, was presented. This production cost 130,000 livres and was only performed twice.Coeyman 1998, p. 47. (Psych√© was reduced in size and successfully revived at the smaller Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal in July.)Gaines 2002, pp. 394‚Äì395. The Salle des Machines was not used again for musical theatre during the remainder of Louis XIV's reign. In 1720, during the Regency of Louis XV, the hall was remodeled again, at a cost of nearly 150,000 livres, and the court ballet Les folies de Cardenio with music by Michel Richard Delalande was given. The young King Louis XV made his first and last appearance in a dancing role in this production. After Cardenio there were no further productions, except for some marionette shows in the 1730s. In view of the large expenditures on the theatre, it is surprising that it was so little used. Modern histories cite the poor acoustics, but Coeyman suggests that its disuse may have been the result of its large size: \\"the hall may have simply been too hard to fill.\\"Coeyman 1998, p. 53.

It succeeded the PEOPLE Party after a name change in 1975. The Ecology Party was the second step for Green politics in Britain and the basis of the successor Green Party, following a change of name in 1985. A councillor and changes The party won its first representation in 1976, when John Luck took a seat on Rother District Council in East Sussex, and party campaign secretary John Davenport won a parish council seat in Kempsey.\\"ECOLOGY - The New Political Force \\", The Ecologist, November 1976, p.311 Jonathan Tyler was elected as the first chairman of the party in 1976, and Jonathon Porritt became a prominent member. That same year the Leader Tony Whittaker and National Secretary Lesley Whittaker (founder members of the original PEOPLE party) greatly reduced their involvement with the party. At the 1977 Party Conference in Birmingham, the Party's first constitution was ratified and Porritt was elected to the Ecology Party National Executive Committee (NEC). Porritt would become the Party's most significant public figure, working, with David Fleming, \\"to provide the Party with an attractive image and effective organization\\". 1979 electoral success With Porritt gaining increasing prominence and an election manifesto called The Real Alternative, the Ecology Party fielded 53 candidates in the 1979 General Election, entitling them to radio and television election broadcasts. Though many considered this a gamble, the plan, encouraged by Porritt, worked, as the Party received 39,918 votes (an average of 1.5%) and membership jumped tenfold from around 500 to 5,000 or more. This, Derek Wall notes, meant that the Ecology Party \\"became the fourth Party in UK politics, ahead of the National Front and Socialist Unity\\".Wall, Derek, Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party, 1994 Moving forward Following this electoral success, the party introduced annual spring conferences to accompany autumn conferences, and a process of building up a large compendium of policies began, culminated in today‚Äôs Policies for a Sustainable Society (which encompasses around 124 520 words). At the same time, according to Wall, \\"the Post-1968 generation\\" began to join the Party, advocating non-violent direct action as an important element of the Ecology Party vision outside of electoral politics. This manifested itself in an apparent \\"decentralist faction\\" who gained ground within the Party, leading to Party Conference stripping the Executive of powers and rejecting the election of a single leader. The new generation was in evidence in the first 'Summer Green Gathering' in July 1980, the action of Ecology Party CND (later Green CND), and the Greenham Common camp. The Party also became increasingly feminist. 1983 general election Due to the recession causing the marginalisation of Green issues, Roy Jenkins leaving the Labour Party to form the Social Democratic Party in 1981, and the inability of the Party to absorb the rapid increase in membership, the early-1980s were extremely tough for the Ecology Party. Nonetheless, the Party prepared for the 1983 general election, inspired by the success of Die Gr√ºnen in Germany. At the 1983 general election, the Ecology Party stood over 100 candidates and gained 54,299 votes.https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information- office/m09.pdfhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIJntX1TvY4 Chairs :1976: Jonathan Tyler :1979: Jonathon Porritt :1980: Gundula Dorey :1982: Jean Lambert, Alec Pontin and Jonathon Porritt :1983: Paul Ekins, Jean Lambert and Jonathon Porritt References Category:Defunct green political parties Category:Defunct political parties in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ecology Party"},{"id":"40034343","text":"Danielle \\"Nolli\\" Waterman (born 20 January 1985) is a professional English rugby union and rugby sevens player.

Discovery of anthracimycin  Anthracimycin was first isolated from a species of marine Streptomyces (strain CNH365) which was collected off the shore of Santa Barbara, CA. Another strain of Streptomyces (strain T676) isolated off the coast of St. John's Island, Singapore, was found to also produce anthracimycin. This strain was found to contain the biosynthetic gene cluster for anthracimycin production.  Biosynthesis  Anthracimycin is the product of a type I polyketide synthase (PKS). This modular synthetic pathway uses a trans-acyltransferase (AT) domain to load successive units of malonyl-CoA (MCoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) to build the macrolide backbone. The synthesis is composed of 10 biosynthetic modules consisting of the typical domains associated with PKS biosynthetic pathways (See Figure 1). Formation of the decalin ring is part of the PKS pathway and not a post-tailoring event. This occurs via a spontaneous [4+2] cycloaddition after module 8 (See Figure 2). Cyclization to form the larger lactone ring is the final step of the process by the thioesterase domain. Figure 1. Architecture of the anthracimycin type I PKS system. Outlined domains are used iteratively.

Formation of the decalin ring by [4+2] cycloaddition.  Antibiotic activity  Anthracimycin was first noted for its potent activity against Bacillus anthracis (strain UM23C1-1), which is known to cause the human infectious disease anthrax, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.031 ug/mL. It was also initially found to have activity against other Gram-positive genera such as staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci, but was not active against Gram-negative strains. In a follow-up study, anthracimycin was screened against a panel of Staphylococcus aureus strains both in vivo and in vitro. All strains of S. aureus tested were susceptible to anthracimycin at MIC values of less than or equal to 0.25 mg/L. This included strains of methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and vancomycin- resistant strains. Unfortunately, postantibiotic effects were minimal and the effects of the antibiotic were mitigated by presence of 20% human serum. Nevertheless, levels of anthracimycin significantly below the MIC were still able to slow MRSA growth. The compound was found to be minimally toxic to human cells with an IC50 of 70 mg/L against human carcinoma cells. It has been found that the most likely mechanism of action for anthracimycin is inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis, but not through DNA intercalation. As part of an in vivo study with a murine peritonitis model of infection, anthracimycin was found to protect mice against mortality by MRSA at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg. As a result, anthracimycin is a promising new scaffold for development of novel antibiotics against MRSA.

A similar Black Twitter community grew in South Africa in the early 2010s. Although Black Twitter has a strong Black American user base, other people and groups are able to be a part of this social media circle through commonalities in shared experiences and reactions to such online. Calling out cultural appropriation was a chief focus of the space in the early 2010s. User base According to a 2015 report by the Pew Research Center, 28 percent of African Americans who used the Internet used Twitter, compared to 20 percent of online white, non- Hispanic Americans.Maeve Duggan, Joanna Brenner, \\"The Demographics of Social Media Users ‚Äî 2012\\" , Pew Internet and American Life Project, Pew Research Center, February 14, 2013. By 2018, this gap had shrunk, with 26 percent of all African American adults using Twitter, compared to 24 percent of white adults and 20 percent of Hispanic adults. In addition, in 2013 11 percent of African-American Twitter users said they used Twitter at least once a day, compared to 3 percent of white users. BlackTwitter.com was launched as a news aggregator reflective of black culture in 2020. User and social media researcher Andr√© Brock of the University of Iowa dates the first published comments on Black Twitter usage to a 2008 piece by blogger Anil Dash, and a 2009 article by Chris Wilson in The Root describing the viral success of Twitter joke memes such as #YouKnowYoureBlackWhen and #YouKnowYoureFromQueens that were primarily aimed at Black Twitter users. Brock cites the first reference to a Black Twitter community‚Äîas \\"Late Night Black People Twitter\\" and \\"Black People Twitter\\"‚Äîin the November 2009 article \\"What Were Black People Talking About on Twitter Last Night?\\" by Choire Sicha, co-founder of current-affairs website The Awl. Sicha described it as \\"huge, organic and ... seemingly seriously nocturnal\\"‚Äîin fact, active around the clock.Choire Sicha, \\"What Were Black People Talking About on Twitter Last Night?\\" , The Awl, November 11, 2009: \\"At the risk of getting randomly harshed on by the Internet, I cannot keep quiet about my obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome.\\" *For Choire Sicha being the first journalist to refer to Black Twitter, see Brock 2012, p. 533: \\"The initial coining of 'Black Twitter' is commonly attributed to Choire Sicha's (2009) article, 'What Were Black People Talking About on Twitter Last Night'.\\" *Chris Wilson, \\"uknowurblack\\" , The Root, September 9, 2009. Kyra Gaunt, an early adopter who participated in Black Twitter who also became a social media researcher, shared reactions to black users at the first 140 Characters Conference (#140Conf) that took place on November 17, 2009 at the O2 Indigo in London. Her slide deck offered examples of racist reactions to the topic #Thatsafrican that started trending in July 2008. She and other users claimed the trending topic was censored by the platform. She and other Black Twitter users began blogging and micro- blogging about Black Twitter identity. The blogging led to buzz-worthy media appearances about Twitter. Social media researcher Sarah Florini prefers to discuss the interactions among this community of users as an \\"enclave.\\" =Reciprocity and community= Slate article, \\"How Black People Use Twitter\\". The remaining birds are parodies by Twitter user @InnyVinny illustrating the diversity of the Black Twitter community. The resulting #browntwitterbird hashtag game went viral, as users adopted or suggested new Twitter birds. An August 2010 article by Farhad Manjoo in Slate, \\"How Black People Use Twitter,\\" brought the community to wider attention.Brock 2012. Manjoo wrote that young black people appeared to use Twitter in a particular way: \\"They form tighter clusters on the network‚Äîthey follow one another more readily, they retweet each other more often, and more of their posts are @-replies‚Äîposts directed at other users.\\"Farhad Manjoo, \\"How Black People Use Twitter\\", Slate, August 10, 2010. Manjoo cited Brendan Meeder of Carnegie Mellon University, who argued that the high level of reciprocity between the hundreds of users who initiate hashtags (or \\"blacktags\\") leads to a high-density, influential network. Furthermore, a 2014 dissertation by Meredith Clark studied the topic of African American practice of creating hashtags on Twitter by arguing that most people use them to ‚Äútest their opinions with the assurance they are being shared within a space where fundamental values are still agreed upon‚Äù. She explains that users on Black Twitter have begun to use hashtags as a way to attract members of society with similar ideals to a single conversation in order to interact with each other and feel as though they are engaged in a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù. Clark characterizes the use of Black Twitter as critically important to the group, as the conversation helps ‚Äúcement the hashtag as a cultural artifact recognizable in the minds of both Black Twitter participants and individuals with no knowledge of the initial discussion‚Äù. She argues that hashtags have transitioned from serving as a method of setting up conversation between separate parties to an underlying reason behind how users outside Black Twitter learn about the thoughts and feelings of African Americans in the present world.Clark, Meredith. To Tweet Our Own Cause: A Mixed-methods Study of the Online Phenomenon \\"Black Twitter\\" Diss. U of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Graduate School, 2014 Manjoo's article in Slate drew criticism from American and Africana Studies scholar Kimberly C. Ellis (Twitter user @drgoddess). She concluded that large parts of the article had generalized too much, and published a response to it titled \\"Why 'They' Don't Understand What Black People Do On Twitter.\\" Pointing out the diversity of black people on Twitter, she said, \\"[I]t's clear that not only Slate but the rest of mainstream America has no real idea who Black people are, no real clue about our humanity, in general [...]. For us, Twitter is an electronic medium that allows enough flexibility for uninhibited and fabricated creativity while exhibiting more of the strengths of social media that allow us to build community. [...] Actually, we talk to each other AND we broadcast a message to the world, hence the popularity of the Trending Topics and Twitter usage, yes?\\" Ellis said that the most appropriate response she had seen to the Slate article was that by Twitter user @InnyVinny, who made the point that \\"black people are not a monolith\\" and then presented a wide array of brown Twitter bird drawings on her blogsite in order to express the diverse range of Black Twitter users; the #browntwitterbird hashtag immediately went viral, as users adopted or suggested new Twitter birds.Chase Hoffberger, \\"The demystification of 'Black Twitter, The Daily Dot, March 9, 2012. *Marcia Wade Talbert, \\"SXSW 2012: The Power of 'Black Twitter, Black Enterprise, March 14, 2012. *Kimberly C.

According to Shani O. Hilton (@shani_o) writing in 2013, the defining characteristic of Black Twitter is that its members \\"a) are interested in issues of race in the news and pop culture and b) tweet A LOT.\\" She adds that while the community includes thousands of black Twitter users, in fact \\"not everyone within Black Twitter is black, and not every black person on Twitter is in Black Twitter\\". She also notes that the viral reach and focus of Black Twitter's hashtags have transformed it from a mere source of entertainment, and object of outside curiosity, to \\"a cultural force in its own right ... Now, black folks on Twitter aren't just influencing the conversation online, they're creating it.\\"Shani O. Hilton, \\"The Secret Power Of Black Twitter\\", BuzzFeed, July 16, 2013. Apryl Williams and Doris Domoszlai (2013) similarly state, \\"There is no single identity or set of characteristics that define Black Twitter. Like all cultural groups, Black Twitter is dynamic, containing a variety of viewpoints and identities. We think of Black Twitter as a social construct created by a self-selecting community of users to describe aspects of black American society through their use of the Twitter platform. Not everyone on Black Twitter is black, and not everyone who is black is represented by Black Twitter.\\" =Signifyin'= Feminista Jones has argued that Black Twitter's historical cultural roots are the spirituals, or work songs, sung by slaves in the United States, when finding a universal means of communication was essential to survival and grassroots organization. Several writers see Black Twitter interaction as a form of signifyin', wordplay involving tropes such as irony and hyperbole. Andr√© Brock states that the Black Tweeter is the signifier, while the hashtag is signifier, sign and signified, \\"marking ... the concept to be signified, the cultural context within which the tweet should be understood, and the 'call' awaiting a response.\\" He writes: \\"Tweet-as-signifyin', then, can be understood as a discursive, public performance of Black identity.\\" Sarah Florini of UW-Madison also interprets Black Twitter within the context of signifyin'. She writes that race is normally \\"deeply tied to corporeal signifiers\\"; in the absence of the body, black users display their racial identities through wordplay and other language that shows knowledge of black culture. Black Twitter has become an important platform for this performance.Sarah Florini, \\"Tweets, Tweeps, and Signifyin‚Äô: Communication and Cultural Performance on 'Black Twitter, Television & New Media, March 7, 2013. Florini notes that the specific construction of Twitter itself contributes to the ability for African Americans to signify on Black Twitter. She contends that ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äôs architecture creates participant structures that accommodate the crucial function of the audience during signifyin‚Äô‚Äù. By being able to see each other‚Äôs replies and retweets, the user base is able to jointly partake in an extended dialogue where each person tries to participate in the signifyin‚Äô. In addition, Florini adds that ‚ÄúTwitter mimics another key aspect of how signifyin‚Äô games are traditionally played‚Äîspeed‚Äù. Specifically, the retweets and replies are able to be sent so quickly that it replaces the need for the audience members to interact in person. In addition the practices of signifying create a signalling that one is entering a communicative collective space rather than functioning as an individual. Tweets become part of Black Twitter by responding to the calls in the tag. Hashtags embody a performance of blackness through a transmission of racial knowledge into wordplay. Sarah Florini in particular focuses on how an active self-identification of blackness rejects notions of a post-racial society by disrupting the narratives of a color-blind society. This rejection of a post-racial society gets tied into the collective practices of performance by turning narratives such as the Republican National Committee's declaration of Rosa Parks ending racism into a moment of critique and ridicule under the guise of a game. Moments where performance of blackness meet social critique allow for the spaces of activism to be created. The Republican Party later rescinded their statement to acknowledge that racism was not over. Manjoo referred to the hashtags the black community uses as \\"blacktags,\\" citing Baratunde Thurston, then of The Onion, who argued that blacktags are a version of the dozens. Also an example of signifyin', this is a game popular with African Americans in which participants outdo each other by throwing insults back and forth (\\"Yo momma so bowlegged, she look like a bite out of a donut,\\" \\"Yo momma sent her picture to the lonely hearts club, but they sent it back and said, 'We ain't that lonely!).Cecil Adams, \\"To African-Americans, what does \\"signifying\\" mean?\\", The Straight Dope, September 28, 1984. According to Thurston, the brevity of tweets and the instant feedback mean Twitter fits well into the African tradition of call and response. =Black Twitter humor= Many scholars have highlighted how Black Twitter offers a platform for users to share humorous, yet insightful messages.Florini, 2013Dates, J. & Mia Moody-Ramirez (2018). From Blackface to Black Twitter: Reflections on Black Humor, Race, Politics & Gender. Peter Lang. In their book titled, From Blackface to Black Twitter: Reflections on Black Humor, Race, Politics, & Gender, Jannette Dates and Mia Moody-Ramirez (2018) suggest that alternative spaces, such as Twitter, offer a platform for ideas and concerns from a black perspective about social inequalities, politics, and social justice, that were historically prohibited from taking root in other communication venues. Dates and Moody-Ramirez (2018) noted Black Twitter became the amplifier for a \\"clap back\\" culture that was particularly prominent during an era of social unrest. Comedians and ordinary citizens used the platform to share both humorous and serious messages on topics such as ‚ÄúStay Mad Abby,‚Äù which highlighted Abigail Fisher, whose case against affirmative action was argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after Fisher was rejected from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008. She claimed that it was because she was white. In another example, Black Twitter responded with #AskRachel questions, which quizzed readers on their true blackness. The questions centered on the idea Rachel Dolezal knew a lot about black culture; however, she was still white. Black Twitter also knows how to make sad situations into something humorous. More recently, Black Twitter spotlighted the \\"BBQing While Black\\", incident during which a white woman called police officers on a black family barbecuing in the park. Oakland police arrived; no one was arrested.Moody-Ramirez, M., Cole, H. (2018). Race, Gender & Image Repair Case Studies in the Early 21st Century. Lexington Press. The 25-minute episode was captured on video, then posted on YouTube where it was viewed more than 2 million times. The incident was memed hundreds of times with images featuring a white woman in sunglasses showing up to various locations and events, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs monumental speech, a Soul Train taping, and President Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency. =Black Twitter and image repair= In their book titled, Race, Gender & Image Repair Case Studies in the Early 21st Century, Mia Moody-Ramirez and Hazel Cole (2018) explored how Black Twitter has been used to repair the image of individuals and corporations using Benoit's typology of image repair. The popularity of #NiggerNavy provides an example of how social media users used Twitter to call out social injustices (Dates & Moody-Ramirez, 2018). Black Twitter was ablaze in January 2017 when Yahoo Finance misspelled bigger with an \\"n\\", in a Twitter link to a story on President-elect Donald Trump's plans to enlarge America's navy. The tweet containing a racial slur gained more than 1,000 retweets before being deleted, almost one hour after it was shared.Mezzofiore, G. (2017). Yahoo accidentally tweeted a racist slur and Twitter is dragging them. Retrieved December 17, 2017 from http://mashable.com/2017/01/06/ yahoo-finance-racial-slur-twitter/. Yahoo Finance published an apology shortly after, saying it was a \\"mistake\\". It was too late. Black Twitter turned #NiggerNavy into a joke for many Twitter users. Unlike other image repair cases in which celebrities used remorse and mortification (Benoit, 1995),Benoit, W. L. (1995). Accounts, excuses and apologies: A theory of image restoration strategies. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press. Yahoo Finance primarily took a back seat in its own image restoration process and others took control‚Äîusing social media. The two note that while Black Twitter responses are not a replacement for true image restoration tactics such as mortification and corrective action, they provide a platform to help tackle tough issues that might aid in the image restoration process of an individual or a company.

Black Twitter came to wider public attention in July 2013, when it was credited with having stopped a book deal between a Seattle literary agent and one of the jurors in the trial of George Zimmerman. Zimmerman ‚Äì who had only been arrested and charged after a large-scale social media campaign including petitions circulated on Twitter that attracted millions of signaturesWalter Pacheco, \\"Trayvon Martin case draws more blacks to Twitter\\", Orlando Sentinel, March 28, 2012. ‚Äì was controversially acquitted that month of charges stemming from the February 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in Florida.Jamilah Lemieux, \\"Justice for Trayvon: Black Twitter Kills Juror B37‚Äôs Book\\", Ebony, July 16, 2013. Black Twitter's swift response to the juror's proposed book, spearheaded by Twitter user Genie Lauren (@MoreAndAgain), who launched a change.org petition, resulted in coverage on CNN.Don Lemon, \\"The Influence of Black Twitter\\", CNN, July 17, 2013. The community was also involved in June 2013 in protesting to companies selling products by Paula Deen, the celebrity chef, after she was accused of racism, reportedly resulting in the loss of millions of dollars' worth of business. A #paulasbestdishes hashtag game started by writer and humorist Tracy Clayton (@brokeymcpoverty) went viral.Prachi Gupta, \\"Paula Deen‚Äôs racism goes viral with #PaulasBestDishes\\", Salon, June 19, 2013. In August 2013, outrage on Black Twitter over a Harriet Tubman \\"sex parody\\" video Russell Simmons had posted on his Def Comedy Jam website persuaded Simmons to remove the video; he apologized for his error in judgment. Another example of Black Twitter influence occurred in May 2018 after Ambien maker Sanofi Aventis responded to Roseanne Barr, who blamed the sedative for the racist tweet she posted that resulted in the cancellation of her TV show, Rosanne. Moody-Ramirez, M. & Cole, H, 2018 Barr explained that she was \\"ambien tweeting\\" when she compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to the \\"spawn\\" of \\"Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes.\\" Sanofi responded: \\"People of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\\" In response to Twitter chatter and criticism, Barr was killed off Roseanne via an opioid overdose. The show was renamed, The Conners. Demonstrating the continued influence of Black Twitter, a 2019 SXSW Education panel, organized by Kennetta Piper, was selected to address the topic, \\"We Tried to Tell Y‚Äôall: Black Twitter as a Source!\\" Panelists include Meredith Clark, Feminista Jones, Mia Moody-Ramirez and L. Joy Williams. The focus for this panel is about how Black women are creating community and sparking change via social media and digital communities, how Black humor, over the centuries offers insights into the intersections of race, gender and politics, and how Black Twitter should be recognized as a news subculture. =#SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen= The #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen hashtag was created by black feminist blogger/author Mikki Kendall in response to the Twitter comments of male feminist Hugo Schwyzer, a critique of mainstream feminism as catering to the needs of white women, while the concerns of black feminists are pushed to the side.Daniella Gibbs Leger, \\"Don't Mess With Black Twitter\\", Huffington Post, August 22, 2013. The hashtag and subsequent conversations have been part of Black Twitter culture. In Kendall's own words: \\"#SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen started in a moment of frustration. [...] When I launched the hashtag #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen, I thought it would largely be a discussion between people impacted by the latest bout of problematic behavior from mainstream white feminists. It was intended to be Twitter shorthand for how often feminists of color are told that the racism they feel they experience 'isn't a feminist issue'.

Lawrence posed the question, \\"If They Gunned me down which photo would the media use?\\" The hashtag became the number one trending topic in the world overnight and was ultimately named the most influential hashtag of 2014 by Time Magazine. This was a direct criticism of the way Black victims of police violence were portrayed in media with an assassination of their bodies subsequently and swiftly being followed with character assassinations in Media. #IfTheyGunnedMeDown spread virally in the course of worldwide social media attention paid to the Ferguson crisis. The hashtag was posted several hundred times in the weeks following Atkins' initial use of it. #IfTheyGunnedMeDown is now taught in elementary classrooms and in universities around the world. Lawrence, the creator, still lectures on #IfTheyGunnedMeDown and has since established his own media company, Black With No Chaser, to continue the mission of making sure that black people control their narratives. =#MigosSaid= The call and response aspects of a game where users work to outdo the other are exemplified in the creation of the blacktag #MigosSaid. Black Twitter engaged in a public display of using oral traditions to critique the hierarchy of pop culture. The movement stemmed from an initial tweet on June 22, 2014, when @Pipe_Tyson tweeted, \\"Migos best music group since the Beatles.\\" This sparked an online joke where users began to use the hashtag #MigosSaid to examine lyrics of the popular rap group. While the game could widely be seen as a joke it also embodied a critique of popular representations of black artists. The hashtag made in fun was used to offer a counter argument to the view the Beatles and other white popular music figures are more culturally relevant than their black counterparts.Millard, Drew. \\"What We Talk About When We Talk About Migos Being Better Than The Beatles.\\" N.p., November 10, 2014.

However, this information was deemed not credible in the face of conflicting testimonies and impacted the jury's decision. Hands up, don't shoot is a slogan used by the Black Lives Matter movement and was used during protests after the ruling. The slogan was supported by members of the St. Louis Rams football team, who entered the field during a National Football League game holding their hands up.

Harrison (2016) stated: \\"To reference childhood is to acknowledge that once a black person, and especially a black American, has reached adulthood, there are sorts of 'magic' and 'joy' that simply cannot be reclaimed if he or she is at all conscious of reality, a reality that has become increasingly inescapable with the practice of sharing police executions of black citizens on any given Twitter or Facebook timeline.\\" According to Harrison (2016), the hashtag, #BlackBoyJoy, first appeared as a \\"natural and necessary counterpart to the more established #BlackGirlMagic\\".Thomas, Dexter (8 September 2015). \\"Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'\\".

In a country that has 11 official languages, Black Twitter users regularly embedded words from isiZulu, isiXhosa, and Sesotho in their tweets. In August 2016 there were approximately 7.7 million South Africans on Twitter ‚Äì by August 2017, this grew to about eight million users, with 63.8% of South Africans being online.

Black Students took to Twitter to report about the protest because they believed that the media was distorting their views and what the protest was about. One of the most retweeted tweets of the protest was \\"The Revolution Won't Be Televised, It Will Be Tweeted\\", the protest led to President Jacob Zuma of the ANC making a statement in December 2017 stating that free education would be rolled out for the working class as well as the low class, through a grant system. =#MenAreTrash= The #MenAreTrash hashtag was another prominent topic in 2017 on South African Twitter.

In 1989 he was described as the English equivalent to Oscar de la Renta, and \\"the master of the English thoroughbred look\\". He now works as a painter.  Early career  Edelstein was born in London. In 1962 he began working as a trainee designer for Alexon. As well as Alexon and Salvador, he worked for Nettie Vogues, Clifton Slimline, and Biba. In 1970 he launched his own label although it was short-lived. He then went on to spend three years working for the London branch of Christian Dior S.A. under the direction of Jorn Langberg, before re- establishing his label in 1978. In 1982, Edelstein decided to focus exclusively on haute couture, and also designed for the theatre and ballet.  Clients  Diana, Princess of Wales, wearing her Victor Edelstein Travolta gown at the White House in 1985. Edelstein's workroom was based at Stanhope Mews West, London. His most famous design is probably the ink-blue velvet gown he created in 1985 for Diana, Princess of Wales, to wear to the White House, where she danced with John Travolta. This dress, on both occasions it sold at auction, set world record prices for a dress worn by Diana (¬£137,000 ($222,500) in 1996, and ¬£240,000 ($362,424) in 2013). In addition to Diana, his clients included the Duchess of Kent, the Princess of Hanover, Princess Michael of Kent, the Countess of Snowdon, Anna Wintour, Tina Brown, Michael Heseltine's wife Anne, and Lady Nuttall, who commented that Edelstein's workroom was the only place her husband liked to accompany her when clothes- shopping. In the late 1980s, his prices were often around the ¬£2,400 to ¬£2,500 mark for an evening dress, with his clients typically buying three or four outfits each season (an evening gown, a suit, and one or two dinner dresses).  Later years  Edelstein closed his fashion house in 1993, explaining that there was no longer a market for luxurious custom-made clothing. Since then, he has established himself as an artist, exhibiting his work throughout Europe and the United States. His portrait of Judith Martin, the American etiquette authority known as 'Miss Manners', was commissioned by her husband as a 70th birthday present for her, and now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, Washington.

In January 2013, Governor Matt Mead signed legislation that stripped Hill of most of her official duties as Superintendent, on the grounds that she did not manage the department properly and created a \\"hostile workplace environment\\"; the changes for months rendered Hill as a mostly ceremonial political figure, until the Wyoming Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional. After her demotion, Hill announced that she would not yield to politically expedient decisions and challenged Mead for re-nomination in the Republican gubernatorial primary held on August 19, 2014. She ultimately finished third in the primary with 12,443 votes (13 percent). Background The youngest of four girls, Hill (Siel) spent her early years in Newcastle, in Weston County in northeastern Wyoming. She subsequently moved with her family to Rawlins in Carbon County in southern Wyoming, and then Wheatland in Platte County in the southeastern portion of the state. There she completed grades seven through twelve and graduated from Wheatland High School. Hill thereafter graduated from the University of Wyoming at Laramie and received a master's degree in educational policy and administration from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Michigan. She spent fifteen years working in juvenile treatment facilities before she was appointed one of the principals at Carey Junior High School in the capital city of Cheyenne. She was a principal for more than eight years and has more than twenty years experience in the educational system. Her educational emphasis has been on student performance results. Hill lives in Cheyenne with her husband, Drake D. Hill, whom she met at the University of Wyoming. He is an attorney with the Beatty & Wozniak firm and a former state chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party. The couple has one son, Andrew \\"Drew\\" Hill, a 2010 graduate of the University of Wyoming who was born in Laramie while Drake was enrolled there in law school. Election of 2010 In the 2010 Republican primary election, Hill unseated Jim McBride, the incumbent superintendent. Hill won all 23counties in the state. She received 47,111 votes to McBride's 24,270. Former superintendent Trent Blakenship received 13,989 votes, and Ted Adams, the former superintendent of Laramie County School District No. 1, finished last with 10,221 votes. In the general election, Hill then defeated Democratic State Senator Mike Massie, 113,026 votes (59.2 percent) to 71,772 (37.6 percent). In the campaign, Hill stressed reducing the state dropout rate, placed then at 26 percent, and cutting bureaucracy in the state education department. Role as superintendent As superintendent, Hill had responsibility over the K-12 public school system prior to the reorganization which took place in 2013. Early in her administration, Hill closed the district office in Laramie, a move which affected 29 employees, who she indicated would be given the option of working in the Cheyenne office. The Laramie office had handled assessment. Hill moved the focus of the state office in Cheyenne from data collection and compliance to federal guidelines instead to a concentration on the improvement of public instruction. She worked to establish partnerships with the school districts with the goal of mutual cooperation and collaboration. She sought to bring in teachers from a high-performing district to advise educators in areas where pupil reading scores need improvement. Critics contend that Hill's new focus had led to confusion and workplace disenchantment. =Controversies= The allegations levied against her included that she threatened department employees and misused state funds. At her first meeting with employees in late 2010, she reportedly asked them to \\"honor the new superintendent's leadership,\\" which some department employees considered a request for a loyalty oath. Hill is accused of having used special education monies to finance general teacher training sessions. She allegedly waved around a cake knife at her birthday party and told the attendees that she would not be bullied by the Wyoming State Legislature. Hill maintains that dissenting employees \\"broadly misunderstood\\" her departmental objectives: \\"The inference that jobs were in jeopardy, or that the legislative mandates were to be subverted, or that the unwavering loyalty was the goal of such meetings is simply fantasy by a small group of people who seem to revel in intrigue,\\" Hill said in response to allegations against her leadership. Early in 2013, the Legislative Select Committee on Statewide Education Accountability approved draft bills to transfer the responsibilities, funding, and personnel from the superintendent's office to the Wyoming State Board of Education, which assumed the requirement to finish the work on the design of the first phase of the educational accountability system. Under the plan, Hill also lost her right to vote on deliberations of the state board of education. The legislature soon passed the final bill, which was signed into law by Governor Mead. Hill argued that a \\"coup\\" had been undertaken on her constitutionally-created state office. In a suit filed to contest the law, Hill said that the legislature and the governor had disenfranchised voters by transferring many of the superintendent's duties to a gubernatorial-appointed director. Hill said the change would be valid only through an amendment to the Wyoming State Constitution. Angela Dougherty, Hill's attorney, declared in court filings: \\"By passing a law that strips the superintendent of the general supervision of public schools, the Wyoming Legislature and the governor have threatened the very nature of constitutional government.\\" Dougherty sought a restraining order and injunction to halt the change in the superintendent's duties.= Governor Mead quickly challenged the validity of Hill's suit; he claims that the Wyoming Constitution gives lawmakers the authority to transfer duties from the elected education superintendent to an appointed director. Mead's legal team said that much of the transferred powers in dispute had been assigned to the superintendent in the past two decades by statute, not from the constitution itself. Meanwhile, Mead hired Rich Crandall, a moderate Republican member of the Arizona State Senate, to serve as the new education director. A businessman from Mesa, Arizona, Crandall formerly worked with the Digital Learning Commission, a national panel formulated by Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida. Crandall's new position involves an annual budget of $1 billion. In July 2013, Hill was summoned to a meeting of key legislators to discuss an investigation into a further charge against her: that she may have misused federal funds while the administrator of her office. The investigation is requested by House Speaker Tom Lubnau, a Republican from Gillette in Campbell County in northeastern Wyoming. Hill contends that the House Rules Committee is biased against her because all of its members voted for the legislation to strip away her duties. Lubnau has pledged that the hearings into Hill's conduct of the office will be conducted fairly. In August 2013, the special House committee investigating Hill said that it will need $110,000 to finance the probe. The panel asked Governor Mead if he can determine a way to provide Hill, his pending gubernatorial rival, with legal counsel. Depending on what is uncovered, the committee could recommend that the full House launch impeachment proceedings against Hill. Were impeachment approved, Hill would, upon conviction in the Wyoming Senate, be required to vacate her position. No deadline has been set for the committee to complete its work. Meanwhile, the investigating committee determined that it had no authority to provide Hill with counsel at state expense. This means Hill will either represent herself before the hearings or retain a lawyer at her private expense. =Mead appeals Hill's reinstatement= On January 28, 2014, the Wyoming Supreme Court in a three-to-two vote declared the law removing the duties of the superintendent and placing them into the hands of an appointed director conflicts with the Wyoming State Constitution. The ruling at first seemed to mean that Hill would resume her regular duties within two weeks. Written by Justice E. James Burke and supported by Michael K. Davis and Barton Voigt, the Supreme Court opinion said that while the legislature can legally adjust the powers of the superintendent, it cannot undermine the constitutional authority of the office itself over the general supervision of public schools. Governor Mead, meanwhile, through his appointed Attorney General Peter K. Michael, will appeal for a rehearing. The court could stay the return of Hill to her regular duties, pending the granting of any rehearing. The Supreme Court did not specifically address the status of Crandall's director position whenever Hill resumes her duties. On March 6, 2014, Hill announced that she would attempt to resume her official duties on March 10, based on the Wyoming Supreme Court ruling thirty-seven days earlier. However, Governor Mead warned her not to disrupt the department and instead to wait on further rulings from a Laramie County state district court judge, Thomas Campbell. Hill maintains that Mead, who officially announced his reelection plans on March 11, is stalling the judicial waters to prevent her from returning to the superintendent's post: \\"The time for waiting and deference are long since passed. I must resume my duties as required by the (Wyoming) Constitution.\\" As Mead had warned, Hill was at the time forbidden to return to her constitutional duties. Attorney General Peter Michael instructed Hill that she must await word from the district court before she can resume her duties. According to Michael, the district court will make a legally binding decision in the case, which the state Supreme Court failed to do when it declared the law stripping Hill of her duties to be unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Mead appointee Rich Crandall remains in charge of the state education department. Hill's case was returned to the district court after the Supreme Court declined to rehear the matter or to offer additional clarifying information on the resolution of the issue. On March 18, Judge Campbell set a three-week time frame for the next part of the case. =Hill reinstated= Judge Campbell certified the Supreme Court decision to reinstate Hill but determined that five parts of the measure met constitutional muster. Attorney General Peter Michael had maintained that those sections of the law should be considered constitutional because they did not involve the transfer of duties from Hill to Crandall. Those provisions include a requirement that the superintendent prepare by October 15 an annual report on the status of all public schools and that the superintendent identify and address professional development needs for the schools. Another part of the law repealed the authorization for the education department to retain an attorney independent of the attorney general. On April 21, 2014, Hill finally resumed her regular duties as superintendent. Crandall remained for a few additional days to assist in the transition. Meanwhile, a legislative committee continued to investigate Hill's former tenure as superintendent prior to her removal. Candidates seeking to succeed Hill With Hill not seeking a second term as Superintendent but instead having unsuccessfully challenged Mead in the gubernatorial election, Jillian Balow, a former human services policy advisor to Governor Mead and an administrator at the Wyoming Department of Family Services, became the first Republican to announce her candidacy for superintendent. Balow did not take a stand on whether Wyoming should support the Common Core State Standards Initiative for science instruction but subsequently came out against Common Core entirely. Balow's opponent was the Democrat, Michael A. Ceballos (born 1955), a Cheyenne businessman who supported Common Core. The position pays $92,000 annually. Balow defeated Ceballos in the November 4 general election with more than 60 percent of the vote. Hill said that despite her defeat by Mead in the Republican primary, \\"I trust the people, so they've elected this person again. And so we'll cope with that.\\" Hill said that her campaign was based on the premise that one should always stand on principle and never give up, no matter the odds against them.

Saul has recently co-written a report for the British Philosophical Association and Society for Women in Philosophy UK with Helen Beebee titled Women in Philosophy in the UK: A Report.http://swipuk.org/notices/2011-09-08/Women%20in%20Philosophy%20in%20the%20UK%20(BPA- SWIPUK%20Report).pdf Saul frequently writes comments on women in philosophy, in a variety of non-academic publications.http://philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1079 Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award In December 2011, Jennifer Saul was awarded the Distinguished Woman Philosopher award in Washington, D.C. by the Society for Women in Philosophy. In response to her Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award Saul said, \\"I'm deeply honored and absolutely stunned by this. It‚Äôs especially wonderful to be recognized as making a difference in people's lives by doing philosophy. For me, that's the highest honor there could be.\\" Saul is co-founder and co-blogger for the Feminists Philosophers which is a forum that focuses on gender biases. The forum's Gender Conference Campaign aims to highlight the lack of participation and representation of female philosophers at world events. Research areas Saul's primary research is in analytic philosophy of language and feminist philosophy. In her most recent book, Lying, Misleading and What is Said: An Exploration in Philosophy of Language and in Ethics (Oxford University Press 2012), she argues that the distinction between lying and misleading is theoretically significant and illuminates a variety of issues in philosophy of language concerning semantic content, implicature, and assertion. Moreover, because it is also an ethically meaningful distinction, it demonstrates some ways in which communication and speech are apt for ethical analysis. Saul argues that it is not the case, in general, that lying is ethically worse than misleading. Luvell Anderson, in his review of the book, says that \\"Her book is an excellent addition to a growing literature of what might be considered applied philosophy of language.\\" This work led to Saul being an advisor to the UK Office of Statistics Regulation in developing its work on misleadingness in the use of statistics, where any false belief is contingent on available evidence. In philosophy of language, Saul is also known for her work on substitution of co-referential terms in simple sentences. Although it is universally accepted that substitution fails in propositional attitude contexts, Saul argues that substitution can also fail in sentences that have no psychological verbs whatsoever. This raises questions about the semantics of names and dominant accounts of attitude reports. In 2007, Saul published Simple Sentences, Substitution and Intuitions (Oxford University Press) in which she develops her views on these issues with attention to their methodological implications. Jennifer Duke-Yonge says of the book, \\"Saul advances the study of simple sentence substitution failure by demonstrating the inadequacy of existing accounts, but perhaps more importantly this book brings into focus crucial questions about the problematic role of semantic intuitions, frequently used without question in philosophy of language. In an area like philosophy of language where intuitions are often the primary kind of data we have available, this focused study of their role and nature is to be welcomed.\\" In feminist philosophy, Saul is known for her book Feminism: Issues & Arguments, Oxford University Press (2003), an introductory text that explores a variety of feminist views and explores their application to controversies over such topics as pornography, abortion, and veiling. Louise Antony says, \\"Saul's accessible and engaging introduction to philosophical issues in feminism will challenge students of all political persuasions. Modelling good philosophical method all the way, Saul draws her readers into some of the most important and interesting controversies of contemporary gender studies.\\" She has also done important work on pornography, objectification, and the history of the vibrator. From 2011-2013, Saul was Director of the Leverhulme-funded Implicit Bias and Philosophy International Research Project. The project brought together nearly 100 researchers in philosophy and psychology to explore the implications of research on implicit bias and related topics for epistemology, philosophy of mind, and moral/political philosophy.

Early life and education Jack Pritzker was the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants Annie P. (n√©e Cohn) and Nicholas J. Pritzker. His father left Kyiv for Chicago in 1881 and worked first as a pharmacist and, after graduating from DePaul University College of Law, as a lawyer. He graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1927.Silbiger, Steve The Jewish Phenomenon: Seven Keys to the Enduring Wealth of a People His father wrote a small book that has been passed down from Pritzker to Pritzker; the theme of the book is \\"Your only immortality is the impact you have on your successors.\\" Career Jack joined his father's law firm, Pritzker & Pritzker, along with his brothers, Abram and Harry. Harry specialized in criminal law, Abram (called Abe and later A. N.) specialized in business law, and Jack in real estate law. In the 1930s, he left the law practice and branched out with his brother Abram investing in real estate and small companies mostly in the Chicago area. Harry continued to run the law firm which eventually became an in-house firm catering solely to the needs of the Pritzker family and its business. The Pritzker brothers were very successful and amassed a considerable fortune. Using Pritzker & Pritzker, they shielded their earnings from taxes through a series of trusts and tax code loopholes enabling them to distribute their earnings as they chose. His brother Abram's sons continued to grow the family business eventually buying the Hyatt House hotel in Los Angeles in 1957 forming the cornerstone of their hotel chain. His nephew Robert created a conglomerate of a multitude of manufacturing companies which grew into the multibillion-dollar Marmon Group. Marmon was diversified to include manufacturing concerns ranging from lumber to railroad box cars and travel industry staples. It composed half of the family's wealth. On December 25, 2007, it was announced that Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, would purchase 60% of the Marmon Group from the Pritzkers for $4.5 Billion.

Directed by James Hill, it was produced by the Gaumont Specialised Film Unit, a descendant of the Gaumont British film studio. Players included veteran character actor George Cole. Synopsis The film centers on the adventures of Sea Cadet Jimmy Sutton, played by Roy Savage. Sutton is seen walking down an English country path, and the sound of a boy's cheerful whistling are dubbed onto the soundtrack. Soon a misfiring propeller engine is also heard and a World War II-style plane crashes in a field. Sutton heroically rescues the pilot and retrieves a portfolio of important papers as the plane erupts in flames. Two suspicious men can be seen sneaking away, trading dialogue that indicates they have sabotaged the plane. The scene shifts to Gibraltar, where Sutton has been granted the right to enjoy a short vacation, courtesy of the British armed forces, as a reward for his bravery. New challenges arise. One of the first things that the garrison shows to Sutton are some of the Gibraltar apes, feral primates that have become the totemic animals of the armed forces base. The local folklore is that if the animals ever die or disappear, Gibraltar will fall to Britain's enemies. Young Jimmy soon finds that someone is indeed killing the primates. With the help of a new friend, young local girl Pilar Ellis (played by Nati Banda), Jimmy tries to save the 'apes' and wake the authorities up to the threat they face. It soon becomes clear that the cruelty to animals is only part of a much larger impending terrorist strike against the strategic naval base of Gibraltar. The deaths of the monkeys are meant to serve as a feint to distract the Royal Navy from the imminent reality that the capital ships stationed at the base will be damaged or sunk by limpet mines that will be attached by skilled frogmen. Sutton and Ellis have the task of saving Gibraltar from this sinister attack. A series of chase scenes includes many of the key sights of Gibraltar as they existed in 1953, including the fortified spine of the Rock of Gibraltar and the Gibraltar water catchments. With the last-minute help of adults, the terrorist plot is foiled and the Royal Navy is saved. The film's closing credits scroll to the accompaniment of Rule Britannia.

Biography He was born to a landowning family of some wealth. In 1855, he began classical studies in Sulmona under the Latin scholar, Leopoldo Dorrucci. Patini's father had taken a position as chancellor of the Royal Judiciary in that town. He acquired a diploma of ‚ÄúBelle Lettere‚Äù, and then enrolled in the University of Naples to study philosophy, then transferred to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. This move, however, was not approved by his family. At the age of 20 years, Teofilo, along with Antonio Tripoti, enlisted in the volunteer forces of Garibaldi: the Cacciatori del Gran Sasso, which was organizing an insurrection in Abruzzo. Later he was to join for four months in the National Guard of Castel di Sangro, with forces attempting to repress the rampant rural brigandage. During a competition at the Academy, his painting of Edward III of England and the Deputies of Calais won him a stipend for two years (1868 ‚Äì 1869) to study in Florence. In 1870, his canvas of ‚Äò‚ÄôLa Zingara‚Äô‚Äô gained him a scholarship to travel to Rome from 1870 to 1873. In Rome, he painted Nello studio di Salvatore Rosa, which was awarded first prize in an 1872 exhibition in Rome. In Rome, he began a relationship with Teresa Tabasco, a model of the Academy. Years later, they married. In 1872, he was afflicted with the ophthalmologic infection, trachoma. This curtailed painting to some degree, although he painted La guardiana delle oche (1873), Case di campagna (1874), I notabili del mio paese (1878). A few years later, by the age of 39, he was allowed by his doctor to restart painting. His painting became progressively focused on the lives of the poor peasants, fore example, Il ciabattino (exhibited at 1873 Mostra of the Promotrice). The Good Samaritan In 1882, he was named director of the Scuola di Arti e Mestieri of L'Aquila. In 1884, he was commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture to visit the art museums of Germany.Short biography by the Thule Gallery. In 1880, at Turin, he exhibited: Ogni buon stivale doventa ciabatta, Lo studio di Salvator Rosa, and La prima lezione di equitazione. In 1881 at Milan he displayed L' Erede. This canvas depicts a peasant, sprawled dead on a mat on the foreground, while to his side, his wife grieves in a corner while her naked baby lies supine. The bleak reality of rural poverty prompted a contemporary critic, to label this a protest work, a legitimate descendant of the Proximus Tuus. The bronze statue by Achille D'OrsiStatue of Proximus Tuus is now at the Academy of Arts of Naples. depicts an exhausted peasant, sitting with a hoe. In 1884 at Turin, Patini exhibited Vanga e Latte (a breast-feeding mother and her working man), and finally at Venice: Beasts of burden, in which three peasant women recall the pose and exhaustion of Proximus Tuus, and the paintings of Millet. Other paintings such as The Three Orphans, painted in earthy tones, reiterate this subject matter of empathy with the poor. Patini struggled financially as a painter. He developed cardiac ailments in later decades. In addition to his genre subjects, and despite some anticlerical positions,Patini is said to have been a freemason. he also painted sacred subjects: for San Demetrio ne‚Äô Vestini in Calascio, for the Sanctuary of the Madonna della Libera in Pratola Peligna, for the Duomo and the church of Santa Maria della Concezione at L‚ÄôAquila. he painted canvases of the Crucifix for the basilica of San Pelino, near Corfinio; Il Purgatorio o Redenzione, The Guardian Angel, St Carlo Borromeo among the plague victims, L‚ÄôImmacolata e Santi.Short biography by the Thule Gallery.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis.

It was designed by (at the time) Maryborough architect Willoughby Powell and constructed by local builder Fritz Kinne on high riverside land adjacent to the original site of Maryborough. The original town of Maryborough, originally and unofficially called Wide Bay Village, was established on the Mary River approximately eight kilometres upstream from the current town centre. In August or September 1847 George Furber built a wharf and store on the southern bank of what was then generally called Wide Bay River. It operated as a reception centre for squatters running sheep in the area and primarily provided transport for wool. The river was officially named Mary River on 7 September 1847 by Governor Sir Charles Fitz Roy and the first shipment of wool was dispatched from the wharf in December 1847. Edgar Aldridge was born in either Great Baddow or Little Baddow in Essex, England. It is believed that Aldridge named the house after his birthplace. He immigrated to Australia. Well born and educated, he became a hotel keeper on the Macleay River near Kempsey, New South Wales from about 1843 and began a variety of business pursuits. In June 1849 he married widow Maria Sarah Slater (nee Steele), a former convict. She had a child, Frederick Slater, from her previous marriage and Edgar and Maria had two children, Maria Rachael and Harry Edgar. In late 1849 the family moved to Maryborough. Edgar had visited the previous year to establish his businesses. The Aldridges settled on the northern bank almost opposite Furber's wharf, establishing a store, wharves for timber and wool trading, and the settlement's first hotel, the Bush Inn. Other settlers arrived and chose to settle near Aldridge. Furber then relocated his operations to the more popular northern bank. The first years of settlement were extraordinarily troubled with deadly conflict between Europeans and Aborigines. This situation discouraged settlement. Aldridge petitioned the New South Wales government to send extra troopers in order to encourage settlement. The struggling settlement was officially named Maryborough on 23 January 1849. In 1850 Surveyor Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary ... to suggest ... the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other ... also ... point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation\\". The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was already established but further east, a decision not well received by the existing settlers who had invested time and money into the original township. Immediately, a government wharf was established at the new location able to service larger ships than was previously possible, effectively ending further development of the old town. Over the following decade the town relocated to its current location where it quickly thrived. The old town was abandoned and most of the buildings removed by 1856. The Aldridges lived in their Bush Inn upon settling in Maryborough. Another child, Joey Edgar Aldridge was born in 1850 but died in 1851. At 1852 land sales of the new township, Edgar purchased many allotments in the new town and re- established his businesses there. In 1854 he purchased land at the old town including five allotments covering over 18,200 sqm. This land included part of a creek and the end of a spur of high land to the south. Aldridge built a timber slab house here. The land overlooked the nearby wharves and Aldridge's store and inn which soon ceased operation. The Aldridges cultivated extensive and productive gardens including experimental exotic species such as sugar cane, the first grown in the area. This established the viability of what would become an important and profitable crop for Maryborough. By 1863 the area was being called Baddow, presumably after the Aldridge house, but Aldridge letters and diaries call the area West Maryborough or The Old Town. The Aldridge finances improved rapidly with speculative land purchases and successful business ventures and in 1860 Edgar retired from business with management passing to his son Harry. Edgar held the position of Alderman of Maryborough from 1861 to 1864 and 1865 to 1866. The 1880s were prosperous for the colony of Queensland as migration and capital investment created unprecedented growth. Maryborough's growth was based on its role as the main port and centre for an extensive pastoral industry in the Wide Bay district, a sugar industry in the immediate vicinity of Maryborough, the Gympie goldfields, a timber industry in and around the main waterways, coal mining at Burrum and manufacturing industries such as Walker's foundry. Maryborough's dominance as a regional centre was also strengthened by its role as the terminus for the railway line south to Gympie which was completed in 1881. Many significant buildings were constructed in the late 1870s and 1880s in Maryborough including: Maryborough Court House (1877), Bank of New South Wales (1877), St Paul's Church of England (1879), Maryborough Railway Station (1880), Maryborough Boys Grammar School (1881), Criterion Hotel (1883), Maryborough Mortuary Chapel (1884), Maryborough Base Hospital (1888), and the Maryborough School of Arts (1888). During Maryborough's prosperous period of the late 1870s and 1880s wealthy residents constructed fine, architect- designed suburban villas. During this period, the middle-class home was a stage for social ritual and was an outward manifestation of the occupant's status in the community. The middle-class desired to emulate the lifestyle of the English gentry. Suburban villas were often built on the fringes of established urban areas throughout the colony, remote from the town centres. They are characterised by a semi-rural grandeur brought about by an elaborate and substantial detached house of a Classical style surrounded by a large restful garden. In Maryborough these included: villa for John Vivian Williams, Churchill Street (1879), Doon Villa (c.1882), Riversleigh, corner North and Elizabeth Streets (1882), villa for JE Brown, Woodstock Street (1882), villa for Robert Hart (1883), and Philadelphia Villa, corner Lennox and North Streets (1884). Construction of Baddow House was begun in 1883. It cost approximately and replaced the previous Aldridge house except for the detached kitchen which was retained for use in the new house. It was designed by architect Willoughby Powell (c.1848-1920) who came to Maryborough in 1882 to capitalise on the building boom in the growing town. Powell was born in Cheltenham, England where he trained as an architect before immigrating to Queensland in 1872. He worked for Brisbane architect Richard Gailey before joining the Queensland Public Works Department in 1874. Powell won a competition for the design of the Toowoomba Grammar School (1875) and left the Department of Public Works to supervise its construction. Other examples of Powell's work include Warwick Town Hall (1888) and Toowoomba City Hall (1900). Baddow House for 'Maryborough's wealthiest resident' was one of his first works completed during his three-year stay in Maryborough. He completed at least 14 projects including two other villas in the town as well as shops, hotels, a mortuary chapel, and a parsonage. Baddow House was built by local builder Carl Friedrich \\"Fritz\\" Kinne (1844-1929), a German immigrant who arrived in Maryborough in 1871. Kinne was responsible for constructing many Maryborough buildings, including the extensions for St Mary's Roman Catholic Church for architect FDG Stanley in 1884, and was later elected Alderman (1890‚Äì98) and the Mayor of Maryborough (1895). Maria Aldridge's health began to decline in the early 1880s and Aldridge diaries suggest she spent the majority of her last years at another Aldridge property at Booral, by the sea. She died at Booral 17 March 1886. Edgar paid for the construction of memorials to her within Maryborough - St Thomas's Church of England and a large free- standing bell tower for St Paul's Church of England - that were completed in 1887. Edgar died 18 May 1888 in Baddow House. He was not a wealthy man by this time and when the house passed to his son Harry, who lived there with his wife Lappy and their children until his death 4 February 1910, in 1912 the Bank of New South Wales foreclosed on the property and disposed of it by auction. Lappy Aldridge and her children moved to the Booral property. After the Aldridges, the house passed through many hands. First, it was transferred to Hugh Biddles in 1913. After his death in 1939, it was transferred to Ethel Stiler in 1942. Under her ownership the verandahs were removed and the grounds were cleared of gardens. During the clearing of the gardens, a Canary Island Date Palm that survived from the Aldridge years was damaged in a rubbish fire. A photo taken during the latter years of the Stiler's ownership clearly shows the burnt stump has a regrowth shoot. Around this time the house is thought to have been used briefly as a girls' boarding house for St Mary's Catholic School, Maryborough. Baddow House was transferred to the Crown in 1950 with the intention of use as a migrant hostel. This never occurred and the house remained empty and unused and was greatly vandalised. In 1954 the Boy Scouts Association of Queensland used Baddow House as their meeting hall. By this time the kitchen that had been retained from the previous house had been demolished, although the cellar under it survived. During the occupation by the Scouts some repair of the vandalism was undertaken by caretakers. Allotments 1 and 2, upon which the house stands, were purchased in 1967 by Donald and Daphne Scott. The remainder of the estate land continues to be in Crown ownership and is part of the parkland reserved for the Old Maryborough Town Site. It was then purchased by John and Lois Hastings in 1973, John Stevens in 1981, Tony Nioa in April 1986, and then by Barrie and Janice Christison in November 1986. The Christisons used the upper floor as their residence and opened the lower floor as a museum, displaying historical paraphernalia. In 1988 buried bricks were uncovered while building a car park. These were considered to be from the cellar now buried and filled with earth. The opening of the house as a museum was well-published, popular, and successful. In this period when Maryborough was generally promoting itself as a \\"Heritage City\\" the house gained a high profile within the local community which continues today. In 2003 the house was purchased by Ian Russell and Anne De Lisle. The house underwent a substantial renovation during the following three years. Local architect, Marion Graham, managed the project which included concrete underpinning, repair of rendering internally and externally, rebuilding of verandahs, and the construction of a one- storey wing to the south corner containing kitchen, garage, study, and bathroom. With reconstruction, the interior is a combination of new and original fabric. This work included recovery, repair, and rehanging of the large folding cedar doors in the ground floor reception rooms; rebuilding fireplace surrounds; repair or replacement of cedar joinery, doors and windows rehung or replaced; floors and ceilings repaired with some replacements of boards; and the whole interior plastered and painted. The reconstruction of the verandah was done to the dimensions and character of the original. The gardens were extensively redeveloped and planted. Much of the renovation was done by local tradespeople. The book \\"A Grand Passion: A memoir\\" by owner Anne De Lisle published in 2007 documents this period and the work undertaken and has raised the public profile of the house significantly. Baddow House remains a private residence in 2011. Highly regarded by the local community, it is occasionally used as a venue for fundraising events.  Description  Baddow House is a large, two-storey Neo-Georgian residence with an extensive garden on the northern end of a ridge beside the Mary River, Maryborough. It is one of the largest residences in Maryborough. On two equal lots totalling , the land is bound on the north- western and south-western sides by treed parkland, on the north- eastern side by an unformed road reserve for Queen Street, and on the south-eastern side by Russell Street. The front of the house faces north-east to the road reserve and views to the Mary River are to the west. The building is of brick construction rendered and scored to resemble ashlar coursing. It has a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a timber verandah with twin steel posts and decorative cast iron balustrade that wraps around the north-east, north-west, and south-west sides on both levels. The building, sitting within an established garden of lawns, trees, and garden beds, is in a Neo- Georgian style and the principal elevations are symmetrically composed. The house roof has three large, cement-rendered chimneys with mouldings and conical metal roof ventilators. The north-eastern (front) elevation is viewed from the reserve of Queen Street below. A wide, central, cement-rendered stair leads from the garden onto the verandah. Flanking the entrance doorway and projecting onto the verandah are two octagonal bay windows rising across both levels with separate hipped roofs. Entrance is through a large round arched opening fitted with a panelled door surrounded by sidelight and a fanlight. The windows are large square headed openings fitted with double-hung, timber framed sashes. The verandah is a reconstruction; has a timber floor, decorative cast-metal balustrade, frieze, and brackets; timber handrail; and panels of timber lattice screening the corners of the upper level. Under its own roof, the verandah wraps around to the symmetrical north-western elevation composed of three large windows and continues around onto the south-western elevation composed of one octagonal bay window and a secondary entrance via a central square-headed opening fitted with a panelled and glazed door surrounded by sidelights and a fanlight. The rear, south-eastern elevation, visible from Russell Street, has a central back door and a projecting service block at the eastern end containing laundry (ground floor) and bathroom (first floor). The laundry has large timber fixed louvred windows and the bathroom has small square-headed windows. The service block has a parapet roof that conceals a roof level water tank that supplied the rooms below. This tank was filled by a hand pump mounted externally on the wall at ground level which is connected to the underground beehive tanks nearby. The verandah on the upper level returns along the rear facade at the western end but it is narrower. Abutting the southern corner of the rear is a one-storey extension with hipped roofs and a large awning. This extension is designed to imitate traditional detail but is not of cultural heritage significance. The plan of the two- storey part of the house is repeated on the two levels. A central, T-shaped hall provides access to the five main rooms and a decorative timber switch back stair with decorative turned balustrade and carved newel post finial provides vertical circulation. Generally, the interior walls are plaster with timber skirtings, timber architraves, and plaster cornices, all moulded. The floors and ceilings are timber boards. Internal doors are timber with four panels with bolection moulding and glazed horizontal-pivoting fanlights. The six fireplaces have moulded timber mantelpieces and metal fire surrounds and either a metal grate or stove. A timber partition of horizontal beaded boards divides the northern rooms on the upper level and this wall in the lower level contains large folding door with six panels with bolection moulding and matching timber panelling above the opening. The ceilings on the ground floor rooms are high with those of the first floor being high. The house contains cedar joinery throughout. The house contains much furniture and paintings brought into the house by the current owners. An octagonal side table and two framed paintings are in the dining room and may have been owned by the Aldridges. The Aldridge Collection is held by the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum and contains domestic items donated to the museum by a member of the Aldridge family. It may give providence for the side table and paintings and also evidence of the domestic history of Baddow House. During World War II, the iron lacework was removed from the verandahs to contribute to the war effort. The garden shows evidence of past landscaping including terracing for a past driveway and decorative cast-iron fence posts with chain link fence. There are two large brick underground \\"beehive\\" water tanks in the grounds near the house. One is near the south-east side of the house and is in width and of a similar depth. The other is further down the bank in front of the house and is of a similar construction. A Canary Island Date Palm (Phoenix canariensis) is planted near the front (northern) steps. Nothing of the other vegetation on the site is of cultural heritage significance. Archaeological evidence may survive in the grounds or under the house that may provide information pertaining to the 1850s to 1880s occupation of the site by the first settlers in Maryborough or of earlier landscaping elements of the house.  Heritage listing  Baddow House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Baddow House, Maryborough (1883) provides evidence of the development of regional Queensland during the economic boom of the 1870s and 1880s when Maryborough, already a busy port, became a major regional town and agricultural, pastoral, industrial, and commercial centre for Queensland. The place, combined with surviving documentary and photographic evidence, contributes to our understanding of the way of life of wealthy families in the establishment and development of major regional towns. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Baddow House has the potential to reveal further information about domestic life of wealthy regional Queenslanders in the 1880s through an examination of the existing fabric in combination with documentary evidence. In particular, the examination of the water reticulation system, including beehive water tanks, hand pump, and rooftop tank, which is a rare and early hydraulic system, may provide further information regarding the technical accomplishments in providing domestic services that were sophisticated for the time. Baddow House has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the effects of the 1870s-1880s economic boom on an important early regional Queensland community. Baddow House has potential to contain important subsurface archaeological features and deposits from the 1850s to the early 20th century. This may include evidence associated with the second Baddow House (-), the construction and design of the extant house and early gardens, and its ownership by two generations of the Aldridge family. Archaeological investigations of Baddow House may inform on consumption choices and patterns of the Aldridge family before, during and after the 1870s-1880s boom period. These investigations may provide an important insight into the perceptions of class and taste over an extended time and in a period of important social and economic change in Maryborough. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Baddow House is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a substantial, architect-designed Queensland suburban villa of the late 19th century. These characteristics include: the form (detached, two-storeyed); structural materials (brick); planning of both the house (public rooms downstairs, attached rear service rooms, bedrooms on the upper floor, and verandahs) and the grounds (siting of the house overlooking the river amongst landscaped gardens); and decorative detailing and finishes (including external render, internal plaster, ornate cedar joinery, panelled doors, stained glass). The place evokes a strong sense of grace, genteel languor, tranquillity and seclusion through its setting - a characteristic of the original design which rarely survives at other suburban villas in Queensland. It is a fine example of the work of Queensland architect, Willoughby Powell and of Maryborough builder Fritz Kinne, both skilled professionals, prominent and successful within their fields.

The mother church receives tithes and manages the funds of the affiliated local churches, as well as assign pastors for the local congregations. There is a strong influence of pastoral leadership on the decision-taking process, and the members only rubber stamp the 'Ministry' decisions.

Currently, the Bethlehem Ministry is presided by Pastor Jos√© Wellington Bezerra da Costa, who succeeded Pastor Cicero Canuto de Lima in 1989. History The Bel√©m minist√©rio is a misnomer, since it is headquartered not in Bel√©m do Par√°, but in the Belenzinho neighborhood in S√£o Paulo city. This minist√©rio began as a local schism of an Italian Pentecostal church in 1928. This novel church succeeded in attracting migrants, especially from the poverty and drought-stricken Northeast Brazil. With time, the Minist√©rio do Bel√©m grew not only in membership, but also in influence within the politics of the General Convention of the Assemblies of God of Brazil. As a consequence, two of Minist√©rio Bel√©m pastor-president also were chair to the General Convention. Since January 6, 1980, Assemblies of God Bethlehem Ministry responded spiritually for more than 2,000 churches and congregations formed in S√£o Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, and abroad the United States, South America, Europe and Africa. In 1995, Assembly of God Bethlehem Ministry in USA was founded by Severino Pedro da Silva in the United States.

An illiterate Jewish laborer, Boloff was arrested in 1930 under Oregon's criminal syndicalism statute, which made it illegal to be associated with communist or anarchist groups. Boloff was the first person to be tried under the statute since its implementation during the First Red Scare. He was arrested with 12 other suspected communists, but was the only one to be sentenced to prison. While imprisoned at the Oregon State Penitentiary, he contracted tuberculosis and was denied treatment. He was released from prison after fifteen months on a suspended sentence, which was issued by the original circuit judge that sentenced him. He died on October 12, 1932 and his supporters called it a murder by the State of Oregon. His funeral attracted several socialist and communist supporters as they carried Boloff's coffin through the street. Despite being a citizen of Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, Boloff was never deported after being convicted and was eventually buried in his adopted hometown of Portland.  Biography  Boloff lived in Portland, Oregon and worked as a construction worker. He was arrested on November 1, 1930 in Portland initially on the charge of vagrancy, but police found a communist membership card on him, leading them to charge him under Oregon's criminal syndicalism statute. Boloff's arrest was one of several arrests of communists in 1930 by the Portland Police Bureau, but his case was unique in that it was one of the few cases to be tried in court. He entered a not guilty plea in court. His trial was delayed from January to February 1931. Boloff was the first of the 12 people charged under the criminal syndicalism to be tried. The jury selection focused on the prospective member's opinions on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. During Boloff's trial, a police informant testified as a witness for the prosecution stating that the Communist party's goal was to recruit high school students, including those at Washington High School and train them against patriotism and capitalism. He went on to say that Communist agreed with public education, but disapproved of the administration. He never directly named Boloff in his testimony. A Communist party membership card with Vladimir Lenin's profile on it was submitted into evidence. Boloff took the witness stand in his own defense. He stated that he was unable to read the English language and that did not know of Oregon's criminal syndicalism or that it made being associated with communist organizations as punishable offence. Boloff stated that he only joined the Communist party because they represented working people like himself. The state asked him just one question during cross examination, whether or not he was a member of the Communist party since 1924, which Boloff admitted he was. The jury found him guilty of criminal syndicalism and he was sentenced to ten years at the Oregon State Penitentiary. After his conviction, a petition was written demanding Boloff's immediate release was circulated. The petition was investigated by the Portland Police Bureau's Red Squad, a group of officers who investigated communist activity. Two of the twelve other Communists arrested with Boloff were acquitted as a groundswell of support for Boloff and the others charged began to coalesces. The ten other prisoners were released and the charges against them were dropped. The Oregon Supreme Court denied a second hearing of the case, reaffirming their previous ruling that upheld the lower court's ruling. Three separate petitions were sent to the Oregon Supreme Court requesting that they rehear the case. Finally, the original trial judge suspended Boloff's sentence and he was released on his own recognizance. Boloff's tuberculosis, which he contracted at the Oregon State Penitentiary, was advanced due to the lack of treatment. He succumbed to the disease on October 12, 1932, in Portland. Boloff's casket was raised through the streets of Portland. Given an opportunity to break-up the mourners, the mayor of Portland allowed the procession to continue without police intervention. Boloff was interred at River View Cemetery in Portland with a hammer and sickle insignia on his headstone. After his first appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court was defeated, The Oregonian wrote an op-ed in support of Boloff's release. The editors noted that Boloff's imprisonment only strengthened the communist movement by making him a martyr for their cause. In a later op-ed entitled \\"Set Boloff free\\", The Oregonian editors urged the Governor Julius Meier to pardon him. The article details the criminal syndicalism law in Oregon, arguing it was passed around the time of World War I as an \\"emergency measure\\", but to apply it to Boloff was an abuse of power.

Nineteen soldiers were killed in the deadliest day since peace talks began in November 2012. The conflict came one day after a FARC-EP officer Alejandra had detained with a chain around the neck a vacationing U.S. Army Combat Engineer (12B) veteran, Kevin Scott Sutay including for his 27th birthday in the jungle on October 13 to try and further anger him intentionally. Former US Army Specialist Sutay walked alone from San Jose Del Guaviare to El Returno then proceeded on foot alone enjoying the jungle for another 50 to 60 kilometers SSE wearing flip-flops for the first 25 kilometers switching to tennis shoes after they broke. Kevin encountered FARC-EP whom provided rubber boots and a mosquito net for Kevin and noticed they were headed in the same direction. Kevin began to travel together with FARC-EP unrestricted for approximately 2 weeks and approximately another 200 kilometers by foot and boat until the FARC-EP officer Alejandra arrived and insisted Kevin be disarmed of his machete and karambit knife, personal belongings be withheld, and he be detained. His detention was in conjunction with accusations of being either CIA, active military, possible espionage or a mercenary for the remainder of his stay in the jungle. Kevin desired to continue his journey towards Puinawai and In√≠rida including after his release four months later but FARC-EP insisted he leave the jungle with the International Red Cross.  Background  Since the 1960s, the Colombian government has been in periodic conflicts with Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels. An estimated 600,000 people have died in the 50-year-long conflict, with an additional 3.7 million people displaced. In November 2012, peace negotiations between the two sides began in Oslo, Norway and Havana, Cuba. At the time of the 20 July attacks, negotiations were ongoing. A few days prior, FARC's chief negotiator said the conflict was nearing its end. Three previous attempts to peacefully end the conflict failed. The Colombia government estimates that FARC has 8,000 active fighters, down from 16,000 in 2001.  Attacks  In southern Colombia, FARC said it had detained a former U.S. Army soldier far outside El Retorno whom was traveling alone on foot towards Colombia's Puinawai(mother of creation/first mother) Natural Reserve which included 3 exclusive mountains on 19 July, but was willing to release him to senator Piedad Cordoba to show commitment to the peace talks. A statement by the U.S. government said the man was in the area as a tourist, not as a part of a military mission. Historically, the United States has aided the Colombian military. In the town of El Doncello in southwest Colombia, a battle between the army and FARC left 4 soldiers and 6 FARC members dead on 20 July. Three other soldiers were injured and two rebel fighters were captured. Hours later, about 70 rebels ambushed a group of government soldiers guarding an oil pipeline on 20 July in El Mordisco, a rural area of Arauca in eastern Colombia. Fifteen soldiers were killed in the attack and twelve rebels were captured. The government attributed the attack to FARC activity. Overall 20 July was the deadliest day since peace talks began also known as the Colombian Independence day.  Response and aftermath  Colombia's president Juan Manuel Santos traveled to Arauca to the site of the ambush. There, he promised to retaliate with \\"the entire machinery\\" of war. \\"Just as we have extended our hand and are in negotiations, so do we have a big stick. We have decisive military force and will apply it,\\" he said. He did, however, reiterate that the government was optimistic about the peace talks and said he hoped \\"the guerrillas will come to their senses\\" and continue with the talks. Santos also stated that he would not allow the FARC rebels to make a media circus of the release of the American soldier that was detained after the group \\"flagrantly violated\\" a promise to end the kidnappings before peace talks began. On 22 July, two FARC members were killed during a military operation in southwest Cauca. The same day, FARC offered to arm coca farmers that have been protesting against coca eradication. Peace talks between FARC and the Colombian government are expected to resume on 28 July.

After a successful amateur career, he turned professional in March 2013, making the top makuuchi division that September. His highest rank has been komusubi. He has been awarded one special prize for Fighting Spirit, one for Outstanding Performance and three for Technique, as well as seven gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He was runner-up in the September 2016 tournament. He wrestles for Oitekaze stable. He is extremely popular with Japanese sumo fans and has been regarded as one of the most promising home-grown wrestlers in sumo. Early life and sumo background End≈ç first began trying out sumo in his primary school years largely to please his father. He did not like sumo at first, but as time went on he became inspired by the spirit and technique of then yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´. He began trying out more techniques and came to love sumo.National student sumo athletes ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂ≠¶ÁîüÁõ∏Êí≤ÈÅ∏ÊâãÊ®©Ôºö10Êó•ÈñãÂπï‚Ä¶ÂÄã‰∫∫Êà¶V„ÅÆË°åÊñπ„ÅØ mainichi.jp In his second year of junior high school, he participated in a Kanazawa area sumo competition, where he won the team championship as well as beating the future Tochinosato in a playoff to take the individual championship. In high school, he participated in several team and individual competitions, taking two separate championships. Upon graduation he entered Nihon University as an economics major. From his fourth year, he was captain of the sumo team. That year he also took two major national championship titles becoming both the amateur sumo yokozuna as well as the National Athletic Championship yokozuna. Despite of his great success at sumo thus far, it was a difficult decision for End≈ç whether or not to go professional, because he had a dream of becoming a teacher.Amateur yokozuna Endo enters Oitekaze stable „Ç¢„Éû„ÉÅ„É•„Ç¢Ê®™Á∂±„ÉªÈÅ†Ëó§„ÄÅËøΩÊâãÈ¢®ÈÉ®Â±ãÂÖ•ÈñÄ„ÇíË°®Êòé YOMIURI ONLINE 2013-3-8  Career  Satoyama January 2014 After taking some time to reflect he decided to join professional sumo as a wrestler for Oitekaze stable, the stable where Daish≈çyama, who was from the same hometown as him, was the founder and head coach. Upon entering professional sumo, he was allowed to debut as a makushita tsukedashi instead of starting at the bottom of the ranks, to reflect his amateur success. Moreover, because of his two national championships he was allowed to debut at an even higher rank than other amateur champions. This debut at makushita 10, was only the second time this has had been allowed, following his Nihon University predecessor Ichihara.Endo takes two national championships ÈÅ†Ëó§„ÅåÂàù„ÅÆ„Ç¢„ÉûÊ®™Á∂± ÂõΩ‰Ωì„Å®„ÅÆ2ÂÜ†ÈÅîÊàê ÂÖ®Êó•Êú¨ÈÅ∏ÊâãÊ®© MSN Sankei News2013-3-8 He entered the professional ring in the March 2013 tournament, choosing to keep his surname of End≈ç as his shikona. He was not quite as successful as was expected, managing two consecutive tournaments with strong, but less than ideal, 5‚Äì2 records. They were enough, however, to allow him to join the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç for the July 2013 tournament. He did so without a top-knot as his hair was still not long enough for one. Debuting at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 13, he came into his own, finally giving the kind of performance that had been expected of him. He beat several wrestlers with top makuuchi division experience as well as other up and comers, including the closely watched Egyptian wrestler ≈åsunaarashi. His only loss was to j≈´ry≈ç regular Tokushinh≈ç. His 14‚Äì1 record was at least a four win berth over any other wrestler in the division and his championship was already decided by the 13th day of the tournament. His previous amateur success, his technique and his seemingly effortless championship fueled speculation that End≈ç could be the next big Japanese hope in professional sumo in a sport largely dominated by foreigners in the higher ranks. His success continued into his makuuchi debut in September 2013, where he scored a majority of wins, although he damaged his left ankle and dropped out of the tournament on Day 14. After making a respectable comeback in November with a score of 6‚Äì9 from the rank of maegashira 7, he had his best result in the top division to date in January 2014, winning eleven bouts and the Fighting Spirit Prize. He was even matched with an ≈çzeki, Kotosh≈çgiku, on Day 12, although he lost this bout. Promoted to the top of the maegashira ranks for the March 2014 tournament, he faced three ≈çzeki and two yokozuna in his first five matches. He lost the first four but defeated Kisenosato on Day 5, his first win over an ≈çzeki, and the fact that he was still without a top-knot was also noted. He finished the tournament with a 6‚Äì9. The following May 2014 tournament, while only managing a 7‚Äì8, he got his first kinboshi or gold star win against yokozuna Kakury≈´. End≈ç suffered a serious injury to his left knee after a bout against Shohozan on the fifth day of the March 2015 tournament, rupturing anterior cruciate ligaments and damaging the lateral meniscus. He opted not to have surgery and competed in the following tournament in May, knowing he would be demoted to j≈´ry≈ç if he failed to take part. Although he only scored six wins against nine losses, it was enough to keep him in the top division. In the Nagoya tournament in July, he came through with a solid 10‚Äì5 record and recorded 8 wins in September. A disappointing 4‚Äì11 in November however, was followed by a sprain to his right ankle in the January 2016 tournament (attributed to over- compensating for his previous left knee injury) and End≈ç was demoted to the second division (j≈´ry≈ç) for March. He returned to the top division in May 2016 and scored 11‚Äì4, although a defeat on the final day meant he missed out on a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. In September 2016, fighting from the low rank of maegashira 14, he finished runner-up to Goeido on 13‚Äì2 and won his first Technique Prize. In November he defeated three ozeki and yokozuna Hakuho but lost four of his last five matches to finish with a make-koshi 7‚Äì8 record, which cost him the Outstanding Performance Award. Fighting at the rank of maegashira 1 in May 2017 (his highest rank since September 2014), on Day 4 he was the first to earn a kinboshi against new yokozuna Kisenosato, giving Endo the third of his career. He withdrew from the July tournament on the fifth day due to an injury to his left ankle. He underwent surgery on the ankle in late July. He picked up his fourth kinboshi in the January 2018 tournament with a defeat of Kakury≈´, and won his second Technique Prize in March. His consecutive kachi-koshi performances in the tournaments following his injury earned him a sanyaku rank for the first time for the May 2018 tournament, at komusubi. In his sanyaku debut he injured his right arm in his Day 6 match against fellow komusubi Mitakeumi and had to withdraw from the tournament. Although he returned on Day 10 he was unable to win any of his remaining matches and finished with a 3‚Äì10‚Äì2 record. He earned his fifth and sixth kinboshi with back-to-back victories over Kakury≈´ and Hakuho on Day 1 and Day 2 of the January 2020 Hatsu basho. He came the third wrestler post WWII to win back-to-back kinboshi on the opening two days of a tournament, and the first since Tochiazuma in September 1999. He returned to komusubi in March, but after a 7‚Äì8 record was demoted to maegashira 1. In July he earned another kinboshi, defeating Kakury≈´ on opening day. Back at komusubi in September, he withdrew on Day 11 with only three wins, after a build-up of fluid in his right knee related to his previous injury. He is the owner of the Kitajin toshiyori kabu or elder stock, purchased from the former Kirinji in May 2018, indicating he intends to stay in sumo as a coach upon his retirement. Personal Life In October 2019, Endo announced that he had been married since May and was no longer living at his stable. He declined to answer any questions about his bride saying \\"She's an ordinary member of the public, so I think it's not necessary to answer to that\\".https://www.sanspo.com/sports/news/20191011/sum19101105050003-n1.html  Fighting style  End≈ç is a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring grappling techniques to pushing and thrusting. His most common winning kimarite is a straightforward yori kiri, or force out, and he uses a hidari yotsu grip on the mawashi or belt, with his right hand outside and left hand inside his opponent's arms. He has a flexible offense and is good at catching his opponents off-guard.

February 26, 1934 ‚Äì d. 2008) was a Mexican painter and art teacher. He began studying art at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\", but unsatisfied with the instruction, helped organize a student strike. It was unsuccessful and rather than return to school, he decided to go to Morelia to teach. Donis‚Äô art career consisted of exhibitions both in Mexico and abroad, including an important exhibition at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City and accepted as a regular with the prestigious Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano. His teaching career included directorship at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Benito Ju√°rez as well as helping to found the Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas Rufino Tamayo in the city of Oaxaca. He received several recognitions for his work, including membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Roberto Donis was born in the small town of Venado in the state of San Luis Potos√≠. In 1950, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" at age sixteen, studying principally under Carlos Orozco Romero but at this time he work was also influenced by figurative Mexican painters Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Manuel Rodr√≠guez. In 1953, not satisfied with the education he was receiving, he organized a student revolt along with Rafael Coronel and Gilberto Aceves Navarro. Fifteen students resigned together for set up their own exhibition in the basement of the Excelsior newspaper building. However, the event was short-lived and achieved little as their demands were ignored and the group went back to school, all except Donis who then went to Michoac√°n to teach. He returned to Mexico City in 1956, hoping to sell his paintings and earn enough money to travel abroad. In 1962 and 1963, he lived in Paris and studied art history at the √âcole du Louvre. During this time, he came into contact with various avant garde artists, which motivated him to experiment with abstract art. He also developed lifelong friendships with Mexican artists Rufino Tamayo, Francisco Toledo and Jorge Dubon. He returned to Mexico in 1963. From 1966 to 1969 he lived in New York. This time he received influence from American abstract art. His relationship with Toledo led him to settle in Oaxaca after he returned to Mexico in 1970, acquiring a large house in the small town of Santa Mar√≠a de Tule, near the city of Oaxaca. He had six daughters Denhi, Paulina, Yerina, Guiexoba, Oralia, and Eugenia. Donis died of cancer in 2008. Career After a failed student protest, Donis decided to begin his professional career rather than continuing with school. He went to Morelia in 1954 to teach at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. He was noted for his ability to teach as well as find talented students. In 1972, he became the director of the Escuela de Bellas Artes at Universidad Aut√≥noma Benito Ju√°rez, where he radically modernized its system of teaching. However, he was forced to resign a year later due to internal conflicts. In 1974, he founded, along with Tamayo, the Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas Rufino Tamayo, where he remained until 1984. During this time he dedicated himself to developing a new way to teach art students which he called experimental teaching, emphasizing that student should not copy what has been done before. He also stressed drawing skills as a way to generate innovation. Various Oaxaca artists came out of this school at this time including Alejandro Santiago, Filem√≥n Santiago, Maximo Javier, Abelardo L√≥pez, Juan Alc√°zar, Arnulfo Mendoza and Ariel Mendoza. He left the Tamayo workshop due to conflicts with a number of students. In 1954 he had his first individual exhibition in Morelia. Over his career, he had individual exhibitions in Mexico in venues such as the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana, the Glantz Gallery, Galer√≠a Misrachi and the prestigious Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano. With the last venue, he became of its regular artists at a young age, starting in 1966. In 1979, he presented a series of 40 paintings at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City, to favorable criticism. Donis participated in collective exhibitions in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Cuba, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Spain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Poland, China, Russia, the Czech Republic and Japan. These included the Confrontaci√≥n 66 exhibition, and one of the representing artists from Mexico at the Expo 67 in Montreal. Donis retired from painting in the 1980s. His first recognition was an honorary mention from the Instituto Mexicano de Arte competition, which allowed him to travel for two months to New York and Washington, DC. He was accepted as a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Before his death in 2008, his hometown of Venado paid homage to him. At the same event, Donis donated artworks by him and Rufino Tamayo, along with Australian aboriginal art which he collected. These works were used for the permanent collection of the Roberto Donis Cultural Center, which is located in the old textile factory of the town. After his death, he was paid homage at the Museo de los Pintores Oaxaque√±os in 2009. Artistry From 1950 to 1954, his work was primarily figurative, which eventually evolved into a kind of expressionism during the rest of that decade. After his first trip to Paris, he began to experiment with abstract expression, which was solidified after his time in New York (1966-1969) .

In 2001, drummer Pat Kraus joined and named them the Futurians. He left after recording their first album, and ISO-12 (Jason Aldridge) and Rocko Mandroid (Sean Norling) were recruited soon afterwards on synth and drums respectively. Stefan Neville of Pumice was later an interim member, and Antony Milton played a space-y game onstage once.  Festivals  They have played at many New Zealand festivals; including Lines of Flight, Meatwaters, the Dunedin Fringe Festival, Rising Tides Festival, Deathstar Disco XXXIII, and Swallow Your Words.  Covers  The Futurians have covered the Rolling Stones, Joy Division, Human Instinct, Grace Jones, Boney M., Robots in Disguise, the Troggs, the Timelords, Hasil Adkins, Billy Joel, Iggy Pop, Tivol and Gary Glitter.

Her solo shows have been called authoritative, with precise and fearless dancing. As part of the \\"No Venues\\" concept, Ducklingmonster shows are often staged in unconventional spaces such as public parks, back yards and church stoops. This was born of a frustration of having a stage create a barrier between the performer and the audience, and barriers encountered between art practice and commercial and institutional venues. Her Society for Cutting Up Venues Manifesto outlines the philosophy behind the No Venues concept. She is a core member of the Uniform Collective, a central Auckland women's art collective that organises art shows, parties, and a magazine.

The wall existed from 1962 to 1989. After its demolition, pieces of the wall were broken with some taken as souvenirs. World War II affected many countries, Germany in particular. After the years of total war, the Nazi regime in Germany finally surrendered to the Allied countries in spring of 1945.Evans, Richard J. Third Reich at War. London: Allen Lane, 2008. Print. Later, the Empire of Japan surrendered shortly after the second atomic bomb devastated their country.\\"Potsdam Declaration.\\" AtomicArchive.com. National Science Digital Library (NSDL) (1998-2015), n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2016. In the post-war years, tensions between two of the victorious powers, the United States and the Soviet Union emerged. The former was growing ever more capitalistic and the latter pursued communism. Germany, not only geographically located in the center of Europe, was the center of the divided between the powers. Germany, especially its capital, Berlin, was partitioned by the victors of the Second World War; there were a few parts but the major division was east-west dividing the capitalist countries from the communist one. A great wall was erected almost two decades later to strengthen the division, literally and figuratively. Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall represented one of the great political, economic, and ideological divides of the twentieth century between two major powers: the United States and the Soviet Union. It was 96 miles in length. The conflict between these two powers affected the global community, namely Germany. Even after it was demolished, the wall symbolized divisions in Germany and the rest of the world, ones that arguably still exist today. Cornell sociologist Christine Leuenberger described the effects of the wall and its ultimate fall by arguing that \\"It became the landmark that symbolized the Cold War‚Ä¶ the Berlin Wall also left a lasting impression on the psyche of the German people\\". She further argues that The Berlin Wall \\"provides a salient and powerful example of how material culture intersects with knowledge production in the psychological sciences\\". After the fall Monument plaque describing the dedication to Chicago. This is a tourism map of Lincoln Square. Lincoln Square is a neighborhood in the northern part of Chicago. It has been a historically German neighborhood. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, fragments of the Berlin Wall have been donated to various cities in the world. Chicago was offered a piece of the wall in 2008 by the German government and was placed in the Lincoln Square neighborhood due to its German roots. It is on permanent display at the Western Brown Line Station. Lincoln Square is just southwest of Ravenswood in the northern part of Chicago. The particular segment of the wall donated came from the fourth phase of the Berlin Wall's construction, called Grenzmauer 75. The dedication was attended by 120 residents and included several prominent individuals such as Erich Himmel of United German American Societies of Greater Chicago, Alderman Gene Schulter, Chicago Transit Authority President Ron Huberman, then-mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley and the U.S. diplomat and charg√© d'affaires to Germany, . It is one of two fragments of the wall on display in Illinois; the other is in the Ronald Reagan Peace Garden at Eureka College in Eureka, Illinois. Description The wall segment is visible on both sides. The side that originally faced West Germany contains sprayed graffiti and messages from the time the wall was standing; the side that faced East Germany, on the other hand, is entirely blank. It is simple to tell which side faced West Berlin and which side faced East Berlin. The former has graffiti and the latter is bare. \\"'So you're talking about the free side, the side that the Americans were able to release at the end of (World War II). That's why we have all this graffiti on it, because they were free, they were allowed to do things, and express themselves,' Nicholle Dombrowski, executive director of the DANK Haus German American Cultural Center, said. 'The east side is traditionally clean, because they were under a communist government at that time, and they were not allowed to express themselves, whatsoever.'\\". The piece serves as a metaphoric and literal reminder of the two very different sides of a long, bitter conflict. The monument also contains a plaque describing the dedication and reasoning behind why the wall fragment was donated. The inscription reads: :\\"Segment of the Berlin Wall (1961 - 1989) dedicated by the City of Berlin to the citizens of Chicago as an expression of its gratitude for the invaluable assistance rendered by the United States of America in securing the safety and freedom of Berlin, in bringing down the Wall, and in supporting reunification of Germany and Berlin.\\" The inscription contains affirmations of acceptance from many representative individuals and businesses of both Chicago and Germany at the time including Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Mayor of Berlin Klaus Wowereit, German Consul General Wolfgang Droutz, Lufthansa, and the Chicago Transit Authority.

The Fancy classification was initially debated by the DHG Gemological Laboratory and the Gemmological Center of Moscow State University. The Ocean Paradise was rated in color as Fancy Greenish Blue by Moscow State University and Fancy Green Blue by DHG. (A blue- green colour is commonly seen in artificially enhanced diamonds, whose colour is imparted by various irradiation methods.) Both institutions have determined that the Ocean Paradise is oval shaped and has a clarity grade of VS2.  Discovery  The Ocean Paradise was discovered in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil in 2012.

Plot Oswald is a radio personality who runs a radio station R-A- Z-Z. Individuals with musical talents are selected before they perform there. The first performers consists of a rat, a horse, and a ram who sing the song And If You See Our Darling Nellie. Their act is well received by the live spectators. The next to perform is a porcupine with a cello. But because the porcupine's performance is drab, an animated microphone decides to help out by taking and playing the instrument in a more upbeat fashion. But when he gets back the cello and continues to play poorly, the porcupine gets removed from the picture. Oswald then turns to a jazz band which performs the song One More Time. The rabbit even plays along as he takes and plays a piano. Some musicians and listeners sing to it. As Oswald plays another tune on his piano, a male donkey decides to take a female cow for a date. When the couple enter a saloon, the donkey gets hurled out of the place by a bull who wants to take the female cow. The thrown donkey lands on and smashes Oswald's piano.

Aside from a place of origin and mythology, ritual landscapes were also considered places of protection and renewal. Avebury Stone Circle in Great Britain  Features  Many ritual landscapes were gradually built around the two earliest classes of Neolithic communal monuments, known as long barrows and causewayed enclosures. In Britain, for instance, the Avebury ritual site featured a giant, flat-topped barrow called Silbury Hill, which is considered the largest artificial mound in prehistoric Europe. The evidence of contemporary settlement within these landscapes is often sparse or absent altogether; conversely, non-utilitarian structures and artifacts are typically abundant. In other cultures, the ritual landscape is strongly influenced by the environment. This is demonstrated in the case of Tibet, the verticality of the environment dominated the constructions of the ritual landscape and features therein such as structures and tombs, which were built to resemble the mountains. Ritual landscapes went out of use relatively abruptly around 1500 BC and were replaced by smaller- scale shrines, which were often located near rivers, marshes, and springs. These smaller shrines usually feature offerings of food and metalwork and continued to be created and used into Roman and even Saxon times. Today they are often described as Celtic.

Description Pinaroo is an ephemeral lake in the arid north-western corner of New South Wales (NSW) near Cameron Corner. It forms the largest terminal basin within the NSW part of the Simpson‚ÄìStrzelecki Dunefields bioregion. It is subject to erratic flood events interspersed with extended dry periods; once full, it may take up to six years to dry out. =Flora and fauna= Because it holds water for much longer periods than other wetlands in the desert region, it is regionally important as a breeding site and drought refuge for many kinds of animals, especially waterbirds that have bred on, for example, interdune swamps that only retain water for a few months. Waterbirds for which the site is important when inundated include freckled and blue- billed ducks. It is also used as a staging site by migratory waders such as black-tailed godwits, common greenshanks, marsh sandpipers and red-necked stints. It provides opportunities to see large flocks of desert birds such as budgerigars. Other animals recorded at the site are the eastern long-eared bat and interior blind snake.

She has been at the center of controversy for several years. Her reputation as a troubled elephant, allegedly due to past abuse and an inadequate life at the Zoo, has caused animal rights activists such as Friends of Woodland Park Zoo Elephants to fight for the release of the Zoo's elephants to a sanctuary. According to the Zoo's website, Bamboo weighs 8,800 pounds and is the most inquisitive of its three elephants.  Early years  Bamboo was born in Thailand in November 1966 and was captured from the wild as a very young calf. She was imported into the United States and arrived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington on June 1, 1967. She lived at the Children's Zoo in the Family Farm before moving to the old Elephant House. Former Director of the Zoo, David Hancocks, recalled that Bamboo was once a playful, trustworthy, and cooperative elephant who could be walked on Zoo grounds and use the entire park as her playground. According to Hancocks, who left the Zoo in 1984, harsh management methods such as discipline and overnight chaining were reintroduced after his departure. As a result, Bamboo earned a reputation as a dangerous and \\"difficult\\" elephant.  A \\"difficult\\" elephant  On November 3, 2000, another Asian elephant named Chai gave birth to a female calf named Hansa. The new addition changed the daily routine for Bamboo, who was not originally welcoming toward Hansa and had to be housed separately. Spending much of her time alone in a small barn stall, she displayed what is believed to be stereotypical behavior for elephants - pacing and bobbing her head continuously - caused by inadequate environmental and social conditions and is not displayed by elephants living in the wild. A YouTube video taken in May 2001 shows Bamboo exhibiting this stereotypical behavior, pacing around her small space repeatedly in circles. Bamboo was also known to be aggressive toward keepers; she once grabbed a keeper's bullhook and even knocked another keeper down while he was sweeping the hay in her stall.Hansa: The True Story of an Asian Elephant Baby (novel by Clare Hodgson Meeker) In 2005, it was announced that Bamboo would be moving to the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington in an attempt to integrate her into the \\"herd\\" of its two resident Asian elephants, Suki and Hanako, who are similar in age and disposition to her. According to the Point Defiance Zoo, Bamboo did not show predictable social skills toward newborns or very young calves and therefore did not fit into the Woodland Park Zoo's Asian elephant breeding program. She also had a strained relationship with Seattle's African elephant, Watoto, who had bullied her in the past and had to be housed separately from her. Bamboo arrived at the Point Defiance Zoo on August 25, 2005, but stayed there for less than a year, as Suki and Hanako did not accept her. As a result, she had to spend most of her time in Tacoma alone. She returned to the Woodland Park Zoo on June 11, 2006.  New plans for the Zoo's elephants  After years of PETA outcry over the Zoo's inadequate elephant exhibit, the Woodland Park Zoo launched a task force in 2013 to investigate the living conditions of the elephants. The task force was criticized, however, due to the fact that many of its members are or have been affiliated with the Zoo. In August, a six- member panel suggested changes, such as allowing the elephants to have free contact with one another and replacing the concrete floors of the barn with sand. In March 2014, the Woodland Park Zoo announced planned changes for the elephant program, which include spending $3 million on improving the exhibit and sending its African elephant to another location in order to house a new Asian elephant. Zoo officials have also stated that they may possibly acquire a fourth female Asian elephant of breeding age. Zoo management reversed course in November 2014, announcing that they would be closing the elephant exhibit rather than expanding it. The Woodland Park Zoo plans to relocate the elephants to other zoos with existing elephant herds, however some groups are still opposed to this and believe the elephants should be placed in nature preserves. On April 15, 2015, Bamboo and one other elephant were moved from Woodland Park Zoo to Oklahoma City Zoo. They arrived in Oklahoma City Zoo on May 13, 2015 where they were separated and quarantined for 30 days.  Later life  At 52 years old, Bamboo is the oldest of the Zoo's elephants as well as the largest, weighing in at 8,800 pounds. She is also the hairiest individual and has a large amount of hair on her head and back. Bamboo is the most inquisitive of the three elephants and has learned how to pick locks, open doors, unscrew bolts, and dismantle locks.

Summary The novel is narrated by white American leftist Hannah Musgrave, a woman in her fifties reflecting back on her life as a politically radical student who later became a member of the Weathermen and changes her name to Dawn Carrington. After a series of failed relationships with men, Dawn takes on a young mother named Carol as her lover and lives with her and her daughter Bettina while carrying on secret activities for the weathermen. After Zack, another member of her cell, erroneously tells her that they are both wanted by drug dealers, she flees with him to Ghana before moving on to the city of Monrovia in Liberia in 1975. There she meets and eventually marries the Minister of Public Health, Woodrow Sundiata, who is aware of her political past but is willing to overlook it because of the status that a white American woman brings to his family. Their marriage is one of convenience on both sides and during the time they are together Hannah gives birth to three sons: Dillon, a math prodigy, and twin boys William and Paul. Motherhood does not come naturally to Hannah and she feels cold and distant with her children while at the same time feeling warm and loving to the chimpanzees she works with as part of her job. In 1980 William R. Tolbert, Jr., the president of Liberia and a friend of Woodrow's, is murdered during a coup d'√©tat. He is replaced by Samuel Doe. Hannah's life remains relatively comfortable throughout the political upheaval and she remains ignorant of the political situation in Liberia until three years later, in 1983, when she is 40 years old, when Woodrow is taken away from home in the middle of the night on accusations that he and Charles Taylor have embezzled aid relief for their own personal use. Woodrow is eventually able to successfully free himself but as a condition of his release Hannah is forced to return to America without her sons. Hannah is secretly relieved at the idea of abandoning her children and husband, though she mourns her separation from her chimpanzees. In America Hannah decides to visit her parents for the first time in 15 years. After surprising her mother she learns that her father suffered a cerebral hemorrhage a few weeks before her return. Though her mother is optimistic about his recovery Hannah quickly realizes that he is completely brain-dead. She is able to visit her father once in the hospital before he dies. Shaken by the death of her father, Hannah steals her mothers car and goes to find Carol. She finds Zack living there and he tells her of his brief incarceration in a low-security prison where he met Charles Taylor. Hannah goes to meet Charles Taylor in jail and after he tells her that, once free, he will assassinate Samuel Doe and allow Hannah to return home, she agrees to help him escape from jail. After helping Charles Taylor to flee America, Hannah begins to correspond with her husband Woodrow. She learns that Samuel Doe has lifted his imposed ban on her and she is free to return to Liberia. Once in Liberia Hannah decides to open a rescue sanctuary for her beloved chimpanzees while she waits patiently for Charles Taylor to return and overthrow Samuel Doe. Eventually Charles Taylor and a small guerrilla group begin to invade Liberia, triggering the beginning of the First Liberian Civil War. Since Hannah and her family live in the country's capital, Monrovia they are able to stay protected for some time. Eventually, Samuel Doe, fearful that he is losing power, sends a group of assassins to murder Woodrow. Hannah and her children witness the murder and her sons run off shortly thereafter to join any of the rebel armies against Samuel Doe. Hannah spends the rest of her time in Liberia fruitlessly searching for her sons despite the urging of Sam Clement, the American ambassador, to leave for America. He at last provides a video tape showing that her children are now child soldiers working for Prince Johnson who have murdered Samuel Doe. He also reveals that the Americans were behind Charles Taylor's escape from prison and rise to power and that they have known Hannah's true identity and movements for decades. Hannah, dispirited that all along she was working on behalf of the interests of the CIA finally leaves Liberia. Reception The novel received positive reviews upon its publication. The Guardian called it \\"an urgent, passionate, compelling panorama\\" while noting that it \\"deserves to stand beside Conrad and Greene.\\" The Village Voice praised Hannah as \\"The Darling's only full-bodied character, a monstrously magnetic woman\\" but criticized Bank's \\"inability or unwillingness to bring Hannah's African family to life\\" calling it a \\"major failure on Banks's part, in a book otherwise reverberating with ideas and startling prose.\\" Adaptations A film adaptation of The Darling starring Cate Blanchett and directed by Martin Scorsese was planned and later scrapped. In 2011 Jessica Chastain was rumoured to be attached to the role of Hannah with Denis Villeneuve directing.

On its time of closing, Hotel Otava was the oldest hotel-restaurant in Finland. The Neo-Renaissance building is designed by the Swedish architect C. J. von Heideken. Today it works as an office building for the city administration. Hotel Otava was named after the Finnish name of the Big Dipper. The building is located on the same block with the 1853 established Pori Brewery and the 1884 opened Pori Theatre. It is a part of the old town which is listed as a cultural environment of national significance by the Finnish National Board of Antiquities.  History  The building was originally built in 1857 with two storeys, consisting of accommodation and a drawing room, which was later changed to become a theatre. The building took its current form in 1891, when a third storey was added, as had been originally planned by the architect, C. J. von Heideken. Hotel Otava is considered to be the birthplace of the Finnish-language theatre as the Finnish National Theatre gave its first performance at the hotel's auditorium on 13 October 1872. During the World War II, the hotel hosted the staff of the German troops, which had an airbase at the Pori Airport. After the war, the hotel accommodated the Russian Allied Commission staff officers. Hotel Otava was also one of the concert venues of the annual Pori Jazz festival, which is one of the major European jazz festivals. Artists performing at Otava include names like Bobby Hutcherson, Champion Jack Dupree and Herbie Hancock. In 1882, the theatre was converted into become a concert hall and a dance hall. The hotel closed on 28 February 1985, Kalevala Day; it was, at the time, the longest continually open hotel-restaurant in Finland. = Present day usage = The city of Pori bought the property in 1997. In 2000, a six-year long renovation took place at a cost of three million euros, and the building was rebuilt to its original size. The building is now used as an office building for the city administration. In July 2016, a ceiling on the building's first floor collapsed, causing the building to be closed for six months to allow repairs to take place, with the twenty affected employees moving to the City Hall. During the survey, it was discovered that the ceiling of the third floor was architecturally different to that of the other floors.

Music  Alongside his teaching role, Peter was known for his contributions to the field of chanting, both as a composer and in his explanations of old chantings. He completed both known books of Peter the Peloponnesian, the Anastasimatarion, composing the missing Kekragaria with the incidental Stichologia, and the Heirmologion of Katavasies, adding Heirmoses standards for several holidays. He also pointed at the outset the Short Anastasimatarion and most importantly, for the first time, the Short Heirmologion.First publication, Constantinople (1825) He composed many chantings of Priests' Art (Greek: Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ), such as the ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœâŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ œÑœâŒΩ KœÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫œéŒΩ (three stops) and some of the ŒïŒΩŒπŒ±œÖœÑœåœÇ, eight Cherubic Hymns in all modes, Doxologies, two Theotokia, eight Timioteres (Greek: Œ§ŒπŒºŒπœâœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ) for all modes, the ŒùŒµŒ∫œÅœéœÉŒπŒºŒøœÇ ŒÜŒºœâŒºŒøœÇ, and some others. His compositions are distinguished by their simplicity and frugality, and he sang his chants, as noted by Chrysanthos of Madytos:Archbishop of Durr√´s \\"with orderliness, concern, and the appropriate pace of chanting.\\"¬´ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒµœçœÑŒ±Œ∫œÑŒøŒΩ ŒºŒ¨ŒªŒªŒøŒΩ Œ±œÜŒøœÅœéŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒµœçœÅœÖŒ∏ŒºŒøŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ œàŒ±ŒªŒºœâŒ¥ŒØŒ±œÇ¬ª ‚Äì \\"Theoretical Mega\\" by Chrysanthos of Madytos, page LIII = Manuscripts = Peter the Byzantine copied and expounded many manuscripts.

Some are dated between the years 1773‚Äì1806, while others are undated. There are also multiple copies of his copies of the works of Peter the Peloponnesian, as well as numerous anthologies of Priests' New Art (Greek: ŒùŒ≠Œ± Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒÆ). = Works = * Heirmologion by Peter the Peloponnesian * Short Heirmologion * Anastasimatarion by Peter the Peloponnesian * Short Anastasimatarion * Doxastarion by Peter the Peloponnesian * Doxastarion by Jacob the Arch-cantor = Contribution = Due to this teaching and his work in the area of chanting, as well and his copying and explanations of older works, Peter the Byzantine remains one of the most important musicians in the second great period of prosperity (1770‚Äì1820) of the new church chanting.

It was a major power center-style strip mall from its opening until the early 2000's. A Walmart opened on the adjacent lot to Northern Lights in 2014. Parts of the plaza were demolished in 2018. History The plaza opened in the late 1950s along Pennsylvania Route 65 (then part of Pennsylvania Route 88), serving as the major shopping center for the Beaver Valley. For decades, J. C. Penney was the main anchor store for the plaza, having a three-story store at the plaza. Other anchor tenants included Sears, local supermarket chain Giant Eagle, and discount department store chain Hills. The plaza was divided into three buildings: the main eastern portion of the plaza facing the Ohio River housed J. C. Penney and Hills. The northern portion of the plaza housed Giant Eagle, while the southern portion housed Sears; all three buildings also housed many smaller shops. Despite the opening of the Beaver Valley Mall in 1970 in nearby Center Township, Northern Lights continued to attract shoppers, although Sears did move to the Beaver Valley Mall at this time where it remained until its closure in 2016. However, the collapse of the steel industry in the 1980s, combined with the Beaver Valley Mall's easy access off of the Beaver Valley Expressway and the rapid development of Center Township, Cranberry Township, and Robinson Township, eventually saw a gradual decline for Northern Lights. In 1998, J. C. Penney moved to the Beaver Valley Mall to become its new fourth anchor store. Around the same time, Hills was acquired by Ames, however Ames itself experienced its own problems related to the Hills acquisition. Ames liquidated and closed all of its stores in 2002 leaving Giant Eagle as the plaza's sole anchor tenant. Gradually, many of the smaller stores left, leaving a few retailers and a small handful of mom-and-pop businesses and doctor offices as of July 2013. In 2006, the roof at the former J. C. Penney location collapsed. This prompted the then-new owners of the plaza, Zamias Services, Inc., to demolish the former J. C. Penney location for safety reasons, leaving a big hole (literally) in the middle of the plaza and removing over of leaseable space. There were talks of moving the remaining tenants into the two smaller portions of the plaza so that the two larger portions‚Äîthe two that were on each side of J. C. Penney (including the former Hills/Ames store) could be considered for redevelopment but this didn't happen.http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2010/03/15/daily46.html?page=all Zamias later admitted that if Northern Lights wasn't included in a package deal with other properties such as Pittsburgh Mills and instead was standalone, it wouldn't have acquired the property. =Efforts at redevelopment= The site of the former Hills/Ames store (left) and the former Sears store (which had been several different retailers after Sears moved out) in 2014. Note the dilapidated state at both the parking lot and the storefronts themselves. The larger structure on the right was the location of the short lived bar and nightclub Callahans's. The Giant Eagle at Northern Lights. Note the parking lot being better maintained in front of the store compared to the empty storefronts. Shortly after the demolition of the former J. C. Penney location, Walmart representatives visited Northern Lights to express interest in opening a location at the plaza. Although Zamias was in favor of Walmart's proposed plaza location, Giant Eagle and its Northern Lights franchisee opted to enforce a provision its lease granting the brand exclusive grocery rights there, in effect preventing Walmart from building on the site. After Zamias was forced to decline Walmart's interest due to Giant Eagle's lease, Walmart's representatives noticed the 230-acre hillside behind the plaza, which had partially been obscured by the whole plaza but was now visible with the former J. C. Penney location having been demolished. Walmart's interest in the hillside subsequently increased after Walmart abandoned its plans to build a location at the site of the former Dixmont State Hospital in nearby Kilbuck Township in 2007. Walmart contacted the owners of the hillside, the estate of Erwin S. Boal, and was able to strike a deal to purchase the property for development. With the help of Economy Borough, in 2007 Zamias willingly gave up a portion of its parking lot and the site of the former J. C. Penney location by eminent domain in order to build a road connecting PA 65 with the hillside and the future Walmart location, despite legal claims made by Giant Eagle. Giant Eagle lost the eminent domain case to Economy in Beaver County Common Pleas Court, a ruling which was later upheld by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in 2009. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania refused to hear the case, clearing the way for the Walmart to eventually be constructed. After receiving the necessary permits from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in late 2012 for the connecting road, Walmart began construction, and opened May 21, 2014. Once Walmart opened, Zamias expected Northern Lights to start filling up with tenants again, since Walmart customers would have to drive through Northern Lights to access Walmart.http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods- west/walmart-store-could-be-built-behind-northern-lights-in-economy-228593/ The opening of Walmart next door to Northern Lights gave Beaver County its third Walmart location, which primarily serves residents of Aliquippa, Ambridge, Baden, Conway, and Economy, while Walmart's existing location in Center Township will serve the main Beaver Valley area (Beaver, Bridgewater, Monaca, New Brighton, and Rochester) and its existing location in Chippewa Township serves rural northern Beaver County as well as Beaver Falls and to a lesser extent East Palestine, Ohio in order for Ohio residents to take advantage of Pennsylvania not charging sales tax on clothing. On June 26, 2017, Zamias announced that the entire portion of Northern Lights south of the road connecting PA 65 with Walmart would be demolished for redevelopment. This included the former Sears and Hills/Ames buildings. Economy borough had recently cited Zamias (who had recently lost Pittsburgh Mills to Wells Fargo in a foreclosure sale) for many safety violations for the unused portions of Northern Lights. Demolition began in January 2020.

On January 17, 1997 as the president of the board, Brown was one of seven members to vote yes to include sexual orientation among the district's anti-discrimination policies alongside race, religion, age, and physical appearance. In 1997, Brown lobbied Michigan Governor John Engler to secure an additional $100 million over 10 years in funding for the district, now known as the Wayne-Westland Equity Language.  Re-election campaign  In May 1997, Brown was seeking reelection to the board of education when she was attacked by several right- wing Christian groups for her sexual orientation and for voting in favor of the policy. A flyer titled \\"Take a Hike Dyke\\" was circulated throughout the community, urging voters to not vote for Brown because of her sexual orientation. Additionally, a religious decree was issued by the self- proclaimed Wayne County \\"Bible Court\\" comparing electing Brown to the position to hiring an \\"alcoholic to drive a school bus or a pedophile to work in a day care center\\". Brown lost the election by 110 votes. Shortly after Brown's term expired, the policy protecting homosexuals from harassment was removed by a 6‚Äì1 vote.  1998 election and lawsuit  Brown ran for a seat on the Wayne-Westland Community Schools board one final time in the 1998 election and failed to garner many votes. At the same time, Brown filed a civil suit against the Bible Court, seeking damages \\"in excess of $25,000\\". The clerk of the Bible Court, Peter James Narsisian, issued an apology and resigned from his position in July 1997. = Public relations = Trish Brown and Congressman John Conyers at the Western-Wayne NAACP Freedom Fund Dinner in 2012.

Wayne County Community College District  Merrill Osmond testifying on behalf of Wayne County Community College District In 1993, Brown began working as a consultant for the Wayne County Community College District through her public relations firm, Communication Concepts. Throughout her contract with Wayne County Community College, Brown led these successful millage campaigns: * A proposal to make the previous 1-mill proposal passed in 1992 permanent (1998). * A proposal to add 1.5 mills for 10 years (2001). * A proposal to extend the 2001 1.5 mill proposal until 2021 at a reduced rate of 1.25 mills (2008). * A proposal to add 1 mill for 10 years to fund general operating purposes (2012). In 1999, she stopped Ford Motor Company, the UAW union, and the State of Michigan from building a technical center within the tax boundaries of the district. In late 2001, legislation was introduced that compromised the newly passed millage and would force the college to close if passed. Brown worked with Merrill Osmond, who testified before the legislature to stop lawmakers and Michigan Governor John Engler from closing the school and explained how the new funding would be beneficial to residents in the community college boundaries in Wayne County. Through millage proposal estimates and saving the 2001 millage from being removed, Brown has raised approximately $2 billion in funding for Wayne County Community College District.

One of the first of the \\"rich kid foundations,\\" Vanguard was a model for a new generation's philanthropy. Vanguard rose as a leader among some two dozen new progressive foundations that comprised a network called the Funding Exchange. History The Vanguard Public Foundation established in 1972 by a group of inheritors of corporate fortunes, including Peter Stern and members of the Pillsbury and du Pont families. who were devoted to supporting a progressive social and political agenda. =Closure= In 2002, Samuel \\"Mouli\\" Cohen was introduced to Vanguard CEO Hari Dillon by actor Danny Glover. Mouli said he would help the foundation by allowing Vanguard and its donors with buying shares in the privately owned Ecast, Inc.. Dillon and Glover formed general partnerships through which they thought they had purchased several million dollars' worth of Ecast. At least three partnerships with Hari Dillon's Dillon Group, and an additional one with Glover, were used as vehicles to funnel investments from Vanguard Public Foundation donors to a deal with Mouli. The Vanguard donors ultimately put in over $20 million more in philanthropic money and personal investment cash. Mouli stated that Ecast was to be acquired by Microsoft, which would then generate a significant return on investment, as high as 1000%. The Microsoft acquisition reportedly got delayed over EU rules, which generated a need for more fees to cover transaction costs. It was further delayed when reports that Ecast was considering a competing bid from Google. Ultimately, there was no Microsoft purchase, no Google bid, and the money was fraudulently taken by Cohen. Further, as reported by American Greed, a show on CNBC, Cohen had already been forced out of Ecast and was no longer affiliated with the company by the time he had become involved with Dillon. Vanguard was forced to close in 2011 as a result of the fraud. Cohen and Dillon were later successfully prosecuted, with Dillon pleading guilty, for their role in the scandal. Grants Vanguard's grant making put money into social movement causes, often before they became politically acceptable and often to organizations and actions that were never going to generate mainstream support. The Vanguard Public Foundation oversees four separate grant-making programs. =Social Justice Fund= Provided support to community-based organizations seeking to bring about progressive social change. The funding priorities focused on issues such as homelessness, civil rights, cultural activism, criminal justice, environmental justice, economic justice, human rights, immigration, and youth advocacy and leadership. =Community Institution Building Program= The Community Institution Building Program supported social justice organizations. =Technical Assistance & Capacity Building Program= Provided grant support, access to professional consultants, and skills workshops for community-based organizations that focused on environmental justice and other health-related problems in the Central Valley of California. =Social Justice Sabbatical Fund= Provided funding to community activists in order to enable them to take a 2-3 month break from their activities. =Grant recipients= Vanguard tended to focus on emerging projects which often went on to become more accepted by the public and therefore more fundable by other foundations. Donors also gave money to specific groups through Vanguard, enabling unincorporated groups to receive donations. Among the groups that received Vanguard grants: =Criticism of grants= Their focus on projects often before they became politically acceptable attracted negative attention from conservative pundits. Glenn Beck referred to Vanguard as \\"Marxist foundations of the 'social justice' movement\\" while Bill O'Reilly referred to the foundation as \\"pinheads\\". Influence on other foundations In 1977, Vanguard published a book designed to serve a guide to other foundations, Robin Hood Was Right: A Guide to Giving Your Money for Social Change.

The episode is written by Dan Nowak and directed by Jonathan Demme. In the episode, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) and Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) seek out Joe Mills (Ryan Robbins) after he attacks Danette Leeds (Amy Seimetz). Their pursuit proves costly to everyone. With Ray Seward's (Peter Sarsgaard) execution scheduled the next day, he desperately accepts Dale Shannon's (Nicholas Lea) suggestion to pray, only to learn his cellblock mate's true nature. Plot Early in the morning, Danette puts missing-person flyers of Kallie on cars around the neighborhood. When she gets home, it is ransacked and Mills emerges from the bedroom. Later, a beaten-up Danette tells Linden and Holder that Mills took off with her money and car. She mentions that he frequently camps near the Canada‚ÄìUS border; his camping gear and maps are kept in her storage unit. At the unit, Linden and Holder find a sleeping bag and lit cigarette. Someone was just there. Hearing the elevator, they split up the pursuit. Mills tackles and assaults Linden as she screams for Holder. He knocks Mills off of her then handcuffs him. As the police investigate the storage unit, Carl Reddick (Gregg Henry) hands Linden a box, which contains the victims' missing rings. As she looks through the box, Linden finds Bullet's necklace. Holder radios an officer near Linden to say they found Mills's cab downstairs with blood on the bumper. Knowing what Holder is about to discover, Linden races downstairs to beg him to not open the trunk. Holder opens it anyway and finds Bullet dead inside. Linden asks to interrogate Mills but Skinner (Elias Koteas) says he'll only talk to Danette. Linden notes that Kallie's blue ring was not among the rings discovered in the storage unit. Outside, as reporters ask the district attorney about Joe Mills, Caroline Swift (Jewel Staite) talks with Holder in his car, telling him not to blame himself for Bullet's death. When she reminds him of the danger the street kids put themselves in every day, he yells at her, telling her that he was an addict. In their motel room, Lyric (Julia Sarah Stone) shows Twitch (Max Fowler) a letter stating he's officially off probation. They can finally move to Los Angeles. She asks why he is upset and he tells her Bullet is dead. He later surprises Lyric by paying the deposit on a government-sponsored apartment she had previously mentioned. She asks about L.A. and he says that all he wants is to be with her. At the station, Linden and a group of officers watch as Danette and Mills talk in the interrogation room. He denies hurting Kallie, but Danette says she knows about the videos. He says he was gentle with the girls on the videos and that he \\"took care of them.\\" She lunges at him, screaming for him to reveal what he's done to her daughter. After a psychologist determines Adrian Seward (Rowan Longworth) is stable enough to be a credible witness, Linden talks with him. She shows him a group of mugshots, asking him to point out the man that killed his mother. He points to the photo of Mills and asks to see his father. Having finally established a connection between Mills and Trisha Seward's case, she starts to call Seward until she sees Danette in the station hallway. Linden is shocked when Danette mentions Mills was in Alaska, not Seattle, the night of Trisha's death. He had dropped off their Christmas presents and then went fishing there. Linden goes to Holder's apartment to find him distraught and drinking. She tells him Adrian falsely identified Mills but contemplates using his testimony to get Seward a stay of execution. Holder warns that she'd be burying evidence. He then says he should've answered Bullet's final phone calls. As Linden comforts him, he leans in to kiss her. She moves away and he apologizes. At the prison, Seward demands another phone call. Becker (Hugh Dillon) refuses. Dale (Nicholas Lea) tells Seward to not give up hope. Outside in the prison yard, he encourages Seward to pray, which the desperate man kneels to do. Dale laughs at him, saying Alton was easy to \\"crack.\\" He expected Seward to have been harder. Seward realizes Dale has been playing a game with his fellow inmates. Inside, Evan Henderson (Aaron Douglas) learns Becker has added him to Seward's execution team. Becker's wife, Annie (Sonya Salomaa) then calls to tell Henderson that Francis shot someone. Becker arrives home to see his son Francis (Colin MacKechnie) being escorted away in handcuffs. A dead body lies on the lawn. Henderson tells Becker his son just murdered a man Annie was seeing. Holder goes to see Bullet's body at the coroner's office. Tim Jablonski (Phil Granger) tells him that Reddick logged numerous calls from Bullet the previous night. Reddick had dismissed them as another wild goose chase. An enraged Holder goes to Reddick's house and assaults him. At the station, Skinner (Elias Koteas) tells Linden they matched all but four of the rings to the victims. He asks about Adrian but Linden says there's no connection between Trisha Seward and Joe Mills. The next morning Linden is in her car, outside the prison. She holds the bag containing the four unidentified rings.

Turkish historian Taner Ak√ßam describes this attitude as an ongoing perception that \\"there are forces which continually seek to disperse and destroy us, and it is necessary to defend the state against this danger.\\" Overview Danish political scientist Dietrich Jung describes the terms as \\"the perception of being encircled by enemies attempting the destruction of the Turkish state,\\" and asserts that it remains a significant determinant of Turkish foreign policy. The term has been used in the scope of the Kurdish conflict in Turkey, accession of Turkey to the European Union in 1987 by Turkish nationalist circles and the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.

He signed a 3 year contract. Immigration to New France Nicolas left France in the spring of 1672 in the direction of the New France to arrive in Quebec City during the summer of the same year. He worked 3 years for the sieur de Bouteillerie for three years, in the seigneury of the Rivi√®re-Ouelle, Quebec. Subsequently, Nicolas joined to the factory Ch√¢teau-Richer, near Quebec City. There, he met his future wife, Marie-Fran√ßoise Plante. Marie-Fran√ßoise was the daughter of the sieur Jean Plante and Marie-Fran√ßoise Boucher.

In the first year of their marriage, Marie-Fran√ßoise gave birth to her first child she named Nicolas, just like her husband. In 1678, Marie-Fran√ßoise gave birth to the second child of the couple that they taken Genevi√®ve. In this same year, Nicolas bought a land on the √Æle d ' Orl√©ans, in the parish of Sainte-Famille. This earth, he bought it from a man named Jean Moreau. Compared to soldiers and labourers who earned that sixty pounds per year of work, Nicolas en earned one hundred fifty pounds, so Nicolas earned more than double the average salary of that time. Note that this land in the cadastre of new-France, in the parish of Sainte-Famille of the St. Lawrence Island, numbered 11. The current cadastre this land lies at number 231-233, either the last dwelling of the parish of Ste-Famille toward the St. Peter parish.

Despite their many family responsibilities, Nicolas and Marie-Fran√ßoise is involved in the community. For example, in this same year of 1698, when the Committee of helping the poor was founded in the √Æle d ' Orl√©ans, it is Nicolas who was appointed Director of the passers-by. It was he who took care of those who sought charity from parishioners. His wife, Marie-Fran√ßoise and three of her companions were charged to collect alms. In 1700, the Lord of the Bouteillerie, where Nicolas was committed to working in 1672, owed him still one hundred ninety pounds salary and Nicolas in was don verbally at his parish of Sainte-Famille. Thus, the Church could be reimbursed this money which was due to Nicolas, by the Sieur de the Bouteillerie. In Exchange, the parish joined to say annually four masses for the repose of the soul of Nicolas, his wife and their children following their dead. It was on 10 October 1705, that Marie-Fran√ßoise and Nicolas attended the first wedding of one of their children, Nicolas II. The latter married Marie-Anne Perreault. Then, it was already established in the seigneury of Mr. Deschambault., since 1702. June 12, 1708, it was the turn of Marie to marry. She married Jean-Baptiste Marcotte, the Church of the Holy Family parish, at the √Æle d ' Orl√©ans. Death Nicolas Paquin died December 16, 1708, at the age of sixty years, probably worn out by work. He had done it its duty of good Christian also working by the sweat of his brow, from dawn until dark, his life during. Following the death of Nicolas, was son-in-law Marcotte, married in the same year with Marie Paquin, who became his mother-in-law support and the support of the Paquin family, still young. At the death of Nicolas, most children were still at home. So, Marie-Fran√ßoise had ended rearing her four minor children, by sharing his home with his daughter Mary and son-in-law Jean-Baptiste Marcotte. Church of D√©chambault On July 23, 1711 was a great day for the Paquin family since that day it y had a double wedding of the two daughters of Marie-Fran√ßoise, or Mary Magdalene and Genevi√®ve. Mary Magdalene was twenty- one years old and she married Jacques Perrault. Genevi√®ve, for its part, was 23 years old and she married Jean-Fran√ßois Naud. The two girls will go to settle at Dennis, Lordship where their husbands already each have a land. Marie-Fran√ßoise had more than two children under his charge, either Marie-Anne and Jean-Baptiste. She could now help Marie, his daughter giving him help with his own daughters. Together Mary and Marie-Fran√ßoise raised three daughters of the union of Mary and Jean-Baptiste Marcotte. In 1720, while she was only sixteen, Marie-Anne married Pierre Groleau, a resident of Deschambault, she had probably met during one of his visits to this Lordship to go see his sisters and his brothers Nicolas, who were already settled there for some time. Jean-Baptiste, the youngest of the family was nineteen years old and worked on the family land. So we can say that Marie had finished to raise all her children, at this time. Marie-Fran√ßoise, widow of Nicolas died on 18 April 1726 and she was buried in the parish of Sainte-Famille on the √Æle d ' Orl√©ans. It had therefore survived him eighteen years. Shortly after the death of his mother, Jean-Baptiste just like his sisters and brother, went to settle in the seigneury of Deschambault. He was married in 1731 with Marguerite Chapelain. Nicolas Paquin and Marie-Fran√ßoise, the strain of this lineage of the Paquins couple, had an eventful life by the various events of everyday life, but otherwise they had a peaceful life.

Collins et al. first described the genus Exiguobacterium with the characterization of E. aurantiacum strain DSM6208T from an alkaline potato processing plant. It has been found in areas covering a wide range of temperatures (-12 ¬∞C‚Äî55 ¬∞C) including glaciers in Greenland and hot springs in Yellowstone, and has been isolated from ancient permafrost in Siberia. This ability to survive in varying temperature extremes makes them an important area of study. Some strains in addition to dynamic thermal adaption are also halotolerant (up to 13% added NaCl added to the medium), can grow within a wide range of pH values (5-11), tolerate high levels of UV radiation, and heavy metal stress (including arsenic). Exiguobacterium are globally diverse organisms that are found in a variety of environments including microbialites (Thrombolite from Pavilion Lake, BC and Stromatolites from Laguna Socompa, Argentina), ocean, freshwater lakes, Himalayan ice, Himalayan soil, hydrothermal vents, brine shrimp and in microbial biofilms Seven genomes from the genus have been completed as either complete (one circular chromosome, with plasmids) or in a draft format (containing multiple unassembled contigs). A new species of Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha has been found to have global distribution in cold lakes from Greenland, Pavilion Lake BC, and Laguna Negra, Argentina. The 'Chiri qhucha' in Quechua means 'cold lake.' The study of Guti√©rrez-Preciado et al. was confirmed by the completion of genomes two strains of Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha RW2 and GIC31. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) of varying temperatures in Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha strain RW2 results in major rearrangements of cellular membrane function which may allow for its temperature, pH and salinity adaptation.

Early life Madison was born October 15, 1977 to Diane Madison and John Baldwin as the result of an accidental pregnancy. However, Baldwin has denied that he was the father and had no contact with Madison. Arrest On July 19, 2013, police, responding to reports of a foul odor, investigated a garage leased to Madison and discovered a decomposing body lying inside. Two more bodies were found the following day - one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The bodies of the three women were found to apart and were each wrapped in plastic bags. After obtaining a search warrant, police entered Madison's apartment and found \\"further evidence of decomposition.\\" After a brief standoff with police at his mother's house, Madison was taken into custody without incident.After 3 bodies found, mayor warns: 'There might be more victims', CNN.com, 21 July 2013East Cleveland sex offender Michael Madison to be charged Monday in deaths of 3 women, police say, Associated Press, 21 July 2013 The victims were identified as: *Shetisha Sheeley, 28, who had been missing since September 2012. *Angela Deskins, 38, a resident of Cleveland who was reported missing in June 2013. *Shirellda Helen Terry, 18, who was last seen July 10, 2013, leaving a Cleveland Elementary School where she had a summer job. On July 22, 2013, Madison was charged with three counts of aggravated murder. His bail was set at six million dollars and he also waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Trial and conviction On October 31, 2013, Madison's attorney David Grant entered a not guilty plea to an updated indictment that included aggravated murder charges; prosecutors had announced that they were now seeking the death penalty, a move his attorney had tried to prevent but had expected. The 14-count updated indictment includes two counts each of aggravated murder for each victim, three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a corpse, one count of rape, and one count of weapons possession by an ex-convict. He had originally been registered as a sex offender in 2002 after serving four years for an attempted rape conviction, having had previous drug convictions in 2000 and 2001. Madison's trial began April 4, 2016. On May 5, 2016, Madison was found guilty in the murders of Shirellda Terry, Shetisha Sheeley and Angela Deskins. The jury spent less than one day deliberating before returning a guilty verdict on all 13 counts. Madison told the court he plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. On May 20, 2016, the jury recommended that Madison should be sentenced to death. On June 2, 2016, Cuyahoga Common Pleas Judge Nancy R. McDonnell sentenced Madison to death. During the sentencing, Madison was seen smirking which caused the father of victim, Van Terry to try to attack Madison in anger over his daughter's murder. The Ohio Supreme Court voted unanimously to uphold the death sentence for Madison on July 21, 2020.  Mother's killing Three years after his conviction, Madison's mother, Diane Madison, was killed at her home on June 22, 2019. She died from multiple stab wounds.

The flag, donated by Napoleon on his arrival on the island, was hoisted on the highest point of Portoferraio on the day of the landing of the emperor on the island. The original flag is kept in the Napoleon residence, Palazzina dei Mulini in Portoferraio. The meaning of the insignia chosen by the Emperor has long been and continues to be, a matter of debate among historians. The red band This is a caricature against Napoleon, who is borne off to Elba in April 1814 by a double-headed eagle representing the Sixth Coalition. There are different theories about the origin of the red stripe on a white background. One of those is that the red and white colors were chosen from the Polish flag in honor of the Major Jan Pawe≈Ç Jerzmanowski who followed Napoleon in his exile on Elba. Many authors agree however that Napoleon was inspired by a picture book on flags. The commander of the British frigate HMS Undaunted, Thomas Ussher, which led Napoleon to Elba from Marseille, tells that Napoleon had with him a book in which were represented all the flags of Tuscany, ancient and modern, and he asked me my opinion on the one he had chosen. The British Commissioner designated to accompany Napoleon on Elba, Neil Campbell, confirms this version writing in his diary: it was as exactly as possible an ancient flag of Tuscany. =The Grand Duchy of Tuscany flag= According to some authors, the red stripe on the white field was inspired by the colors of the flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany which ruled the island with the House of Medici first and the House of Habsburg-Lorraine after. Robert Christophe mentions that The Emperor himself designed the flag. During the five days of the journey, he studied some books about Elba which he brought from Fontainebleau. Inspired by the Medici coat of arms, the ancient rulers of the island, he designed a new flag with a white background and a diagonal strip with three golden bees on top. The symbol of Florence would have been appreciated by the people of Elba and the golden bees, memory of the imperial mantle, were intended as a tribute to the soldiers who, under the command of Cambronne, after crossing France, were going to reach Portoferraio 20 days after. The flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany under the House of Medici had, however, nothing to do with the flag of Elba with the exception of the white background while the flag of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, being red-white- red horizontal stripes, resembles the Elba flag due to the colors. =The Lordship of Piombino flag= Yet according to other authors, the diagonal band was inspired by a flag of House of Appiano that, first with the Lordship of Piombino, then with Principality of Piombino, ruled the city of Piombino and, as a direct dependent, the island of Elba. This flag is white, divided diagonally by a diagonal checkered band in red and white, starting from the top of the mast. As Vincenzo Mellini Pon√ße de L√©on wrote, it reminded the inhabitants of Elba of their first lords, the House of Appiano, which ruled Elba after the collapse of the Republic of Pisa. =Conclusion= Napoleon, most likely, trying to create something new, yet at the same time familiar to the people of Elba, was inspired by the predominant white color present in the House of Medici and the House of Appiano flags, by the red of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine and the House of Appiano flags, and by the diagonal stripe, without diamonds, of the House of Appiano flag. Flag of the Lordship of Piombino, From the magazine Vexilla Italica, issue 54, 2nd semester 2002 House of Appiano Flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, House of Medici, 1562-1737 Flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, House of Habsburg-Lorraine, 1765-1800 and 1814-1859 The golden bees Napoleon's coat of arms with golden bees on the mantel Among the various hypotheses about the meaning of bees, one is that Napoleon wanted to symbolize the unity and hard work of Elba inhabitants. Another one, however, aroused greater foundation, attributes to Napoleon himself the explanation thereof. Speaking with Admiral Thomas Ussher, he said that he chosen the three bees because they represent the people of Elba that has had three rulers and now, with me, they are finally united under a single banner. The golden bees are, however, very often a symbol in the Napoleon iconography. A photograph of a flag made during Napoleon's reign on the island = The bee in the Napoleonic vexillology = The bee was chosen by Napoleon to link the new dynasty to the ancient kingdom of France. Golden bees, being found in 1653 in Tournai in the tomb of Childeric I, father of Clovis I and founder of the Merovingian dynasty in 457, were considered the first emblem of the kings of France. They represented a sign of immortality and resurrection.From the website of the Fondation Napol√©on  The Polish Cavalry (Chevau-l√©ger)  The Polish Cavalry Squadron Guard of Napoleon on Elba Island - Painting by Jan Chelminski It is often believed that the flag of Elba has been borrowed from the Polish Cavalry (Chevau-l√©ger), while the opposite is true. All Polish soldiers, whom arrived on Elba with Napoleon (Grenadiers, Artillerymen, Cavalrymen of Chevau-l√©ger and Lancers), were assembled under the command of Major Jan Pawe≈Ç Jerzmanowski, into a single Cavalry Squadron. The squadron assumed the name of Polish Cavalry (Chevau-l√©gers) - Napoleon Squadron - Guard of Napoleon on Elba Island and was given the flag of Elba. Permanent Delegation of the Republic of Poland to the NATO Authors: Wojciech Markert Military Office of Historical Studies - Polish MoD, Dr. David Stefancic Saint Mary's College They were later assigned to the Grande Arm√©e during the Hundred Days. There is no trace of the existence of the Squadron before 1814, just as there is no record of the use of the Elba flag by other units of the Polish Cavalry. The flag of the Polish cavalry is kept at Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e of Paris and below the flag is the following statement:  Current use  Nowadays, the flag of Elba Island can be found in the armorial bearings of the municipalities of Elba towns of Campo nell'Elba, Marciana Marina and Rio Marina and in the armorial bearing of Province of Livorno which consists, in turn, of the coat of arms of the city of Livorno surmounted by a flag of Elba.

She was New South Wales' first female industrial advocate. She joined the Australian Labor Party as a teenager in 1928, becoming assistant secretary of the party's Stanmore branch in 1929. She worked as a shop assistant at Grace Brothers on Broadway before becoming a journalist with the Labor Daily. She worked for Labor Head Office from 1929 to 1936. Powell was employed by the Australian Railways Union (ARU) from 1937, working as de facto editor of the journal, the Railroad. In 1938, the ARU took the Railways Department to the Conciliation Commissioner, based largely on Powell's findings during research on the Railway Refreshment Rooms offered for female employees. The Commissioner awarded the women a small pay increase but did not address the major issues of the case. During World War II, Powell worked for the Commonwealth Department of Labour and National Service. Women were at that time performing many jobs on the home front, and Powell was instrumental in the creation of the Industrial Welfare Division to oversee that process. She then returned to the ARU, hosting a popular daily radio session on Radio 2KY (1944-52). She was then appointed as Australia's correspondent of the International Labor Organisation Committee of Experts on Women's Work by the Curtin Government, on the recommendation of Albert Monk, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. In 1948, she married Fred Coleman-Browne, a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald. Powell ran unsuccessfully as the Labor candidate for North Sydney at the 1951 federal election. She later gave evidence at the National Wage Case in 1969, which adopted equal pay for equal work, and was awarded the Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. Powell died in 1997.

On 20 May 2003 the forests were recognised as a wetland site of international importance (RS1291) by designation under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Description The 840 km2 site comprises three geographically separate, though interrelated, areas: the Murray Valley National and Regional Parks, the Werai Forests, and the Koondrook‚ÄìPerricoota Forests. They contain a wide variety of wetlands including rivers, lakes, drainage channels, marshes and swamps. The site has a long history of water regulation for agriculture, as well as pastoralism and timber harvesting. =Flora and fauna= 320 native plant species have been recorded in the New South Wales Murray Forests. The site is dominated by river red gum forest, with box woodland and sandhill communities, and is subject to regular flooding. Importantly, there are trees of over 200 years of age present. Moira grass plains dominated by moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens) are found on rises and river banks. Threatened species include the fish Murray cod, trout cod and Murray hardyhead, the birds Australian painted snipe, Australasian bittern and superb parrot, as well as swamp wallaby grass. The forests provide shaded water as shelter and are important spawning grounds for native fish species. Native fish such as the golden perch (Macquaria ambigua), Murray cod and silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) migrate as far as 300 km upstream and 900 km downstream.

Through short sketches, the artist tells of her experiences among First Nations people and cultures on British Columbia's west coast. The book won the 1941 Governor General's Award and occupies an important place in Canadian literature. Background Emily Carr (1871 - 1945) is one of western Canada's most well-known artists. Born in Victoria, British Columbia, she painted themes from nature, as well as imagery from the cultures of west coast First Nations. In her late sixties, Carr turned to writing. After Klee Wyck, she published six additional collections of autobiographical sketches. Carr was an avid traveller, and explored much of the west coast of British Columbia in her lifetime. She related some of her experiences on western Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii, and on the Skeena and Nass Rivers are related in this first book. Other essays relate to her time living in Vancouver, where she worked as a painter and art teacher. In 1937, Carr suffered a heart attack. After this, she turned away from painting and began a prolific period of memoir writing. Much of Klee Wyck was composed as she recovered in bed. The original, unpublished title for the book was Stories in Cedar. Carr instead chose Klee Wyck, a nickname given to her by the First Nations people of Ucluelet. It means \\"Laughing One\\". Carr's painting Kitwancool, (1928) Publication history Originally published by the Oxford University Press' Toronto division in 1941, the book was abridged by 2,300 words for the 1951 Clarke, Irwin & Company edition. Removed were several passages critical of the actions of European missionaries, as well as an account of a mixed race family. This version was the basis for all editions of the book until Douglas & McIntyre's 2004 edition restored the text. The original edition also featured four colour plates of Carr's paintings, including a portrait of Sophie Frank. The original foreword was by Ira Dilworth. A French translation was published in 1973.

Its distribution area includes the Gawler, Barossa, Light, Playford, and Adelaide Plains areas. Along with The Murray Pioneer, The River News, and The Loxton News, The Bunyip was now owned (since 2003) by the Taylor Group of Newspapers and printed in Renmark. On 1 April 2020, however, The Bunyip announced that it would cease publication \\"indefinitely\\" as a result of losses due to the coronavirus crisis. However, due to public support, the newspaper was able to return shortly afterwards. In August 2020, with the closure of The Border Watch (1861-2020), The Bunyip became South Australia's oldest rural newspaper still in print. History Originally a monthly publication, the first issue of The Bunyip, subtitled \\"Gawler Humbug Society's Chronicle\\" was issued on 5 September 1863, consisted of eight pages and was priced at 6d. The name was chosen because \\"the Bunyip is the true type of Australian Humbug!\\" It was warmly greeted by the South Australian Register, observing that it was \\"full of racy articles and local hits ... a very humorous article on the Gawler Agricultural Society's last dinner, which (was) not only very amusing but strictly correct ... (and should) undoubtedly prove a great success.\\" High praise indeed! With the paper's success, publication increased to bi-monthly in February 1865 (there was none printed in January), appearing on the first and third Saturday of each month. With new printing machinery, the paper upsized to broadsheet format, and its title had become The Bunyip or Gawler Chronicle and Northern Advertiser. The following year it became a weekly. By this time however, the paper's original offbeat stance had quite vanished and it had become a regular newspaper. With three newspapers published in Gawler at the time, conditions allowed William Barnet, the proprietor, to purchase rival the Gawler Times (5 March 1869 to 27 June 1873). Another rival, the weekly (later biweekly) Gawler Mercury (27 November 1875 ‚Äì 8 July 1876) also folded after a brief run of less than nine months. In February 1885 The Bunyip's building was destroyed by fire. Barnet again wasted no time in having its competitor of seven years, the Gawler Standard (11 January 1878 - 27 February 1885), take over printing duties, then arranged with Richards, its proprietor, for an immediate merger. In January 1969, the newspaper absorbed the Junction and Gilbert Valley News, which had been published in Hamley Bridge since February 1940. Controversies The Bunyip's first issue elicited a libel case against the publisher, William Barnet, by one Dr. Home Popham who had set up a hospital in the town and who had advertised boastfully in The Northern Star. The court proceedings were a merry affair with Mr. Stow appearing for the defence and the jury found for the plaintiff, awarding damages of one shilling. Four years later, Barnet was sued in the SA. Supreme Court by Henry Edward Bright MP, for libel and found not guilty. This was greeted by both The Register and the Advertiser as a landmark decision. List of owners *William Barnet (1834‚Äì1895) married Hannah Burfield. His daughter Edith Violet Barnet married Frederic C. Custance, son of Professor John D.

His mother, Grace Lerner, was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. At a young age, the family relocated to Chicago, Illinois. As a teenager, he studied in the Telz Yeshiva in Chicago and, later, at the Yeshiva of Rabbi Dovid Soloveitchik in Jerusalem.

The company manufactured the first steam locomotive to be built in Australia. Robertson, Martin and Smith comprised a partnership of William B Robertson, an English born engineer; John Martin; and William Smith. The company was operating from at least mid 1853 with an office at Lambeth-place, Flinders-lane west, Melbourne, when they advertised for labourers., through proclamation in the Government Gazette. In June they tendered for the construction of a steam gondola for the Cremorne Gardens a pleasure ground on the Yarra River in Richmond. When the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company began construction of the first steam-hauled railway line to operate in Australia, they ordered locomotives from the renowned British engineering firm of Robert Stephenson and Company. However, the ship was delayed, and so the railway looked to the firm that had previously constructed a small donkey engine for hauling supplies along the line during construction. The boiler was made by Langlands foundry and Robertson, Martin & Smith assembled it at a rented premises on the Maribyrnong River.Leon Oberg Locomotives of Australia: 1854 to 2007 (Google eBook) Rosenberg Publishing, 2007 p.14Gary B.

Ng of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.President of ISSMGE (retrieved: 9 January 2018) History The ISSMGE originated in the International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, held in June 1936 at Harvard University as one of many events held to mark the university's 300th anniversary. Arthur Casagrande of the Harvard faculty gained university support for an international conference on soil mechanics and successfully persuaded Karl Terzaghi, who was then working in Vienna, to preside. The conference attracted 206 delegates from 20 countries. The success of the five-day conference led participants to decide to establish a quadrennial International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering (ICSMFE) as a permanent institution. An executive committee was set up, with Terzaghi as the first president, Casagrande as its first secretary, and Philip Rutledge, also of Harvard, as treasurer. Due to World War II, the second ICSMFE was not held until June 1948. The 1948 conference, held in Rotterdam, had 596 delegates. After the third ICSMFE was held five years later in Zurich in 1953, the organization settled into a pattern of meeting every four years. In the meantime, a first regional conference was held in Australasia in 1952. Terzaghi was first president of the ICSMFE, serving until 1957 when he was succeeded by Alec Skempton. Casagrande succeeded Skempton, holding the presidency from 1961 to 1965. A steering committee was established in 1981, and it became the Board in 1985. This meets annually; the Council meets every two years. The current name, the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, was adopted in 1997. ISSMGE membership has increased through its history. There were 32 member societies and 2500 individual members by 1957, 50 societies and 11,500 individuals in 1977, and 71 societies and 16,500 individuals in 1998. As of 2012, ISSMGE's reported membership totaled 19,000 individuals in 90 countries. =Secretaries-General= * John K.T.L. Nash (1965‚Äì1981) * John Burland (1981) * Richard H.G.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates. The area was a part of Bezhetsky Uyezd of Tver Viceroyalty, from 1796 of Tver Governorate, and Molokovo was the center of Molokovskaya Volost. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Molokovsky District, with the administrative center in Molokovo, was established within Bezhetsk Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Molokovsky District was transferred to Tver Oblast. In February 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Molokovsky District was merged into Krasnokholmsky District, but on December 30, 1966 it was re-established.

The film stars Aubrey Plaza. The film premiered in competition at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2014, and was given a limited release on August 15, 2014. This was Garry Marshall's final film appearance. Plot After his girlfriend Beth Slocum dies, Zach Orfman is left devastated. He begins to spend time with Beth's parents Maury and Geenie as a source of comfort. Zach confesses to Maury that he and Beth were having problems in their relationship; Maury advises him not to let the end of the relationship define it. The Slocums stop contacting Zach. Confused, he goes to their house and sees Beth through a window. Zach yells at the Slocums to let him in but his brother Kyle, a security officer, escorts him off the premises. At home, Zach's manic demeanor and strange comments that Beth is alive causes his parents, Judy and Noah, to worry. That night, Zach breaks in and discovers that Beth's parents have been hiding her. A heated argument ensues before Zach storms off. Later, he goes to Beth's grave and sees a large hole in its place. He confronts Geenie and Maury with this and they explain that, after the funeral, Beth suddenly reappeared, seemingly alive and well. Beth's parents are reluctant to let her leave the house, especially during daytime, and refuse to tell her that she died. When Zach takes Beth on a daytime date in the park, she gets blisters on her face, apparently from the sun. Maury bans Zach from the Slocum house and seeing Beth, but Zach continues to sneak in. Zach starts to notice people around town acting similarly to Beth, who has grown increasingly violent and has mood swings; he also discovers smooth jazz can calm her down. He also notes that Beth and people like her are stronger now than when they were living humans. Needing a break from Beth, Zach goes to a diner. There, he sees an old childhood friend, Erica Wexler. She sits with him and she gives her condolences to him over Beth. After they finish their meal, Zach accidentally runs Beth over with his car. She is okay, but when people try and help her, she screams at them and scares them off. She even frightens Erica after thinking Zach has replaced her. Zach brings Beth to her grave and informs her of her death and resurrection, then tries to break up with her, only for her to angrily run off with his car. Zach walks home and discovers his family members shocked by the sudden reappearance of his dead grandfather. Maury picks up Zach and tells him that Beth is extremely upset, insisting that Zach tell her that he lied about her death and promise to be with her forever; Zach reluctantly agrees. Zach's attempts to talk to Beth fail. When she eats a bystander, he drives away, with her in the car. Maury catches them, knocks Zach unconscious, and takes Beth. Once he has recovered, Zach heads home, and finds a stranger inside the house and burnt bodies in the backyard. Believing his family dead, Zach packs his bags, and prepares to leave the state. However, he changes his mind and drives back to the Slocum house. He finds the house is in disarray, with Geenie and Beth in the kitchen. Tied to a stove, Beth has become a full-fledged, bloodthirsty zombie, having eaten Maury and bitten off Geenie's hand. Zach convinces Geenie to leave, then calms Beth by promising to hike with her like she always asked him to. They run into Kyle, who is hunting zombies. He reveals that their parents are still alive, having escaped to a safehouse. Kyle gives Zach his handgun, reminding him that Beth is suffering. On their hike, Zach and Beth stop by a cliff. He tearfully apologizes to her for never doing the things she wanted when she was still alive. They say \\"I love you\\" to each other, and Zach shoots her in the head. Zach is reunited with his family at the safehouse, along with a traumatized Erica, who was forced to kill her own grandmother. The survivors make plans to leave town but, suddenly, the power returns and a TV news story shows things going back to normal. Some time later, Zach visits the graves of Beth and Maury, leaving Beth's scarf on her tombstone, and a knight chess piece on Maury's. Zach's mom picks him up in her car, with Erica in the backseat. Zach invites Erica for dinner and she accepts, smiling as they drive off. Cast * Dane DeHaan as Zach Orfman * Aubrey Plaza as Beth Slocum * John C.

It was initially designed by Charles Tiffin with later additions and alterations by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and POE Hawkes. The initial construction was from 1869 to 1872 by G Smith and J Thomas. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Mary's Roman Catholic Church was constructed in several stages and incorporates the first permanent Roman Catholic church in Maryborough started in 1869 to a design of Charles Tiffin. The building was enlarged in two major stages of construction, the first in 1884-5 to the design of FDG Stanley and then in 1936 to the design of local architect, POE Hawkes. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. As part of the survey two acres of land, through which a creek ran, in Section 85 was set aside for the Roman Catholic Church. To service the early Roman Catholic community in Maryborough, Father James Hanley from Brisbane, visited Maryborough and held baptismal services. The first service was held in August 1852 in the house of the local chief constable. Towards the end of the 1850s the town of Maryborough developed with the erection of several public buildings including churches, and in 1856 a decision was made by the Roman Catholic community to erect a timber building to house 300 people. The tender of Linklater and Thompson was accepted and the church was ready for use in 1858, though not on the reserved site which was subject to flooding. A new site had been donated to the church by James Cleary and this has remained the principal Roman Catholic church site in Maryborough. The timber building was erected principally as a school house, but used as a service centre when Hanley's replacement, Dean Rigby visited Maryborough. After the separation of the State of Queensland in 1859, the Roman Catholic Church formed the Brisbane Diocese encompassing the entire state. Bishop James Quinn was appointed and he arrived in his diocese in 1861 and immediately made plans to visit the populated areas, including Maryborough. He arrived in the town on 25 July 1861 with two fellow priests, one of whom, Father Tissot, remained in Maryborough as the first parish priest. By 1867 Father Tissot and his congregation considered the timber building inadequate as their church and steps were made to construct a new permanent church. It was in this year that gold was found in Gympie and the development of Maryborough, as the port of the gold fields, was rapid. The services of Brisbane architect, Charles Tiffin were procured to design the new brick church and the foundation stone was laid on 29 July 1869. Tiffin was a well known public architect who was appointed to the position of Clerk of Works of Moreton Bay in 1857 and in 1859 he became the first Queensland Colonial Architect and was responsible for the design of many well known Brisbane landmarks, including Old Government House, Parliament House and the (now demolished) Public Lands Office. He also designed several buildings in Maryborough including the Government Bond Store in Wharf Street and the Post Office. St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, as it became known, was completed and opened at a service conducted by Father Tissot on 4 February 1872. The building was constructed by local contractors G Smith and J Thomas under the supervision of WN Davidson. When completed, the church was described as Early English and of brick with stone quoining and detailing. The building had a steeply pitched gabled roof clad with shingles. Side aisles extended the length of the four-bay nave and these were lined with double lancets. The plan incorporated a small porch, chancel and two sacristies. Father Tissot landscaped the grounds surrounding the church and provided the a chancel screen and other timber panelling carved by himself. He is thought to have been involved with the design of the high altar and the carved timber canopy, or baldacchino above the altar. Provision was made in the design for extension of the church at a later date. On 21 November 1882, at a meeting presided over by the new Bishop, Robert Dunne, a decision was made to extend St Mary's. The services of Colonial Architect, FDG Stanley were sought and plans for alterations were prepared and the church was re-opened in May 1884. The contractor for the work was Fritz Kinne at a cost of ¬£1871. The additions included the extension of the nave by three bays and the erection of a large chancel. The roof was reclad with slate and several ventilation gablets were added near the ridge. Internally the church was painted by Messrs O'Malley and Mill. A new set of Stations of the Cross from Lyons, described as oleographs or coloured lithographs printed with oil paints, were framed in gold. During the nineteenth century the Roman Catholic Church in Maryborough continued to grow with several outbranches of the parish established in surrounding areas. A large presbytery, convent and school were constructed. In 1912 a new organ and blower, costing ¬£900, were installed in the gallery of St Mary's. Substantial alterations were made at St Mary's in 1936 to the design of innovative local architect, P.O.E. Hawkes and carried out by contractor, Herbert Neilson for ¬£7000. Again, the length of the building was extended, north and south chancels were added, as were sacristies, confessionals and a baptistry. The organ was moved from the gallery and placed in the Sacred Heart transept. Externally, the building was rendered and an entrance was formed from Adelaide Street, where previously access was provided only from Bazaar Street. A marble high altar was made by local craftsman, Mr Prout. A cock was added to the western gable of the church reflecting the French ties of Monsignor MacCarthy, the then parish priest. Cocks were traditionally added to the roofs of French churches to symbolise resentment over Italian dominance of the papacy. Minor alterations have been made to the church since 1936, including the recladding of the roof with tiles and rib and pan roofing in two stages in 1959 and 1967. A section of the timber floor of the body of the church was replaced with concrete in 1979, followed by work in 1980 to stabilise foundations in the north western corner. A porch was constructed on the northern transept in 1987 and the timber canopy over the high altar was removed in 1989.  Description  St Mary's Church is centrally located in metropolitan Maryborough. The complex comprises the stuccoed masonry church, stone and concrete grotto, and two modern steel and canvas shelters. The nave of St Mary's runs north west/south east on the block between Adelaide and Bazaar Streets with pedestrian access provided from both of these streets. The principal entrance to the complex is via Adelaide Street, at which end is the entrance of the church, with the chancel end of the building, and transepts at the Bazaar Street end. The building has a steeply pitched gabled roof, and with gothic accoutrements and essentially cruciform plan formed by the long nave and intersecting transepts, the building conforms with many of the ideals of gothic ecclesiastical architecture. The principal facade of the building comprises the centrally located gable end of the building, abutted to the north east by a smaller gabled section surmounted by a small plaster statue of a rooster. On the face of the main gabled bay is a centrally located entrance formed by a gabled porch, surmounted by a statue of Our Lady and flanked by plaster moulded pinnacles. Above this is a large traceried stained glass window of five lancets with foils above. The roof is concealed by a moulded string coursed parapet which encircles the building. Surmounting this parapet on the central gable of the front of the building is a Latin Cross. St Mary's Church has a seven bay nave, defined by internal columns supporting a nave arcade of pointed arched openings above which are small quatrefoil opening within triangular recesses forming the clerestory of the building. Around the altar the order of architecture changes to classical and, as a continuation of the nave arcade, Corinthian columns support an entablature to create the chancel space. On the entablature are painted, in relief lettering, several religions phrases in Latin, and this writing continues around the cornice line of the transepts at this end of the building. In one of the transepts is a large organ.  Heritage listing  St Marys Roman Catholic Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Mary's Church the principal Roman Catholic Church in Maryborough illustrates the growth of the town from a small port to a large regional city. The church demonstrates the development of the catholic church in regional Queensland, from the establishment of centres in major regional towns in the mid nineteenth century to upgrading facilities during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a characteristic example of a large regional Roman Catholic Church, with substantial sections dating from the nineteenth century and sympathetic early twentieth century additions. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. St Mary's has aesthetic and architectural merit as the work of a group of talented architects, forming a well composed building on a prominent Maryborough site. The building features fine craftsmanship, particularly the marble high altar, stained glass windows, Stations of the Cross and joinery. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has important spiritual associations with the Roman Catholic community in Maryborough as their place of public worship for 125 years and has association with many of the parish priests who were responsible for adding to or altering the building. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building has associations with architects, Charles Tiffin and FDG Stanley and with POE Hawkes, an innovative Maryborough architect.

When in the 1950s, in nearby Italy the San Remo Festival, and later in Switzerland, the Eurovision Song Contest came into existence, Malta soon followed suit by organizing its own National Song Festival.  Origins and other festivals in Malta  The first Malta Song Festival was organized by the Maltese section of the Young Christian Workers movement in 1960. Out of 72 submissions, 20 were chosen for the two semi-finals. Eventually 10 made it for the final of Saturday 5 November 1960. All shows were held at the Radio City Opera House in Hamrun and were transmitted on the island's cable radio system, now extinct, and then better known as Rediffusion. Eight of the ten songs were sung in Italian, one in English and one in Maltese. Each song had to be presented with two different musical arrangements. It was also a requisite to have two different singers for each song.The GO Eurosong 2010, PBS TVM Souvenir Brochure, \\"The First Malta Song Festival 1960\\" by Tony Micallef On 14 November 1960 RAI TV transmitted a video coverage of the festival in its evenings news bulletin.Noel D'Anastas, Il-Festa 2013, Ghaqda Tal-Muzika San Gejtanu, Hamrun, P.89 As far back as 1960 the organizers of the festival were already planning to send the winner to the \\"Eurovision Song Contest\\".

Noel D'Anastas, Il-Festa 2013, Ghaqda Tal-Muzika San Gejtanu, Hamrun, P.89 In December 1961 the same Young Christian Workers movement organized also the first \\"Festival Ta' Kanzunetti Maltin\\" (Festival of Maltese Songs)\\". The songs in this festival were all sung in the Maltese language. Although it was organized again in 1962, but after the 1962 edition, a decision was taken that the \\"Festival Ta' Kanzunetti Maltin\\" (Festival of Maltese Songs)\\" would no longer be held.Noel D'Anastas, Il-Festa 2013, Ghaqda Tal-Muzika San Gejtanu, Hamrun, P.90 In 1963 a decision was taken by the Malta Song Festival Board, that it was no longer feasible to organize two separate festivals. Instead it was decided that every song should be presented on stage in two languages, one of which should in Maltese.History of the Malta Song Festival. ZHN Malta Song Festival 1966, Souvenir Booklet In 1964, the Malta Song Festival was transmitted for the first time on the Malta Television Service on 16, 17 and 21 November.

Joe Grima and Victor Aquilina, then Head of Programmes and Assistant Head of Programmes respectively of Rediffusion Malta, were the producers of this first 33 RPM of Maltese songs. In 1967 and 1968 Rediffusion Malta fully financed the festival.Gaetano Abela, Joe Grima, Message From The Organisers, Malta Song Festival 1968, Souvenir Booklet. During the same period the late lyricist and composer from Rabat, Malta, John B. Cassar, who was a pharmacist and a teacher by profession, had set up an enterprise called \\"Tourist Revues International Malta\\". They were the organizers of \\"The Malta International Song Festival\\"The Times of Malta, 24 June 1969, by Fred Barry, Page 11 which had nothing to do with the \\"Malta Song Festival\\". They also used to organize \\"Festival Della Canzone Italiana A' Malta\\". The 1966 edition of this festival was held at the Alhambra Theatre in Sliema and was even recorded and transmitted by RAI TV.The Times of Malta, 2 May 1966, 12. In the second edition of the \\"Malta International Song Festival\\" held at the Hilton Hotel in St' Julians on the 25 July 1969, David Bowie was one of the participants.http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/tours/tour58.htm.

The then Malta Government Tourist Board gave its assistance to the organizers of this festival which was also held in 1975 and 1976.Il- Mument, 24 November 2013, page 26, by Noel D'Anastas. In 1973, the Youth Travel Circle, a youth organization led by Rev. Fr. Maurice Mifsud., organized the first edition of another festival L-Gƒßanja tal-Poplu (People's Ode Song Contest). The songs of this very popular song festival are all sung in the Maltese Language. Against all odds, L-Gƒßanja tal-Poplu (People's Ode Song Contest) has not only managed to survive, but it has even donned a National perspective. Since the nineties, this festival has been regularly transmitted on local television stations. In 1986, the \\"Konkors Kanzunetta Festa San Pawl\\" was the first song festival ever to be held in a church in Malta. The songs all had a religious theme. The festival was held at the Church of St. Paul in Valletta.On-Line: Accessed 24Aug2014 Worthwhile pointing out is the fact that the original organizers of the first editions of the Malta Song Festival, namely the Maltese section of the Young Christian Workers are still very much active in the Malta music scene. In fact, on the 9 and 10 October 2015 they organized the 14th. edition of \\"Strummin', an annual non-competitive music show incorporating a choir a some 63 guitarists, a band and a group of singers.Strummin' What a Feelin', Show Programme, 9 & 10 October 2015, Sir Temi Zammit Hall, University of Malta.  Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest  In 1970 the Malta Broadcasting Authority decided that, as from 1971, Malta would participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. So the Malta Broadcasting Authority and the Malta Song Festival Board joined forces. On Saturday 28 November 1970, 12 compositions competed in the semi-final to a packed audience in the Grandmaster's Ballroom of the Malta Hilton. Six finalists were chosen with the finals held on 29 January 1971, at the Main Studio of Malta Television Services, now TVM.Times of Malta 2 December 1970, 15. In fact in 1971 Joe Grech, by now a four-time winner of this festival, managed to be the first Maltese singer to represent Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest. Although in 1972 and 1975 Malta participated again in the Eurovision Song Contest, for some very obscure reason in 1973 and 1974 Malta did not participate. In 1976 the government decided against Malta's participation in the Eurovision. It was only in 1991 that the regular participation of \\"Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest\\" was resumed. 1980s and 1990s In 1981 the organization of the \\"Malta Song Festival\\", now known as \\"Festival Internazzjonali Tal-Kanzunetta Maltija\\", was taken over by the Ministry of Education and Culture. In the eighties all songs were being sung in the Maltese language and later, a version of the Maltese song was also sung in a foreign language by a foreign artist. In 1982 the festival was held at Mediterranean Conference Centre between 25 and 28 March 1982. The festival was divided in three categories. Several international singers were invited to take part by singing the festival songs in the language of the foreign participants. Riccardo Fogli and The Tweets, so very well known for their Birdie Song, were the special guests of the 1982 edition. In 1991, 1992 and 1993 the \\" Festival Tal-Kanzunetta Maltija\\" became the venue from which the English version of the winning song would represent Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1994 two versions of the festival were held simultaneously, one section for songs in Maltese, and another section for songs sung in English, with the winning song of the latter section representing Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest. As from 1995 two distinct festivals were organised, one for songs in Maltese and another for songs to represent Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest Up to 2002, the \\"Festival Internazzjonali Tal- Kanzunetta Maltija\\", continued to be organized by the Maltese Government, in tandem with another festival whose winner would represent Malta in the Eurovision Song Contest. But, after 2002, the \\"Festival Internazzjonali Tal- Kanzunetta Maltija\\" came to a halt. On the other hand, the \\" Malta Song For Europe Festival\\" continued to be organised year after year. In 2008 the event was renamed Malta EuroSong, but this name was only used for the 2009 and 2010 editions. The event is now known as the Malta Eurovision Song Contest. Return in 2013 On 24 July 2013 a meeting was held at the Manoel Theatre in Malta where Josette Grech Hamilton, Chairperson of the newly formed Organizing Committee, announced the return, after an absence of 11 years, of the \\"Festival Internazzjonali Tal-Kanzunetta Maltija\\".

Christian finance is characterized by the existence of three dimensions: personal (actors), operational (operations), and dogmatic (principles).  General description  = Actors = Although not widely used,N. Ferrier/V. Maymo, Peut-on parler d‚Äôune finance catholique ?, Revue Banque n¬∞750, juin 2012 the notion of \\"Christian finance\\" refers to banking and financial activities which came into existence several centuries ago. Whether the activities of the Knights Templar (12th century), Mounts of Piety (appeared in 1462) or the Apostolic Chamber attached directly to the Vatican, a number of operations of a banking nature (money loan, guarantee, etc..) or a financial nature (issuance of securities, investments) is proved, despite the prohibition of usury and the Church distrust against exchange activities (opposed to production activities).J. Le Goff, Marchands et banquiers au Moyen √Çge, Puf Quadrige, 2011, p. 75 In modern times, if the Catholic clerical finance continues to be on center stage through the Vatican Bank (IOR), many Catholic lay financial players also exist, both in Germany (e.g. Pax-Bank, Liga Bank, Darlehenskasse DKM) or the United States of America (e.g. Catholic Family Federal Credit Union, Holy Rosary Credit Union). Many other reformed Christian actors exist (e.g. Christian Community Credit Union,https://www.mycccu.com Kingdom Bank). In France, if the General Union presented ostensibly as a Catholic credit institution, today, social finance (non-religious ethical finance) seems to have completely replaced Christian finance (e.g. Credit coop√©ratif, Caisses de cr√©dit municipal). However, with regard to ethical principles implemented and their historically Catholic origin, many actors of the solidarity finance can be attached to the category of Christian finance (\\"Catho-compatible players\\"A.R. Cuny de la Verry√®re, Finance catholique, edit. EMS, 2013, p. 39 et s.). = Financial products = If certain financial transactions were explicitly condemned because they circumvented the prohibition of usury (e.g. Mohatra contract), the operations of contemporary Catholic bank is characterized by their search for solidarity and the distribution of benefits in favor of the poor.A.R. Cuny de la Verry√®re, Finance catholique, edit. EMS, 2013, p. 135 et s. For example, Liga Bank offers credit cards whose commissions are donated to charities supporting children. = Principles = As with Islamic finance, Catholic finance claims to supervise banking operations and financial activities with moral principles directly from the interpretation of Christian religious texts (Bible) and from the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church (Treaty of virtues and vices, Catholic social teaching). Also, since the subprime financial crisis, it was found that the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace took more often positions on financial matters. In October 2011, was published a note \\"Reform of the international financial system with a view toward a general public Authority\\". In his book \\"Catholic Finance\\" (in French: ‚ÄúFinance catholique‚Äù), Dr. Antoine Cuny de la Verry√®re presents seven principles for a Catholic finance (named \\"princificats\\"). Some of them are inspired from the principles of Islamic finance: prohibition of short-termism, prohibition of non-virtuous investment, obligation to give priority to virtuous savings, prohibition of unjust profits, obligation to share profits, obligation of transparency, and obligation of financial exemplary.A.R. Cuny de la Verry√®re, Finance catholique, edit. EMS, 2013, p. 122 et s.  Worldwide development  = Europe = The Christian Finance Observatory (\\"OFCCFO\\"), a non-profit international organization, gathering professionals of Christian ethical finance, announced in 2015 the publication of a \\"Fundamental Charter of Christian Ethical Finance\\". First codification of the genre, the Charter considers the various schools of Christian thoughts (Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox) on financial matters and is available in many languages.http://www.christianfinanceobservatory.org/en/the-charta Beyond general principles, the Charter set out a practical codification of financial practices, and makes sorting between practices considered as virtuous and those considered as non-virtuous.

In the late 1980s Gomiashvili quit the stage to become a businessman, the Ostap Bender Club owner, and philanthropist. Biography Archil Gomiashvili was born on March 23, 1926, in Chiatura, Soviet Georgia. His father, an Institute of Red Professors graduate, was the Donbass miners' trade-union leader, when in the years of the Great Purge he was arrested, to be freed only in 1944. Having spent two years in the Tbilisi Academy of Arts' school, Archil Gomiashvili joined the Moscow Art Theatre's college-studio but had to leave Moscow in 1948 after some incident involving fistfight. In 1958 he moved to Poti to join the Eristavi Theatre's troupe, then returned to Tbilisi as a member of the Russian Griboyedov Theatre. Gomiashvili debuted on the big screen in 1957, playing Mantasherov in Personally Known, the first film of the Kamo trilogy. In 1961 he appeared in Cossacks after Leo Tolstoy's novelet. 1965 saw him cast in the Special Task, the second installment of the Kamo trilogy, as Mantasherov again, and Mikhail Chiaureli-directed musical comedy These Are New Times. Gomiashvili's involvement with Ilf and Petrov's satire started in 1958 when, assisted by Yuri Lyubimov, he produced the musical called The Adventures of Ostap Bender (based on The Little Golden Calf novel) where he played all the roles, including that of Zosya Sinitsina. In 1971 Leonid Gaidai, looking for the lead for his adaptation of The Twelve Chairs, rehearsed 22 well-known actors (including Vladimir Vysotsky, Andrey Mironov, and Yevgeny Yevstigneev) to no avail. Then he found Gomiashvili who performed The Adventures of Ostap Bender in Gorky and signed the man. The actor's relationships with the director were strained throughout. According to Gomiashvili, Gaidai was trying to dumb down the Bender character whom the actor saw as being much more than just a brilliant crook. \\"The director wouldn't let me show the warmer side to my hero. As I saw the film I didn't like it at all,\\" Gomiashvili said later. Yet, it was Gaidai's Twelve Chairs that made Gomiashvili the Soviet movie star. He made it to the Top 10 most popular Soviet actors of 1971, was invited to the Soviet Council of Ministers's party and received by way of appreciation a luxurious flat (formerly that of Svetlana Alliluyeva) in the legendary House on the Embankment. In 1973 Gomiashvily joined the troupe of the Moscow Lenkom Theatre. In 1980-1988 he worked at the Moscow Pushkin Theatre. His 1971 triumph on the big screen, though, has never been repeated. At the age of 62 Archil Gomiashvili quit the stage to become a successful businessman, the prestigious Ostap Bender Club owner, and philanthropist. He continued to appear in films occasionally and in 1985-1994 played Yosif Stalin five times. In the early 2000s he said in an interview: > Thirty years are the whole life and I‚Äôve lived this life as/with Ostap. He > made me famous, got me a Moscow flat and this restaurant named in his > honour... And you know, I think we have a lot in common. We both are actors > in need of an audience. Without an audience I need neither chairs nor the > money. In 2004 Archil Gomiashvili was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on June 3, 2005, in Moscow and was interred in Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.

It is characterized by a compact and modular design, which encompasses several different functions in one module. Concept High- voltage switchgears have been traditionally distinguished according to the medium used to extinguish the arc. In the case of the hybrid switchgear modules, this device developed during last 90‚Äôs uses two different types of technologies: one to extinguish the arc and the other to connect to the other equipment of the high voltage substation, for pursuing the goal of maximizing the advantages of the already existing technologies. The hybrid module typically utilizes gas-insulated switchgear components and conventional air- insulated bushings for connecting to the busbar.http://www.abb.it/cawp/seitp202/7e75ffdb74406fb8c1257111003ca46c.aspx Components The term module refers to the fact that the equipment itself is a combination of different standard substation components in a single assembly. The integration allows to reduce the overall substation footprint from 50% to more than 70% when compared to substation realized using conventional air insulated equipment. An hybrid module can incorporate: * One (or more) circuit breaker * One (or more) disconnector and earthing switch * Gas-insulated voltage transformers * Cast-resin current transformers * Air- or gas-insulated surge arresters The high voltage live parts (circuit breaker, disconnector and earthing switch) are encapsulated in a grounded aluminum tank, filled with pressurized sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas, which means that the disconnector contacts will likely not require any maintenance during the product life, thus increasing the availability of the substation and the safety of the operators. Substation applications This modular approach to the construction of the substations is based on flexibility and customizability. The hybrid module can be used for extension or substitution in any traditional substation which uses an air- insulated busbar. This allows to configure the module with the components that are required by substation‚Äôs architecture and scope of supply. Vice versa, it is also possible to install traditional air-insulated equipment in a hybrid substation.

The American Bottom stretches from St. Louis south along the east side of the Mississippi River all the way to the mouth of the Kaskaskia River, just north of Fort Kaskaskia, Illinois. At Morrow Island the American Bottom is broken by the Mississippi River, and on the west side of the Mississippi River the alluvial plain continues as the \\"Le Grande Champ\\" or Big Field Bottom, which includes Kaskaskia Island. South of Kaskaskia Island the alluvial flood plain continues on as the Bois Brule Bottom. The Bois Brule Bottom is bounded on the north by an old channel of the Mississippi River which flows around Kaskaskia Island, and is bounded on the south by Cinque Hommes Creek (also known as St. Cosme creek), with the Mississippi River lying to the east. The Brazeau Bottom continues further south along west side of the Mississippi River.  Etymology  Bois Br√ªl√©, French for \\"Burnt Wood\\" was given to the flood plain by early French settlers. The name was applied by the French to describe a burnt tract of forest.State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html  History  = Indigenous people = The first Native American groups known to have inhabited the area were the Mound Builders. The Mound Builders constructed large earthen mounds in the area, particularly along the Mississippi River. By the 12th and 13th centuries, the Mississippian Culture was in decline and eventually disappeared. Later Native American groups in the Bois Brule Bottom area were the Kaskaskia Indians who originated from the area of present-day Peoria, Illinois, but had migrated south to the area of Kaskaskia, Illinois. In the late 1770s and 1780s, remnants of the Illinois Nation, the Peoria tribe, left the east bank of the Mississippi River to escape British and American oppression, with some settling in New Ste. Genevieve and about 100 settling in the Bois Brule Bottom. = French settlement = The first Europeans to colonize the Middle Mississippi River region were the French. Both the present-day Illinois and Missouri shores along the Mississippi River were referred to as the Illinois Country and was governed as a district of New France. A number of M√©tis and French colonial communities had been established just to the north of Bois Brule Bottom: Kaskaskia, Ste. Genevieve, Chartres, Prairie du Rocher, Nouvelle Bourbon, and St. Phillipe. In 1763, the Spanish gained control of the Upper Louisiana and ruled the area as a part of New Spain. Among the first settlers in Bois Brule was Jean Baptiste Barsaloux, a traveling merchant, who lived in the Bois Brule Bottom in 1787, and applied to the Spanish Colonial officials for a concession for himself and his father Girard Barsaloux. = American settlement = In the late 1700s and early 1800s the Spanish authorities granted American Catholics from Kentucky, also known as Maryland Catholics, to settle in the Bois Brule Bottom. These Maryland Catholics included Levy Wiggins, William Boyce, and Isadore Moore. The American Catholics chose to live separately from the French and Creoles in the district, and many had left the bottoms by 1820. A number of other Americans also settled in Bois Brule Bottom. The Fenwick Settlement was founded in the late 1790s by Maryland Catholics who had previously settled in Kentucky. These included the Fenwick brothers: Walter, Ezekial, Thomas and James. Another group of settlers were Irish Catholics who settled in the late 1790s along Bois Brule Creek. Despite the fertile soil, early settlers faced a number of problems. The land was level with thick gluey soil, which led to bayous, mosquitos, chills, malaria, typhoid and brain fever, to name a few of the maladies. In 1804 ownership of the territory of Upper Louisiana was transferred to the United States, and by the 1820s American settlers began pouring into the region. After Missouri statehood in 1821, Bois Brule Bottom, originally part of the Ste. Genevieve District, was reorganized as a township in Perry County, Missouri.A history of Missouri from the earliest explorations and settlements until the admission of the state into the union (Volume 1) http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/louis-houck/a-history-of-missouri-from- the-earliest-explorations-and-settlements-until-the-a-cuo/page-44-a-history- of-missouri-from-the-earliest-explorations-and-settlements-until-the-a- cuo.shtml  Floods  Flooding has been a constant concern of residents of Bois Brule Bottom since settlement began.

The first system, Hurricane One, was first observed in the Gulf of Mexico on August 9\\\\. The final storm, Hurricane Six, was last observed on September 22\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. One of the cyclones has only a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data. Operationally, another tropical cyclone was believed to have existed in the Wilmington, North Carolina area in September, but HURDAT - the official Atlantic hurricane database - excludes this system. Another tropical cyclone that existed over the Northeastern United States in mid-August was later added to HURDAT. Four tropical cyclones reached hurricane status, including two which became major hurricanes, Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to four cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. The strongest cyclone of the season, the first hurricane, peaked at Category 4 strength with 150 mph (240 km/h) winds. Known as the 1856 Last Island hurricane, it brought devastation to southern Louisiana. More than 200 people were killed after a storm surge submerged Last Island, making it one of the deadliest hurricanes in Louisiana history. Hurricane Two brought heavy rains and squalls to Barbados and Grenada, causing \\"considerable\\" damage. Tropical Storms Three and Four had a minor impact on the Northeastern United States and Cuba, respectively. Additionally, Hurricane Five caused four deaths in Inagua, Bahamas and had a minor impact on Cuba and the United States. The season's activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 49. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/08/1856 till:01/10/1856 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/08/1856 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_(TD)_=_<39_mph_(0‚Äì62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(119‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì130_mph_(178‚Äì209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131‚Äì155_mph_(210‚Äì249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:09/08/1856 till:12/08/1856 color:C4 text:\\"One (C4)\\" from:13/08/1856 till:14/08/1856 color:C1 text:\\"Two (C1)\\" from:19/08/1856 till:21/08/1856 color:TS text:\\"Three (TS)\\" from:21/08/1856 till:21/08/1856 color:TS text:\\"Four (TS)\\" from:25/08/1856 till:03/09/1856 color:C3 text:\\"Five (C3)\\" from:18/09/1856 till:22/09/1856 color:C1 text:\\"Six (C1)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/08/1856 till:01/09/1856 text:August from:01/09/1856 till:01/10/1856 text:September TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems =Hurricane One= The Last Island Hurricane of 1856 On August 9, a minimal hurricane was observed near the Dry Tortugas. The storm moved northwestward and strengthened, becoming a Category 2 hurricane about 12 hours later. The hurricane reached Category 3 strengthened late on August 9\\\\. It continued to deepen and became a Category 4 hurricane on the following day. At 1800 UTC on August 10, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Simultaneously, the storm made landfall in Last Island, Louisiana. It rapidly weakened inland and fell to tropical storm intensity on August 11\\\\. The system then drifted northeastward, until dissipating over Mississippi early on August 12\\\\. Offshore, at least 183 people drowned after steamers and schooners sunk in rough seas produced by the hurricane. A storm surge between lashed Last Island, Louisiana. The island was completely submerged, with virtually every structure destroyed, including the hotels and casinos, while all crops were ruined. Additionally, Last Island itself split in two. Inland, heavy rainfall caused the Mermentau River, destroying crops and every house in Abbeville. The storm produced up to of precipitation to New Orleans. In Plaquemines Parish, rice fields were under several feet of water, while many orange trees lost their fruit. The storm resulted in at least 200 fatalities, making it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in the history of Louisiana.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 165-171 =Hurricane Two= A hurricane with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) was initially observed about 750 miles (1,000 km) northwest of the coast of Venezuela on August 13\\\\. The cyclone tracked due westward and crossed Grenada, before entering the eastern Caribbean. Heavy rain and squalls were reported in Barbados and Grenada. This system was last noted near La Orchila, Venezuela on August 14. =Tropical Storm Three= The third tropical storm of the season developed on August 19 about 170 miles (270 km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. At 1100 UTC that day, it made landfall near Cape Lookout with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The storm traveled north and emerged into the Chesapeake Bay near Norfolk, Virginia. The storm continued travelling northward just offshore of the east coast of the US before finally dissipating off Rhode Island on August 21. Heavy rains and strong winds were reported in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, D.C. This system was known as the Charter Oak Storm, because it felled the famed Charter Oak in Hartford, Connecticut. =Tropical Storm Four= A limited number of sources indicate that a tropical storm was briefly active in the vicinity of Havana, Cuba on August 21. =Hurricane Five= The Southeastern States Hurricane of 1856 A hurricane formed north of Hispaniola on August 25. It moved westward, passing over the Inagua Islands before striking the north coast of Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane on August 27\\\\. The cyclone weakened to Category 1 strength as it crossed the island, close to Matanzas, but regained first Category 2 and then Category 3 strength as it moved north through the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on August 31 as a Category 2 hurricane. Thereafter, it then quickly weakened to a tropical storm while moving northward through Georgia and South Carolina. The storm entered the Atlantic from the state of Virginia on next day and dissipated on September 3. The hurricane destroyed thirty houses on Inagua and four people died there. Several vessels were run ashore on the Cuban coast. In Florida, high tides were reported along the coast. The SS Florida was tossed ashore at St. Joseph Bay and completely destroyed, while streets were inundated with water in Apalachicola. Inland, strong winds and heavy winds brought very damage inland, especially at Marianna, which was considered \\"a wreak.\\" In Key West, it was reported that the hurricane completely washed away all of the island above water. In Georgia, flooding damaged numerous bridges, dams, and corn and cotton crop fields. Many streets and sidewalks in Columbus were blocked by falling trees. At Norfolk, Virginia, on September 1, the spire of a church was blown down by the storm.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 171-173 =Hurricane Six= A sixth tropical storm was first observed by the brig Caroline E. Kelly on September 18, which experienced a heavy gale while located about east- southeast of Bermuda. With initial winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), the storm slowly strengthened while moving north-northwestward. At 1200 UTC on September 19, it reached hurricane status and peaked with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The storm decelerated and remained at this intensity for over 24 hours. Late on September 21, the system re-curved westward and weakened to a tropical storm. It was last seen by the Pride of the Sea on September 22, while located about 695 miles (1,120 km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland.

PhotoDNA is primarily used in the identification of child pornography (more properly identified as Child Sexual Abuse Material or CSAM), and works by computing a unique hash that represents the image. This hash is computed such that it is resistant to alterations in the image, including resizing and minor color alterations. It works by converting the image to black and white, resizing it, breaking it into a grid, and looking at intensity gradients or edges.

Career =Short films= Hwang Dong-hyuk was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. After he graduated from Seoul National University with a B.A. in Communications, he wrote and directed numerous short films including Our Sad Life and A Puff of Smoke. Moving to Los Angeles to study for a M.F.A. in Film Production at the University of Southern California, he continued to make films, completing two shorts Heaven & Hell and Desperation (2000). His graduation thesis film was Miracle Mile (2004), a short starring Karl Yune as a Korean-American gypsy cab driver who helps his fare, a young Korean woman (played by Hana Kim) search for her brother who was adopted by Americans 20 years ago. Miracle Mile screened at over 40 international film festivals and won several awards, including the DGA Student Film Award and Student Emmy Award. =My Father= For his feature film debut, Hwang returned to the topic of adoption in My Father (2007). Based on the true story of Korean-American adoptee Aaron Bates, the film is about a U.S. Army soldier stationed in Korea who appears on national television to search for his birth parents, then finds his father on death row for murder. Kim Yeong-cheol played the father opposite lead actor Daniel Henney, whom Hwang decided to cast despite the latter being typecast as a heartthrob. Henney and Kim were praised for their acting, as was Hwang for his non-melodramatic handling of forgiveness and acceptance, intertwined with issues of cultural identity and the death penalty. =The Crucible (Silenced)= Hwang's second film became one of the biggest stories in Korean cinema in 2011. Based on a novel by Gong Ji-young and starring Gong Yoo and Jung Yu-mi, The Crucible (also known as Silenced) depicts real-life events at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the deaf where young students were cruelly treated and sexually abused by their teachers and administrators. Hwang said he deliberated for about a month whether or not he should make the film, but decided to do it because \\"It had to be told.\\" Hwang said, \\"I thought about two things when making this film. First, I wanted to let the world know about this horrific incident. Secondly, I wanted to expose the structural problems of society as revealed during the process of how the case was buried. The issues portrayed in the movie -- sexual violence against children, corrupt ties between police and influential families, negligence of duty by civil servants -- is not fictitious, but can be seen regularly on the daily news.\\" The movie became a box-office hit in Korea, attracting 4.7 million viewers. But more significantly, it provoked widespread public anger and commentary, such that the case was reopened and lawmakers passed the \\"Dogani Bill\\" which abolishes the statute of limitations for sex crimes against minors and the disabled. Hwang said, \\"I took up filmmaking because I was so frustrated by all these unresolved social issues I saw. We can see through films how much we are changed by the world. You can't change society with just one movie, but looking at the repercussion of the release of this film, we can think about the power film has in terms of positively affecting society.\\" =Miss Granny= In a significant departure from his previous films, Hwang's third feature Miss Granny (titled Suspicious Girl in Korean) focuses on a 74-year- old woman who regains the appearance of her 20-year-old self (played by Na Moon-hee and Shim Eun-kyung, respectively), in a movie that straddles comedy, family drama, music and romance. Hwang said at the 2014 film's press conference, \\"With My Father and Silenced, I always seemed to be making social films with dark subject matter, but in reality, I am a fun person. This time I really wanted to make a happy and light film.\\" Strong word of mouth propelled Miss Granny to the top of the box office chart, with more than 8.65 million admissions.

It was described in 2010, replacing the illegitimate name Endolepis. It comprises two species, that have also been included in the genus Atriplex.CalFlora Database: Atriplex covillei (Coville's orach) . accessed 2.22.2015 Stutzia species occur in western North America.  Description  The species of Stutzia are annual herbs 3‚Äì50 cm high and broad, growing erect or spreading. Young plant parts are sparsely furfuraceous or farinose, older ones glabrescent. The stems are branched nearly from base with ascending or spreading branches, the older ones with whitish bark. The numerous green leaves are alternate, petiolated or not. Their succulent leaf blades are 7‚Äì50 long and 2‚Äì30 mm wide, triangular-hastate, broadly ovate, lanceolate-ovate, lanceolate, or elliptic, with entire margins. The leaf anatomy is of the \\"normal\\" (non-Kranz) type of C3-plants. The plants are monoecious. The inflorescences form terminal, dense or interrupted spikes of glomerulate male and often female flowers, and female flowers standing to 1-6 in the axils of midstem leaves. Male flowers (without bracteoles) consist of 5 triangular to subulate perianth lobes, ca. 1‚Äì2 mm long, united in the lower half to 3/4, smooth or with a fleshy crest, and 5 exserting stamens inserting on a disc. Female flowers are sitting within 2 opposite bracteoles, they consist of a hyaline perianth of 1‚Äì5 distinct, entire or lobed tepals, and an ovary with 2 filiform, slightly exserted stigmas. In fruit, the bracteoles enclosing the fruit become accrescent, 2‚Äì20 √ó 1‚Äì10 mm, connate at least to the middle or to the summit. Their shape can be either ovate and entire or ovate-cordate to lanceolate, and laterally lobed at base, with acute to acuminate apices. Their surface is scurfy, usually without tubercles. The ovate, laterally compressed to subglobose fruit (utricle) greatly surpassing the perianth is not spongy, and does not fall at maturity. The membranous pericarp adheres to the seed. The vertically orientated seed with rostellate apex has a brown to dark reddish-brown, thin, crustaceous seed coat. The subannular, slender embryo surrounds the copious perisperm. Stutzia is flowering from April to July. The chromosome numbers are n = 9 (haploid) and 2n = 18 (diploid).  Distribution  The species of Stutzia are distributed in western North America (Alberta, Saskatchewan, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and possibly Oregon). They grow in dry habitats on alkaline or saline substrates, from 400‚Äì2,200 m. Stutzia dioica is more widely distributed, and is a pioneer on alkaline or saline, fine-textured soils in badlands. Sometimes it occurs together with Atriplex species, sagebrush, or grasses. Stutzia covillei grows on saline soils in saltbush, greasewood, rabbitbrush, warm desert scrub, and salt-grass communities.  Systematics  The genus Stutzia has been first described in 2010 by Elizabeth H. Zacharias (In: A Molecular Phylogeny of North American Atripliceae (Chenopodiaceae), with Implications for Floral and Photosynthetic Pathway Evolution. In: Systematic Botany 35 (4), p. 839-857). It replaced the illegitimate name Endolepis, that had been described in 1860 by John Torrey (not being aware of the earlier fossil Endolepis Schleid. from 1846). The type species is Stutzia dioica. Stutzia species were often included in genus Atriplex. The genus name Stutzia was given in honour to the botanist Howard C. Stutz, who had resurrected Endolepis in 1993. Stutzia belongs to the tribe Atripliceae in the subfamily Chenopodioideae of the family Amaranthaceae. =Species= The genus comprises two species: * Stutzia covillei (Standl.) E. H.

The system covers New Plymouth city, as well as services to Waitara, Inglewood, Oakura and recently Stratford. Major changes were introduced on 31 May 2010. New routes were introduced, and service levels greatly expanded. Funding (from the Council and NZTA) for the expanded service was provided on a ‚Äútrial‚Äù basis for two years and was subject to the services performing satisfactorily. These services became permanent in 2012. System =Administration= Public transport in New Plymouth primarily consists of diesel buses operating over eleven regular routes during the week (plus a reduced weekend service) and regular school runs. Limited shopper services run south-east of the city to Inglewood and Stratford. New Plymouth has also historically operated both trolleybuses and trams. Despite having had stations at the breakwater, Elliot Street, Fitzroy, Egmont Road and Bell Block, suburban rail services have never operated in the city. Buses in the city are privately owned and subsidised, with the infrastructure (such as bus stops and shelters) owned by the New Plymouth District Council. Planning and subsidising public transport are in turn the responsibility of the Taranaki Regional Council. The district‚Äôs transport services are marketed under the name Citylink. Types of Vehicles Used =Trams= New Plymouth‚Äôs electric tramway system (proposed as early as 1906 ) began operations on 10 March 1916 between Fitzroy and Weymouth Street (a short distance past the railway station). In the first week of operation, 18,213 passengers rode the trams. Weymouth Street to the Breakwater opened on 21 April 1916 and Egmont Street to Morley Street followed on 20 May 1916. Further extensions opened from Morley Street to David Street in Westown on 29 November 1923 and a final line to Pukekura Park and Gilbert street opened in July 1924. Further proposals were for extensions to Vogletown and Frankleigh Park but these were not successful. New Plymouth Corporation Tramways was reputedly the smallest municipality in the world to operate trams on the overhead electricity system. The original fleet consisted of 6 cars. No 1-4 were single-truck trams built in 1915 by Boon and Company of Christchurch. No 5-6 were larger double-bogie vehicles also from Boon & Co. No 7-9 were Birney Safety Cars introduced in 1921 (nicknamed ‚ÄúTin Lizzies‚Äù) and were purchased for the Westown extension. Finally No 10 was a double-bogie tram from Boon & Co. almost identical to No5 & 6\\\\. All vehicles survived until the closure of the system on 23 July 1954. Bodies were auctioned off and one tram body survives (Birney No 8) and is currently stored in Wanganui awaiting restoration. =Trolley Buses= In 1950 the Westown route was replaced with a fleet of 4 Crossley trolleybuses and the route extended to Wallath road. There ran for 17 years until October 1967 when they were replaced with diesel buses. The Port-Fitzroy route was replaced directly by diesel buses in 1954. =Buses= New Plymouth City Council first started operating buses from 1918 (two years after starting its bus service). The council's preference when purchasing new vehicles was to tag its orders onto those of larger cities, resulting in a fleet of top specification. It could be described as being a microcosm of the fleets of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Council continued operating these until the end of 1991 when the fleet was sold to Gold Star Buses, a Hamilton company that failed a few months later. Okato Bus Lines took over some of the Gold Star routes. In 2008 Tranzit took over from Okato Bus Lines and continues to run the buses. All bus have bike racks.

It serves as the 11th episode of the ninth season and the 189th overall episode. The animation directors were the supervising director, Alan Smart and Tom Yasumi, and was written by Marc Ceccarelli, Luke Brookshier, and Mr. Lawrence. Ceccarelli and Brookshier also served as storyboard directors. The episode originally aired in Greece on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it aired on Nickelodeon on November 11. In this episode of the series, which follows the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob gets fired from the Krusty Krab after Mr. Krabs discovers he can save a nickel by eliminating him. Subsequently, SpongeBob's attempts to apply at other restaurants end in humiliating failure. \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\\" was first screened at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International. Prior to broadcast on television, the episode created a level of controversy for its depiction of unemployment. It eventually sparked a political debate when Media Matters for America and Al Sharpton of MSNBC accused both the New York Post and Fox News of using the episode \\"to slam poor people who use social services\\". The premiere of \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\\" drew 5.19 million viewers, the biggest audience viewership for a SpongeBob SquarePants episode in two years since \\"Frozen Face-Off\\" in July 2011. Plot SpongeBob is going about his usual day at work at the Krusty Krab. All of a sudden, his employer, Mr. Krabs, fires him from his job as a fry cook. According to Mr. Krabs, he can save a nickel if he cuts SpongeBob's salary completely. SpongeBob offers to work for free, which Mr. Krabs says he considered but learned it would be illegal and that he could lose his vending license. Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's apathetic co-worker, asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs refuses because Squidward has more seniority. SpongeBob cries in depression all the way home. Squidward, although gleeful over SpongeBob not working at the Krusty Krab anymore, asks Mr. Krabs who will be the new fry cook. His boss informs him that, to save money, he will take over the kitchen, much to Squidward's dismay. At home, SpongeBob, still distraught, explains the situation to his best friend and neighbor Patrick. Patrick, however, tells him that being unemployed is \\"the best gig I know\\" and promises to return in the morning to introduce SpongeBob to \\"the unemployed lifestyle.\\" The next morning, the two friends meet up and start SpongeBob's first day of \\"glorious unemployment,\\" or as Patrick likes to call it, \\"Fun Employment.\\" Patrick shows SpongeBob the following activities: 1.) Going to Squidward's garden and getting him to throw vegetables at them after ruining some of his flowers, 2.) Taking a \\"siesta\\" and 3.) Having a free lunch with friends at Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. Sandy, who is carrying out an experiment in nutrition, is surprised to see SpongeBob in poor condition and tells him that he should find a new job after she learns he was fired. Deciding that Sandy is right, SpongeBob thanks Patrick for trying to help him but points out that, while unemployment might be fun for him, SpongeBob needs a job. Patrick is fine with this and tells his best friend that he should do what he feels is right. Over the next few days, SpongeBob tries getting a job at a hot dog joint, a pizzeria, a taqueria, and even an Asian noodle house. He is fired every time for making a type of patty (\\"weenie patties,\\" a \\"pizza patty,\\" a \\"burrito patty\\" and a \\"noodle patty\\" respectively) instead of what each respective restaurant itself specializes in. After being dismissed from the noodle house, SpongeBob goes home and prepares some homemade pet food for Gary, noticing that they're out of store bought food. Gary loves the food, but the gluttonous Patrick shares it. Eventually, the doorbell rings, but before SpongeBob can answer it, he is stashed into a body bag shaped like a hot dog bun and taken back to the hot dog joint, where he is forced to work because, surprisingly, the customers loved the weenie patties that he created. Soon, all four of the restaurant managers who fired SpongeBob the day before begin to fight over him because their customers loved the patty creations he made. A mysterious person in a Krabby Patty costume (only referred to as the \\"Killer Patty\\") arrives, defeats all four of the restaurant managers using a unique style of martial arts, saves SpongeBob, and takes him back to the Krusty Krab, which has faltered ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. The person in the Krabby Patty costume is none other than Squidward, who explains that, as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again. Mr. Krabs admits that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place, as the Krusty Krabs is even worse without him. With his confidence restored, SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs installs a pay toilet that only costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by rehiring SpongeBob. Promotion On July 21, 2013, Tom Kenny presented an event called \\"SpongeCon 2013: The Year of the Fan\\" at the San Diego Comic-Con International 2013. The event hosted the official and exclusive sneak preview of \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\\" and the screening of the SpongeBob SquareShorts global short film competition finalists. Prior to the official preview, a sneak peek of the episode was featured on Nick Studio 10, hosted by Noah Grossman and Gabrielle \\"Gabby\\" Senn, on June 10, 2013. A \\"SpongeBob expert\\" named Sophia said that \\"the unthinkable [will] happen to SpongeBob [in this episode]\\". She remarked that the episode is \\"pretty top secret\\". In an October 30, 2013 article of the New York Post, it was first reported that \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\\" would air on Nickelodeon in the United States on November 11, 2013. As part of the marketing campaign for the episode, Nickelodeon debuted an online game of the same name. Beginning November 6, players could visit \\"nick.com/spongebob\\" to play the game. In the gameplay, players must accurately cook the orders of the diners while juggling each server's impatience level in order to keep them \\"happy as possible\\". Furthermore, Nickelodeon published a collection called SpongeBob SquarePants: Get to Work! on iTunes. On November 6, Nickelodeon debuted the full-length trailer of the episode to garner more exposure. Earlier that day, The Hollywood Reporter exclusively debuted the 45-second teaser. The source also released in advance an exclusive 90-second trailer of the episode, featuring SpongeBob getting the ax from Mr. Krabs, on November 4. Ratings \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\\" first aired on Nickelodeon (Greece) on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it premiered on November 11. The original U.S. airing of the episode on Nickelodeon brought in the biggest audience viewership for a SpongeBob SquarePants episode in two years, with 5.186 million households tuning in overall. The episode tied with CBS' Hostages, the \\"poorest performer\\", from the \\"Big Four\\" of the night. However, across cable, the show outperformed The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills (0.8 adults), Teen Mom (0.7 adults) and The Daily Show (0.6 adults). The broadcast was the second most viewed show among all the day's cable programs (a Monday Night Football contest between the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on ESPN came first). The episode topped the 2‚Äì11, 6‚Äì11 and 9‚Äì14 in the kids demographics. Reception and Controversy SpongeBob, You're Fired received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike. The episode was harshly criticized for dialogue referencing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps benefit). In a scene from the episode, Patrick Star tries to show SpongeBob \\"the benefits of being unemployed\\", to which SpongeBob replies, \\"Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.\\" The scene was meant to demonstrate the title character's \\"eternal optimism and willingness to get back to work...in a way that's still funny and relatable\\". However, some political activists claimed the \\"notorious line\\" was a \\"slam\\" to the Food Stamps benefit. A report by The Hollywood Reporter alleged that the episode may have had a political agenda about the social safety net. It added that \\"It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left.\\" The Hollywood Reporter cited the previous episodes \\"SpongeBob's Last Stand\\" and \\"Selling Out\\" for where \\"environmentalism is glorified\\" and \\"large businesses are demonized\\". According to various sources, the story line is said to be \\"symbolic of a harsh economic climate\\". The plot eventually sparked a political debate for its depiction of unemployment. Prior to the premiere, the New York Post published an article on the episode. Critics accused the author, Andrea Morabito, of attacking \\"poor people\\" who rely on government assistance, referring to individuals who rely on food stamps as \\"mooching off the social services\\" and applauding SpongeBob for instead quickly returning to \\"gainful employment\\". Fox News's Heather Nauert of Fox & Friends stated that \\"the harsh economic climate has hit the underwater community\\", but \\"instead of mooching off social services at Bikini Bottom...SpongeBob sets out to return to the work force\\". After the New York Post and Fox News commented on the episode, Media Matters for America, a politically progressive media watchdog group, responded. The group accused the media sources, both owned by News Corporation, of using the episode \\"to slam poor people who use social services\\". In response to Fox News, Media Matters immediately posted an item online titled \\"Right-Wing Media Use SpongeBob SquarePants' Firing To Attack Social Safety Net\\", arguing that the two \\"are using the firing of fictional cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants to attack the social safety net and those who rely on it\\". Media Matters was \\"also particularly bothered by [a] line from The Post story: 'Lest he sit around idly, mooching off the social services of Bikini Bottom, a depressed SpongeBob sets out to return to gainful employment wherever he can find it', reporter Andrea Morabito wrote. 'No spoilers‚Äîbut it's safe to say that our hero doesn't end up on food stamps, as his patty-making skills turn out to be in high demand.'\\" Civil rights activist and talk show host Al Sharpton of MSNBC remarked in the October 31 episode of PoliticsNation that \\"The right-wingers found a new hero in its war against the poor [...] SpongeBob SquarePants. That's right. SpongeBob SquarePants [...] So a sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea doesn't need government help. That means no one does?\\" Nickelodeon declined to comment on the issue caused by the message of the episode. However, Russell Hicks of Nickelodeon said the show is \\"tapping into the news of the moment, but did not specifically address any political leanings or ideologies within the episode.\\" In a statement, Hicks said \\"Like all really great cartoons, part of SpongeBob's long-running success has been its ability to tap into the zeitgeist while still being really funny for our audience. As always, despite this momentary setback, SpongeBob's eternal optimism prevails, which is always a great message for everyone.\\" Merchandising Nickelodeon and Random House released a book based on the episode called You're Fired!. The book is illustrated by David Aikins and was released on January 7, 2014. \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired!\\" was released on a DVD compilation of the same name on April 29, 2014 by Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Entertainment. The DVD includes the episode itself, \\"Neptune's Spatula\\", \\"Welcome to the Chum Bucket\\", \\"The Original Fry Cook\\", \\"Le Big Switch\\", \\"Model Sponge\\", \\"Employee of the Month\\", \\"Bossy Boots\\", \\"Krusty Dogs\\", \\"License to Milkshake\\", \\"Help Wanted\\", \\"Wet Painters\\", \\"Krusty Krab Training Video\\", and \\"Pizza Delivery\\". On October 10, 2017, \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired!\\" was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete Ninth Season DVD, alongside all episodes of the ninth season. On June 4, 2019, \\"SpongeBob, You're Fired!\\" was released on the SpongeBob SquarePants: The Next 100 Episodes DVD, alongside all the episodes of seasons six through nine.https://www.facebook.com/tvshowsondvd/photos/a.10151614436896063/10156879245486063/?type=3&theater; See also References ;General * ;Specific External links * * Category:SpongeBob SquarePants episodes Category:2010s American television specials Category:2013 controversies Category:2013 American television episodes Category:2013 television specials Category:Animated television specials Category:Political controversies in the United States Category:Mass media-related controversies in the United States Category:Works about labor and the labor movement Category:Television controversies in the United States Category:Television episodes about termination of employment Category:2010s controversies in the United States ","title":"SpongeBob, You're Fired"},{"id":"40039255","text":"Harutyunyan (), also transliterated as Harutyunian, Harutiunyan, Arutyunyan, Arutiunov, or Arutiunian, is an Armenian surname.

The virus was first discovered in 1996 in an epizootic of inclusion body hepatitis and enteritis in aplomado and peregrine falcons. It can also infect orange-breasted falcons, taitas, merlins, and American kestrels. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of infection last for 1‚Äì2 days and include: *Anorexia *Dehydration *Diarrhea *Enteritis, the inflammation of the small intestines *Inclusion bodies in the liver *Necrotizing hepatitis *Splenomegaly, the enlargement of the spleen Diagnosis To allow screening of captive birds for virus shedding and investigations of disease outbreaks, conventional and quantitative PCR assays as well as in situ hybridization techniques have been developed to identify the DNA of Falcon aviadenovirus A. If the falcon has died, a necropsy can be performed to look for intranuclear inclusion bodies and necrosis in the liver and inflamed small intestines. Testing for serum neutralizing antibodies can also be used to identify if a bird has been infected by the virus. Transmission Transmission of Falcon aviadenovirus A occurs horizontally through the fecal-oral route. Cross-species brooding of eggs increases the risk of infection. The primary way to stop transmission is to separate sick falcons from uninfected ones susceptible to infection. Epidemiology As Falcon aviadenovirus A infects falcons found throughout North America, the virus likely has a large geographic distribution. Serosurveys of captive and wild peregrine falcons have revealed a seroprevalence of 80-100%, although clinical disease is rarely reported in this species, which suggests they are the natural reservoir of the virus. In other falcon species, seroprevalence ranges from 43 to 57%. Wild American kestrels caught have sometimes been infected, indicating the virus to be circulating in wild populations.

The first books printed in the thirteen colonies were published and sold by Usher. Early life Usher was born in 1615. The medieval records known as the Hundred Rolls show that Usher came from the then hamlet of Bednall Green (today's Bethnal Green) in East London in England. The Usher family line itself is believed to be originally from the town of Bednall Green. The Usher family name is known in English history and literally means \\"one who introduced strangers.\\" Usher and his brother Robert left Bednall Green and settled in the thirteen colonies. Usher came first to Cambridge. As of 1642, he was the owner of a house in Cambridge (located on the northeast corner of Dunster and Winthrop) that was the property of William Andrew in 1635. Later, in 1645 Usher settled in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He lived on the north side of Boston on State Street near the marketplace. Usher opened his first bookstore in Boston in 1647. His affairs prospered, and by 1652, he had become a well-known merchant and bookseller. Robert, his brother, had settled in Stamford, Connecticut. Career Bay Psalm Book, first book Usher sold Usher was a commercial merchant and a real estate investor. He was the first known colonial bookseller. Most of the items he had for sale in his business as a merchant were books. One such book that he sold that was well received was the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the thirteen colonies. The first edition was sold by Usher in Cambridge in 1640 and the fourth edition of the Bay Psalm Book was sold in Boston by Usher in 1652. He had also printed and distributed for free John Eliot's catechism in 1653. Usher was agent for the London Society of the Corporation for Propagating the Gospel in managing the money matters between the corporation established in England for spreading the New Testament among the Indians in America and the commissioners of the thirteen colonies in New England. He was able to obtain paper and type fonts for printing the New Testament in the Indian language when he went to England in the winter of 1657/58. The printing items he received he put in charge of Samuel Green in 1659 at Cambridge to print the Indian New Testament and other works. Usher distributed the Indian New Testaments free of charge from 1660 to 1663. Usher was the publisher of the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for seven years under the monopoly he received from the Massachusetts General Court in 1672. Wives and families Usher's first wife was Frances (died February 25, 1652).

Usher's third wife was Mary Alford Butler (daughter of William Alford and widow of Peter Butler). They had no children. She survived him and married Samuel Nowell of Charlestown, Massachusetts. Death Usher died in May 1676. His will is dated 11 May 1676 and proved 19 May 1676. During his lifetime he had accumulated much wealth in selling books and publications. Two of his sons quarreled over his estate, which ultimately had to be settled in court. Usher's will talks about his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Harwood, and his brother-in-law, John Harwood. Usher and several of his family members are buried at the historic King's Chapel Burying Ground on Tremont Street in Boston. Legacy Home of Hezekiah Usher's son, Hezekiah Usher was one of the founders of the First Church in Boston. He was a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. Usher was interested in Boston civic matters and held several town positions. He was elected selectman in 1659, a position he held until his death.

She is the wife of the show's protagonist Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and the main protagonist in the final season. She is a lobbyist and runs an environmental nonprofit organization, but in later seasons ascends to the positions of Second Lady of the United States, First Lady of the United States, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Vice President of the United States, and finally the 47th President of the United States. Claire made her first appearance in the series' pilot episode, \\"Chapter 1\\". The character is based on Elizabeth Urquhart, a character from the eponymous British miniseries from which the current series is derived. Unlike the original character, however, Claire has her own storylines. The role has been critically acclaimed. Wright won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama for this role at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, becoming the first actress to win a Golden Globe Award for a web television online-only role in a series. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for this role at the 65th, 66th, 67th, 68th, 69th and 71st Primetime Emmy Awards. In November 2017, Netflix fired Spacey from the series after a number of people accused him of sexual misconduct. The Frank Underwood character was written out of the show as having died, and Claire became the main character of the show's sixth and final season.  Character overview  Claire Hale Underwood is originally from the exclusive Highland Park enclave of Dallas, Texas. Her late father was a major Texas Republican. While at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, she met Francis J. \\"Frank\\" Underwood, a Harvard Law student from South Carolina. She is from a wealthy family, and the show characterizes her as a \\"Dallas Debutante\\" and \\"Lily White\\". She recounts her father's taking her to Dealey Plaza, where John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and that it made her feel \\"so sad, so angry\\". She has a difficult relationship with her mother, Elizabeth Hale (Ellen Burstyn), who despises Frank and is disappointed in Claire for marrying him. Brian Stelter of The New York Times described her as Frank Underwood's conniving wife and described the Underwoods as \\"the scheming husband and wife at the center of 'House of Cards'\\". She is a woman \\"who will stop at nothing to conquer everything\\". Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an \\"ice-queen wife\\". The Independent's Sarah Hughes echoes this description, saying Claire is so dedicated to the couple's schemes that it is clear she will execute them herself if Frank wavers. Following season 4, Robin Wright stated that she felt Claire Underwood was the equal of Frank Underwood and demanded equal pay for her performance. Netflix acquiesced. = Relationship with Frank = While Frank is Machiavellian, Claire presents a woman urging on her husband's assertion of power in the image of Lady Macbeth. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weaknesses, saying: \\"My husband doesn't apologize...even to me.\\" This gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Willimon notes that \\"What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do.\\" Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes Claire as \\"a short-haired blonde who manages to be masculine and demasculinizing at the same time.\\" Smith describes their relationship as pivotal to the show: \\"Benign though they may seem‚Äîand their harmless air is what makes the Underwoods so effective as political plotters‚Äîthis is a power couple with the same malignant chemistry as pairs of serial killers, where each needs the other in order to become lethal\\". Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter says the series \\"...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple Frank (Kevin Spacey) and Claire (Robin Wright) Underwood as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels but most importantly between Frank and Claire. In season 3, when the Underwoods are President and First Lady of the United States, Claire's marriage to Frank begins to falter. She tires of being in a subordinate role to him, wanting to be \\"significant\\" in her own right, and decides that he is \\"not enough\\" for her. She leaves him in the season finale but comes back in the fourth season, treating their marriage as a purely political arrangement to further her own career. When he is shot during a campaign event, Claire privately admits that she feels nothing for him. Throughout the season, she works behind the scenes to undermine Frank's election campaign, before finally joining forces with him in order to become his vice president. She also has an affair with her speechwriter Tom Yates (Paul Sparks), with Frank's approval. Prior to Spacey's departure from the series, season 6 was going to center on a divorce battle between Frank and Claire, with the two attempting to destroy each other; after Spacey was fired, however, the season's story arc was drastically rewritten. The new season plot had Frank dying offscreen, and Claire‚Äînow the president‚Äîpublicly distancing herself from him, and privately calling him her \\"biggest regret\\". Later in the season, she reveals that she is pregnant with his child.  Fictional character biography  = Season 1 = Claire is the CEO of an environmental group while serving as her husband's primary accomplice. After President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) goes back on his promise to make Frank Secretary of State, Frank enlists Claire to help him get revenge and propel them both to positions of power. She and Frank scheme nightly over a cigarette, and together they maneuver their way into Walker's inner circle. Frank says of Claire: \\"I love that woman, I love her more than sharks love blood.\\" Claire is aware of Frank's sexual relationship with reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) and approves of it as long as it achieves their ends. She herself has an affair with an old boyfriend, Adam Galloway (Ben Daniels). By the end of the season, Walker appoints Frank the Vice President of the United States, making Claire the Second Lady of the United States. = Season 2 = Claire's main storyline in season 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for a sexual assault prevention bill. During her campaign for the bill, a secret from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims was the result of the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office. Claire becomes increasingly ruthless as the season progresses. When Galloway leaks an intimate photo of Claire to appease his jealous fiance√©, Claire intimidates him into publicly stating that he fabricated the picture, ruining his reputation. When Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt), a pregnant former employee, returns to demand health care as part of her severance, Claire says, \\"I am willing to let your child wither and die inside you, if that's what's required,...Am I really the sort of enemy you want to make?\\" Claire also manipulates First Lady Patricia Walker (Joanna Going) into believing that her husband is having an affair in order to distract President Walker from Frank's machinations. She shows remorse for her actions only once. When another of McGinnis' victims, Megan Hennessy (Libby Woodbridge), comes forward, Claire uses her as the poster girl for the sexual assault bill, leaving the fragile young woman open to public scrutiny and reprisals from the bill's opponents. Before she can testify about her ordeal before Congress, however, Megan suffers a breakdown and attempts suicide. Upon realizing what she has caused Megan to go through, Claire bursts into tears. In the season finale, she urges Frank to humble himself before President Walker, with whom he has fallen out of favor, in order to complete the plan: \\"Cut out your heart and put it in his fucking hands.\\" The gambit works: Walker keeps Frank as his Vice President, allowing Frank to succeed him when he resigns. Frank is now President of the United States, with Claire as the First Lady. According to Drew Grant of The New York Observer, Claire's season-long storyline was similar to the real life efforts of United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's to legislate an end to military sexual assault. Based upon the 4-episode preview, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says that in season 2 Claire \\"is still ruthlessly pursuing her own agenda as well as her husband's. She remains an enigma even as she reveals more and more disturbing secrets from her past.\\" Claire remains composed and stylish with or without her husband and manipulates the press with aplomb. = Season 3 = In Season 3, Claire feels the need to be something more \\"significant\\" than the First Lady, and asks Frank to nominate her to a United Nations post. He nominates her, but the Senate rejects her after a rocky hearing. Frank gives her the job anyway in a recess appointment, but her tenure is brief; she ruins a treaty between the U.S. and Russia by publicly confronting Russian President Viktor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen) about his anti-gay policies and is forced to resign when Petrov uses her as a bargaining chip during a diplomatic crisis. During Frank's election campaign, Claire begins to question whether she still loves him. In the season finale, she and Frank get into an ugly fight in which she says he is not enough for her; Frank replies that without him, she is nothing. Season three ends with Claire leaving Frank as he prepares to go to the New Hampshire primary. = Season 4 = After leaving Frank, Claire goes back to Texas, where she has a tense reunion with her mother, who is dying of lymphoma. She sets her sights on running for a House of Representatives seat in Texas, with help from political consultant LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell). Frank persuades her to resume public appearances with him by promising to support her run. However, he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally's daughter, in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign. Claire retaliates on the day of the South Carolina primary by covertly leaking a photo of Frank's father with a Klansman, imperiling Frank's candidacy. Frank figures out that she was behind the leak and confronts her. Claire calmly admits what she did and proposes that she join him in the ticket as his vice president. Frank rejects the idea. Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus), in an assassination attempt, and falls into a coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's weak vice president Donald Blythe (Reed Birney) through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines going to the hospital in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind the scenes to undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates. When the terrorist group Islamic Caliphate Organization (ICO) takes an American family hostage, Claire negotiates with their imprisoned leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), who agrees to tell his followers to release the hostages. Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that they can exploit. = Season 5 = In season 5, Claire's story begins as the opening scene of the season: shooting a propaganda commercial in order to stir up fear. Throughout the beginning, she helps make the campaign's focal point about the fear of ICO and how they can stop the threat. On Election Day, Claire and Frank learn that they may lose because of low voter turnout. They exploit a possible terrorist threat to close down multiple polling centers in key states, such as Ohio. This leading to numerous states filing lawsuits and refusing honoring the election results. Nine weeks later, with neither side winning the majority of electors, the House (now Republican-controlled) will decide the President and the Senate (Democrat-controlled) for the Vice President, the first instance of this happening for the President since the 1824 presidential election and the first time for the Vice President since the 1836 presidential election. Claire eventually wins when Blythe issues a bill to block any filibuster in the Senate; while the House cannot reach a majority. In the meantime, Claire is sworn in as Acting President of the United States and begins to exert her limited power by excluding Frank from certain presidential functions, such as the swearing-in of the new Justice of the Supreme Court. During her short- lived presidency, a truck with nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by several members of Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign. During the emergency, Claire is visited by diplomat Jane Davis (Patricia Clarkson), who says that she can track down a leader of ICO for the Underwoods. Claire is also faced with a series of diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have taken over an American base, and the Russians and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders for the boat to be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get what is on board. Around this time, Claire agrees to an open election in Ohio for not only the President, but also the Vice President, in order to avoid a possible Conway-Underwood administration. Frank acquires a recording of Conway verbally abusing a pilot, as well as a recording of Conway's running mate, General Ted Brockhart (Colm Feore), threatening to kill Frank, which Frank and Claire use to blackmail Conway's campaign manager Mark Usher (Campbell Scott) into helping them; they then releases the tapes anyway. Voters turn against Conway, and the Underwoods win the election. Soon afterward, Congressman Alex Romero (James Martinez) encourages Republicans in the House to start up the Declaration of War committee to investigate Frank, which puts Claire and Frank in damage control. By this time, Claire and Yates have fallen in love, which complicates both their lives. During an unguarded moment, Claire tells Yates that Frank murdered Zoe Barnes and Congressman Peter Russo (Corey Stoll). She immediately regrets it, and tells Yates that they can't see each other anymore. In response, Yates threatens to publish a book detailing the Underwoods' crimes. Claire invites him to Usher's home, and poisons him. He dies while having sex with Claire, and she has Usher get rid of the body. Around this time, Claire and Frank convince Stamper to take the fall for Zoe Barnes' death. Frank also starts to become suspicious of Claire as she disappears for a period of time (she had started talking to Davis in a secret corridor) and starts to memorize her testimony defending herself but not Frank, in case she has to testify. Walker publicly testifies against Frank, prompting him to appear before the committee and resign the presidency. When an incredulous Claire confronts him, Frank says that it was his plan all along to resign and set her up to be president, so that the two of them can run Washington together‚Äîshe from the White House and he from the private sector. For the plan to work, however, Claire must pardon Frank, which would damage her politically. Frank resigns and Claire is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. However, Claire does not announce that she is pardoning Frank in her first address to the nation as President. Frank calls her repeatedly, but she forwards the calls. She sees that Frank has burned a hole into the American flag in the Oval Office, and breaks the fourth wall, saying: \\"My turn.\\" = Season 6 = The sixth season begins four months later. Claire is President, with Usher as her Vice President. Frank has died of an apparent heart attack, but Claire suspects that he may have been murdered. Throughout the season, she tries to disassociate herself from Frank, returning to her maiden name and calling him \\"my biggest regret\\". She makes enemies of Bill Shepherd (Greg Kinnear) and his sister Annette (Diane Lane), two political power brokers who oppose her agenda. As she returns to the White House from giving a speech, an attempt is made on her life; a disgruntled ex- soldier shoots at her motorcade and commits suicide. Claire also faces a threat in Stamper, who recants his confession and makes a deal with federal prosecutors to give them Claire as revenge for her turning her back on him and Frank. She makes a shaky alliance with him, however, by promising to protect him in return for his help getting rid of Durant, who she fears will testify against her regarding her and Frank's crimes. Days later, Claire pardons Stamper, and Durant apparently dies of an embolism; it is later revealed, however, that she faked her death and fled the country. Meanwhile, Claire grows suspicious of Usher, who is secretly working with the Shepherds. She fires her cabinet to neutralize his influence, and leaks information tying him and Bill Shepherd to laundering money for the Russian government; she also punishes Annette Shepherd by revealing to the press that Annette's son, Duncan (Cody Fern), is in fact the biological child of one of her serving staff. To clear the field of potential threats to her power, Claire has Durant, Davis and Hammerschmidt killed. When Stamper confronts her about what Frank left him in his will, Claire says that she is pregnant with Frank's child. The Shepherds try to undermine her by developing a voting app that would essentially steal the upcoming midterm elections; Claire retaliates by having Duncan, who created the app, arrested for treason. In the series finale, Claire arranges a meeting with Stamper, whom she (correctly) suspects has been hired by the Shepherds to kill her. During a heated exchange, she gets him to confess that he poisoned Frank in order to stop him from killing her, in order to protect the Underwood \\"legacy\\". He attacks her with a letter opener, superficially wounding her in the throat, but cannot bring himself to kill her, instead collapsing into her arms. Claire then stabs him and watches him die on the floor of the Oval Office, saying, \\"There, no more pain.\\"  Reception  Wright's performance is described as \\"nuanced and compelling\\". Claire has \\"chilly poise\\" but the \\"coolly regal doyenne\\" softens over the course of the first season according to New Republics Laura Bennet. Wright plays the role with \\"an almost terrifying froideur\\". As a couple Frank and Claire are said to \\"reverberate with tension and wit\\". Michael Dobbs, who wrote the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of the relationship between Frank and Claire favorably to the original characters in House of Cards and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. He is not alone. In season 2, she remains \\"equally steely\\". Despite suggestions to the contrary, Wright insists that the character is not based on Hillary Clinton. = Awards and nominations = On July 18, 2013, Netflix earned the first Primetime Emmy Award nominations for original online only web television for the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Three of its web series, Arrested Development, Hemlock Grove, and House of Cards, earned nominations. Among those nominations was Wright's portrayal of Claire Underwood for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series as well as Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Frank Underwood for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Jason Bateman's portrayal of Michael Bluth in Arrested Development for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, making these three roles the first three leading roles to be Primetime Emmy Award-nominated from a web television series. The role has also earned Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama award at the 71st Golden Globe Awards on January 12, 2014. In so doing she became the first actress to win a Golden Globe Award for an online-only web television series. For season 2, Wright earned a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series nomination at the 4th Critics' Choice Television Awards. Wright was again nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. She was nominated for both Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. In season 3, she was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards, as well as both Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards. Her performance in season 4 earned her a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards. Wright continued to receive another individual Screen Actors Guild Award at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a nomination at the 7th Critics‚Äô Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series. Wright's performance in season 5 earned her a fifth consecutive Primetime Emmy nomination at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards. She continued to be the show's only nominations at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards and the 8th Critics‚Äô Choice Television Awards, both hosted in early 2018. For her final performance in season 6, Wright received her fifth individual (and seventh overall throughout the series) consecutive nomination at the 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards. She later went on to receive her sixth and final nomination for the role for the Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmy at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards. She became one of only seven actresses that received six or more nominations in the category for the same show.

The proposed mine has reserves amounting to 348.7 million tonnes of ore grading 5% titanium. The mine project is backed by the ANC government headed by Gwede Mantashe whom are set to make millions in kickbacks, and Transworld, initially a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian corporation Mineral Commodities (MRC), the mine would be one of the largest mines of its kind in South Africa, and decimate local ancestral grounds. The government decision to support the company's 2007 application for Mining Right was challenged by the Amadiba Crisis Committee (AAC), formed in 2007 by local people who would be affected by the mine. The lands have traditionally been held communally by local villages. The subsequent decades- long conflict has been marked by violence. The chairman of the Amadiba Crisis Committee, Sikhosiphi 'Bazooka' Rhadebe, was assassinated in 2016. Amnesty International has called on South Africa to respect the rights of indigenous people and to protect threatened indigenous rights advocates such as Nonhle Mbuthuma, another founder of the ACC. In September 2016 the Minister of Mineral Resources announced an 18-month moratorium on mining in the Xolobeni area. In September 2018, it was proposed that the moratorium be extended for another two years. As of 22 November 2018, Judge Annali Basson of the Pretoria High Court stated that even if the informal rights of customary communities had not been protected by law previously, they had the right to decide what would happen to their land. Therefore the Minister of Mineral Resources cannot grant mining rights to the Xolobeni lands without first obtaining the full and formal consent of the Xolobeni community. In spite of the decision, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe continues to support the mining project.  Proposal  Mineral Commodities Limited had confirmed the presence of mineral deposits in the area by 2002. As of March 2007, Mineral Commodities Limited‚Äôs South African subsidiary Transworld Energy and Minerals Resources submitted a Mining Right Application to the Department of Minerals and Energy (‚ÄúDME‚Äù) in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It described the Xolobeni Project as \\"one of the largest undeveloped mineral sands resources in the world\\". The area was projected to contain more than 9,000,000 tonnes of ilmenite, titanium-iron oxide mineral, as well as rutile, zircon and leucoxene. The expected lifetime of the mine was 22 years. Mining rights to five sectors were requested as part of the Xolobeni Mineral Sands Project (Xolobeni). The Xolobeni area is described as being located \\"between the Mzamba and Mtentu Rivers, along the east coast of South Africa.\\" The Kwanyana Block is described as extending \\"along the coast bordered by the Mnyameni River along the northern boundary and the Kwanyana River to the south.\\" Five villages were included in the area: Sigidi, Mdatya, Mtulana, Kwanyana and Mthentu. The area is characterized by \\"high unemployment, poor education levels and a rural population primarily dependent on agriculture, animal herding for sustenance\\", with 72.2% of people in the larger region living below the poverty line. It is one of the most impoverished communities in South Africa. There were efforts by several regional organizations, beginning as early as 1997, to develop ecotourism resources in the area. The main business in the area between 2000 and 2004 was AmaDiba Adventures, an EU-supported award-winning ecotourism initiative owned and run by the Amadiba community.  Reception  The proposed mine met fierce opposition from members of the local Xolobeni community, who formed the Amadiba Crisis Committee in 2007. The mining proposals were challenged both on the grounds that community members who would be directly affected had not been properly consulted, and on the grounds that the Xolobeni area is part of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area, and therefore not open to mining under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 57 of 2003. Initial granting of mining rights The Department of Minerals and Energy, under Buyelwa Sonjica, granted mining rights to the Kwanyana Block to the Mineral Resource Commodities and to Transworld Energy and Mineral Resources as of 14 July 2008. The expected signing date for the Xolobeni Mining Right was 31 October 2008. This was blocked by the filing of an appeal by the Amadiba Crisis Committee and Grahamstown office of the Legal Resources Centre in September 2008, requesting that the Minister of Minerals and Energy suspend and appeal the decision to grant the Mining Right.  Revoking of rights  On 17 May 2011, Minister of Mineral Resources Susan Shabangu revoked her predecessor's award of mining rights in the Kwanyana Block to Mineral Resource Commodities and to Transworld Energy and Mineral Resources. The mining company was given a 90-day grace period to appeal, if they chose to address the environmental concerns at issue. However, Shabangu also indicated that she considered the company to have followed an adequate community consultation process, a conclusion that did not agree with findings of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on the matter.  Environmental impact assessment  As of March 2015, the company again filed a Mining Right Application to develop mines in approximately 2800 hectares including the areas of Mtentu, Sikombe, Kwanyana, Mnyameni, and Mpahlane. In order for the Xolobeni project to move forward, as per South African law, and as administered by the Department of Mineral Resources, the Company was required to engage an Independent Environmental Consultant to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as part of their Mining Right Application. An independent assessment can be an important source of information for the residents of the local community, where the mining is proposed. Without the EIA, local residents are unable to make a fully informed decision of the pros and cons of the project, thus are not empowered with the necessary information to make the decision to support the proposed mineral sand mine based on the merits of the project versus the consequences of mining to their community. In April 2015, a delegation attempting to perform an environmental impact assessment on behalf of the mining company were forced to leave the area after residents protested.  Community impact  Estimates of the number of families that would be affected by the proposed mine vary widely. The ACC has suggested that as many as 200 families might be affected by displacement or disruption of the use of tribal grazing lands. As of 2015, an assessment reported that residents of 62 homes would be affected in the demarcated mining area. In a court filing of 2016, it was stated that 70 families would be directly affected and many more indirectly affected. In contrast, the mining company has claimed that only three families will need to be relocated if the mine proceeds. The Company released a report of a community engagement meeting at Xolobeni in 2015, stating that 498 questions/concerns were raised by an estimated 200 people. By their account, the majority of the residents (77%) supported the mine, or were happy to support the local infrastructure upgrades that would result because of the mine. Only 10% of residents opposed the mine in principle alone, thus leaving 20 people in total currently opposing the mine. 5% of the residents were undecided and 8% asked for more information. An imbizo at Komkhulu (the Great Place) in January 2016 was attended by about 500 people from the Amadiba region. The meeting was called by called by the Pondo queen MaSobhuza Sigcau, and chaired by Mdatya leader, Zadla Dlamini. People came from the Xolobeni, Mdatya, Mtolani and Sigidi villages. Those attending vocally opposed the mining operations. Two of the most prominent local mining advocates are Zamile Qunya and Lunga Baleni. Both have been accused of conflict of interest, as a result of positions and benefits they receive from the mining company. Zamile Qunya is a founder of Xolco, a company formed in 2003 to act as an \\"empowerment partner\\" on behalf of TEM and MRC. Local Amadiba chief, Lunga Baleni, who accepted a 4x4 vehicle paid for by the mining company, is supportive of the proposed mine, but most residents are in opposition. Lunga Baleni is also a director of both TEM and Xolco. In February 2016, Chief Baleni announced that a water drilling programme would commence, and it was alleged that Baleni stated force would be used if the community attempted to stop the drilling. It was reported that over 200 residents waited on the announced day to stop the drillers, who failed to arrive. The Company released their intentions for the drilling programme on their website, which stated that the programme would \\"have left 3 fully equipped boreholes with fresh drinkable water for the community\\" however due to the threats of violence, the Company cancelled the programme.  Violence against local activists  In December 2015, villagers returning from a mass-meeting opposing the mine, and in defence of a local headwoman who had been intimidated, were attacked by a gang wielding knobkerries and pangas. Four men were arrested for their part in the attack. In March 2016, the chairman of the Amadiba Crisis Committee, Sikhosiphi 'Bazooka' Rhadebe, was assassinated. Rhadebe's son and wife were also seriously injured during the assassination. Rhadebe had allegedly warned of police involvement in the violence against mine opponents, and shortly before his death it has been alleged that he discovered a hit list of mine opponents, on which his name was first. The police have not been able to verify the allegation of a \\"hit list\\" as true. Another committee member, Nonhle Mbuthuma, claimed that Rhadebe was murdered by men claiming to be police officers, and in a vehicle with a rotating blue light. The mining Company sent condolences to the family. Threats have been made against other members of the ACC, including Nonhle Mbuthuma, who now has a constant bodyguard. Inhabitants of the village of Mdatya, including its headwoman Cynthia Duduzile Baleni, have been harassed and attacked. Amnesty International has called on South Africa to respect the rights of indigenous people and to protect Nonhle Mbuthuma and other indigenous rights advocates.  Proposed divestment  In July 2016, MRC announced its intention to withdraw from the project, stating that \\"In light of the ongoing violence and threats to the peace and harmony of the local Xolobeni community, the company accepts that the future viability of the Xolobeni Project should be managed by stakeholders and organisations exclusively owned by South African people.\\" However, the divestment did not occur. As of October 2018, Mineral Commodities still held a 56% interest in Transworld Energy and Minerals, and continued to pursue the potential for mining in the area. Mark Caruso, chairman of Mineral Resource Commodities, continues to be a director of TEM. Moratorium In September 2016, the Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane announced an 18-month moratorium on mining in the Xolobeni area, citing the ‚Äúsignificant social disintegration and highly volatile nature of the current situation in the area‚Äù. The application by Transworld Energy and Mineral Resources SA was frozen, and it was stated that no new applications would be permitted. In September 2018, it was proposed that the moratorium be extended for another two years. As of 22 November 2018, Judge Annali Basson of the Pretoria High Court stated that even if the informal rights of customary communities had not been protected by law previously, they had the right to decide what would happen to their land. Therefore the Minister of Mineral Resources cannot grant mining rights to the Xolobeni lands without first obtaining the full and formal consent of the Xolobeni community.

The House of Beaufort: The Bastard Line that Captured the Crown, p. 16. Amberley Publishing, Stroud. . Sir Payn Roelt,Walker, Simon. \\"Katherine [n√©e Katherine Roelt; married name Katherine Swynford, duchess of Lancaster\\"], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 3 January 2008. Accessed 8 January 2019. Payne Roet and sometimes Gilles Roet, was a herald and knight from Hainaut (in present day Belgium) who was involved in the early stages of the Hundred Years War. He became attached to the court of King Edward III of England through the king's marriage to Philippa of Hainaut. He is most notable for the fact that he became the ancestor of the monarchs of England and of Scotland. The children of his daughter Katherine, mistress and later wife of the king's son John of Gaunt, were given the surname Beaufort and her great-granddaughter Margaret Beaufort gave rise to the Tudor dynasty while her granddaughter Joan Beaufort married into the Stuart dynasty. Another of his daughters, Philippa, also made a notable marriage to the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. Career =Early life= Born about 1310 in Hainaut, he was \\"probably christened as Gilles,\\" in English 'Giles' and in Latin 'Egidius', a name used in each generation of the knightly family who were feudal lords of the town of Le Roeulx. However he became known as Paon or Payne, written in Latin as Paganus. He may have been inspired to seek his fortune in England by the example of Fastre de Roet, who accompanied John of Beaumont in 1326, when, with three hundred followers, he went to fight for the English against the Scots. Fastre was a younger brother of Eustace VI, last lord of Le Roeulx and a descendant of the Counts of Hainault. He and his brother Eustace fell into pecuniary straits, and were obliged to alienate their landed possessions. Fastre died in 1331, and was buried in the abbey church of Le Roeulx, while his brother Eustace survived till 1336. Paon was, like Fastre, a younger brother, if not of Eustace VI then of a collateral line. =In England= Paon de Roet may have come to England as part of the retinue of Philippa of Hainaut, accompanying the young queen in her departure from Valenciennes to join her youthful husband Edward III in England at the close of 1327. His name does not appear in the official list of knights who accompanied the queen from Hainaut. However, Froissart says he was one of a number of additional young knights and squires who added to the queen's retinue, referred to as 'pluissier jone esquier', i.e. \\"plusieurs jeunes escuyers\\" ('other young squires'); Speght (1598) Froissart's account of the history of English monarchs includes a genealogical tree, the relevant part of which begins with Paon's name. He is described as \\"Paganus de Rouet Hannoniensis, aliter dictus Guien Rex Armorum\\" (\\"Paon de Rouet of Hainaut, also called Guyenne King of Arms\\"). The latter part refers to the title of King of Arms granted by Edward III to Roet for the territory of Guyenne (Aquitaine) which was controlled by Edward. =France and Hainaut= In 1347, Roet was sent to the Siege of Calais, and was one of two knights deputed by Queen Philippa to conduct out of town the citizens whom she had saved (the so- called Burghers of Calais).Froissart, 5.215 : \\"Et au matin elle fist donner a casqun sys nobles [six nobles, about $150], et les fist conduire hors de l'oost par messire Sanse d'Aubrecicourt et messire Paon de Ruet, si avent que il vorrent, et que il fu avis as deus chevaliers que il estoient hors dou peril, et au departir il les commanderent a Dieu, et retournerent li chevalier en l'oost.\\" He had returned to the lands of Hainaut, probably by 1349. He went to serve the queen‚Äôs sister, Marguerite, who was the empress of Germany, and his three younger children‚ÄîWalter, Philippa and Katherine‚Äîwere left in the care of Queen Philippa.Davis, Craig R. ‚ÄúA Perfect Marriage on the Rocks: Geoffrey and Philippa Chaucer, and The Franklin‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù Chaucer Review 37.2 (2002). 130. He died in Ghent, County of Flanders in 1380. Family Paon had three daughters, Katherine, Philippa and Isabel (also called Elizabeth) de Roet, and a son, Walter. Isabel was to become Canoness of the convent of St. Waudru at Mons in Hainaut, c. 1366. Philippa married the poet Geoffrey Chaucer in 1366. They met while still children when they were attached to the household of Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster.Braddy, Haldeen. ‚ÄúChaucer‚Äôs Philippa, Daughter of Panneto.‚Äù Modern Language Notes 64.5 (1949). 342. Katherine became governess to the daughters of John of Gaunt. After the death of John's wife Blanche in 1369, Katherine and John began a love affair which would bring forth four children born out of wedlock and would endure as a lifelong relationship. However, John made a dynastic marriage to Constance of Castille, a claimant to the throne of Castile, after which he called himself \\"King of Castille\\". When Constance died he married Katherine and legitimised their children. Tomb Roet's name listed amongst early graves lost noted on the memorial in St Paul's Cathedral Paon de Roet's tomb was in Old St Paul's Cathedral, near Sir John Beauchamp's tomb (commonly called \\"Duke Humphrey's\\"). In 1631 the antiquary John Weever reported that \\"upon a faire marble stone, inlaid all over with brasse, (of all which, nothing but the heads of a few brazen nailes are at this day visible) and engraven with the representation and cote-Armes of the party defunct. Thus much of a mangled funerall Inscription was of late time perspicuous to be read\\". (p. 413 in W. Tooke's edition of 1767). By 1658, still without its brass plate and effigies, the tomb was again described by William Dugdale. It was destroyed, along with many others (including that of John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster) in 1666 in the Great Fire of London. A modern monument in the crypt lists De Roet amongst the important graves lost. The inscription (as recorded by Weever, although lost by his day) began: :Hic Jacet Paganus Roet miles Guyenne Rex Armorum Pater Catherine Ducisse Lancastrie ... :(Here lies Paon de Roet, knight, Guyenne King of Arms, father of Katherine Duchess of Lancaster ...) Alison Weir argues that Katherine herself likely had the tomb made for her father during her lifetime, which would place its construction between 1396 and 1403.Mistress of the Monarchy: The Life of Katherine Swynford, Duchess of Lancaster.

The palace is the first building that was erected outside the walls of the old city. It was named after its square with the form of . It is one of the museums in the city. History and location The palace was built by King Abdulaziz outside Riyadh, being the first major expansion of the city in the twentieth century. Construction was started in 1936, partly finalized in 1938 and fully completed in 1945. The palace was intended to be a family residence and court for the king. With the construction of the palace three novel technologies were introduced to the Saudi society: the use of the automobiles as means of transportation, electricity by means of generators and water closets with drainage systems. In order to connect the palace with the city center a concrete road was constructed which was also new in the city. The king left his former court in Masmak fort when the construction was finished, and used the palace as his residence and court from 1938 until his death in 1953. One of his wives, Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi, also moved with him to the palace in 1938. Another palace, Addeera, was also used as royal residence. During this period Murabba Palace witnessed many official visits and sign of various agreements. A lift was installed into the Murabba Palace in the late 1940s when the king had difficulty in climbing the stairs due to advanced arthritis. It was the first lift in Saudi Arabia. The king appointed one of his sons, Prince Mansour, as emir of the palace. The Murabba palace is situated two kilometers north of the old city of Riyadh, and its total area was over 16 hectares. It is located about half a mile from Masmak fort. The area where the palace was constructed was called Murabba Al Sufyan. In the south of the palace there are gardens, and the Batha valley is situated in the east. Wadi Abu Rafie is in the west, and small hills lie on the north of the palace. Murabba Palace is very close to Al Shamsia mansion which was the residence of Saud Al Kabeer and his wife Noura bint Abdul Rahman, elder sister of King Abdulaziz. In the 1950s the Murabba Palace was connected to Al Nasriyah Farm which is in fact a rural palace in the west of old Riyadh through a stone road. Layout and style The palace is a complex of palaces used for different purposes, housing two stories with 32 rooms. Overall shape of the building is cubic. It is made up of residential buildings, service facilities and the diwan of the king. These buildings are surrounded by a courtyard. A huge brick wall also surrounds the palace, and there are nine gates. The main gate was originally on the west side, but, later the gate on the southern side was used as main entrance which allowed a short link to the nearby mosque. The upper floor of the building used for court of the king included audience hall, offices of administrative affairs, communications and guest chambers. The ground floor housed the offices for palace utilities, security and administration. It has a plain style and reflects the general features of the traditional Najdi architecture. The building also reflects the general characteristics of Najd's urban pattern, namely solid masses, covered streets, and the integration of courtyards. The palace was built mainly by bricks, indigenous stones, tamarisk trunk and palm-leaf stalks. The walls of the building were made by straw reinforced adobe, and have engraved ornaments on coating. Local Acacia with palm frond matts was used for the ceiling of the palace. The wood beams supporting the ceiling have decorations with yellow, red, and black geometric patterns. Current usage A development project was initiated by the Supreme Commission of Tourism and Antiquities in 1999 to renovate the Murabba palace. It was converted into a museum that is open to public visits. It was called \\"living museum\\" after renovation. It is part of the King Abdulaziz Darat or King Abdulaziz Historical Center. In the current usage, the ground floor includes the guards' room and stores for food, coffee, wood and other materials needed for cooking. The upper floor is made up of salons and waiting rooms for visitors. There several historic garments and crafts are exhibited. There is also the King Abdulaziz memorial hall and a written and photographic archive centre in the building.

Biography  Born of an Armenian father (descendant of Armenian bourgeoisie) and a French mother, at 16 he entered school of dentistry, but left his studies to pursue his love of music studying saxophone with Raymond Legrand (Legrand married Jacques's sister Marcelle). He commenced his musical career playing saxo alto, saxo baryton and clarinet in Roland Dorsay's orchestra and later in Jo Bouillon's and in Ray Ventura's orchestra. He also performed in French live radio broadcasts releasing a number of recordings before World War II. Called for military service in 1939, he became a prisoner of war until his liberation in March 1943 for health reasons. After his release, he formed a small orchestra and performed on radio. After the liberation of France from Nazi occupation, Jacques H√©lian gained huge popularity, replacing Raymond Legrand's fame. His tune \\"Fleur de Paris\\" (with lyrics from Maurice Vandair, and music by Henri Bourtayre) became a virtual \\"hymne of liberation\\" for France. All music broadcasts would start and end with \\"Fleur de Paris\\". Between 1945 and 1949, Jacques H√©lian recorded more than 70 songs for Columbia Records, with C'est si bon in 1948 and Ma√Ætre Pierre in 1949 gaining international fame. \\"Place Pigalle\\" was written by Alex Alstone and recorded by Maurice Chevalier in 1946 with H√©lian's orchestra. He collaborated with composers like Henri Bourtayre (\\"Chanteville\\", \\"La Marchina\\", \\"Soleil levant\\") and Loulou Gast√© (\\"Le Porte-Bonheur\\", \\"Chica! Chica!\\", \\"Au Chili\\", \\"Les Pompiers du Mexique\\"). Jacques H√©lian's continued his highly-followed radio performances, and organized galas and musical tours throughout France with artists that gained big following after appearing with his orchestra including Francine Claudel, Zappy Max, Jo Charrier, Ginette Garcin and others. In 1947, a singer, guitarist and composer known as Jean Marco (real name Jean Marcopoulos), quickly became the signature voice of H√©lian's orchestra until his death in a road accident on 24 June 1953. Jean- Louis Tristan and Lou Darley succeeded Jean Marco and Claude Evelyne as lead singers. thumb H√©lian's \\"√âtoile des neiges\\" sung by \\"The H√©lians\\" female choir became one of his biggest successes ever with a gold accreditation. In 1951, he received the Grand Prix du Disque from Acad√©mie Charles Cros for his song \\"Tout est tranquille\\". Between 1949 and 1956, the best of French and European jazz artists paraded with his orchestra including Christian Garros, G√©rard L√©vecque, Andr√© Paquinet, George Cloud, Fernand Verstraete, Marcel Bianchi, Pierre Gossez, Janot Morales, Sadi, and from the other side of the Atlantic, jazzmen like Ernie Royal, Al Mone, Bill Tamper, Don Byas, Kenny Clarke and Sonny Grey, making his band one of the most known names of \\"big band\\" in Europe. His music was used in a number of films like C≈ìur de coq (1946), Pigalle-Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s (1950), Musique en t√™te (1951) and Tambour battant (1952). The permanent orchestra's grande finale was on 15 March 1957. He made various appearances until the beginning of the 1980s, but with much lesser following. His works are considered references for the best of \\"big band\\" orchestras in French music-hall. He died in Paris on 29 June 1986 at the age of 74. His works were featured as \\"Les Ann√©es Jacques H√©lian\\" in the film Vive la vie.

The purpose of the school was for giving young men the skills they needed to accomplish their chosen trade. It was a vocational school education for farmers, agriculturists, and other specialized trades of the nineteenth century. It provided the scientific and technical education needed for their vocation or to become schoolmasters.  History  Robert Hallowell Gardiner founded the school in 1822 on land with buildings he gave to the new school. The school was given statewide recognition when there was an Act (Chapter CXCIX) in addition to an Act to incorporate was passed in February 1823 by the state of Maine governor, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Maine, the president of the Bowdoin College, the president of the Waterville College and others called the Board of Visitors. The directors of the Gardiner Lyceum school were men associated with higher education. The first principal and main instructor of the school was Benjamin Hale (president of Hobart College and a future professor at Dartmouth College). The next principal was a professor of Hamilton College of New York and later president of the State universities of Missouri, Maryland, and Wisconsin. The next principal was a supreme judge in the state of New Hampshire. The next principal was a graduate of Brown University. Maine legislature provided the school with $2,000 in funds in 1823 when the school opened. The legislature provided the school with funds of $1,000 per year for six years starting in 1825. The first year in operation the school had twenty students. The school had 53 students in 1824. It had 120 students in 1825. In 1826 the student level fell off to only 55 pupils that included only 2 Gardiner native residents.  Name origin  Since the location of the new school was in Gardiner, Maine and it was a lyceum (vocational secondary school, not a high school or college), it took on the name \\"Gardiner Lyceum\\" (advanced technical schooling in the town of Gardiner).  Courses  The courses were designed for the realistic and useful applications of mathematics and science with emphasis on liberal and cultural subjects. They were mainly designed to make scientific farmers and skillful craftsmen. The main object of the courses of the Gardiner Lyceum was intended to be something between High School, preparatory agenda for entering into college, and a college or university education. Gardiner Lyceum was intended as a practical vocational school that prepared the students with an immediate trade (e.g. farming). The school was intended as a two-year agenda. The school was a lyceum, a secondary schooling that was more technical that High School and less scholarly than a college or university education. It was for trade training for immediate employment in the field of their choice. The courses of the school classes were in various fields of advanced mathematics, bookkeeping, surveying, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, chemistry, natural philosophy, and natural history. There were also courses in navigation and carpentry. The principal object of the lyceum was in establishing young men to be practical in running a farm profitable or do professionally whatever occupation they chose. The agricultural courses were designed to give future agriculturist the practical training of science upon which he could run a farm or be associated with farming in his trade. The school provided potential leads for employment in hopes of getting a return on its expenses in training the student. Laws of the Gardiner Lyceum and Regulations for its Government 1825  Laws of the Gardiner Lyceum and Regulations for its Government  There is a set of Laws printed in 1825 by P. Shelton on how the school was to be regulated - a copy held by the Library of Congress. In the Preface it gives the language It is almost unnecessary to add that this system is found not only to prepare young men for the real business of life, but to give them manliness of feeling and character.  Equipment  A stone building was built for the school. There was fourteen acres of land provided for agriculture training for those students that were going to become farmers and of agricultural occupations. The land was on the Kennebec River in Gardiner and worth about $4,000 at the time. The school had available to the pupils, besides books, a workshop at no cost to them which consisted of circular saws, models, minerals, and specimens in natural history. The school additionally provided modern equipment and tools for training.  Demise  The school struggled financially for 6 years from 1826 until it closed in 1832 for various reasons, but mostly due to lack of funds that it needed to continue running. Mr. Gardiner, the founder, then had to close the school.  Legacy  The concept of teaching \\"scientific farming\\" was first started by the Gardiner Lyceum. In the United States about a thousand similar schools teaching this concept were in place a decade later.
