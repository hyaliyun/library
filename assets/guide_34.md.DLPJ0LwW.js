It was planned to have two tubes, four lanes, and would be long. It would shorten the distance of European Road 16 (E16) between Bergen and Arna by . Currently E16 runs north from Arna to √Ösane as a limited-access road and then runs concurrently with E39 as a four-lane motorway to the city center, a distance of . By building a tunnel directly from Arna to the city centre, this distance would be reduced to . Alternatively, cars can drive via County Road 580 via Nesttun, which is to the city center, but this road has much lower standard than E16. The Arna Tunnel would allow a 15-minute reduction in travel time for all cars running from the city centre and from Bergen West, including Ask√∏y and Sotra, eastwards, including the main routes to Oslo. It would also give the same time saving for transport for commuter from Arna, Voss, parts of Hardanger and Oster√∏y, and would remove the need for the ferry from Oster√∏y, as all of Oster√∏y could use the Oster√∏y Bridge. In contrast to the roadway, the Bergen Line runs through the mountain in the Ulriken Tunnel, and the Norwegian State Railways operate a service with the Bergen Commuter Rail between Bergen Station and Arna Station every 30 minutes. The Norwegian National Rail Administration is planning to expand the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, which would allow increased traffic on the whole Bergen Line and a 15-minute headway on the Bergen‚ÄìArna service. The construction is scheduled for completion in 2016. An alternative has been to build a branch of the Bergen Light Rail to Arna through its own tunnel through Ulrikken. Nyg√•rdstangen acts as the main interchange in the city center, and distributes traffic between the city centre, traffic westwards along National Road 555 via the Nyg√•rd Tunnel, southwards along E39 along the Nyg√•rd Bridge and northwards along E39 and E16 through the Fl√∏yfjell Tunnel. By 2015, it is estimated that the interchange would have 97,000 vehicles per day if the Arna Tunnel is not built, and 114,000 vehicles per day if the Arna Tunnel is built. This exceeds the interchange's capacity, and would result in severe congestion. A possible remedy is to build both the Arna Tunnel and extend the Fl√∏yfjell Tunnel to the planned Minde Tunnel, which would run from Fj√∏sanger to Danmarksplass. This would require the Arna Tunnel to be built after the Minde Tunnel, the latter which is not included in any plans until 2019. If the Arna Tunnel is built, buses operating to Arna would probably continue through the tunnel to the city centre, thus ending the commuter train service. This would give an increased number of buses through the city centre, which is already experiencing bus congestion. The Ulriken Tunnel is being expanded to double track during 2016-2020 which instead will increase the train traffic. The Road administration has decided not to build to build the Arna Tunnel, instead build a Ring road East around 2030-2035. It will be a 4 lane road east of the Ulriken mountain, bypassing the city Bergen, and including a shorter tunnel at Fj√∏sanger and eastwards.

Camping is allowed in these places only. For heating a backpacking stove must be brought along, even though wood stoves are available in some places. Open fires are prohibited. Use of campgrounds must be planned in advance.Parks Canada, Designated Camping Campgrounds =Finnegan's Point= This campground is located adjacent to the Taiya River while the valley is still relatively flat. The mosquitoes are very bad at Finnegan's Point partly due to its location and the abundance of standing water. The campsite itself includes a canvas warming and cooking shelter with mosquito screens, a bear pole and a bear-proof food storage locker, an outhouse, and ample tent sites. Finnegan's Point often takes in very few hikers because of its proximity to the trailhead, and most parties pass Finnegan's Point within a few hours. However, for slower parties and those with a late start on the trail, Finnegan's Point is often the campground of choice. The campground receives its name from Pat Finnegan, who enterprised to collect bridge-crossing tolls from stampeders. Finnegan's Point consisted of a \\"huddle of tents surrounding a hard core of blacksmith shop, saloon, and a restaurant.\\" =Canyon City= The second-largest campground on the American side of the trail. It is located next to small tributary of the Taiya River. Canyon City includes a log cabin with a wood stove and several bunks (although sleeping is not permitted inside park shelters), several shelves for cooking, and a small porch for drying gear. Canyon City includes more than 30 campsites and two outhouses as well as food lockers and bear poles. =Pleasant Camp= Pleasant Camp This is the smallest of the campgrounds on the American side of the trail. It is located next to a sandbar in the Taiya River and consists of a canvas warming and cooking shelter, a small number of campsites, and a bear pole. Pleasant Camp usually serves as a spillover campsite if Sheep Camp is full. There is a sign near the cooking shelter notifying backpackers whether Sheep Camp is at capacity or can still take backpackers. =Sheep Camp= Sheep Camp shelters, ranger giving trail briefing, Aug 2016 This is the largest of the American campsites. It is located adjacent to a braided Taiya River. Occasionally avalanches, rockslides, or exceptional rains, will flood Sheep Camp. Sheep Camp consists of three canvas shelters, a small cache used by the trail crew, outhouses, and over 40 campsites. A large (bigger than all three canvas shelters combined) post-and-beam picnic pavilion is currently (Aug 2016) being built adjacent to the shelters. The only U.S. Ranger Station on the trail is located just a few hundred meters south of Sheep Camp and the ranger during the official season gives a nightly presentation on the history of the pass and current weather and trail conditions. From Sheep Camp many hikers leave early in the morning‚Äîas early as 4 a.m.‚Äîfor the summit push into Canada. During the official hiking season the park ranger stationed just south of Sheep Camp gives a quick presentation outlining the route over the pass, the weather forecast, and snow conditions. Rangers recommend 7.5 to 10 hours for a group to travel from Sheep Camp to Happy Camp. =Happy Camp= Happy Camp in the early season, 2004 Happy Camp is the only campground on the Chilkoot Trail in the alpine. A very small wooden warming cabin, an outhouse, and a modest number of campsites are all available at this campsite. Happy Camp owes its name to the relief prospectors (and hikers) experienced from arriving at the first outpost after the pass. The camp is situated in a true alpine ecosystem and receives heavy use because of its location. =Deep Lake= Deep Lake is one of only two campgrounds on the trail without permanent or semi-permanent shelter. Deep Lake includes an outside cooking area, bear proof lockers for food, and a small number of campsites. It is notable, however, for its scenic location, between the indigo hues of Long and Deep Lakes. =Lake Lindeman= Lake Lindeman campground, 2004 The largest campground on the Canadian side. It includes separate north and south campsites, a small cluster of buildings for the trail warden and trail crew, a dock and Parks Canada powerboat, a canvas shelter containing a museum of photographs and small library on the outdoors and Klondike history, and a web of trails leading among the remains of the old town. The north and south campsites each include a large wooden cabin that serves as a cooking and warming shelter, numerous bear poles, and several picnic tables. The campsite is located on the site of what was Lindeman City during the gold rush: a cemetery of deceased prospectors from the gold rush era remains, as well as numerous foundations, former fire rings, old latrine holes, the ruts of Lindeman City's main street, and a plethora of artifacts ranging from broken wine and beer bottles to tin cans. Lake Lindeman hosts a small tent museum containing photographic displays and a small library of books on the Chilkoot, the outdoors, and other Canadian parks. =Bare Loon Lake= Bare Loon Lake Camp cooking shelter 2016 Bare Loon Lake is the second campground without semi-permanent shelter, though it now includes a pavilion-style cooking shelter. Located on a small ridge above Lake Lindeman in a pine forest and overlooking the Bare Loon Lake, the campground is one of the most beautiful on the trail. It includes two outhouses, a helicopter pad, and food lockers. =Bennett= This camp is the end of the trail. Several structures maintained by the White Pass and Yukon Route are clustered around the tracks, as well as a private First Nations residence. The campground is relatively small and includes bear poles, picnic tables, and an outhouse.

Mr. and Mrs. Kellner have supported educational activities in the Czech Republic through their foundation for over 15 years, and over this time they have disbursed over CZK 1.2 billion. History The Foundation was established in 2009 and provided 9 million CZK to aid several municipalities after the floods of 2010. In 2011, the Foundation reported that it had been merged with the Educa foundation in 2011. According to the media, the Foundation has donated in total CZK 91 million during the year 2013. In 2014, the Foundation exceeded that amount by granting over CZK 97 million. In 2017, the Foundation has donated almost CZK 88 million. In 2018, the Foundation has donated CZK 88 million. In 2019, the Foundation has donated CZK 89,5 million. Description The Kellner Family Foundation focuses on improving the quality of education at public primary school in the Czech Republic, namely through its Helping Schools Succeed project. It also supports financially disadvantaged students of the Open Gate grammar school which is located in Babice, a town near Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic. The Foundation‚Äôs ‚ÄúUniversities‚Äù project also provides grants to Czech students to study at universities in the Czech Republic and abroad. The Foundation has also made generous donations to individuals and institutions working on projects focused on health, educational and cultural activities. The Foundation channels its efforts into four major projects: *The ‚ÄúOpen Gate‚Äù project supports academically-gifted children from foster homes, broken families or otherwise challenging socio- economic environments by providing them with education and accommodation at the 8-year grammar school of the same name. Since the school‚Äôs establishment in 2005, about one-half of its students have received full or partial grants from the Foundation. The Foundation grants around CZK 40 million annually. Hundreds of students have studied or continue to study at the Open Gate School thanks to grants from The Kellner Family Foundation. To date, 442 students have benefited from grants exceeding a total of CZK 615 million. *Similar to Open Gate is the ‚ÄúUniversities‚Äù project that grants money for school fees, travel costs and living expenses to talented students so that they can study at universities abroad and in the Czech Republic. Thanks to these grants, around 50 students leave the country to study abroad, or get support to enroll at Czech universities and other higher education institutions annually. In the academic year 2012/2013 the group of 50 students has been granted funds. In the academic year 2014/2015 the grants have been provided to the group of 57 students. In the academic year 2019/2020 the grants have been provided to the group of 61 students. *Helping Schools Succeed is a project that provides selected elementary schools with funds to improve the qualifications of their teachers and principals. The Foundation currently works with more than 860 teachers and, through them, supports more than 9,500 students. *The Science project supported the work of Czech oncology researchers. Multi-year grants were allocated to exceptional scientists with successful international backgrounds and also to talented researchers who had just started their careers, including fresh graduates from medical or natural science faculties. In 2013, the first three research groups received grants for 4‚Äì5 years whose overall sum totalled CZK 8.5m. Within the next five years, the Foundation was projected to provide around CZK 38m in grants and financial support. To date, grants have been given to three teams of researchers. One team, led by Jan Br√°bek from Charles University‚Äôs Faculty of Science in on the Analysis of the Plasticity of Cancer Cell Invasiveness. The other two teams are led by Jaroslav Truksa from the Institute of Biotechnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague, and Ji≈ô√≠ Bartek, who heads a laboratory at the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen, Denmark.

It first aired on September 19, 2011. Plot Marshall is still hungover after Punchy's wedding, and makes a \\"sweeping declaration\\" that he will henceforth permanently stay sober. Future Ted says that Marshall's \\"sweeping declarations\\" typically do not work. Marshall receives a call from Garrison Cootes, a partner at one of the nation's largest environmental law firms. He tells Marshall that the company is interested in Marshall's application for employment, and he will receive a job offer after the company completes an extensive background check. The danger of a background check concerns Marshall, who fears that a college-era video of him streaking through Wesleyan calling himself \\"Beercules\\", which is now available online, could result in Garrison dropping the job offer. Marshall contacts the uploader, Pete Durkenson, an old college acquaintance, and asks him to remove the video. However, Marshall ends up getting drunk and streaking again after inadvertently playing Edward Fortyhands with Pete, and thus another \\"Beercules\\" video is uploaded. Pete's refusal to take it down prompts Lily to blackmail him with information that she claims to have received from women who dated him in college. Eventually, Garrison does see the video, but offers Marshall a job anyway; the video is not an issue with him. Later, Pete calls Marshall and offers to remove the video, but Marshall refuses. Thinking about a date with Nora, Barney appears to the gang in a leg cast and using crutches; he hopes to use these to gain Nora's sympathy. He meets Nora at a 24-hour diner, where he is forced to explain to her all the plays he ever made on women, one of which irks a woman in an adjoining booth who overhears the conversation; she turns out to be one of Barney's previous conquests. Nora leaves, still angry at Barney for lying to her. To prove to Nora that he will never lie to her again, Barney vows not to leave the diner until she agrees to a second date. The gang eats at the diner nine hours later and sees Barney wake up. He refuses to make an order several times, and true to his word, does stay at the diner the whole time, which convinces Nora when she comes back. Ted capitalizes on being featured in New York magazine, speaking to women at newsstands when they pick up a copy of the magazine. He befriends 16 people, 13 of them being women, and dates two women from amongst them on separate occasions. With Lily's and Robin's help, he must decide on one of the women as a date to the exclusive \\"Architect's Ball\\". Robin thinks that the event will be boring, but hints that she would like to become Ted's date when he mentions that Lenny Kravitz will be at the event, since she is an avid fan of the rock star. Ted winds up taking Robin to the gala, where she discovers that the Lenny Kravitz Ted was referring to is an old architect, Leonard Kravitz. Disappointed, Robin leaves the party. Future Ted tells his kids that a person will know for sure about falling in love \\"pretty quickly and with absolute certainty.\\" While looking at the gala guests, he sees his former girlfriend Victoria arranging cupcakes at a table and they establish eye contact.

Tranv√≠a de Tenerife. Trams in Spain go back to an animal-drawn Madrid tramway network, which opened in 1871. Steam tramway traction started in Spain in 1879, and electric trams first operated in 1899. Spanish tramway networks were dismantled in the 1960s and 1970s, but have gradually been reintroduced since 1994. At present, there are plans to add 13 new Spanish tram networks to the nine currently operating.  History  The history of tramways in Spain began with animal-drawn trams in the nineteenth century, in Madrid (1871), Barcelona and Bilbao (1872), Valencia (1876), Valladolid (1881), Zaragoza (1885), Sevilla (1887) and Palma de Mallorca (1891). In 1879, the Madrid-Legan√©s tramway began working with steam traction, and in 1899 the first electrified line ran. In Barcelona, steam traction was introduced in 1877 (at Sant Andreu), and the first electrified line in 1899. The first Spanish city to introduce an electric tram service was Bilbao, with the line Bilbao-Santurtzi, electrified in 1896 and managed by a predecessor of the current Transportes Colectivos. Steam trams began running in Valencia in 1892 and the first line was electrified in 1900. In Zaragoza, the Torrero line was electrified in 1902, and electric trams came to Palma de Mallorca in 1916. Valladolid network was totally electrified in 1911. In many other cities, trams were common through much of the twentieth century. However, they were dismantled in the 1960s and 1970s, on the basis that they obstructed traffic on the streets of large cities. Then, in the late twentieth century, they were once again considered and, in some cities, began running again.  Today's tramway networks  Spanish cities with tramway networks. Valencia was the first Spanish city to reintroduce the tram, in 1994. The success of the modern tramway network in Valencia led to the extension of its lines on three occasions. After Valencia came Bilbao (2002), Alicante (2003), Barcelona (2004) and, in October 2006, the inauguration of the 4.7 km long V√©lez-M√°laga Tram (which linked V√©lez-M√°laga with the coastal part of Torre del Mar). These lines were followed by the Metro Ligero de Madrid (2007), in the Madrid districts of Sanchinarro and las Tablas (ML-1), and linking the capital with Boadilla del Monte and Pozuelo de Alarc√≥n (ML2, ML3). Then came Seville, where a tramway network named MetroCentro has been running since spring 2007, Tenerife (2007), Murcia (2007), the Madrid suburb of Parla (2007) and Vitoria (2008). In Tenerife, the tramway is operated by the company Metropolitano de Tenerife. It runs through and connects the cities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, and has a fleet of 26 Alstom Citadis trams. Line 1 (Santa Cruz interchange)‚ÄìAvda. Trinidad (La Laguna) opened on 2 June 2007. The line connecting the two neighborhoods of Tincer (Santa Cruz) and La Cuesta (La Laguna) followed on 30 May 2009. In Zaragoza, the commercial service began on 19 April 2011. The Ja√©n Tram opened in 2011 but was closed a few weeks after service began.  Projects  Modern Euskotran tram in Abandoibarra, Bilbao. In Spain, 13 tram networks are currently planned to be added to the nine already operating. New projects, in Cadiz, Cordoba and Toledo, total in length and two billion euros in investment. Active construction on the Tranv√≠a Metropolitano de Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra has been taking place since 2007, along with lines in Dos Hermanas and Mairena del Aljarafe. Other networks are proposed for Granada, Jerez de la Frontera, C√≥rdoba, Huelva, Pamplona, Almeria, Le√≥n, Elche, Burgos, Salamanca, Toledo, Palma de Mallorca, Leioa-Sestao, Baracaldo, el Alto Deva. There have also been plans to install a tramway in Oviedo (a project to implement this mode of transport, by the PSOE, was discarded after the PP defeated it at an election). In addition, Madrid is expanding its LRT (light rail) network on its outskirts. Finally, an historic tramway has been operating in the city of A Coru√±a since 1997, following additions and alterations to the road.

Naturally found in open forest, it grows as a small shrub 1‚Äì2 m high with highly pinnate leaves reminiscent of parsley. The white inflorescences appear in summer. Description Lomatia silaifolia is a small upright shrub which grows high with glaucous smooth stems. It has highly pinnate leaves which can vary in appearance and are reminiscent of parsley. They are up to long. The white inflorescences appear in summer and are up to high.Lomatia silaifolia flower detail Taxonomy English botanist James Edward Smith first described this species as Embothrium silaifolium in 1793. At the time, Embothrium was a wastebasket taxon to which many proteaceae were assigned. It was given its current binomial name by Robert Brown in his 1810 On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae. An alternative name, Tricondylus silaifolius, published by Joseph Knight in his 1809 On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, was rejected, after Brown's 1810 description of the genus Lomatia was officially conserved against Salisbury's 1809 Tricondylus. The species name is derived from resemblance of the leaves to the parsley genus Silaum. An early common name applied in England was sulphur-wort-leaved lomatia. Other common names include crinkle bush, parsley fern, wild parsley, and fern-leaved lomatia. Hybrids with L. fraseri and L. myricoides have been recorded. Analysis of chloroplast DNA showed that there is extensive hybridization between the five species (L. arborescens, L. fraseri, L. ilicifolia, L. myricoides and L. silaifolia) of mainland southeastern Australia, though each is distinct enough to warrant species status. Distribution and habitat Lomatia silaifolia is found across much of eastern Australia east of the Great Dividing Range, on the Blackdown Tableland in central Queensland, then from Gympie in the south-east of the state to the New England area of north-eastern New South Wales, and then also from the Hunter Region to Jervis Bay in central New South Wales. It grows as an understory shrub in open forest on sandstone soils, associated with such trees as red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), narrow-leaved peppermint (E. radiata), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata), red stringybark (E. macrorhyncha), grey gum (E. punctata), scribbly gum (E. sclerophylla), smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) or rose sheoak (Allocasuarina torulosa). Ecology Plants are thought to live for over 60 years and regenerate after bushfire by resprouting from the base. The leaves are eaten by swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor). Calves are thought to have died after eating it, and cut flowers kept indoors have been reported to attract and kill flies. Positive cyanide reactions have been recorded for the anthers, styles and stigmas. Use in horticulture Lomatia silaifolia was trialled in cultivation in England in 1808, though noted to flower rarely and require a greenhouse. The unusual leaves and fruits of the species make it a suitable garden feature. It can be easily propagated from seed, is hardy in most soils and aspects.

Fatai's father was a drummer, and he was trained to follow that trade. He studied at St. James Anglican Primary School, Ogbaagba (1964‚Äì1969), then at Catholic Commercial Secondary Modern School, Iwo (1970‚Äì1973). Between 1973 and 1974 he worked as a pharmaceutical salesman in Lagos, before returning to study at Catholic Technical College, Ile-Ife (1975‚Äì1978). He qualified as a Civil Engineer. Early career Akinbade was appointed a member of the board of Delta Steel Company in Aladja, Delta State, and was Chairman of the company's Finance and Multipurpose Committee. Akinbade joined the Osun State government, working for over sixteen years under three military administrators and then under the civilian governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola. In 2003 he was appointed Secretary to the state by Olagunsoye Oyinlola. In 2004 Fatai Akinbade was chosen as the leader of the Party in the Iwo Federal Constituency. Governorship candidacy bid Akinbade announced his plan to run in the PDP primaries for state governor in February 2010. Eventually fourteen others announced their candidacy. In an interview in March 2010 he rejected the argument that it was the turn of Ife/Ijesha to present the next governor of the state. In June 2010 his bid was given public support by several traditional rulers in the Ife region of the state, including the Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade. However, Akinbade's bid was opposed by party leadership. They directed all the state council chairmen to back Senator Iyiola Omisore, whose election as Senator for Osun East had been annulled in October 2009. The April 2011 election did not take place. In November 2010 the Federal Appeal Court, Ibadan declared that the April 2007 election of Olagunsoye Oyinlola was invalid, and in his place declared that Rauf Aregbesola of the Action Congress of Nigeria was the winner. Aregbesola was to serve for the next four years.

Before his solo act, he was a lead singer in various bands, most notably Grupo Tradi√ß√£o. His biggest national and international hit is \\"Ai Se Eu Te Pego\\", a number one in most European countries and Latin America. Tel√≥'s artistic career began in 1987 when, as a six-year-old, he made his first solo performance in his school choir, singing a piece by Roberto Carlos and Erasmo Carlos. At ten, his musical talent blossomed when his father gave him an accordion. At age 12, upon encouragement by neighbors, school friends and his brothers, he formed a young band for playing traditional music, which was called \\"Guri\\" and served to strengthen Tel√≥ taste in music in a professional organized manner. He was the band's lead singer and composer. Besides his love for the harmonica, Tel√≥ also took piano lessons for five years. He was also dancer and played the accordion, harmonica, and guitar. Grupo Tradi√ß√£o (1997‚Äì2008) In 1997, Tel√≥ was just 16 when he was invited to join the band Grupo Tradi√ß√£o, making part of the band for 11 years as lead vocals until 2008. His career as a singer took off as he sang the band's biggest hits, such as \\"Barquinho\\", \\"O Caldeir√£o\\", \\"Pra Sempre Minha Vida\\", \\"A Brasileira\\", and \\"Eu Quero Voc√™.\\" During such period of time, he was the band's front figure, conducting most of the interviews and promotions. According to Tel√≥'s former producer Wagner, he left without creating any enmity or hard feelings, as Tel√≥ made clear that he wanted to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Guilherme Bertoldo, but the band had lost most of its appeal due to his departure and soon members began to quit the band, not having enough trust in the viability of the band without Tel√≥. Solo career (2008‚Äìpresent) Michel Tel√≥ live The album Balada Sertaneja was released in 2009 by Brazilian record label Som Livre. It was produced by Ivan Myazato and resulted in two singles: \\"Ei, psiu! Beijo me liga\\", a great commercial success, and \\"Amanh√£ sei l√°\\".

Throughout 2011, Tel√≥ played over 240 shows. According to Forbes magazine, Tel√≥'s Fugidinha Tour was attended by more than 17 million people and Tel√≥ has reportedly made $18 million alone in 2011. Tel√≥ has also released two DVDs, one containing songs from the 1980s and 1990s, in collaboration with Milion√°rio & Jos√© Rico, Bruno e Marrone, and Jo√£o Bosco & Vin√≠cius, and the other, entitled Michel Na Balada, including new songs.

Although Therapy is Lea's first solo album, he had previously released material as singles under various pseudonyms since the early 1980s.Cum On Feel The Noize! The Story of Slade by Alan Parker & Steve Grantley (2006) Background After the disbanding of Slade in 1992, Lea entered the property business in 1993 and went on to study psychotherapy in 1997, although he did not take it up as a career. In 1998, he began writing and recording material again. However, beyond the release of the \\"I'll Be John, You Be Yoko\\" single in 2000, the material would remain unreleased as Lea was unsure of how to get the material released to the public. In 2000, Lea put his music plans on hold to care for his father, who died in 2002. That year, Lea performed a charity show \\"Jim Jam\\" at the Robin 2 club in Bilston and afterwards, in 2003, he decided to record a solo album. The first demos for the album had been made around the time of his father's death. Titled Therapy, Lea arranged a meeting with Slade's former record label Polydor, however he decided to cancel after he felt that the label would not understand the project. Wishing to avoid conventional marketing strategies and the pressure to tour to promote the album, Lea decided to release Therapy independently in 2007. On his official website, Lea stated: Song information In 2007, \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" was rated eight out of ten by the magazine The Last Word.http://a4.l3-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/97/ca8587a0e67d4b6ff081b1429d99404b/l.jpg The song \\"Big Family\\" was originally recorded in 2000 by Belgian boy-band Mama's Jasje under the title \\"Samen Door Het Vuur\\". \\"Dead Rock U.K.\\" references numerous musicians, mainly from the 1970s, including Marc Bolan, Freddie Mercury, Phil Lynott, John Lennon and John Bonham. During Lea's 2002 live performance at the Robin, he revealed that \\"Go Out in Style\\" was written about Keith Moon, the drummer of the English rock group The Who. The album contains a version of \\"Universe\\", a song that was written by Lea for Slade and released as a single in 1991. The song was Slade's last single, failing to chart after it was lost in the Christmas rush that year. Robin 2 Live In 2002, Lea performed live for charity at the Robin 2 venue in Bilston. While most of the set-list contained covers, Lea performed two original songs that would appear on Therapy; \\"Great Big Family\\" and \\"Over the Moon\\", with the latter being re-titled \\"Go Out in Style\\". The entire Robin 2 gig was originally released in 2007 as a download on Lea's official site. Later in 2009, the gig was added as a bonus disc on a double CD edition of \\"Therapy\\". Although it contained the entire set-list of his main performance, it did not feature the encore tracks: \\"Get Down and Get with It\\", \\"Teddy Bears Picnic\\", \\"Johnny B. Goode\\", \\"Gudbuy T'Jane\\", \\"Twist and Shout\\", and \\"Purple Haze\\". During the concert, Lea performed covers of Slade hits \\"Cum On Feel the Noize\\", \\"Mama Weer All Crazee Now\\", \\"Far Far Away\\", \\"Gudbuy T'Jane\\" and \\"Get Down and Get with It\\". Release Therapy was originally released in 2007 as a 13-track CD and digital release on Jim Jam Records. Although no singles were released from the album, the opening track \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" appeared on the promotional CD Now Hear This! 54, distributed free with Word magazine. In 2009, the album was released as a double CD to include the Robin 2 gig on the second disc. In 2016, the album was re-issued as a double CD by Wienerworld. In addition to the altered colour of the sleeve, the re-issue featured three previously unreleased bonus tracks: \\"21st Century Thing?\\", \\"Thank God It's Friday Right Now\\" and \\"Am I the Greatest Now?\\" The 16-page booklet contained new liner notes from Lea, as well as memories of the Robin 2 gig by owner Mike Hamblett. A vinyl edition of Therapy was also released by Wienerworld in November 2016. It featured an additional three bonus tracks, two of which were previously unreleased: \\"Misty Morning Light\\" and \\"Dare to Be Great\\". The other bonus track, \\"I'll Be John, You Be Yoko\\" was released in 2000 as a single under the name \\"Whild\\". Track listing Critical reception =Original release= Upon release, Bubblegum Slut said: \\"Therapy is an appropriately named, open-hearted, on-the-couch record from a man whose public persona has always been rather one dimensional. As a result there seems to be something of a watershed here; different styles and ideas are crammed in hectically and most songs feature some candid emotional outpouring. Therapy is a record which raises a lot of issues for its author - listen only if you're prepared for some seriously thought provoking pop.\\" The Last Word described the album as a \\"fantastic solo record\\" and commented: \\"Of all the things I didn't expect to enjoy this year, a solo album by the guy who used to play bass in Slade was right up there at the top. It's been 16 years since Lea's last album but on this evidence he's kept up with both pop and rock. Especially if it's the sort of pop and rock that owes its very existence to Slade. A truly surprising pleasure.\\" Robin Dart of Subba-Cultcha said: \\"Wonderfully crafted songs, it is an album in the true sense. On Therapy, James Whild Lea showcases his song- writing ability, by penning the kind of songs which are quite simply really well written. In a world of mediocre songwriters pushing albums on more style than substance this record harks back to the Paul McCartneys of song-writing, welding effective melodies to imaginative arrangements, and it is quite simply a joy.\\"http://www.subba-cultcha.com/album-reviews/article.php?contentID=4464 Classic Rock stated: \\"Jimmy Lea was always the most enigmatic, talented and attractive member of Slade. Now pursuing a successful career as a therapist, his solo album seems to be more a labour of love than a stab at a comeback. Virtually a one man show a la Todd Rundgren/Roy Wood, Lea doesn't hide his influences, lyrically it's a universe away from the dyslexic musical football chants of his former employees. It's a treasure trove of lo-fi nuggets. And any album that name checks John Bonham and Phil Lynott in one verse has got to be worth the price of admission. Commendable and inspiring.\\" Trucking magazine wrote: \\"OK, it's definitely not Slade Mk II - and it's not even The Dummies Mk II. It's light years from \\"Cum On Feel the Noize\\" but is not easy to pigeonhole, being a collection of tracks that are clearly the work of a multi- talented one-man band a la Roy Wood. Broadly speaking, it's a great album to listen to - and \\"listen\\" is the key word. You get the feeling these are personal lyrics, a genuine labour of love in both words and music - and because of that, maybe not necessarily a serious comeback in terms of chart success, but more a case of \\"doing what I like, how I like it\\". Jim promises more in the future and I personally can't wait.\\" =2016 re-issue= Chris Roberts of Classic Rock wrote: \\"...he addresses his midlife crises with bold, ambitious pop songs, the scale of which suggest a Midlands Todd Rundgren or Brian Wilson. Lyrically stretching, they trade in solid rock tropes, which he's adept enough to re-energise, although once or twice you're not sure if he's aping or parodying Oasis. The live album gives you all the Slade rock- outs you need, but Therapy itself is a more thoughtful bag of thrills.\\" Kevin Bryan of Lancashire Telegraph said: \\"The studio offering showcases a generous helping of the melodic Beatles influenced rock which became Slade's trademark during their glory years in the early seventies, whilst the concert package serves up an appealing assortment of golden oldies and covers, including loving revamps of such unlikely bedfellows as The Fab Four's \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and the Sex Pistols' \\"Pretty Vacant\\" to name but a few.\\" Shindig! commented: \\"For an album composed and recorded while Lea undertook a psychology course, what could have been an indulgent album, full of introspective navel-gazing, is actually a blast. Despite the preoccupation with self-exploration the album is full of brash and ballsy songs, with hooks and killer choruses aplenty. It seems the man cannot help writing belting pop-rock tunes, and can also knock out a pretty decent piano ballad (\\"Smile of Elvis\\").\\" Speaking of the 2002 Robin live disc, the review added: \\"Tearing through an incendiary covers-heavy set, the self-confessed \\"miserable one\\" from Slade sounds like he's having fun. Revelatory and immensely enjoyable.\\"Shindig! magazine - issue 61 - 2016 Ray Harper of Total Music said: \\"...he did record some songs that really deserved a larger audience (\\"Deadrock UK\\" could've graced any classic Mott album and \\"Go Out in Style\\" is only a Noddy vocal short of prime time Slade). A second live CD addition makes this a good time to check this out.\\" Steven Reid of Fireworks wrote: \\"Jim Lea was always a superb songwriter and with Therapy, he may [have] delivered his most consistent set of songs ever which is high praise indeed.\\" Ian Abrahams of R2 (Rock'n'Reel) commented: \\"Don't expect something in line with Slade. This gorgeous album, luscious in sound and beautifully written and played has a resonance and depth to it. It's such an immediately likeable work, songs with memorable hooks, layered with great instrumentation and inhabited by haunting and heartfelt lyrics. Its great frustration is that it's a one-off, that since its original website release there's not been anything else. You'll want more.\\" Jim Stewart of Beat said: \\"When I was about to listen to Therapy, I had no real expectations, just a hope that it didn't try to recreate too much of the sound of the old band, and fortunately it doesn't. In fact it's a good listen, with the 'Live' bonus disc brilliant. An interesting package of solid productions, plus a great live set, what more could you want.\\" Personnel * Jim Lea - vocals, all musical instruments (except where noted), strings * Mark Viner Stuart - recording, mixing engineer, drumage, extra percussion * Trevor Hallesy - recording and mixing on \\"Universe\\", additional engineering * Paul Hodson - pre-production * John Astley - mastering * Heidi Bowdler - French Horns * Vicky Adams - Oboes * Rob Adams - Trumpet * Andrew Kosinkski - extra violin on \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" * Graham Carter - all Cellos * Tony Clarkin - singalong assistance on \\"The Valley of the Kings\\" * Paul Hudson - backing vocals on \\"Big Family\\" and \\"Time and Emotion\\" * Andrew Sadowski - drums on \\"Deadrock U.K.\\" * Alan Barrow - cover photography References Category:2007 debut albums ","title":"Therapy (James Whild Lea album)"},{"id":"33150594","text":"1\\\\.

He was noted in his early political career as a champion of universal suffrage, social welfare, labor unions, women's rights and Pan- Asianism. pages 161‚Äì184 Biography Nagai was born in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, where his father had been a samurai in the service of the Maeda clan. Nagai studied at a middle school run by Doshisha University and the Kansei Gakuen and converted to Unitarianism in 1901. He was a devout Christian, and read the Bible every day. He studied at the School of Politics and Economics at Waseda University, where he was highly influenced by Abe Isoo and the concept of \\"Christian-Socialism\\" and with Abe's assistance he secured a scholarship to study at Manchester College within Oxford University in England for further studies. He returned to graduate from Waseda with a degree in Colonial Studies, and with the assistance of ≈åkuma Shigenobu obtained a post there as a teacher. He also edited Shin Nippon, a monthly magazine that was a mouthpiece for Okuma's political views. In 1912, Nagai wrote optimistically about the possibility of large-scale Japanese settlement on under-developed agricultural lands in Korea. Nagai ran for a seat in the Lower House of the Diet during the 1917 General Election from the Kanazawa district, but was defeated by the Rikken Seiy≈´kai candidate Nakahashi Tokug≈çr≈ç by only 203 votes. For the 1920 General Election, Nakahashi changed his electoral district to Osaka, and Nagai was elected. He retained his seat over the next seven elections, eventually rising to the position of Secretary-General of the Rikken Minseit≈ç political party. Nagai was known for his strong oratory, combining ponderous speech with colorful or flamboyant phrases. (He was once censured by the Diet for making a congratulatory speech on the inauguration of Prime Minister Hara Takashi by comparing Hara‚Äôs victory to that of Lenin in the Soviet Union). page 280 In May 1932, Nagai was picked to be Minister of Colonial Affairs under the Sait≈ç administration, which he held until July 1934. In June 1937, he was selected to be Minister of Communications under the Konoe administration, until January 1939 and returned to the same post from August 1939 to January 1940 under the Abe administration. Also under the Abe administration, he served as Railroad Minister concurrently with his term as Minister of Communications. During his later career, Nagai became increasingly critical of what he perceived to be the racist and imperialistic designs of United States and United Kingdom on Asia, writing essays and issuing speeches on the \\"White Peril\\" and on the mission of Japan to protect China from the western powers and to liberate Asia from its European masters. A leading member of the pro-military clique within the Rikken Minseit≈ç, Nagai was a member of the League of Diet Members Carry Through the Holy War and a key supporter of Konoe‚Äôs plan to create a single-party state under the Taisei Yokusankai. Under the war-time regime, he was appointed a political bureau chief for Greater East Asia Development Board, and also founded the \\"Greater Japan Scholarship Foundation\\", the predecessor to the modern Japan Student Services Organization. In a speech in 1943, he promoted the concept of hakk≈ç ichiu as meaning the \\"universal brotherhood\\" of mankind, rather than imperial domination of the world by Japan. Nagai died in 1944, shortly after the Tokyo Air Raid. Michio Nagai, Minister of Education in the Miki administration was Nagai‚Äôs eldest son.

The LCP and its militia were members of the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and its successor, the Lebanese National Resistance Front (LNRF). Origins The LCP's military wing was not only well-organized, but also one of the largest secular and non- sectarian militias in Lebanon. It was first founded unofficially during the 1958 civil war, fighting alongside the anti-government forces against the Lebanese Army and the allied Christian militias. Disbanded upon the conclusion of the war, in early 1969 the Party's Politburo decided to quietly raise a new militia force ostensibly to help defend the border villages located in South Lebanon. The reality, however, was more complex. Like other political groups in Lebanon, the LCP realized in the early 1970s that without an armed militia it would lose its political relevance.Rabinovich, The war for Lebanon (1989), pp. 78-79. Thus the \\"Popular Guard\\" was officially established on January 6, 1970, ostensibly in response to the occupation of Kfar Kila and Houla villages in the Jabal Amel region of southern Lebanon and the kidnapping of local villagers by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF). Prior to the war, the Popular Guards initially received covert support from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the USSR, Syria, Iraq, Libya and from well-connected left- wing sympathizers in Jordan, and some Eastern Bloc Countries, such as East Germany. Furthermore, the LCP started sending its militiamen to training camps in Jordan under the control of the Palestinian Fatah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Jordanian Communist Party (JCP). Moreover, the LCP's links with the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP) and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP) led them to forge close ties with the Ba'athist Iraqi and Syrian Governments to help train militants and purchase high-tech soviet arms. Military structure and organization Initially made up of just 600-700 poorly armed militiamen,Makdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias. by mid-1976 the Popular Guard's ranks had swelled to some 5,000 men and women (though other sources list a smaller number, about 3,000),McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 242. this total comprising 2,000-2,500 full-time fighters and 2,500-3,000 irregulars, mostly drawn from its youth branch organization, the Union of Lebanese Democratic Youth (ULDY), which had been established in early 1970. Organized into infantry, signals, artillery, medical and Military Police 'branches', the LCP militia was first headed by the Greek-Catholic George Hawi (whose nom de guerre was Abu Anis), but in 1979 PG command was passed on to Elias Atallah, a Maronite. Although it was active mostly in West Beirut and Tripoli, the LCP/PG also kept underground cells at the Koura District, and the Sidon, Tyre and Nabatieh Districts of the Jabal Amel region of southern Lebanon. Illegal activities and controversy The LCP/PG was mainly financed by the USSR and Syria, though it also received revenues from other 'unofficial' sources within Lebanon. In the mid-1980s, allied with the Red Knights militia of the Alawite Arab Democratic Party (ADP), they helped the latter to control Tripoli's commercial harbour and oil refinery ‚Äì the second large deep-waters port of Lebanon ‚Äì in collusion with the director of the city‚Äôs harbour Ahmad Karami and corrupt Syrian Army officers. The National Fuel Company (NFC) headed jointly by businessmen Maan Karami (brother of late prime-minister Rachid Karami) and Haj Muhammad Awadah, run in their behalf a profitable fuel smuggling ring that stretched to the Beqaa Valley. The Popular Guards' in the 1975-1990 civil war After the return of George Hawi, the Popular Guard joined the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) ‚Äì PLO Joint Forces. The LCP militia was soon involved in many street battles against the Christian right-wing militias of the Lebanese Front. On October 24, 1975, the Popular Guards fought alongside other LNM militias such as the Al-Mourabitoun and the Nasserite Correctionist Mouvement (NCM), the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) and the PLO at the Battle of the Hotels in Downtown Beirut, where they engaged the Lebanese Front militias and the Army of Free Lebanon (AFL). Following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon of June 1982, the LCP/PG went underground, participating actively in the formation of the Lebanese National Resistance Front (LNRF) guerrilla alliance in September that year and later joining the LNSF in July 1983. They fought at the 1983-84 Mountain War allied with the Druze People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP), Al-Mourabitoun and Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) militias in the Chouf District and at West Beirut against the Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) militia, the Lebanese Army and the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF). When the War of the Camps broke out on May‚ÄìApril 1985 at West Beirut, it saw the LCP/PG participating ‚Äì albeit reluctantly ‚Äì in a military coalition that gathered the Druze PSP/PLA, and the Shia Muslim Amal Movement, backed by Syria,Stork, Joe. \\"The War of the Camps, The War of the Hostages\\" in MERIP Reports, No. 133.

In December 1986, the Popular Guards joined the Arab Democratic Party (ADP), SSNP and Ba'ath Party militias in another military coalition backed by the Syrian Army, which contributed to the decisive defeat of the Sunni Muslim Islamic Unification Movement (IUM; a.k.a. 'Tawheed') at the Battle of Tripoli.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 171. =Resistance to the Israeli occupation= On September 16, 1982, the Secretary-General of the LCP George Hawi and the Secretary-General of the OCAL Muhsin Ibrahim announced the creation of the LNRF, which rallied several Lebanese leftist and Pan-Arabist parties and armed factions to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. Popular Guard underground guerrilla cells continued to operate in the Jabal Amel after the end of the civil war, fighting until 2000 alongside the Shia Hezbollah and other Lebanese armed groups against the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and their South Lebanese Army (SLA) proxies in the Israeli-controlled \\"security zone.\\" List of combat operations * The 1958 civil war against right-wing Christian militias * The Battle of the Hotels (Part of 2 years war) against the Lebanese Front * The 1978 South Lebanon conflict against the Israeli Defence Forces * The 1982 Lebanon War and Siege of Beirut against the Israeli Defence Forces, the Lebanese Forces, and the South Lebanon Army * The Mountain War against the Lebanese Forces, the Lebanese Army and the Multinational Force in Lebanon * The Battle of Tripoli against the Islamic Unification Movement and other radical Islamist factions * The 2006 Lebanon War alongside Hezbollah and Amal movement against the Israeli Defence Forces Weapons and equipment The collapse of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF) in January 1976 allowed the LCP/PG to seize some weapons and vehicles from their barracks and police stations, though most of its weaponry, heavy vehicles and other, non-lethal military equipments were procured in the international black market or supplied by the PLO, Syria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and the USSR.Dunord, Liban: Les milices rendent leurs armes (1991), p. 31. =Pistols= *TT pistol *Makarov pistol *M1911A1 pistol *CZ 75 =Submachine guns= *≈†korpion vz. 61 *MP 40 =Carbines and Assault Rifles= *M1 Garand *StG 44 *Mosin‚ÄìNagant *MAS-49 rifle *SKS *AK-47 assault rifle (Other variants included the AKM, Zastava M70, AK-63, AK-74, AK-103, Chinese Type 56, Romanian AIM and former East German MPi assault rifles) *FN FAL *FN CAL *Heckler & Koch G3 *M16A1 =Machine guns and autocannons= *RPK Light machine gun *RPD Light machine gun *DP-28 Light machine gun *SG-43 Goryunov *PK General-purpose machine gun *Type 67 General- purpose machine gun *Rheinmetall MG 3 General-purpose machine gun *M1919A4 General-purpose machine gun *DShK 12.7 mm Heavy machine gun (Mainly mounted on Technicals) *NSV 12.7 mm Heavy machine gun taken off from disabled tanks (Mainly mounted on Technicals) *KPV 14.5 mm Heavy machine gun mounted on Technicals *ZPU (ZPU-1, ZPU-2, ZPU-4) 14.5 mm Anti-aircraft guns (Mainly mounted on Technicals)Kassis, Invasion of Lebanon 1982 (2019), p. 231. =Sniper rifles= *Dragunov SVD *PSL (rifle) *Gepard anti-materiel rifles *M40 rifle *Steyr SSG 69 *PTRS-41 14.5mm anti-tank rifle (used for heavy sniping) =Rocket launchers and grenade systems= *RPG-7 shoulder-launched, anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher *RPG-2 shoulder-launched, anti- tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher *Type 69 RPG shoulder-launched, anti- tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher *F1 hand grenade *RGD-5 hand grenade =Mortars= *M2 mortar =Artillery= *B-10 recoilless rifleKassis, Invasion of Lebanon 1982 (2019), p. 230. *M40 recoilless rifle (mounted on Technicals) *122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30) *Type 63 multiple rocket launcher (mounted on Technicals) *BM-21 Grad 122 mm multiple rocket launcher =Vehicles= *Technicals (Jeep CJ-5 and CJ-8,Neville, Technicals: Non- Standard Tactical Vehicles from the Great Toyota War to modern Special Forces (2018), p. 9.

Origins The English words \\"Wales\\" and \\"Welsh\\" derive from the same Old English root (singular , plural ), a descendant of Proto-Germanic *Walhaz, which was itself derived from the name of the Gaulish people known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire. The Old English- speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. The modern names for various Romance-speaking people in Continental Europe (e.g. Wallonia, Wallachia, , Vlachs, the German , and , the Polish name for Italy) have a similar etymology.Davies (1994) p. 71 Albert Henry, , 1990, 3rd ed. (1st ed. 1965), footnote 13 p. 86. Henry wrote the same about Wallachia. Historically in Britain, the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire). The modern Welsh name for themselves is , and is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi, meaning \\"fellow-countrymen\\".Davies (1994) p. 69 The use of the word as a self- designation derives from the location in the post-Roman Era (after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons) of the Welsh (Brythonic-speaking) people in modern Wales as well as in northern England and southern Scotland () (). It emphasised that the Welsh in modern Wales and in the were one people, different from other peoples. In particular, the term was not applied to the Cornish or the Breton peoples, who are of similar heritage, culture, and language to the Welsh. The word came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century. It is attested in a praise poem to (, by ) .Davies (1994) p. 71; the poem contains the line: 'Ar wynep Kymry Cadwallawn was'. In Welsh literature, the word was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples (including the Welsh) and was the more common literary term until . Thereafter prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until the word was spelt or , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian, Cambric and Cambria, survive as lesser-used alternative names for Wales, Welsh and the Welsh people. Examples include the Cambrian Mountains (which cover much of Wales and gave their name to the Cambrian geological period), the newspaper Cambrian News, and the organisations Cambrian Airways, Cambrian Railways, Cambrian Archaeological Association and the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art. Outside Wales, a related form survives as the name Cumbria in North West England, which was once a part of . The Cumbric language, which is thought to have been closely related to Welsh, was spoken in this area until becoming extinct around the 12th century.

His father, Richard More, was master of Linley, an estate near Bishop‚Äôs Castle close to the Welsh border. Samuel More was the husband of Katherine More, whose father, Jasper More, was master of Larden, a 1000-acre estate between Much Wenlock and Ludlow in Shropshire, England. In 1959 the mystery of why Samuel More sent his children on the dangerous journey on the Mayflower was explained. Jasper More, a descendant of Samuel More, prompted by his genealogist friend, Sir Anthony Wagner, searched his attic and discovered a 1622 document which detailed the adultery of the children's mother, Katherine More. That admission led the father, Samuel More, to believe that the children were not his offspring.Donald F. Harris, PhD., Mayflower Descendant (July 1993), vol. 43, no. 2, pp. 124-127 In 1616, Samuel More accused his wife Katherine More of adultery and bearing four children with Jacob Blakeway, a neighbour. Samuel More, under his father Richard's direction, removed the four children from their home. Four years later, without their mother's knowledge, they were transported to the New World on board the Pilgrim Fathers' ship the Mayflower.Sir Anthony R. Wagner, The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 165-168Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 1 (January 1994), p. 14.  Marriage  Jasper More's sons died, leaving no male heir. The estates were held in an entail whereby inheritance was restricted to male heirs, but Samuel father, Richard, in the marriage settlement paid 600 pounds to Jasper More, so there must have been clear title.Donald F Harris,PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43, no. 2 (July 1993), 130 It was arranged that Katherine would marry her cousin and indeed, on 4 February 1610, (old date style) Katherine, 25, the last unmarried daughter of Jasper, married her 17-year-old cousin, Samuel More.Shipton Parish Register Shropshire archive. At some point during this time, Samuel began working in London as secretary to Lord Edward Zouche, privy councillor, diplomat and courtier.Acts of the Privy Council of England, APC Col. p. 38 show Samuel More in Zouche's service as a private secretary as noted in David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p.221. Over the next four years, Katherine bore four children: Elinor, baptised 24 May 1612, Jasper, baptised 8 August 1613; Richard, baptised 13 November 1614; Mary, baptised 16 April 1616. All were baptised at St James' parish church in Shipton, Shropshire. All were registered with Samuel More as their father.Sir Anthony R.

The adultery was supposedly committed with Jacob Blakeway, a young man near in age to Katherine who lived close by and whose family had been More tenants for several generations. In 1608, Jacob Blakeway and his father Edward, a yeoman had renewed a lease on a parcel of land owned by Katherine More's father, Jasper More of Larden Hall. The manor of Larden Hall was about half a mile from Brockton where the Blakeway family lived.Donald Harris PhD., The More Children and the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant, (January 1994), vol. 44, no. 1, p. 12 By a deed dated 20 April 1616, Samuel cut the entail on the Larden estate to prevent any of the children from inheriting. During the long court battle, Samuel would deny that he was the father of the children borne by his wife, Katherine, and stated them to be children of the adulterous relationship.Donald Harris, PhD., The More Children and the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant, (January 1994), vol. 44, no. 1, p. 14, 18 Katherine did not deny her relationship with Jacob Blakeway, stating there was a former betrothal contract with him, and therefore he was her true husband. This would have made her marriage to Samuel invalid. Samuel quotes her words in his declaration, though she could not sufficiently prove by witnesses yet it was all one before god as she sayed. At that time any of the usual witnesses would have been dead.Sir Anthony R. Wagner, The Origin of the Mayflower Children: Jasper, Richard and Ellen More, (Boston: The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, July 1960), vol. 114, p. 165 In that same year, by his own account, Samuel went to his employer and a More family friend, Lord Zouche, Lord President of the Council of Wales, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Privy Counselor, to draw up a plan for the disposition of the children.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p. 109 Zouche had been an active member of the Virginia Company and in 1617 he invested ¬£100 in an expedition to the Colony of Virginia, which is where the Mayflower was supposed to have landed.

Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were over-ridden by the Privy Council, namely, Lord Zouche. Most people thought it a death sentence and indeed, many did not survive either the voyage or the harsh climate, disease and scarcity of fresh food for which they were ill-prepared.Donald F.

Courtesy of Phil Revell At the time of the Mayflower's sailing in September 1620, the children were aged between four and eight and classed as indentured servants and were to be labour in the colony of (Northern) Virginia (present day Long Island). This was the Mayflower's intended destination until winter weather forced the ship to anchor at Cape Cod. A number of colonists travelled as paying passengers on the Mayflower. Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known as many homeless waifs from the streets of London were sent to the New World as laborers.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, (July 1993), vol. 43, no. 2, p. 124Morison & Commager, The Growth of the American Republic ( 4th Ed., New York, 1950), vol.1, p. 40 Three of the Mayflower Pilgrims took responsibility for the children as indentured servants: * Elinor More, Ellen More, age 8, assigned as a servant of Edward Winslow. She died in November 1620 soon after the arrival of the Mayflower at Cape Cod Harbor. Her burial place is unknown and may have been ashore on Cape Cod similarly to her brother Jasper several weeks later. With many others who died that winter, her name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Cole's Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. * Jasper More, age 7, servant of John Carver. He died of a ‚Äòcommon infection‚Äô in Dec. 1620 while the Mayflower was in Cape Cod Harbor. He was buried ashore in what is now the Provincetown area. Provincetown has a memorial plaque with his name and that of four others ‚Äòwho died at sea while the ship lay at Cape Cod Harbor‚Äô in Nov./Dec. 1620. * Mary More, age 4, assigned as a servant of William Brewster. She died sometime in the winter of 1620/1621. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been on Cole's Hill in Plymouth in an unmarked grave as with so many others buried there that winter. As with her sister Ellen, she is recognized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb in Plymouth, misidentified after her sister's name as \\"and a brother (children)\\" ‚Äì the statement of calling her \\"a brother\\" mistakenly coming from William Bradford's failing memory years after the event of her death. * Richard More, age 6, servant of William Brewster. He resided with the Brewster family until about mid-1627 when his term of indentureship expired. This is about the time that his name appears, at age 14, in a census as a member of the Brewster family, in what was called then ‚ÄòNew Plimouth‚Äô. By 1628, Richard was in the employ of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, who was engaged in trans-Atlantic trading.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp 102‚Äì104 and pp. 25‚Äì27, 102‚Äì104, 150‚Äì152Donald F Harris, PhD.,The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 44, no. 2 (July 1994), p. 4Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006), p. 26 Samuel More continued to act as secretary to Edward la Zouche and on 11 June 1625, he married Elizabeth Worsley, daughter of Richard Worsley, Esq. of Deeping Gate (in Maxey) in Northamptonshire and cousin to Lord Zouche's second wife,Donald F. Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part III, The Mayflower Descendants, (July, 1994), vol. 44, no. 2, p.110 although he was only separated not divorced from Katherine More. There was no divorce as it is known today and neither party was allowed to remarry during the lifetime of the other.Donald F Harris, PhD., The More Children of the Mayflower, Part II, The Mayflower Descendant (January 1994), p. 16 On February of 1626, Samuel More obtained a royal pardon, possibly to protect himself against accusations of adultery. It is not known if Katherine was still alive at the time of his second marriage.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 65  Second controversy: the Hopton Massacre  In the English civil war Samuel More fought for Parliament and commanded a garrison at Hopton Castle in Shropshire. Hopton Castle was one of the few castles to be held for Parliament in that county. Samuel More was commandant of the castle when, in 1644, it was besieged by a force of Cavaliers led by Sir Michael Woodhouse, with a force of about 500. Samuel More‚Äôs garrison numbered around 30 men, and the end result of such an action was inevitable. Without external support, More would be forced to surrender. It seems that Colonel Samuel More was offered quarter (the option of a surrender) twice and refused. After this accounts differ. Samuel‚Äôs own accountJohn Brickdale Blakeway, Sheriffs of Shropshire, 1831: Relation of the siege, surrender and butchery at Hopton Castle (see above) by Colonel Samuel Moore, who commanded the garrison, p. 217. states that he finally surrendered once the Cavaliers had breached the castle walls, whereupon his men were brutally slaughtered. Other accounts state that, after a three-week siege, More delayed surrendering until the bailey had been taken and the entrance to the keep was on fire.Time Team ‚Äì Series 17  Episode 6  Hopton Castle Under the laws of war as they were practised at that time, such a surrender was at the discretion of the besieging forces, who had taken significant casualties. More had apparently waited too long to surrender. It seems that Sir Michael Woodhouse chose not to accept the surrender and ordered (or at least did not prevent) the killings. As his men were being killed, Samuel More was taken to Ludlow and was later given his freedom in a prisoner exchange.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), p. 119Hopton Castle Preservation Trust Shropshire UK /  References  Category:1593 births Category:1662 deaths Category:1616 in England ","title":"Samuel More"},{"id":"33150783","title":"1903 Norwegian Football Cup"},{"id":"33150799","text":"Huilong High School is a middle school in Jiangsu, China.

It features syntactic support for concurrency and event-based programming. It is a prototype-based object-oriented scripting language. It is dynamic: name resolution is performed during the program execution (late binding); slots (member variables) can be added/removed at runtime, and even prototypes (superclasses) of an object can be changed at runtime. Memory management is performed by reference counting. Tightly bound to the Urbi platform it supports seamless integration of C++/Java components. Syntax and semantics =Inspiration= From the syntactical point of view, urbiscript belongs to the C-family of programming languages. Its prototype-based object-oriented design was influenced by the Self and the Io programming languages. It is designed to program, but also interact with robots; as such, it is influenced by Unix shells and other languages that provide a read-eval-print loop style interactive toplevel. However, contrary to others, there is no prompt for user input but answers from the system are prefixed by a timestamp (in milliseconds) between square brackets: 1 + 1; sleep(1s); 1 + 2 * 3; :[00005420] 2 :[00006420] 7 =Sequential statements and control flow= urbiscript statements include (among others): * The \`if\` statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with \`else\`. * The traditional \`for\` statement, as in C which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. * Another \`for\` statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. * The \`while\` statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. * The \`try\` statement, which allows exceptions thrown in its attached code block to be caught and handled by \`catch\` clauses. An optional \`else\` clause is run if no exception was thrown. Clean-up code can be guaranteed to be run in every case when given in a \`finally\`-clause. * The \`assert\` statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply. urbiscript also feature \`assert\` blocks, which can be used to factor several \`assert\` statements. Actually, contrary to most C-like languages and despite what the syntax suggests, statements \\"have a value\\", and therefore are expressions, provided they are embedded in braces: var status = { if (closed) \\"closed\\" else \\"open\\" }; var pass = { try { foo } catch { false } else { true } }; =Concurrent statements and control flow= In urbiscript, some control-flow constructs come in several \\"flavors\\": two types of sequential composition, and two types of concurrent composition. Under the hood, concurrency is implemented using coroutines. Statement composition Like in C, the semicolon denotes sequential composition: \`a;b\` stands for \\"run statement \`a\` then run statement \`b\`. Other tasks may be run between \`a\` and \`b\`. Another statement separator, pipe, denotes \\"tight sequential composition\\": no other task can be run between \`a\` and \`b\` in \`ab\`. Similarly urbiscript features two means to compose statements concurrently. With \`a,b\`, first \`a\` is run, and at some point \`b\` will be --- possibly while \`a\` is still running.

This delay in response time when one is required to divide attention can exhibit a negative effect that is evident in many fields of study. The PRP can be used to investigate many areas of research that study processes which require divided attention, such as reading aloud, language, or driving and talking on the phone. PRP effects related to personality, age, and level of alcohol or caffeine intake have also been investigated. Methods PRP is a product of the psychological refractory period paradigm, a paradigm in which two different stimuli are presented in rapid succession, each requiring a fast response. Stimulus onset asynchrony, the time that lapses between the presentations of the two stimuli, acts as the independent variable in this paradigm, and the reaction time to the second stimulus acts as the dependent variable. Figure 1. Model of the central bottleneck accounting for the psychological refractory period. Execution of one task requires three stages: Stage 1 entails the analysis of the perceptual characteristics of the stimulus, Stage 2 entails a decision about what the task-set requires, Stage 3 is the execution of the actual response. Shaded stages cannot overlap, but if they do, for example when the time intervening between the two tasks (SOA) is short, the one that has priority (i.e., the first task) will delay (SLACK) the execution of the second. This phenomenon is known as the psychological refractory period. An example of a PRP paradigm might be that there is a task 1 which requires participants to push the keyboard-letter 'n' with the right index finger when a square frame was green. There is also a task 2 which requires participants to push the keyboard-letter 'v' with the left index finger when the digit displayed was a '3' and to push the letter 'c' with the left middle finger if the digit displayed was a '4'. If the temporal distance between the two tasks is varied, for example 150 ms in one and 1000ms in another, the time to respond to the second task will be longer when the interval occurring between the two tasks is 150 ms than when it is 1000 ms. Referring to figure 1, the SLACK intervening between the execution of the first and second task will be absorbed when the interval intervening between the two tasks is long rather than when it is short. Results Researchers have used the PRP paradigm design to study various topics in psychology, and various results indicate how these areas of psychology are negatively affected by the psychological refractory period delay. =Personality and intelligence= PRP is not dependent on personality. Upon experimentation, participants were tested with a PRP paradigm in which the first task was an auditory task and the second task was a visual two choice task. Results indicated that there is an overall decrease in reaction time, exhibiting a psychological refractory period effect, however, there was no effect due to varying levels of extroversion and introversion. =Language= PRP studies have challenged the notion that central attention does not play a role in reading aloud. Upon experimentation, participants were primed with exception words (pin, mint, hint, lint) and pseudohomophones (brain and brane). In the PRP paradigm they were first asked to read the words aloud quickly, and then asked to respond to a tone by responding to the letter string (counterbalance order of words). Results indicated that the phonological process of reading aloud is not automatic it utilizes central attention, because reading aloud also exhibits a PRP effect. It was also determined that other language areas other than reading aloud are affected by PRP. Grammar whether it be open words such as nouns, or closed words such as determiners, pronoun, prepositions, conjunctions etc. require central attention. =Driving= The PRP affects not only simple dual tasks such as the way we read or speak, it also can affect more complicated tasks such as driving. Hal Pashler and his colleagues tested subjects in a driving simulation, and as they drove they would occasionally hear a tone. Once they heard the tone, they had to call out the number of the tone. The car in front of them would occasionally brake, causing the participant to brake. The results indicated that when they had to respond to a tone, they took longer to brake, which could potentially translate into a longer distance needed to slow driving or potential collisions. =Alcohol and caffeine= Alcohol impairs both speed and accuracy performance in PRP tasks, and while caffeine can reduce speed impairments, accuracy remains poor. Participants in this study performed a PRP task that measured dual-task interference. Performance was tested under 2 active doses and 1 placebo dose of caffeine in combination with 1 active dose and 1 placebo dose of alcohol. Results indicated that alcohol impaired PRP performance for both speed and accuracy, and the combination of caffeine and alcohol impaired PRP performance for accuracy but not speed. Therefore, although caffeine may counterbalance alcohol in terms of reaction time, it fails to counterbalance in terms of accuracy. =Aging= PRP becomes more apparent as we age. However, studies have aimed to determine if dual-task practice can help remove elderly disadvantages. It was previously determined from experimentation with young adults that practice reduces reaction time in both simple and PRP conditions; however, after consecutive days the PRP effect was still found to be evident, and therefore was still a function of stimulus onset asynchrony. However, this finding was further tested with older adults. Young and old participants were assigned to practice 7 blocks of PRP paradigm design. The first task required a vocal response to an auditory stimulus, followed by a manual response to a visual stimulus second task. Results showed that practice did not reduce PRP differences between the old and young. They administered the experiment again with either a less complicated first task or less complicated second task. Results showed that previous practice helped reduce PRP only for older adults. Therefore, older adults have a difficult time switching from task 1 to task 2 that is most profound when either the first or second task is difficult. These differences could be due to the fact that older adults have a reduced ability to bypass the central bottleneck, through task automatization. Older and younger participants first learned to perform an auditory vocal task. They then participated in a PRP paradigm, with a manual response to a visual stimulus, followed by a highly practiced auditory vocal task. Results indicated that there was a processing bottleneck in all but 1 of the older adults. Therefore, older adults either have the ability to use automatic-memory retrieval and bypass the bottleneck and it is just less likely to be used, or they have actual lost the ability entirely. Theories During the psychological refractory period, a network of brain regions in both the back and front of the brain are activated. These areas are notable for processing visual information as well as cognitive and motor information respectively. This PRP effect is most likely to be evident when an individual is stressed or is experiencing exhaustion. The PRP is likely caused by a combination of two approaches; the bottleneck approach and the capacity approach. These concepts vary in specific mechanisms, however, they both propose an overall limit to the amount of mental activity in which we can engage in. =Metaphor of the bottleneck= The bottleneck mechanism occurs when the first stimulus is being processed, any other stimuli cannot be processed. The processing of the second stimulus is postponed which slows down reaction time. Neurons that take in information send this information to specific neural networks in different locations. However, when some specific information is sent in one direction, there is a slight delay before new sensory information can be sent to another direction. =Capacity view= The PRP can also be explained by the capacity view. Limited mental resources must be shared when doing two tasks at once. This lacks a bottleneck metaphor; tasks can be performed simultaneously as long as the common pool of resource from which both the tasks pull from is not emptied. The capacity could either be a unitary pool or divided into two pools of mental resources, separated according to input modality (auditory or visual), and response required (vocal or manual). Therefore, if two tasks are in separate modalities they should not interfere with each other. However, despite this separation, there is a maximum to the amount of capacity that can be devoted to them together. Although this idea enjoys some success, it is criticized because it fails to specifically define a mental resource. The definition tends to be circular in that limited resources define why an individual is not able to share two tasks, while the fact that individuals are not able to do two tasks at once is due to limited mental resources.

The Ajuntament  History of the shield of La Pobla de Vallbona The shield of La Pobla de Vallbona was mainly created to avoid fraud and mistakes with documents or authorizations that each mayor of the towns of Spain issued. In 1848 the government implied as an obligation to use a stamp (shield) with the goal of not confusing documents. This is when La Pobla de Vallbona decided to use the shield that has been used since 1975. The shield is divided in three parts. The first part that is the largest has the 4 bars of Arag√≥n; thus this shows that the origins of the town were established taking into account Arag√≥n‚Äôs costumes. Then, there are two smaller divisions one have 3 ‚Äúmoreras‚Äù of sinople (three green trees); representing how abundant is the town with trees and agriculture. The last division has a blue background that indicates loyalty and also there is the ‚Äúcaserio de plata‚Äù (some kind of houses) that makes reference of the name ‚ÄúPobla‚Äù that is the unique characteristic of the vallbonenses: Loyalty. Lastly, one can see at the top the Royal Crown. Geography Access to La Pobla de Vallbona can be either through the highway CV-35 or also through the Valencia Metro line 1. Neighborhoods In the municipality of La Pobla de Vallbona besides the urban core one can also found the following towns: Casa Blanca Camp del Turia Gallipont La Conarda Pla dels Aljubs Rascanya Economy After the highway with access to Valencia was finished, the population almost doubled due to the proximity to the city. In general, this increased the local trade in the town. Additionally, the agriculture in the town throughout years has been abandoned.

Going in 1794 to Calcutta, where his father was living, he had a subordinate post in a public official but gave it up for an ensigncy in the 76th (Foot) Regiment. Promoted into the 74th Regiment, he served in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War under General George Harris, and in the Second Anglo-Maratha War campaigns of 1803‚Äì4. He was distinguished also in the battle of Assaye. In 1805 he sold his commission, and, visiting an uncle, Samuel Tolfrey, in Ceylon, obtained a post in the public service there in 1806. In 1813 he was assistant commissioner of revenue and commerce, and shortly afterwards proficiency in Sinhalese obtained him the post of chief translator to the resident at Kandy. On the arrival of Sir Robert Brownrigg as governor in 1812, a Bible society was started, and Tolfrey undertook the revision of the old Sinhalese translation of the Bible made by the Dutch. Tolfrey died in Ceylon on 4 January 1817. Works An early English student of classical Pali, Tolfrey found the existing Sinhalese Bible translation too colloquial, and translated each verse into Pali as he worked. At the time of his death, he had nearly completed the translation of the New Testament into Pali, a work which was subsequently printed. Benjamin Clough used Tolfrey's materials for the compilation of his Pali grammar, produced in 1824.

The work was first published in November 1760, and went through five editions.Harding p.184 The pamphlet was released amidst rising opposition to Britain's involvement in the German War.

Today, the Foundation is building the capacities of community in rural and urban areas for abolition of child labour by universalizing social education. It uses an \\"area-based\\" approach instead of a target-based approach. The area-based approach concentrates on protecting the rights of every children and ensuring all of them attend full-time formal education. It draws plans for children to withdraw from work and prepare them to be integrated into schools. Schemes were also designed to ensure that children are retained in school and will continue to do so without any disruption. Objectives Universalizing formal education has been one of the foundation's key objectives. It seeks to address the rights of the entire universes of children- both in school and out of school - in the 5-14 age group and its area of operation. It sees children who are deprived of education opportunities as intrinsically hazardous to their growth and well-being. The MV Foundation also ensures that every child attending school does so without any disruption until she reaches class 10 since there is no guarantee that the child does not get pushed out of school to join the labour force again. Impact Over the years, over 1,000,000 children have been freed from child labour, enrolled and retained in school, more than 4000 bonded labourers have been released and 168 villages in Andhra Pradesh are now child labour free. The core strategy of MV Foundation to achieve its objective of transforming child labours to students is through the residential bridge camps. It has been implemented in more than 6000 villages and an estimated 45000 child labours have thus benefited from these bridge camps. Through the Stop Child Labor Campaigns and Child Rights Protection Forum (CPRF), they had successfully mobilised communities to establish a social norm against child labour and to understand that school is the fundamental right of a child. The greatest impact is the direct cooperation of the MV Foundation with the government of Andhra Pradesh, facilitating the application of the MVF approach in the entire state. It has also leveraged on the support of every section of society on a village and national level to create the community pressures for ensuring sustainability in its institutions and strategies. Enrolling children into schools The MV Foundation uses a variety and combination of strategies to enroll children into schools and into classes appropriate to their age. One of the strategies is the MVF Bridge Camp. These are residential camps in which children spend between three and eighteen months depending on their need. The camp enables children to catch up on missed education and serves as an adjustment period for both child and family. They are given opportunities to interact with peers of their own age and get accustomed to the new lifestyle at their own pace. Parents meanwhile adapt to the changes in their child and their role as parents of a student. Challenges of enrolling children into schools One key concern related to the residential bridge camps is the use of residential bridge camp.

The Former Residence of Premier Zhou Enlai was the childhood home of Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, located in Huai'an, China. Residence The residence was first built during the Qing Dynasty. It is located in a valley called FuMa (È©∏È©¨ meaning \\"the husband of the princess\\") in Huacheng Town of Huai'an. The residence consists of two messuages. That is the East Messuage and the West Messuage. There are 32 rooms in the house. In some there are photographs documenting Zhou's childhood, his family, his hometown, and people's admiration for him. Zhou lived, relaxed, and studied there for nearly 12 years. There is a beautiful hall called the \\"Butterfly Lobby\\" where Zhou's mother lived. There one can also see an old well. =Gate= There are seven Chinese characters (Âë®ÊÅ©Êù•ÂêåÂøóÊïÖÂ±Ö; Zh≈çu'ƒìnl√°i t√≥ngzh√¨ g√πj≈´; Comrade Zhou Enlai's Former Residence) written by Deng Xiaoping across the top of the gate. =East messuage= The room in which Zhou was born was in the East Messuage. Little Zhou also studied in the East Messuage. The room in which Zhou, his stepmother and his wet nurse resided was also in the East Messuage. The patches in the quilts prove that this family lived a hard life at that time. In the East Messuage, one can also see the old well and the vegetable plot. The Birth Place of Zhou Enlai. =West messuage= Here are mainly displays of calligraphy and paintings. People see calligraphy written by Zhou's grandfather and photos telling the story of little Zhou and contributions he made to the People's Republic of China. Exhibition hall. =The garret (‰∫≠Â≠êÈó¥) and Zhou's three mothers= This is where little Zhou and his mothers lived. Zhou is the eldest grandson of his family. His parents gave him the name \\"Da Luan\\" (Â§ßÈ∏æ. It is a kind of bird which is similar to a phoenix. In China, these birds symbolizes auspice and happiness.) He has three mothers. First is his biological mother, Mrs Wang (). Mrs Wan was educated in the family school for about 6 years. So she paid attention to Zhou's education. The second mother is Mrs Chen. Mrs Chen is Zhou's adoptive mother and also his aunt. Zhou's uncle was seriously ill and dad no child. In old days in China, there was a saying that of all who lack filial piety, people who has no children are the worst. () So the couple adopted Zhou in order to make his uncle happy and remove his disease. (In the old days, it was called \\"ÂÜ≤Âñú Chongxi\\") Mrs Chen was born to a scholarly family and was a typical Chinese woman. Her father was a Xiu Cai in the Qing Dynasty. So she taught Zhou a lot of knowledge. When he was 4 years old, Mrs Chen taught him some Chinese words and some poetry of the Tang Dynasty. Zhou was sent to the family school at the age of 5. After school, Zhou always listened to Mother Chen telling some historical stories. Zhou read Three Character Classic (), Thousand Character Classic (), Great Learning (), The Analects () and Mencius () with the help of Mother Chen. The third mother of Zhou is Mother Jiang. Mrs Jiang was Zhou's wet nurse. She was a peasant woman. The characters of the plain peasant woman also influenced Zhou a lot. However, his mothers didn't accompany him for a long time. His biological mother died of Pulmonary disease at the age of 35 in 1907. One year later, his adoptive mother Mrs Chen also died. When he was 12, his father's elder brother brought him to the Northeast. As a result, he had to say goodbye to his wet nurse. These three women influenced Zhou Enlai greatly during his life. =The old well and vegetable plot= The old well. There is an old well behind the Garret. In the brandreth, the scratches caused by the rub between the role and the well can be seen clearly. The residence kitchen was located southeast of the old well. In front of the kitchen, one can see the vegetable plot. Little Zhou spent a lot of time with his wet nurse here. Beside the old well, there are two ancient elm trees, each about 20 meters high. They are protected by the Jiangsu province government. =Wen Qu (Wen Canal) = Wen Qu. Wen Qu (), is considered to be the mother river of Huaian. It was first built in 1623 CE. It flows through the city and in front of the former residence of Premier Zhou. Since its excavation, Wen Qu offers domestic water to the people of Huaian. It is also used for irrigation and for drainage in the rainy season. Bridges over Wen Qu The ancient inhabitants of Huaian built many bridges over Wen Qu. People used moorstone, black bricks and Chinese fir to build these bridges. Most of the bridges are masonry structures or timberwork. They chose Chinese fir because this wood can bear heavy loads and resist decay. It is also convenient for people to mend. The carpenters who built these bridges are called \\"Gao Zuo\\" () or \\"Gao carpenter\\" (). However, in 2004, the last two masonry structure Single arch bridges (Xing Wen bridge, ÂÖ¥ÊñáÊ°• and Wei Xi bridge, ÊÖ∞Ë•øÊ°•) are dismantled in order to build the pedestrian street. Some of the bridges are named from some stories. * Kua Xia bridge (): comes from a story of Hanxin. When Hanxin was poor, he was once challenged by a hooligan and was asked to crawl through between the hooligan's legs. Han bore the shame. With this Character, he became one of the \\"Three Heroes of the early Han Dynasty\\". () * The King bridge (): was named after the Monkey King who is the main character in the book \\"Journey to the West\\" written by Wu Cheng'en. * San Si bridge (): San Si means \\"thinking twice\\". The bridge warns officials that they should think twice before exercising their power. Some of the bridges are named in accordance with the Bagua Azimuth (): * Qing Long Bridge () * Bai Hu Bridge () * Zhu Que Bridge () * Zheng Wu Bridge () =Zhou and his residence= Zhou Enlai became the first Premier of People's Republic of China in 1949. Many people visited his residence in Huaian. Zhou once wrote to the Huaian government and made two requests. First, he hoped that the government would not open his former residence to the public in memory of him. Second, is that don't make people move out of the house who have been living here for a long time. In 1973, he gave three orders: 1. Do not let people visit these houses, 2. Do not encourage people who live in these houses to move out, and 3. Do not mend these houses. Many Chinese leaders made calligraphy here and speak highly of him. In 1984, Hu Yaobang paid a visit to the residence. Half a year later, Jiang Zemin also visited to show respect for Zhou Enlai. In 2004, Hu Jingtao came to Huaian and visited the Former residence of Premier Zhou Enlai. Now many people come here to pay a visit in memory of Zhou Enlai.

Born in Canada, she started taking classical ballet lessons in childhood. After the October Revolution, many artistic and cultural professionals, including ballet dancers and choreographers, emigrated from Russia, bringing with them the typical Russian forms of ballet, which was developing mostly independently from the Western trends since the 19th century and followed classic forms long abandoned in the West.History of the Russian Ballet As the Russian ballet enjoyed great popularity in the West, these emigrants were always in great demand. It is due to this popularity that the European dancers started to adopt Russian pseudonyms. Young Patricia Galian also followed this trend and started to perform as Alexandra Denisova. Before the beginning of World War II, she worked in troupe of Original Ballet Russe ‚Äî OBR (other name is Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo). The troupe went on tour in the different countries, first of all making tour across Europe. All were broken by the Second World War: tours across Europe have been cancelled. The route has changed in a direction to the South America. Alexandra Denisova Soon troupe Original Ballet Russe gave representations in Havana. One of founders of troupe Vasily Voskresensky, the former officer of the Russian imperial army, having brought troupe to Cuba, to Havana, has decided to meet the old colleague-officer who has settled there ‚Äî Nikolay Yavorsky. Nikolay Yavorsky wasn't the professional dancer too, but once in young years he has been given to training to ballet. In emigration this knowledge was useful. He began to give lessons of ballet skill. Among his pupils there were brothers Fernando Alonso (1914) and Alberto Alonso (1917‚Äî2007) and a girl Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Mart√≠nez Hoya. Fernando Alonso and Alicia married; Alicia became Alicia Alonso. Alberto Alonso began his dance career aged 17 in 1936 with Original Ballet RusseAlberto Alonso: National Ballet of Cuba co-founder where he became the partner, and then the husband of ballerina Alexandra Denisova. Alberto Alonso and Alexandra Denisova married in May 1939 in Melbourne.ru: –ê–ª—å–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ –ê–ª–æ–Ω—Å–æ (Alberto Alonso) Tours in Australia were tightened, in 1940 during this tours David Lichine created the ballet Graduation Ball (Alexandra Denisova as one of girl). To return to Europe at war it was impossible. It was reflected in the troupe finance. Some dancers have left troupe to America which was far from war. As a result, Alexandra Denisova accepted all roles of a star of troupe Irina Baronova, and has coped with them so successfully that critic Arnold Haskell marked in the publication in the newspaper The Home on April 1, 1940: Young Denisova during the season danced many of her (Baronova) roles. For any ballerina to undertake this means shouldering an initial handicap, but the Canadian girl proved her mettle and earned high praise. (Arnold Haskell, The Home, April 1, 1940). Alberto Alonso has been occupied in many parties too. But the family began to fall. Denisova and Alberto separated in 1944, while on vacation in the United States, and she was never to return to Cuba. She began to live in the US, Los Angeles. She acted at different theaters in ballets of Michel Fokine (Paganini), David Lichine (Rhapsody, 1946), George Balanchine (Song of Norway, 1946) etc. Denisova's career continued in Hollywood, with small roles dancing when she has removed her Russian pseudonym: films On an Island with You ‚Äî 1948 (in several scenes she replaced ill Cyd Charisse), Two Tickets to Broadway ‚Äî 1951, Singin' in the Rain ‚Äî 1952, Knock on Wood ‚Äî 1954, Three for the Show ‚Äî 1955, Meet Me in Las Vegas ‚Äî 1956, Marjorie Morningstar ‚Äî 1958 etc. In the 1950s she had a position of Assistant to the Dance Director in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios.

Mack, Sr. (born January 8, 1966) is an American Democratic Party politician from Trenton, New Jersey. He served as the Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey from 2010 until being ousted in February 2014. His administration was \\"plagued by accusations of cronyism and reckless spending,\\" according to The New York Times. He faced a recall election in November 2011; however, it did not gain sufficient citizen support to succeed. On September 10, 2012, Mack was arrested after being the subject of an FBI investigation into bribery, fraud, extortion and money laundering. His trial began on January 6, 2014, and on February 7, 2014 he was convicted on all counts. On February 26, 2014, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson removed Mayor Mack from office. Early life and political career Mack was born in Louisville, Georgia. When he was five years old, his father died, and the family moved to Trenton, New Jersey. Mack grew up in the Wilbur section of the city, and attended the Trenton Public Schools. He earned a bachelor's degree in Consumer Affairs Management from Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he was also a member of the football, wrestling and baseball teams from 1984 to 1988. He was a member of the 1987 football team, coached by College Football Hall of Fame member Willie Jeffries, that won the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference title and finished 9‚Äì1. Mack excelled in all three sports, most prominently in wrestling, where his coach was Paul A. Cotton, Ph.D., R.D. As a freshman, he placed second in the MEAC tournament, where he was voted outstanding wrestler, and he also advanced to the Championship Finals of the Capital Collegiate Tournament. In 1986 and 1987, Mack won MEAC Championships in the 150 pound class; in 1987 he became the first Howard wrestler to compete in the NCAA tournament. In 2007, he was inducted into the Howard Athletic Hall of Fame. Mack earned his Master's Degree at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Administrative Science. Mack served as a Mercer County Freeholder for 12 years. First elected in 1996, he served on a variety of committees, including the Airport Advisory Council, the Board of School Estimate, the Commission on Child Abuse and Missing Children, the Human Services Advisory Council, and the Organization Rules and Procedures Committee. Upon being re-elected to a second freeholder term on November 2, 1999, he was sworn in as the Freeholder Board President in 2000. He was re-elected in 2002 and 2005 but was defeated in the Democratic primary election held in June 2008 by John Cimino. He was elected Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey in 2010. Mack served the Democratic Party as a committeeman in the East Ward (District 7) and West Ward (District 1) sections of Trenton; he is a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, The Urban League Guild; a former member of Laborers' International Union of North America Local 595 and a former president of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 2281. Tenure of Office Among Mack's first moves as mayor of the city of 85,000 was firing the existing department heads, including a deputy city clerk hired by the City Council but escorted from City Hall by police. Mack faced a recall election after a controversial first year in office: \\"Mack's critics say he has used the city's payroll like a personal piggy bank, hiring unqualified friends for key posts and focusing on minor projects like parks and parades as the city struggles with serious problems,\\" according to The Times (Trenton). This first year of his administration also saw an unusually-large procession of business administrators. The first resigned after a month, saying the mayor didn't believe in \\"good government.\\" Another resigned just ahead of pleading guilty to embezzlement while employed in another, previous position. His housing director quit after a prior theft conviction was revealed. His chief of staff was arrested trying to buy heroin. His half-brother, whose authority he elevated at the city water plant, was arrested on charges of stealing. Subsequently, his law director resigned after arguing with Mack over complying with open-records laws and potential violations of laws prohibiting the awarding of city contracts to large campaign donors. Conviction on corruption charges As part of an FBI investigation, his home was raided on 18 Jul 2012, and some offices at city hall were raided on the following day. Mack was arrested on September 10, 2012 as part of a FBI corruption investigation. Amongst the eight others also arrested were his brother and his \\"close associate\\", Joseph A. \\"JoJo\\" Giorgianni. Mack was found guilty by a jury of all counts on February 7, 2014. He was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison.http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/nyregion/former-trenton-mayor- sentenced-to-prison-in-corruption-case.html?referrer= Release from Prison On May 23, 2018, The Trentonian reported that Mack was released from prison, and that he would most likely not return to live in Trenton.https://www.trentonian.com/news/ex-trenton-mayor-tony-mack-released- from-federal-prison/article_09ca176c-937b-54a5-a93a-68d35768de4c.html Electoral history Notes References Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:African-American mayors in New Jersey Category:Mayors of Trenton, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:Fairleigh Dickinson University alumni Category:Howard University alumni Category:People from Louisville, Georgia Category:Politicians convicted of corruption in New Jersey Category:New Jersey politicians convicted of crimes Category:American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees people ","title":"Tony F.

In December 1929, the South African Railways placed five Class GDA Garratt articulated locomotives with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type wheel arrangement in branch line service on the Natal North Coast line.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1946). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, February 1946. p. 134. Manufacturer The Class GDA 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type Garratt locomotive was built to the same specifications and was for all intents and purposes identical to the Class GD in its main dimensions. They were ordered from Linke-Hofmann Werke AG in Breslau, Germany in 1929 and numbered 2255 to 2259 upon delivery in December of that same year.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. p. 31. Characteristics The locomotive had the same tractive effort as the Class GD, was also superheated and also had Walschaerts valve gear to actuate its piston valves. The main differences were the use of bar frames instead of plate frames, differently shaped coal and water bunkers, and a round-topped firebox instead of a Belpaire firebox. Service The five locomotives were placed in service working out of Cape Town where they were to join the Class GD on the Overberg branch across Sir Lowry's Pass to Caledon and Bredasdorp, but they were found to be not satisfactory in service and ended up being staged on a siding near the Cape Town sheds for a considerable time. When a question was raised in the local press, enquiring the reason why these brand new locomotives were not being used, they were first moved to a less conspicuous location and shortly afterwards transferred to Natal. The Natal shops managed to get the locomotives to perform satisfactorily and they were placed in branch line service on the North Coast line in Natal, working around Stanger. This line contains long gradients of 1 in 40 (2¬Ω%) and severe curvature with curves of radius. Some locomotives later ended up working on the Port Alfred branch. In 1970 a pair was sent to Port Elizabeth where they worked local goods trains until they were all withdrawn by 1972. SAR locomotive policy During the term of office of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO as SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer from 1922 to 1929 articulated locomotives were in great favour in South Africa, to the extent that the Railway Board of the day instructed that non-articulated engines should only be ordered in exceptional circumstances. His retirement in 1929 brought about a change in policy, however, and there would be an interval of nearly a decade before another articulated Cape gauge Garratt would be acquired.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1946). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, January 1946. p. 13. Preservation Two locomotives were \\"preserved\\". No. 2257 was plinthed at Grahamstown Station. After the branch line via Grahamstown to Port Alfred fell into disuse, however, an apathetic local government allowed Grahamstown's historic station buildings and especially the plinthed locomotive to be vandalised to an eyesore state by 2013.

Regarded by some authors as a subspecies of the common barn owl (Tyto alba), it is recognized by others as a species in its own right. Taxonomy The species was named by Allan Octavian Hume after the collector Frederik Adolph de Roepstorff who shot it at Aberdeen, Andamans. Hume placed it in the genus Strix. Some authors consider this bird to be a subspecies of the barn owl/western barn owl (Tyto alba),or the eastern barn owl (Tyto javanica), but K√∂nig, in his Owls of the World, recognizes it as a distinct species; one distinguishing feature is that it lacks the greyish veil, speckled with black and white, that all other races of Tyto alba / Tyto javanica possess. Description The Andaman masked owl grows to a length of between , with a wing of around and a tail of . It is almost uniformly dark reddish-brown above, with some speckling of buffish-orange. The facial disc is pale reddish-buff with a distinctive orange-brown margin. The eyes are blackish and the beak creamy-white. The breast is golden-brown with blackish spots, paling towards the belly, which is whitish. The legs are fully feathered to near the feet. The toes are greyish-pink and the claws purplish- grey. The voice has been described as a rather high-pitched, short, rasping, descending shriek which terminates abruptly and is repeated several times. Distribution and habitat The Andaman masked owl is known only from the southern Andaman Islands. It occurs on the coastal plain, in fields and gardens with trees, and in human settlements. It is not thought to be migratory. Ecology Little is known of the habits of this owl but they are likely to be similar to those of other related species. It is nocturnal, roosting during the day and emerging at dusk. It feeds on small rodents, and the bones of mice and rats have been found in regurgitated pellets beneath roosting places. It probably nests in cavities but details of its breeding habits are not known.

It was founded to promote and consolidate Mexican folk dance, with a focus on the state of Nayarit, making it unique. However, the troupe also performs other dance from Latin America and contemporary dance as well as Mexican styles. The dancers are young and trained by the company to perform. The organization is divided into two sections, the main group and a children‚Äôs group called the Mexcaltit√°n Infantil, geared to very young dancers with the aim of training them to become part of the main group. Today, the troupe is supported by the Nayarit state government and Garc√≠a P√©rez remains as the general director. While its main objective is to train young dancers in traditional Mexican folk dance, it also trains artists in other disciplines such as acting and singing, with the aim of further promoting Mexican and Nayarit culture. This allows the organization to create larger theatrical pieces such as a homage to Francisco Gabilondo Soler, who performed radio shows for children in the 20th century. In 2011, the group presented a program called Legends and Traditions of Old Nayarit in honor of choreographer Jaime Buentello Baz√°n. This production focused on the stories, dance and music of the state in times past, especially those areas along the coast. The ensemble has performed in its native Nayarit and other parts of Mexico such as Guadalajara, Canc√∫n, and the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City . The ensemble has toured in Europe, Asia and the Americas in countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, England, Taiwan, Dominican Republic, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Cuba, Brazil, India, Canada and the United States.

It is named for its near-parallel strike along the 85th meridian. It is one of two major aseismic ridges in the Bay of Bengal, the other being the Ninety East Ridge. The feature extends from the Mahanadi Basin in the north, off the northeastern coast of India, shifts westwards by about 250 km around 5¬∞N, southeast of Sri Lanka and continues south to the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Central Indian Basin. No wells have been drilled on the ridge. Samples of the ridge from the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount were ultramafic dunite. Seismic studies have shown that the morphology of the ridge including its depth of occurrence varies along the ridge track and that in general the ridge has been buried beneath sediments deposited since the Oligocene. The ridge is associated with complicated gravity and magnetic signatures. The northern part of the ridge is buried beneath thick sediments of the Bengal Fan and shows a negative gravity anomaly. Ridge structures in the south occasionally rise above the sea floor and are associated with a positive gravity anomaly. The magnetic signatures associated with the ridge are complex, with alternate stripes of strong positive and negative anomalies. Magnetic modelling of the ridge suggests that it was emplaced over a period of rapid geomagnetic reversals whereas the underlying oceanic crust was formed in a normal magnetic field of the Cretaceous normal superchron or \\"Cretaceous quiet period\\". The correlation of the magnetization pattern of the ridge and the geomagnetic polarity timescale suggests that the volcanism that created the ridge started ~80 Ma (magnetic chron time 33r) in the Mahanadi Basin and the process continued southwards, ending at ~55 Ma near the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount. There are several proposals to explain the origin and development of the ridge, one of which is that the volcanism was caused by a short-lived hotspot.

This new phase in her life marks her entry into the circle of women, which brings with it new cultural obligations that leave little room for her own personal quest.  Synopsis  Niloofar, a twelve-year-old girl, dreams of being able to read and write. Unfortunately, in her village only boys can go to school. Niloofar's mother, a midwife, pushes her to become her apprentice. During one of the deliveries, Niloofar meets an educated woman. In secret, she starts to teach Niloofar how to read and write. In the meantime, Niloofar's father has bought a field of palms. The price: Niloofar, as soon as she is a woman. Niloofar is horrified by this and tries to postpone her periods. When her periods finally do arrive, she hides this from the community. But the truth cannot be hidden for long and one day her secret is exposed. Terrified Niloo must obey her fathers word and marry a man who once had his own daughter put to death for loving a boy. This boy was Niloo's uncle, Aziz. Aziz is still so haunted by the memory of the young lover he lost years before he feels compelled to free Niloo from a similar destiny. Aziz devises a plan to help Niloo escape and the two set off together. Niloo's family is furious when they discover her missing and vow to bring her back to face retribution for dishonoring the family. They send her stepbrother out to track Niloofar down and bring her back.

On August 24, 1869, she submitted a patent, categorized under the Improvement in the Construction of Houses, for a residential design proposal of a hexagonal house. Her husband and brother-in- law would go on to form a company to construct houses based on her design in the Charlotte area. Life Born to Reverend Robert Hall Morrison and Mary Graham Morrison in 1828, she was home schooled by her father, president of Davidson College and later attended the Salem Female Academy in North Carolina. She had five sisters ‚Äì Isabella Sophia Hill, Eugenia Erixene Barringer, Susan Washington Avery, Laura Panthea Brown, and Mary Anna Jackson - and 4 brothers - Joseph Graham, Robert Hall, Alfred James, and William Alexander She married James P. Irwin in 1849 at the age of 21, and they moved to Charlotte, North Carolina where they had nine children. Later, they lived together at 912 West Fifth Street in a home designed using Irwin's patent. She died in 1897 and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Charlotte. Career She wrote for the magazine, The Land We Love, edited Daniel Harvey Hill and co- founded by her husband James. Her articles consisted of romance and historical stories, as well as articles on church policies. A construction boom in Charlotte in 1869 renewed her interest in engineering and architecture, and later that year she filed a patent for a residence. Plagued by illnesses throughout her life, she designed a home to fit the needs of an invalid housekeeper, taking inspiration from books and articles she read while tending to her home. She studied works by Bindon Blood Stoney, an Irish engineer, and John Ruskin, an English Architect, who believed that buildings should have plenty of access to the outdoors and that nature contributed to people‚Äôs mental power and good health. She was also influenced by Orson Squire Fowler's work The Octagon House: A Home for All which promoted an octagonal house, but Irwin eventually decided the hexagon was a more fitting shape because hexagonal rooms could be nested inside a hexagonal exterior, self-described as lozenge-shaped.Bishir, Catherine W. ‚ÄúIrwin, Harriet Morrison (1828-1897).‚Äù North Carolina Architects & Builders 2014. Web. 29 Apr 2019. On August 24, 1869, at the age of 41, she received patent number 94,116 for her design of a six-sided house. The patent emphasized more-efficient lighting, better movement of air, and better use of space. Even the rooms in Irwin‚Äôs house were six-sided.Herran, Kathy Neill. \\"Irwin, Harriet Morrison.\\" NCpedia. 1 Jan 2006. NC LIVE, Web. 20 Sep 2011. To promote her patent Irwin wrote the book, The Hermit of Petraea, in 1871, in which she discussed her ideas of health, the outdoors and how hexagonal living could promote physical well-being. That same year, she, her husband and her brother-in-law Daniel Harvey Hill organized the Hill and Irwin Land Agency which specialized in hexagonal homes, at least two houses were built in Charlotte based on Irwin's patent, since demolished. The patent details the design of the house, from its six-sided exterior construction, to the division of the resulting hexagon into three smaller hexagons and several smaller diamond-shaped rooms in the corners to serve as storage, stairwells, or porches, a central chimney stack at the junction of the three main rooms, and a mansard roof. A key feature of the plan was an economical use of building materials by a skilled architect, wherein a larger area could be enclosed with the same length of perimeter material, and she personally thought that a hexagonal building offered more aesthetic opportunities than the rectilinear standard. She described her design in her patent letter: \\"My invention consists of a welling-house or other building, hexagonal in form, and enclosing a space separated into hexagonal and lozenge- shaped rooms, ... also of a chimney-stack, arranged at the junction of the walls of the adjacent rooms, and containing flues communicating with the fire- places in several rooms.\\" She goes on to say, \\"The objects of my invention are the economizing of space and building-materials, the obtaining of economical heating mediums, thorough lighting and ventilation, and facilities for inexpensive ornamentation.\\" Legacy While her design for a hexagonal home may not have become as popular as she had hoped, her initial foray into the field of architecture paved the way for later women architects, including Louise Bethune, the first professional woman architect in America. As with several other women trying to break into the field of architecture in the mid 1800s, her work focused on domestic sphere and the residence, in alignment with public sentiment of the time, but was an instrumental step in achieving admittance and earning respect in a field largely regarded as a job for men. There is much debate about the originality of her hexagonal plan, as Orson Fowler, a phrenologist, published a book in 1848 outlining an octagonal house that was \\"based on the saving of space, economy of materials, [and] felicity of ventilation.\\" A Home for All bears striking resemblance to many of the virtues espoused by Irwin, and an interview with the local newspaper revealed she was familiar with the fad that originated in New York and spread throughout the Northeast, though she insisted her work was totally original and of a different nature than the former. The octagonal format house saw significant development in the mid 1800s but died out around the start of the civil war, due in part to the thoroughness of the author who developed floor plans for each floor of the house, variations in room layout, construction plans, and significant discussions of each design decision made possible by its format as a book, whereas Irwin's patent had few due to its format as a patent letter.

The case was an influential decision in Australian Private International Law which is generally regarded as based on an extension of the Mo√ßambique rule to actions for infringement of patents.. Facts Charles Potter was an analytical chemist who lived in Melbourne, Victoria who in 1901 obtained patents in New South Wales and Victoria for a froth flotation process using sulphuric acid to separate silver, lead and zinc ores from waste. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, now BHP, was incorporated in Victoria and operated a silver, lead and zinc mine Broken Hill. Guillaume Delprat, the General Manager of BHP, claimed to have discovered a similar process, and this was used at BHP's mine.. Potter commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria. BHP denied the novelty and utility of the patented process, but also that an action for the infringement in New South Wales of a New South Wales patent was not justiciable in Victoria. The question of law whether the claim was justiciable in Victoria was referred to the Full Court. Potter was represented by Higgins while BHP was represented by Isaacs .Both Isaacs and Higgins were also members of Parliament, however each maintained a practice as a barrister at the Victorian Bar, until their appointment to the High Court in 1906. A majority of the Supreme Court held that the Victorian Courts had no jurisdiction to deal with the suit as the cause of action was local to New South Wales. Potter appealed to the High Court. Judgement In a key statement affirming the application of the Mo√ßambique rule, Griffith CJ stated: > It is settled law that an English Court cannot entertain a suit in which the > question of title to foreign land is directly in controversy: British South > Africa Co v Companhia de Mo√ßambique.British South Africa Co v Companhia de > Mo√ßambique [1893] AC 602, House of Lords, (England and Wales). The Courts > will no doubt entertain such a question of title if it arises merely > incidentally in a case in which the foundation of the jurisdiction is a > personal obligation arising from contract or quasi-contractual relationship > between the parties. He further went on to say: > In my opinion the same rule must be applied to foreign patents that is > applied to foreign lands. The reasons upon which the rule in the one case > are founded are, I think, equally applicable to the other. 'As already mentioned, the decision is generally regarded as based on the Mo√ßambique rule. Although the Mo√ßambique rule is one of the elements in the conclusion of the High Court, an examination of the way in which the case was argued, and of the reasoning of the High Court, shows that it is a decision extending the act of state doctrine to foreign patents.' Judicial consideration =Australia= In 2002 a majority of the High Court indicated that it would like to reconsider this authority, with Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ stating \\"We also would reserve for further consideration in an appropriate case the Mo√ßambique rule,After British South Africa Co v Companhia de Mo√ßambique [1893] AC 602. and the standing of Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd.\\". The matter arose again in the High Court in 2011 where French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ noted that Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd > was argued on a basis which, though conceded, can now be seen to be false, > namely, at 510; see also at 489, 491, 495, 502-503, 505-507. 'that, for the > purposes of the question ... under consideration, the several States of > Australia stand towards each other in the position of foreign States'. No > consideration appears to have been given in argument or in the judgments to > relevant constitutional questions including, but not limited to, the > application of the full faith and credit provisions of s 118 of the > Constitution.. the High Court has not reconsidered the standing of Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd. =United Kingdom= 'It received no attention in the English case-law until it was mentioned by Lord Wilberforce in Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Aegean Turkish Holidays Ltd [1979] AC 508, 536 as authority for the proposition that the Mo√ßambique rule applied in Australia. It was only from the 1980s that it came to be regarded as a significant authority in the field of transnational intellectual property litigation: Def Lepp Music v Stuart-Brown [1986] 273; Tyburn Productions Ltd v Conan Doyle [1991] Ch 75 (both copyright cases).' The 2011 United Kingdom Supreme Court decision of Lucasfilm Limited v Ainsworth, significantly eroded much of the underpinning of this case and of the Mo√ßambique rule, at least within the UK. Notes This case was decided at a time when patents were granted by the several States in Australia, and was subject to the common law rule that each Australian State and Territory is treated as a 'distinct and separate country or law area'..

Over four years, Hata and associate director Kon Ichikawa shot 400,000 feet of film at the Mutsugor≈ç Animal Kingdom. The resulting film, about the adventures of an orange tabby cat and a fawn pug, was released by Toho in 1986 as Koneko Monogatari (Â≠êÁå´Áâ©Ë™û, A Kitten's Story) and was the highest-grossing film of the year in Japan, taking in about $36 million. It was shown that year at the Cannes Film Festival as The Adventures of Chatran. For US distribution by Columbia Pictures, it was cut down from 90 to 76 minutes and narration in English by Dudley Moore was added. It was released in 1989 as The Adventures of Milo and Otis.

It is currently commanded by the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh's son, Ahmed Saleh. It was most notably involved in the 2011 Yemeni uprising, fighting in favour of the Saleh government. The unit was traditionally relied on as the backbone of the regime, and the unit was the best armed and trained in the armed forces. The Defence Ministry both overlooked and engaged in corruption with the unit in order to ensure the loyalty of the unit's leadership.  History  The Republican Guard was raised in 1964 by Yemen's Republican and Nasserist regime based on the Egyptian Republican Guard model of a powerful, heavily armored formation defending the capital city against internal threats. The Guard was initially created and trained by Egyptian and Soviet advisors. The Guard was supposed to be a symbol of the Republican State. Recruits were mostly drawn from the Hajjah and 'Amran Governorates. Each Battalion had a Chief Political Commissar with a deputy in every company, squadron and battery for political education of troops. The commissar was responsible only to the Brigade Commander and not to the Battalion commander. = Role in the 2011-2012 Yemeni revolution = On 15 October 2011, Al Arabiya, quoting defected General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, reported that 7,000 members of the Republican Guard and other security units had defected to the Yemeni opposition. On November 21, anti-government forces stormed a Republican Guard barracks situated in Nahm, a town 70 km northeast of the capital Sana'a. The barracks attacked was used by the 63rd Mountain Infantry Brigade of the Republican Guard. Planes loyal to the regime of Saleh launched several retaliatory strikes against the anti-government forces, who returned anti- aircraft fire using captured base equipment. = Post revolution = Although the Republican Guard under Saleh was counted as one of the most loyal units of the Yemeni Army, the unit has been less reliable for his successor due to parts of it still being commanded by Saleh loyalists. This has led to conflict in the unit between Saleh loyalists and loyalists to the new government. Following an attempt by the new President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to replace the leader of the 3rd Republican Guard Brigade, Tareq Saleh, Saleh led a 65-day mutiny. The mutiny was eventually brought to an end on June 7 after other Republican Guard Brigades managed to disarm the mutinous Brigade. Saleh subsequently relinquished his command and control of the 3rd Brigade, which is regarded as one of the strongest and best equipped brigades in the military, was taken over by General Abdulrahman al-Halili. Another Saleh loyalist, Brigadier General Murad al-Awbali; commander of the 62nd brigade, was abducted by soldiers in the unit after withholding pay from those who had broken ranks with the former president Saleh. Awbali's release was later secured by tribal officials. In an effort to try and curb the power of Brig. Gen. Ahmed Saleh, President Hadi announced a restructuring of the Armed Forces in early August 2012. The restructuring particularly hit the strong Republican Guard, and will see units moved from both the Republican Guard and other units to a new force known as the Presidential Defence Forces, which will be under the direct control of the President. In reaction to these attempts at restructuring, 200 armed members of the Republican Guard protested outside the Defense Ministry, leading to troops having to be deployed in due to worry that the armed protesters might attempt to storm the building. After Saleh's death, Republican Guard forces have reportedly started fighting against the Houthis, capturing many areas in Al Hudaydah city. The Yemeni republican guard and the central security forces have joined to form the 'guardians of the republic' which is Tareq Saleh's private army. They are highly experienced veterans and are reportedly the best equipped and trained forces in the Saudi coalition. Strength 30,000 to 100,000 men commanded by Brigadier Ahmed Saleh. Organization The RG command structure in April 2012 The Republican Guard consists of 20 Brigades: * 1st Brigade (Special Guard) * 1st Artillery Brigade (SCUD Missile) * 2nd Mountain Infantry Brigade * 3rd Mountain Infantry Brigade * 3rd Armoured Brigade * 4th Artillery Brigade (Field) * 7th Infantry Brigade * 9th Mechanized Infantry Brigade * 14th Armored Brigade * 22nd Armored Brigade * 26th Artillery Brigade (Rocket) * 33rd Armored Brigade * 55th Special Forces ' Brigade * 61st Artillery Brigade (Self-Propelled) * 62nd Mountain Infantry Brigade * 63rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade * 72nd Infantry Brigade * 83rd Artillery Brigade (Field) * 101st Mountain Infantry Brigade * 102nd Mountain Infantry Brigade This organization was changed in 2015, just before the outbreak of the Yemeni Civil War.

Most villas did not resemble the luxurious, aristocratic country retreats of the Mediterranean region. Their owners were absentee investors (or the emperor himself), managed by local Gauls whose families were rewarded after the Gallo-Roman wars. It is difficult for archeologists to define a villa; the recovered residences varied in size and style (often determined by economic function). However, all sites designated as \\"villas\\" contain Roman architectural elements found in homes (such as mosaics, porticos, columns and square grounds plans). At first the new Roman masters physically changed very little in Gaul, simply refining the rural economic system in an already intensely farmed landscape. These refinements took the form of technological improvements and enhancing the economic structure (which included the transport of goods and raw materials to larger markets). Gauls (Celts) The Gauls (Celts who lived in Gaul) were a culture rather than a race, nation or empire. They were skilled in metalworking and cattle-raising. The culture began to dominate France around 800 BCE, replacing the existing culture (but not the people). alt=Map of Europe, in two shades of green The Celtic landscape resembled a countryside, with open fields instead of woods; however, Celtic fields were smaller (often square). More fields were used for pasture than for crops because of the need for cattle, sheep and forage. The Gauls intensely managed the forest for wood and forest products; the Romans enhanced the system without dramatically altering it. Villages and hamlets were denser in the countryside during the Roman period; the population (equal to that at the time of Louis XIV) was about 20 million.Yorke 2001, p. 11. At this time, Roman Britain's population of four to six million equaled later- medieval numbers.Yorke 2001, p.7. Homes were better-constructed than most houses built during the Middle Ages; they were built with local materials: timber uprights with plaited wicker, coated with clay, straw and animal hair.Yorke 2001, p. 19. Roman conquest and colonization Julius Caesar and his Roman legions succeeded in their conquest of Gaul from 57 to 52 BCE at the invitation of Gauls in Marseille, who asked the Romans to come to their defense. alt=Small house with large, overhanging pitched roof The Romans occupied and managed their empire with a minimum of administrators, no police force and an army primarily located on the frontiers (much like the French colonial empire of the 17th and 18th centuries. A few Roman natives lived in major towns, but most governmental and economic functions were carried out by local Gauls. This \\"minimalist empire\\" left most people and institutions untouched. New Roman settlements were relatively few; if one paid their taxes and kept the peace, life did not change much during the early centuries of occupation. The primary early-Roman modifications were technological improvements and links to a market economy, which often meant new Roman roads and supplies for the Roman army. The major technological addition was a bigger plough (possibly invented in Gaul), which could break up the heavier soil. This new plough cut deeper into the soil, and the ploughman could regulate its depth. It was usually pulled by four to eight oxen, and had three parts: * Coulter: Knife-like vertical iron blade * Ploughshare: Blade which cut horizontally through grass roots * Mouldboard: Turned the soil to one side The results of these innovations were longer fields (suitable for large estates) and population growth (with the additional food produced). alt=Drawing of simple, two-wheeled plow Roman investors (possibly living in North Africa) bought and sold land, using local Gallic lords to manage the new villa system. These managers built the villas we find today, which historians call a romanitas (Romanized Gallic villa). These Gauls created a wide variety of homes, from two-room cottages to palaces more in keeping with the Roman ideal of life (evidenced in mosaics, columns and other typically Roman features). This romanitas was the passport to a new world of consumer goods, prestige and advancement: urban luxury in the countryside. Locations Originally, historians believed Roman villas to be primarily near urban centers and major roads; their view of the villas stressed their economic autonomy, since transport over land was expensive and slow (even with the improvement of Roman roads throughout Gaul). Today, scholars believe that the villas were linked to a broader empire economy through a system of secondary (and tertiary) Roman roads. These roads were sometimes built (or maintained) by villa owners, especially if the road crossed an owner's land. Owners often hired surveyors, geologists and labourers for the work. Villa sites were places of previous occupation over hundreds (and possibly thousands) of years to reuse stone, water sources, raw materials and transportation links (roads and waterways). In pre-Roman Gaul, tribal areas were divided into parcels approximately the size of a parish (pagi). Each pagus usually had a village at its center, and sometimes Iron Age settlements relocated closer to a Roman road. An adequate water source was the primary site-location factor for a villa. Deep wells were often dug to ensure enough drinking and cleaning water for the family, laborers and livestock. Clean water was also essential for watermills and (eventually) baths, the Roman indicator of a fully civilized life. Types Archaeologists have had difficulties defining villas, since there were a number of local, regional and functional variations. Villa sizes ranged from two rooms to several acres (for rambling houses). The word \\"villa\\" sometimes refers to an architectural style with residential, urban Roman features such as porticos and columns.York 2001, p. 6.Dyson 2003,p.19. Most villas were food-production operations made up of cultivated fields, meadows and forest, with timber use important. Watermills, cowsheds, corn driers, wine cellars and kilns were typical farm buildings. Villas produced wool, leather and tallow in addition to food. Hunting, fowling and fishing were sources of protein.Johnson 2004, p. 7. Beef was important in northern France, and pork in the south; sheep were more common outside the villas.Dyson 2003, p. 66. The transport of produce overland was once thought to be too expensive, but amphorae and delicate ceramics were carried across North Africa (causing archeologists to reconsider ancient logistics).Dyson 2003, p. 61. Although Romans used barges (towed up rivers by oxen, horses, or slaves) on the Rhone River, it is unknown if the same system was used on the smaller rivers of Lower Normandy. Right-of- way would need to be secured by the state, and a clear riverside track would need to be maintained. Some Roman villas engaged in industrial production in addition to food and other essentials. These included:Johnston 2004, p. 29. * Tile works: The correct type of clay and a sizable forest (for fuel) were required. Most French forests in existence today existed during the Gallo- Roman period. *Horse farms *Health spa: Containing a large swimming pool (or bath) *Salt works: On the coast, usually owned by the emperor *Pottery kilns: Similar requirements to tile works, producing amphorae and mass-produced table and kitchenware (such as the popular red ware‚Äîterra sigilata‚Äîfor long-distance trade. Local ceramics for cooking, eating and religious figurines were also produced for consumption.Dyson 2003, p. 50. *Stone quarriesies: The hard work demanded slave labor (often criminals), requiring soldiers and tighter security.Dyson 2003, p. 50-52. * Mining: Precious metals were eventually controlled by the emperor. Community entrepreneurs or private associations controlled most other mines, but all mining (including quarries) was noted for its life-shortening slave work. Most mines were short-lived, located near small villages. *Imperial estates: The civil service or the army administered the emperor's villas.Johnston 2004, p. 30. All villas paid predetermined income and inheritance taxes (tributum) in cash. Materials sold to the army (most commonly leather and corn), were processed on-site. The results were then sent through the empire's posting stations (mansion) to the northern frontier. All industrial villas bought food, iron for tools, wood and other materials locally, hiring local labor. Labor Slave-based villas existed in large numbers (especially after the wars of conquest), but were not dominant; free peasants and tenant farmers working for villas were common as well.Dyson 2003,p.46. The primary source of slaves was war, but abandoned-property owners were also rounded up and treated as slaves.Johnston 2004,p.8. Slaves were considered expensive assets, and treated accordingly. Sometimes several hundred slaves served a medium-sized villa. They were treated as thinking, self-motivated ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù with a variety of skills. Owners were firm but tolerant, admonishing and encouraging with small rewards. Women specialized in a number of jobs: cooks, hairdressers, weavers and laundresses.Rossi 1999,p.22.alt=Relief wall sculpture of three slaves collared together After periods of political upheaval, a father's job legally bound his son to the same work. The Roman institution of slavery in the empire also provided other options. Many were freed for good service, an incentive. There were also opportunities to earn bonuses and buy freedom. A promising young slave might attend the children's lessons; an owner could cultivate his own secretaries, accountants, administrators, and tutors and rent them out. The emperor's slaves were insiders in the wealth system, and could become wealthy themselves.Thomas 1996,p.106. By the end of the second century BCE, 80 percent of the population consisted of emancipated slaves or their descendants. After the wars of expansion, as the slave pool dried up villas converted to tenant or employed laborers. By the end of the empire most slaves worked in domestic service as the owners‚Äô private staff, rather than as laborers on the estates. Architecture Over five centuries, the villa took on many forms. It sometimes began as a simple cottage, which became embedded in a complex of additions; large investor colonial villas were also designed and built, fully formed. Near the empire's end, villas became smaller and more numerous.Johnston 2004,p.15 The classic great villa consisted of a main house with a veranda (or porch) overlooking two rows of buildings (or wings). These were often not parallel, diverging to enhance the effect of distance. The rooms were connected by the veranda, which acted as a hall. Each room had a different function, and all offered little privacy. Some villas were several rooms deep and lit by a clerestory, or dormer windows. Thick walls indicate villas which could have been two or three stories tall, with attics for storage.Johnston 2004,p.17-18. Although fireplaces with hoods have been found, most heating was by braziers burning charcoal or coal. Rarely, a central room was heated by hypocausts (under-floor hot air from fires beneath the house). The venting ran up the walls of the villa, emptying under the roof eaves. This source of venting made the home appear to be on fire because of the smoke billowing from the roof edges and walls.Johnston 2004,p.18. Kitchens were unsophisticated, featuring a masonry hearth with a charcoal fire. Coals would have been scraped into a pile, and a portable grill would hold a pot to simmer or grill meat. Kitchens were often near baths, since both required water; they were detached (or at the end of a building) due to the risk of fire. Some kitchen fireplace ovens used refractory brick, which allowed heat to be gradually released into an adjoining room (a library, study or storage room for drying split wood or wine being artificially aged). Kitchen ceilings were high, again to reduce the fire risk.Johnston 2004,p.19.Rossi 1999,p.19. Reconstructed Roman kitchen (alt=Kitchen corner, with pottery and basket Lavatories were used in towns, but not at villas since trees provided privacy. Rubbish was discarded out the window or into pits. Walls (interior and exterior) and columns might be painted in bright colors, such as red, purple, brown or white. Roof tiles could be a bright sky-blue from the clay-baking process. Painted wall murals rarely survive, but were popular.Johnston 2004,p.38. At least one mosaic appears in all villas, usually on the floor in public areas (and especially in dining rooms by the empire's end). Set in hard Roman cement and buried under collapsed debris, thousands have been found throughout northern Europe. Simple mosaics consisted of a geometric pattern, but an enormous range of cultural and artistic aspects of Roman life were also portrayed (including interpretations of classical literature and Roman mythology). Furniture was sparse by modern standards: a cupboard, sideboard and an occasional table were set along the walls, and brought out when needed. Beds were simple frames. During the late empire, dining was on reclining couches set in threes. Most rooms were square, with chairs and a small table. Increased wealth was spent not on more furniture, but better-quality pieces.Cowell 1970,p.26. The most distinct structure at the villa was the Roman bath, its architectural showpiece: warm, noisy, clean and lavishly decorated. There were two types: Spartan, with high-temperature sauna-style dry heat and a ‚ÄúTurkish‚Äù (moist heat) version with plunge baths. A well- equipped bath would provide both, with the bather entering an unheated room to undress and going into a warm room, a warmer room and a hot bath (perhaps including massage) followed by cleansing. Cleansing was done not with soap, but olive oil scraped off with a bronze tool known as a strigil. Cleansing was followed by a cold plunge bath.Johnston 2004,p.33. Lighting for the baths came through narrow lancet windows. Rarely, pale green glass (glazed or held by crossbars) has been found in windows.Johnston 2004,p.33 Personal lighting came from hand-carried oil lamps. Some lamps had multiple wicks, providing more light but consuming more olive oil. An oil lamp was capable of burning for 40 to 50 hours. On the outside of the villa, hinged wooden shutters protected windows. Walls were rendered or exposed timber and frame. Roofs were made from thatch, tile, stone, terra cotta or a combination, with occasional stone finials.Johnston 2004,p.35 Flower gardens decorated the villas, resembling ordered patches of wild flowers. These gardens were considered necessary for festivals, family altars and banquets. Common flowers were roses, violets, lilies, narcissus, sunflowers, carnations, hyacinths, bluebells and snapdragons.Rossi 1999,p.12. Vegetable gardens were laid out in beds, yielding lettuce, cabbage, leeks, beans and radishes. Fruits consisted of apples, pears, cherries, figs, almonds and plums. Most villas had an aisled barn (rarely two), storing equipment and produce rather than animals. Archeologists have found evidence in these barns of corn drying, metalwork and communal kitchens. The barns may have been partitioned, since workers often slept where they worked.Johnston 2004,p.39. Religion Roman villas illustrate the Christianization of Europe, since the country villa served as \\"pieces of cities broken off\\" and Christianity originated as an urban religion. The Galois aristocrats benefited from conversion by closer ties to Rome (and the emperor's family) after Constantine's conversion. Roman culture was flexible, so a multicultural blend (or sympathetic intermingling) was usually the result with many villas religiously ambiguous.Johnson 2004, p.11. The local peasants (and their pagan traditions) were ignored; pre-Roman religious sites evolved into Roman cult sites and (later) Christian pilgrimage destinations. Because the church kept all records throughout the fall of Rome and the Middle Ages, historians have little information about local non-Christian beliefs.Dyson 2003, p.79. Since historians only know in general terms about Celtic religion, archeology provides additional information. Peasants on the villa estates observed a complex polytheism.Fletcher 1998,p.6. While Gallo-Roman religion considered Mercury (known as Lug by the Gauls) the chief god, there were many nature gods and goddesses for war, thunder, trees and youth. Earth goddesses were Divona (water), Onuava (earth) and Epona (horses and fertility). Villa managers and owners were dependent on local labor. The aristocrats paid lip service to country life with its sturdy virtues, health and innocent pleasures; however, they also felt disdain (mingled with fear) for peasants.Fletcher 1998,p.16. The latter have always faced forces beyond their control, seeking to improve and influence their situation with religious acts. Villa owners sometimes created religious sites on their estates as a destination for pilgrimages, but most were abandoned during the Christian era. Aerial photography has confirmed pagan temples in high-villa-density areas by their distinctive square shape (with over 40 in Picardy alone).Dyson 2003, p.81-82. Evolution and decline As the central empire declined, villas became more self-sufficient and less part of a larger market economy. At the same time, a greater number of smaller villas appeared, exhibiting Roman culture and values. As Rome waned, the provinces waxed at first.Johnston 2004,p.21. From 235 AD (the death of Emperor Severus Alexander) a series of short-lived, sometime incompetent emperors ruled Rome. They generally died violently, after serving for an average of 2.6 years. The high turn-over represents the attempt to find a leader who could deal with the challenges facing the empire. Generals Postumus and Tetricu in Gaul established a separate 'Gallic' Empire 260-274 in response to an invasion of tribes in 259 which reached as far south as Tarrgona in Spain since the legitimate emperor in Rome was too pressed to respond. Bubonic plague (or malaria) may have swept the provinces, and villa owners feared bandit armies. A manpower shortage meant that fewer people were paying taxes.Fletcher 1998,p. 17-18 Some continental villa investors may have moved their holdings to Roman Britain.Johnston 2004,p.28. The Empire actually did not have a budget in the modern sense until Diocletian, 284-305. The authorities resorted to forced requisition to meet needs.From 257 CE to 276 CE began the first series of barbarian invasions pillaging the countryside. These outsiders sensed the disorganization of the Imperial armies on the frontier, and took advantage of the power vacuum: Roman rulers debased the currency to pay the armies, creating enormous inflation. Arbitrary requisitions on rural population caused many to flee the anarchic conditions. Beginning in the early fourth century, more villas appeared to be uninhabited; coins and datable pottery become rare in the archaeological record. The market economy survived, unpredictably, in some parts of Gaul. During this time, archaeologists have found more wooden, temporary construction on villa grounds; some villas added fortifications.Dyson 2003,p.93. A recent, nuanced view is that although massacre sites at villas have been found, most barbarian newcomers arrived with sickle rather than sword; they wanted to be settlers. Backed by armed garrisons living nearby, the new occupiers moved in and dominated politically and culturally. By the early fifth century all villas seemed abandoned as residences; however, archeologists have found small homes built next to the large houses. Some villas seem to have served as cemeteries. Pollen analyses for this period found no drop in crops, indicating that the population largely remained in place and sustained itself.Dyson 2003,p.95-96Johnston 2004,p.58. The whole region between the Alps and the Pyrenees, the ocean and the Rhine suffered considerable damage. It took some decades to recover, however Gaul even in the north recovered some of its prosperity especially in the southern half of the country where numerous massive villas are attested. The beginning of the end of Roman Gaul came as a result of the invasions of tribes in 407 who eventually went to Spain in 409. However, the failure to control or remove the Visigoths in the southwest, the Burgundians in Savoy and the Franks in Belgium resulted in the end of Roman control post 455 (the assassination of Valentinian III opened the flood gates). In 472-475 CE, the Roman Empire lost control of its remaining provinces in southern Gaul to the Visigoths. In the north the last rulers claiming to be Roman were defeated by the Franks in 486. In 470 CE a mass migration to Brittany from Britain occurred.Johnston 2004,p.52. There was continuity from the Roman villa culture and economy.Thomas 1996,p.96. Modern era The size and shape of Roman estates did not change from Roman to Frankish occupation; parish or commune boundaries remained from Roman and (probably pre-Roman) times.Yorke 2001,p.10. Some Christians willed their villas to the church in Spain, which may have also happened in France. Some of these became monasteries; churches often occupied villa sites in the countryside as well.Yorke 2001,p.17. The suffix \\"-ville\\" is thought to derive from villa, and place names often derived from the villa name. From the eighth to the twelfth centuries, Norman agglomerations in France began to acquire names. The prefix ville indicates a rural name; the suffix usually occurred in urban names (meaning the domain of a family's name). Most of this naming was done between the 10th and 11th centuries. A good way to see Roman Gaul is from the sky. Fields may be seen in a rectangular system, with walls and foundations evident. However, without an archeological dig it is often difficult to date artifacts.

While covering a shootout between drug traffickers of the Gulf Cartel and the Mexican Army in the streets of Matamoros on 5 November 2010, Guajardo Romero was caught in the crossfire and killed. His pickup was shot more than 20 times, reportedly by military officers who mistook him for one of the drug traffickers involved in the gunfight. Guajardo Romero had left home earlier that day to cover the military-led operation targeting Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords, who was killed that afternoon. News reports described 5 November 2010 as one of bloodiest days in Matamoros' history. While the official death toll was 10, local newspapers and eyewitnesses reported from 50 to 100 dead as a result of the gunbattles. Career Guajardo Romero was a journalist who worked for local daily Expreso de Matamoros as a print and crime beat reporter in Matamoros, Tamaulipas since 2008. He had previously worked for three other local newspapers: El Bravo, El Ma√±ana, and El Contacto. Guajardo was also member of the Journalists Association of Matamoros (\\"Asociaci√≥n de Periodistas de Matamoros\\"). Although not confirmed, several journalists in Matamoros and Reynosa, Tamaulipas described Guajardo Romero as an enlace (informant) of the Gulf Cartel. =Death= Guajardo Romero, 37, left his home at around 11:00 a.m. to cover a gunfight between the gunmen of the Gulf Cartel and the Mexican Armed Forces in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. While heading to the Secretariat of Homeland Security to gather more information, Guajardo Romero was caught in the crossfire and killed. His pickup truck was shot at least 20 times, reportedly by soldiers who mistook him for a drug trafficker involved in the shootout. According to reports by the Mexican Army, a convoy of eight vehicles from the Gulf Cartel opened fire at several soldiers at around 11:00 a.m. in Fraccionamiento Victoria neighborhood in southern Matamoros. One soldier was killed, while two others were wounded and taken to the nearest hospital. When the smoke cleared, the soldiers discovered the corpse of Guajardo Romero; it was not clear if the journalist was killed by bullets from the Army or from drug traffickers. Guajardo Romero was found dead inside his white Ford Lobo on Pedro C√°rdenas avenue and was recognized by his brother, who is also a journalist. The incident was one among a number of armed confrontations and violent events that were registered that day in Matamoros, and led to the death of the drug lord Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former co-leader of the Gulf Cartel. Guajardo Romero was buried in the Pante√≥n Jard√≠n cemetery in Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 6 November 2010. Context Since 2006, Mexico has been in a prolonged drug war with rival drug trafficking organizations, and violence from the drug war has spilled over from conflicts between Mexican military and the cartels to the general population, including journalists. President Felipe Calder√≥n first confronted the drug cartels militarily in 2006, and has used the Mexican Armed Forces to fight them. The Gulf Cartel, which was headed by the drug lord Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, is primarily involved in the cocaine and marijuana trade through the Matamoros‚àíBrownsville corridor. Mexico has one of the most abundant crops of illicit drugs in the world. The arrest of Antonio's brother Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n in 2003, among other factors, caused the split and rivalry between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. The drug cartels have fought back violently against the military and have used violence to strike fear on the civilian population. In addition, journalists have also been targets of the drug gangs when they have reported on their criminal activities. Reactions In a phone call between President Barack Obama and President Felipe Calderon, Obama offered his condolences for the loss of Mexican lives in the gunfight, which included Carlos Guajardo. The Ministry of National Defense (SEDENA) in Mexico released the following statement: \\"Generals, chiefs, army officers and air force personnel, together express their condolences of our supreme citizen commander Felipe Calderon Hinojosa, President of the Republic, towards the families of our fellow soldier and the journalist Carlos Guajardo-Romero, who both lost their lives in the line of duty.\\" Gregorio Salazar, director of International Federation of Journalists' Latin American office, said: \\"Danger is never far away for our Mexican colleagues who operate in one of the most hostile environment for media. The need for better protection and a safer practice of journalism has never been greater in Mexico.\\" The Expreso de Matamoros newspaper issued an article speaking out against the drug-related violence in the state of Tamaulipas and asking for an extensive investigation for the death of their reporter. Guajardo's death marked the 11th Mexican journalist to have been killed while reporting in Mexico in 2010 and the 66th killed since the year 2000. Legacy Guajardo Romero is survived by his wife Patricia Guajardo Adame and his three children. Patricia was presented with a plaque by the La Asociaci√≥n de Periodistas de Matamoros in January 2011 as a tribute to Guajardo's contributions to the journalism profession.

Salmon Run was the first game in Williams's career, followed by a string of successes noted for their oddball concepts.James Hague, \\"Bill Williams Remembered\\" The player takes the role of Sam the Salmon, as he attempts to swim upriver to mate. Along the way he encounters waterfalls, a bear, fishermen and seagulls, all attempting to eat him. If he survives to the spawning grounds, he is met and kissed by his mate. In 1983, Salmon Run was released for the VIC-20 by Synapse Software using the name Showcase Software. Gameplay In basic gameplay terms, Salmon Run is similar to contemporary bird's-eye view racing games like Bump 'n' Jump. The player's character is movable within a fixed area near the centre of the screen while the scenery scrolls down from the top of the screen, simulating travel towards the top of a large map. As the map scrolls, the player moves primarily side-to-side to avoid obstacles. Each player starts with one life and gains another for each successful round. Hitting the rocks or bank of the river drains Sam's life slightly. Along the way there are a series of rapids which will stop Sam's motion upriver until he jumps them by pressing the fire button. After landing, Sam dips underwater, and can stay there by holding down the button. More dangerous are the bears, fishermen and seagulls that will kill Sam instantly if caught, but can be avoided by careful swimming or hiding underwater. On reaching the end of the map, Sam meets and kisses his mate, and the round starts over with a new map and more enemies. Reception Softline in 1982 noted the unusual gameplay of saving things, not destroying them. The magazine praised the \\"outstanding ... remarkably lifelike\\" sound effects, and concluded that \\"Salmon Run is a charming game that gives the player a genuine sense of ecological accomplishment; it's also quick to learn and quite contagious\\".

It began as a primary school in 1940, and a secondary section was founded in 1962. One feature is the regular staging of British operas by the students. History =Establishment of primary school= Our Lady of Salvation School was started by Msgr. George Fernandes on 6 June 1940 in a small room at Mohammed Mansion, Gokhale Road, South, Dadar (w) for the upliftment of the poor and the marginalized boys from the wadis of Dadar. After Msgr. George's transfer, Msgr, F.X. Vaz took over the school as a parish school. Later, Mrs. Elizabeth D'Souza (then Mrs. Elizabeth Lobo) took over from Ms. Ida Lawrence and was headmistress for ten years. Mrs. Cissy Mendonca was appointed Headmistress around June 1950. By now, the school was shifted to two rooms in Ekbal building. Later, when the Dadar Convent shifted to a new school building at Prabhadevi, the primary school occupied the building next to the church. In 1962, an application was made to the education department to start a secondary school to meet the needs of the growing number of children. On 10 June 1962, the secondary section started and was named Our Lady of Salvation High School. =Establishment of secondary school= The first principals of the secondary school were Fr. Phillip D'Souza, Fr. Michael Paes, Fr. Valerian Godinho and Fr. Noel Britto. On 16 March 1968, the Christian Brothers were given charge of the school. The first principal was Br. J.A.McPhilemy, and he was joined by Br. M.D. Curran and Br. L. Mousely. To build up the self-esteem and self-confidence of the poor boys, Br. Curran staged an opera, 'The Mikado'. After that, operas have been staged at regular intervals. Br. Sebastian George is currently the principal. Annual activities Although located in a lower middle income area where the idea of an opera was unfamiliar to many, the school has produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas year after year, successfully performed by students with a minimal background of English music, customs, traditions or the English language itself.

Computer technology allows the practitioner to select particular flow patterns, along with volume and pressure settings, in order to achieve the best patient outcomes and reduce complications experienced while on a mechanical ventilator. Modern lung ventilators are able to generate three basic wave forms of flow: squared waveform, descending waveform, and sinusoidal waveform. A square waveform pattern is found on most mechanical ventilators, old and new, and achieves a constant flow. During the inspiration phase, the flow rate rises to a predetermined level and remains constant, thus giving the appearance of a square wave form.

He is ranked 9th dan black belt and is the first European to have been promoted to Grandmaster by the International Taekwon-Do Federation. Howard is now retired, but was a roofer by trade and is well known for apt demonstrations of smashing roof tiles. He has appeared on Ireland's most popular television show, RTE's The Late Late Show, on two occasions, most recently following his promotion, where he undertook a demonstration of tile breaking, and originally in 1976 where he famously broke his hand live on the show when he was undertaking a demonstration of block smashing. Early life Howard was born in Mountjoy Square, Dublin, Ireland and he was raised in the Whitehall area of Dublin, before moving to the Santry, Dublin, where he resides now. Establishing Taekwondo in the Republic of Ireland Howard was at the forefront of establishing taekwondo in the Republic of Ireland.Howard, R. J. (c. 2003): The history of Taekwon-Do in Ireland Retrieved on 3 May 2012. Since the early 1970s, he has represented Ireland in taekwondo all over the world and has had a distinguished martial arts career with many international achievements,Howard, R. J.

Howard Retrieved on 3 May 2012. initially as a competitor where he won two silver medals in the World Championships in Oklahoma, USA, later as an Umpire in competitions, and more recently as VIP at the Taekwon-Do World Championships in Pyongyang, North Korea. When Howard first became involved in martial arts, in the early 1960s, taekwondo was unheard of in Ireland. He therefore started his training in karate in 1966 in Gardiner Place, Dublin. After several years, a Korean instructor (Yung Wu Kwon, 3rd dan) arrived at the club and began teaching them after he had moved to Ireland to look for work. Kwon was Howard's first introduction to the Korean martial art of taekwondo. Howard and his early classmates (Liam Dandy, Frank Matthews, and Paul Kavanagh) had never seen techniques like these before and were extremely impressed. Later, another Korean instructor (Chang Ho Cho, 5th dan) started to teach and train in the hall. Cho graded Howard, Dandy and Matthews to red belt, but shortly afterwards he had to leave for the USA in search of work. The class continued to train together and after a while they heard of another Korean black belt who had just arrived in England from Singapore, Rhee Ki Ha (then 5th dan), whom they contacted and arranged to visit him in Coventry where he was living. Rhee agreed to come to Dublin and watch them train, after which he travelled to Dublin on a monthly basis to instruct and train the Irish students for a whole weekend at a time. In May 1971, Howard, Dandy, and Matthews's techniques and skills were rigorously tested for their black belts in Oxford, England. As a test of power they were required to break two inches of timber with various kicks, punch ten tiles, and finally chop a house brick. Howard, Dandy, and Matthews passed to become the first Irish taekwondo black belts. On their return to Dublin, they set in motion a programme to establish a strong taekwondo presence in Dublin. One year later, in 1972, with the help of Rhee, the Republic of Ireland Taekwon-Do Association (RITA) was established.Republic of Ireland Taekwon-Do Association (2012). Retrieved on 3 May 2012. The members of the RITA then travelled the country performing demonstrations in order to boost develop public awareness of the martial art with result that further taekwondo schools were established throughout Ireland. In June 1973, Howard, Dandy, and Matthews were awarded their second degrees in Dublin, which coincided with the first home international against Turkey. On this first occasion, Ireland were the losers. At the 1974 World Championships, held in Canada, Ireland came third overall, with Dandy taking the title of Best Fighter. In 1975, Ireland then beat England in an international contest.Howard, R. J. (c. 2011): History ‚Äì Grandmaster Robert J. Howard Retrieved on 3 May 2012. Three years later, at the 1978 World Championships held in Oklahoma, USA, Howard won two silver medals while Dandy took home a gold. In 1979, Howard (along with Dandy) received his 4th dan, after which he ceased being an international competitor but continued to travel abroad to tournaments as an international umpire. In recognition of their efforts to strengthen ITF taekwondo in Ireland, Rhee presented Howard and Phelan with awards for their indomitable spirit. At the same time, Rhee honoured Howard by bestowing upon him the position of president of the RITA. In 1995, both Howard and Phelan received their 7th dan and became the first Irish men to become Masters in taekwondo. At the time of their awards, there were only two other Europeans to hold such a title. In 1999 and 2000 respectively, Liam Dandy and Francis Barrett were also promoted to Masters 7th dan.

He is now founder and CEO of smartphone app developer and publisher Kwalee. Early life Darling's father was a contact lens pioneer married to an Australian; they had 7 children. In his early life Darling lived on three continents‚Äîin the UK, in the Netherlands, in Australia, in France and in Canada‚Äîbefore finally settling in Crewkerne, Somerset. While in France, the family lived on a boat and travelled through the country, settling for a time in Cap d'Agde. Darling attended 14 different schools in this time including Wadham School where he took classes in Computer Studies. His teacher, Mr. Evans, once told him to, \\"Stop programming games ‚Äì it's a waste of time!\\" Darling would often stay behind after school to program, as there was only one keyboard available in the classroom. During the day he would have to use punch cards while other children had access to the sole keyboard. Codemasters Darling starting writing video games on a Commodore PET with his brother, Richard, in the bedroom of their home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada when Darling was 11 years old. This continued when the brothers moved to Crewkerne, Somerset to live with their grandparents. They then duplicated these games themselves and sold them via small advertisements in magazines such as Popular Computing Weekly. Soon they were earning more money than their father, who returned to England to manage the burgeoning business. In 1982, when Darling was 16, they formed the company Galactic Software and supplied a succession of games to be published by Mastertronic, including The Last V8 (published under their MAD brand), one of several titles written by Darling. Codemasters was formed in 1986 by Darling with his brother Richard and his father Jim to publish their games themselves. Initially it was housed in an industrial unit in Banbury, Oxfordshire, then moved to offices converted from the stables, barns and other outbuildings at Lower Farm House, outside Southam, Warwickshire. Initially Codemasters concentrated on what were known as \\"budget\\" games at the ¬£1.99 then ¬£2.99 pricepoint for 8 bit home computers such as the Sinclair Spectrum and Commodore 64. With titles such as BMX Simulator, Rock Star Ate My Hamster and Pro Skateboard Simulator. Codemasters developed a reputation for innovation with features such as simultaneous four player gaming. They also had major success with the Dizzy series of games developed by the Oliver Twins, who later went on to found Blitz Games Studios. Within the first year of trading Codemasters was the best selling game publisher in Britain with in excess of 27% of the total market according to the Gallup charts. In 1990 Darling co-developed the Game Genie, a game modification device for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other game consoles; this went on to become the 5th best selling toy in the United States of America in Christmas 1991. Codemasters evolved as a game developer to produce full price games across all current platforms, sold globally. Notable successes included the Colin McRae Rally series and Operation Flashpoint. In 2000, Darling won the UK National Entrepreneur of the Year Award. He sold out his interests in Codemasters in 2007. In the Queen's birthday honours in 2008, Darling was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for \\"services to the computer games industry\\". Kwalee In 2011, Darling founded Kwalee in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire to develop and publish smartphone applications. In July 2012, Darling used his personal blog on the Kwalee website to say that video game consoles have become \\"like dinosaurs heading for extinction.\\" He elaborates by saying he believes that Apple and Google will take over the market which was once established by the likes of Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft. In the same month, Darling also met with Vince Cable MP to discuss the British Government's plans for business growth in Leamington Spa. Personal life He lives in Ashorne House, Ashorne, Warwickshire, England.

Cooperative organization of bacterial colonies: from genotype to morphotype. Annu Rev Microbiol. 1998;52:779-806. Being part of a large cooperative, the bacteria can better compete for food resources and be protected against antibacterial assaults. The P. dendritiformis exhibit many distinct physiological and genetic traits including Œ≤-galactosidase-like activity causing colonies to turn blue on X-gal plates and multiple drug resistance (MDR) (including septrin, penicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, streptomycin and mitomycin C. Colonies that are grown on surfaces in Petri dishes exhibit several folds higher drug resistance in comparison to growth in liquid media. This particular resistance is believed to be due to a surfactant-like liquid front that actually forms a particular pattern on the Petri plate. Similar to other social bacteria Paenibacillus species, P. dendritiformis can form complex patterns on semi-solid surfaces.

Communicating with each other using a variety of chemical signals, bacteria exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic and epigenetic adjustments. The bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed information processing to glean and assess relevant information. The information is then used by the bacteria for reshaping the colony while redistributing tasks and cell epigenetic differentiations, for collective decision-making and for turning on and off defense and offense mechanisms needed to thrive in competitive environments, faculties that can be perceived as social intelligence of bacteria.

J R Soc Interface. 2005;3(6):197-214.Ben-Jacob E, Cohen I, Golding I, et al. Bacterial cooperative organization under antibiotic stress. Physica A. 2000;282(1-2):247-282. ‚Äì the calls can cooperatively make drastic alterations of their internal genomic state, effectively transforming themselves into differently looking and behaving cells which can generate colonies with entirely different organization. Under conditions somewhat more favorable to motion, such as growth on a softer substrate, the bacteria engineer classes of chiral colony patterns in which the branches are thinner and curl in the same direction (Figure 2). Accompanying the colonial structure is a designed genome change: the bacteria are now programmed to become longer and have multiple chromosomes. The morphotype transition are both inheritable - the identity is maintained during LB growth and even through sporulation/germination, and reversible ‚Äì for example the reverse transitions from chiral to ordinary branching occur on harder substrates (when higher bacteria densities are required to produce sufficient amounts of lubrication). Optical microscope observations during colony development reveal the following: upon elongation, the cells alter their collective movement from the typical run-and-tumble to a coordinated forward-backward movement with limited tumbling. Genome sequence The genome sequence of the P. dendritiformis is now available and will be soon published. Genetic information can be received upon request from the Tauber Sequencing Initiative at Tel-Aviv University, Israel. The genome was sequenced by a hybrid approach using 454 Life Sciences and Illumina, achieving a total of 340X coverage, with 99.8% sequence identity between the two methods. Preliminary analysis of the P. dendritiformis genome (approximate size of 6.6Mbp) revealed 6,782 open reading frames (ORFs). The analysis also unveiled the P. dendritiformis potential to produces a wealth of enzymes and proteases as well as a great variety of antimicrobial substances that affect a wide range of microorganisms. The possession of these advanced defense and offense strategies render P. dendritiformis as a rich source of useful genes for agricultural, medical, industrial and biofuel applications. Competition between sibling bacterial colonies In 2000 it was discovered, that two sibling colonies (colonies taken from the same mother colony or from the same LB growth) of the P. dendritiformis inoculated side by side can inhibit the growth of one another (Figure 4). Recent detailed studies of the phenomenon in the branching morphotype, revealed that the two colonies not only inhibit each other from growing into the territory between them but induced the death of those cells close to the border. Material extracted from the agar gel between two colonies was found to kill single growing colonies.Be'er A, Zhang HP, Florin EL, Payne SM, Ben-Jacob E, Swinney HL. Deadly competition between sibling bacterial colonies. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Jan 13 2009;106(2):428-433 By employing molecular biology methods combined with the new genome sequencing information and bioinformatics, they discovered a new toxin (sibling lethal factor), which acts selectively only on the same bacterial strain. The findings suggest a new strategy for fighting bacteria by self-toxins they produce.Be'er A, Ariel G, Kalisman O, et al.

V. Vishveshwara (6 March 1938 ‚Äì 16 January 2017) was an Indian scientist and black hole physicist. Specializing in Einstein's General Relativity, he worked extensively on the theory of black holes and made major contributions to this field of research since its very beginning. He is popularly known as the 'black hole man of India'.Sumangala S. Mummigatti, Science Reporter, NISCAIR, CSIR, Dr KS Krishnan Marg, New Delhi - 110 012. p. 31 (ed. April 2017)  Biography  = Academic training and university positions = With initial interest in particle physics Vishveshwara joined Columbia University, where Robert W. Fuller was his mentor. Later he developed interest in General Relativity and encouraged by Fuller, transferred to University of Maryland to work with Charles W. Misner. He received his AM degree from Columbia University. Working on the Stability of the Schwarzschild Black Hole under Misner, he obtained his PhD from the University of Maryland. He subsequently served on the faculties of New York University, and University of Pittsburgh. After his return to his hometown, Channapatna, famous for wooden toys, of Bengaluru, India, he was a senior professor at the Raman Research Institute and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. Vishveshwara has also held the position of Visiting Professor at several universities including University of Pennsylvania, University of Maryland, Boston University, University of London, and Universidad del Pais Vasco. = Research = Vishveshwara was one of the first to analyze the structure of black holes employing spacetime symmetries thereby demonstrating the existence of the ergosphere. He proved the stability of the non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, a crucial factor that ensures its continued existence after formation. Further, he discovered the quasinormal modes of black holes. These modes of black hole vibrations are one of the main targets of observation using the gravitational wave detectors. In later years, he investigated black holes in cosmological backgrounds, an important aspect of black hole physics that had hardly been explored. Vishveshwara has also made significant contributions to other areas of general relativity such as the exact solutions of Einstein's field equations, gravitational collapse, compact stellar objects, inertial forces, and spacetime perturbations.  Books and other publications  In addition to authoring a number of technical papers, Vishveshwara has co-edited ten volumes on relativity, astrophysics and cosmology including those published by Cambridge University Press and Kluwer Academic Publishers. He has contributed articles to these volumes and illustrated two of the volumes with his cartoons. Further, he has written a number of popular articles on various topics in science. His book \\"Einstein's Enigma or Black Holes in My Bubble Bath\\" received highly complimentary comments from Roger Penrose, Nobel laureate Anthony James Leggett, Charles Misner and other readers worldwide. It has also been translated to Italian. \\"Black Holes, Gravitational Radiation and the Universe: Essays in Honour of C.V.Vishveshwara,- Bala R. Iyer and Biplab Bhawal(eds)\\", (Kluwer Academic Publishers (1999)) contains essays contributed by Roger Penrose, Jacob Bekenstein, Abhay Ashtekar, Ashoke Sen etc.  Planetarium and promotion of science  As founder-director of the Planetarium in Bangalore, he has written the scripts of several planetarium programmes and directed them. These are aimed at presenting difficult concepts in a simple and attractive manner. Vishveshwara has also produced two short science films. To promote research as a part of education he started \\"Research Education Advancement Program\\".The Bangalore Association For Science Education (Base) As a part of it, undergraduate students are taught in fundamentals of Physics or Biology by practicing scientists in the field and selected students are involved in research projects at institutes like Indian Institute of Science, Raman Research Institute, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, The National Centre for Biological Sciences.

It was active during World War II as a Third Air Force training airfield. It was closed on 30 September 1945, two years prior to the establishment of the United States Air Force as an independent service. Today, the facility is Page Field, a civilian general aviation reliever airport. Prior to the construction of Southwest Florida International Airport in the 1980s, it also served as a commercial service airport for the Fort Myers / Lee County area. History In 1924, the city of Fort Myers, Florida, purchased 670 acres of land south of the city with the intention of developing it into a municipal golf course. However, that plan was halted when a Florida \\"Land Bust\\" stopped development. In 1927, it became a civil airport named \\"Palmetto Field\\", for the large amount of palmetto brush growing in and around the airport. National Airlines commenced regular flights into the airfield in 1937, but those were soon discontinued due to the poor landing conditions. Efforts to upgrade the airfield were boosted by a January 1940 Works Projects Administration (WPA) project constructed three concrete runways. In addition, other improvements were made and by the time of the Pearl Harbor Attack, \\"Lee County Airport\\" had grown to about 600 acres in size. =World War II= With the United States at war, the War Department decided to lease the airport from Lee County, and the initial lease for its military use was signed in February 1942, and later renewed in June 1944. The airport was turned over to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Air Forces, who assigned it to Third Air Force. At first, the USAAF called the airport Fort Myers Army Air Base; eventually the field would be named Page Field Army Airfield to honor Captain Richard Page, a World War I aviator killed in a seaplane accident near Everglades, Florida on March 3, 1920. Captain Page was the first person from Florida to join the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. During World War I, he was credited with three German aircraft destroyed in combat and was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross along with the French Croix de Guerre and other awards. Along with the existing airport, the ground support station at Page Field construction of a large number of facilities based on standardized plans and architectural drawings, with the buildings designed to be the \\"cheapest, temporary character with structural stability only sufficient to meet the needs of the service which the structure is intended to fulfill during the period of its contemplated war use.\\" To conserve critical materials, most facilities were constructed of wood, concrete, brick, gypsum board and concrete asbestos. Metal was sparsely used. Page Field was designed to be nearly self-sufficient, with not only hangars, but barracks, warehouses, hospitals, dental clinics, dining halls, and maintenance shops were needed. There were libraries, social clubs for officers, and enlisted men, and stores to buy living necessities. Page Field was officially opened as an operational base on 25 April 1943. III Bomber Command The first use of the airfield was by the 98th Bombardment Group, which had been formed at MacDill Field, near Tampa in February 1942, and was moved to Barksdale Field, Louisiana for equipping and personnel assignment. It arrived at Page Field on 30 March 1942 while the base was under construction, such was the need for the facility in the early part of the war. At Page Field, the B-24 Liberator bomber crews practiced formation flying, and other combat maneuvers for about six weeks which they would need for combat missions. The training also included anti-submarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys and the southeast Florida Atlantic coast. The 98th departed in mid-May and wound up in BritishPalestine in July as part of Ninth Air Force. They were replaced by the 93d Bombardment Group, which also moved in from Barksdale Field on 15 May. The 93d also trained with B-24 Liberators. In August, the 336th Bombardment Group arrived with B-26 Marauders from MacDill Field, The 93d moved out to England in September to become part of Eighth Air Force; the 336th was moved to Lake Charles Army Air Field, Louisiana where it became a training unit for medium bomber pilots and aircrews. III Fighter Command In January 1943, the 53d Fighter Group was moved to Page Field from Sixth Air Force in Panama. From this point on, the mission of the base became the training of replacement single-engine fighter pilots. Aircraft used for training consisted of P-39 Airacobras and later, P-47 Thunderbolts and P-40 Warhawks. P-51 Mustangs began to arrive in early 1945 as well. Pilots received about 80‚Äì90 hours of flight training, the number of hours was based on the needs overseas by the combat units. Some pilots received perhaps 60 hours. They initially received orientation flights in a basic trainer, then an advanced AT-6 Texans and then were checked out on the P-39. The major part of their flight instruction included aerobatics, gunnery practice at Buckingham Field, and formation flying. By 1944, Page Field was in full swing, and the base population in January was 276 officers and 1,393 enlisted. By 1944 the P-39 had been phased out and the pilots were using the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Later a less capable aircraft, the Curtiss P-40 arrived and trainees split their time of both aircraft. On 1 May 1944 the 53d Fighter Group was inactivated and replaced by the Page Replacement Training Unit (PRTU), which was part of an administrative change by Third Air Force to streamline the organization of the base. Compared to the training bases, Page Field was a small facility. Buckingham Field, located about four miles east had a total area of 83,000 acres and had over 16,000 men and women assigned. The smallness of the facility was the main reason that Page Field was classified as a sub-base of MacDill Field; later Sarasota Army Airfield. As a result, Page did not receive the same level of attention from Third Air Force as a base operating under its own authority. A significant change in the training program took place in March 1945 with the arrival of the P-51D Mustang. The P-51s replaced the obsolete P-40s, and was a state-of-the-art fighter. =Closure= As the war began drawing to an end in Europe, and later in the summer of 1945 in the Pacific, the number of trainees and the level of activity at the base was reduced rapidly. With the Japanese surrender and the end of World War II most of the temporary training bases such as Page Field were put on inactive status and eventually closed. Third Air Force began the process of shutting down training activities completely, the field receiving notice in early September 1945 that it would revert to inactive status at the end of the month. Trainees in the last class were sent to Venice Army Airfield and Sarasota Army Airfield to complete their training. At the end of September 1945, there were three aircraft left at Page AAF. An AT-6, a P-51 and a C-45 courier transport. The lease was terminated by the War Department and the training airfield was returned to Lee County by the end of December. Today, much of the World War II Army Air Forces use of Page Field is still evident. Some of the student officers quarters remain, and the former officers' club is now a manufacturing firm for small boats. The baseball field is still in use, and some of the parking revetments can still be seen in aerial photography. The base chapel remains, and other buildings can be found in \\"Page Park\\", the redeveloped base station of the former airfield to the south of the airfield.

The Local Ecumenical Partnership enables the congregation to be of mixed denomination - either Methodist or Anglican. The large parish of St Nicholas incorporates the villages of Sturry with Fordwich and Westbere with Hersden. In 1965 the church was Grade I listed by English Heritage. History =Early history= The first records of a church are from around 690AD. King Wihtred gave Sturry (then called Stour-gau) to the Abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. It is likely that the church then was built on the present site. In 1011AD the Danes invaded and destroyed Minister. Sturry was given to St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury by the Danish King Cnut. The actual stone church buildings were first built in the Norman times. (It is not clear whether the Saxon church was stone or timber). The Normans constructed a long rectangular nave with a smaller rectangle at the east end for a chancel with an altar and a square tower at the west end. As typical of Norman churches, Sturry church had a north door and a south door opposite each other and high windows; three each side in the nave and two each side in the chancel. The tower was built in three stages, rather like a castle keep. It was recorded in the 1086AD Domesday Book as such, and remained so until about the year 1200, when it was decided that the church was too dark and narrow. Two aisles, north and south were built either side of the nave, and arches were knocked into the nave walls. The Norman windows were blocked up - although their traces remain in the stonework above the arches, and the entrance to the tower was enlargened to match the style of the arches. In 1230AD, the chancel was refurbished with double-lancet windows in the south and east walls and a single-lancet window in the north wall. An aumbry (a small cupboard for the chalice, paten and other precious items), a piscina (a niche with a shelf and a drain for washing communion vessels), seats for the clergy (where the present wooden seats are) and a sacristy were built. The sacristy is a small room off the north wall of the chancel. Sometime in the 13th century there were also two other considerable building operations in Sturry church. These consisted of enlarging the chancel arch and erecting the spire on top of the tower. The chancel arch almost certainly took place first, and involved taking down the original Norman arch and building a higher and wider pointed arch. The builders re-used the original Norman stone columns on square bases and they are still to be seen today. The spire was an ingenious feat of carpentry work with wooden shingles on the outside - similarly constructed to the spire of St Mary's church, Fordwich. The north aisle was widened in about 1370 and three new windows were put in along the wall and two wider ones at the ends of the aisle. These are the most elaborate windows in the church with highly decorated stained glass. On the outside, the drip mouldings (which keep the rain off) are neatly finished with carved heads and comic faces. Many are simply nameless creations of stone, but the Abbot of St Augustine's and the king are present at the west end. The font, used for baptism of water, was originally placed by the westernmost pillar in the north aisle. In the pillar, a niche called a chrismatory was built for the jar of holy oil and the candle that the priest would use in the ceremony. The font dates back to the late 12th or early 13th centuries, but the decorated ledge around the top was added during the Tudor era, clearly shown by the Tudor roses. Under the east window in the north aisle is an altar dedicated to Our Lady. The south aisle was widened much later than the north aisle, during the reign of Henry VII, in 1490. It was the fashion then to square off drip mouldings and although some carved heads were added, the weather on the south side has been harsher than the north, and erosion has ruined many of the faces. The altar in the south aisle is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Thomas Childmel is buried in the south aisle in 1496 after he donated some lead to cover the roof. =1500-1800= In 1500, both of the aisles and their chapels had altars and furniture - although there were no pews or chairs, the congregation sat or stood on the stone flags (there may have been a few benches). Across the chancel was a beam, beneath which there was a screen to keep small children and stray animals out from the chancel and sanctuary. On the beam stood the Rood (the crucified Christ with Our Lady and St. John) as on the reredos which stood until 1972 on the east wall of the chancel. There was no pulpit and priests stood on the chancel step to address the congregation. From 1527 the Reformation began and the altars, the lights and the screen were taken away. However, moveable altar tables, pews and the pulpit were introduced. The Sturry Churchwarden's Accounts begin in 1716 and describe the interior of the church for the mid-18th century with high-panelled box pews, the reading desk, pulpit, wooden communion table and a west gallery for the singers, built in 1744. They also describe how the Royal Arms were painted onto a board and hung high above the chancel arch; the same done for the Creed, the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments either side of the east window. =Since 1800= In the early 19th century, in 1812 or 1813, the church's spire fell down (or was taken down). It caused a little damage to the tower, but it was rebuilt with battlements. (Note that the top of the tower is not a perfect square). At the same time, the old porch, built in Tudor times, was in need of repair and the walls were rebuilt using brick and the roof was redone. Some of the old timber beams are still visible on the inside. Later on in the 19th century, all the wooden panelling was removed and the altar was moved back to the east wall. Nowadays, there is a wooden moveable altar table in the same place. The present arrangement of pulpit and choir stalls were set up, and the reredos was moved to a place just behind the chancel. It was taken down again however on 3 June 1972 by men from the congregation. On the back of one of the stone uprights, it was written that the reredos had been constructed on 3 December 1867 by a mason from London. It was replaced by a mustard-yellow curtain which in turn was removed in 2007 due to mildew and damp and now the bare stone wall behind the altar is decorated only by the central wood and brass cross.

It is found in the north east Atlantic, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The species name baccata means \\"berry-like\\" and refers to the small air bladders. Taxonomy This species was known as Cystoseira fibrosa until 1950, when P.C.Silva pointed out that it had first been described in 1768 by S.G.Gmelin, who had found the lectotype in the Netherlands and called it Fucus baccatus. His original material cannot now be found but his illustration serves to identify the species.Studies on marine algae of the British Isles. 4. Cystoseira baccata (Gmelin) Silva Retrieved 2011-09-18. Description Cystoseira baccata is a tough, leathery seaweed of a yellowish or brownish colour. It is a perennial, each year growing new branches up to 50 cm long from a dark brown, cone-shaped base. The main axis is flattened and has a cross section of 1 cm x 0.5 cm. The side branches are alternate and cylindrical, being arranged in a pinnate fashion. The smallest branches are fine and wiry. There are small, lemon-shaped aerocysts or air bladders on the smaller branches. Usually these are single but sometimes there are several in a chain. When the lateral branches are shed in the winter, the base of the main axis can be seen to have a zigzag shape caused by the deciduous primary laterals. The receptacles are terminal, up to 5 cm long, cylindrical with knot-like swellings and covered with tiny threads.Cystoseira baccata (S.G. Gmelin) P.C. Silva The Seaweed Site. Retrieved 2011-09-18.Cystoseira baccata (S.G.Gmelin) P.C.Silva AlgaeBase. Retrieved 2011-09-18. In the spring when new lateral shoots grow there are few if any aerocysts. By the autumn they are more numerous and noticeable. Distribution and habitat Cystoseira baccata occurs from the Baltic Sea south to the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands, Mauritania and Western Sahara. It is commonest in France and Spain, and in the British Isles it is mostly found in the Channel Islands, the south coast of England and the west coast of Ireland. It is usually found on the lower shore and the sublittoral zone attached to rocks or higher up the shore in deep pools with sandy bases. Biology The conceptacles of C. baccata are specialised reproductive cavities and form in the receptacles which are fertile from June until the autumn. Inside the conceptacles are antheridial hairs on which the antheridia or male gametes develop. About forty oospheres or female gametes also develop in each conceptacle. The antheridia are liberated first through a pore called the ostiole and accumulate around it in an orange mound. The ripe oospheres are then liberated and are fertilised externally. They become more rounded and sink to the sea floor where segmentation starts within a few hours. Four primary rhizoids develop from each and the lateral branches soon begin to grow.

A road version of the car was planned, but did not enter wide- scale production; instead, the smaller Ginetta G40 was launched. Development Ginetta G50 In late 2007, in what he later described as his Victor Kiam moment, Leeds-based businessman Lawrence Tomlinson bought Ginetta Cars from the group of enthusiasts, who themselves had bought it out of administration. The G50 was developed to celebrate 50 year of production of Ginetta Cars. With base specifications penned by trained engineer Tomlinson, the car was developed in under six months. Racing Launched in 2008, the G50 was awarded Autosport National Car of the Year in its first year. With its own Ginetta GT Supercup one-make series, the G50 has also been undefeated GT4 class championship winner record holder in the British GT Championship (5), and won the GT4 European Cup in 2009, beating Aston Martin, BMW and Porsche. As a result, Ginetta Cars won \\"Small Business of the Year\\" from the Motorsport Industry Association in 2008, and in 2009 Tomlinson was nominated by the MIA for the \\"Outstanding Contribution to Motorsport\\" award. Road car The first Ginetta G50 road-registered car was shown in April 2008, and then took part in the Silverstone Supercar Tour. It features the same base set-up as the race car, with a proposed development of a V8 model with . Retail prices were estimated at starting from ¬£45,000 ($72,549) for the V6, and ¬£100,000 ($161,220) for the V8. However, due to the economic recession, Ginetta indefinitely shelved plans for general production of the G50, instead opting to produce the smaller, cheaper Ginetta G40. G50 EV Prototype Ginetta G50 EV at Goodwood in 2009 In 2009, Ginetta, in conjunction with Zytek, built an electric version of the G50 named the Ginetta G50 EV Prototype. The car was fitted with a rear-mounted electric motor, with the regular petrol engine being removed. Ginetta gave an estimated range of between 150 and 250 miles. In November, former Formula 1 World Champion John Surtees drove the prototype through the Channel Tunnel, with the car becoming the first production- specification car to be driven through the tunnel. However, production was cancelled following the company's failure to secure a government grant for the project. G50Z Ginetta G50Z In 2008, the Ginetta G50Z was announced. Intended for GT3 class racing, the car featured a 4.0-litre Zytek V8 engine which was then down graded to 3.8-litres before the car was sold to privateer teams due to the mechanical problems. The engine produced in the highest trim. The car focused on improved handling and stability, a front splitter and a large rear diffuser aided in that purpose along with a large rear wing. The engine was coupled to a 6-speed Hewland sequential manual gearbox operated by paddles on the steering column which resulted in faster gear changes than the GT4.

It was directed by Alan Taylor and written by Chad Hodge and Becky Mode. In this episode, Maureen, a newly hired Playboy bunny, gets involved in the murder of mob boss Bruno Bianchi. Nick Dalton, one of Chicago's top attorneys and Club key-holder, comes to her aid; his girlfriend Carol-Lynne makes an ambitious move and becomes the first Bunny Mother. Meanwhile, Bunnies Janie, Alice and Brenda each deal with their own personal issues and secrets while the club's general manager Billy Rosen tries his best to keep the club running without interference from the mob. Development for a pilot episode began in 2010, when 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV attempted to produce the concept in time for the 2010‚Äì11 television season; however, it never materialized. Its scripts were picked up by NBC in January 2011 and two months afterwards, principal photography for the episode commenced in Chicago, Illinois, where it occurred over a period of nine days. The pilot episode was heavily advertised in the weeks leading up to its premiere, as the show's producers collaborated with several companies such as Bloomingdale's to initiate cross-promotional advertising deals. Television critics were generally unimpressed with the episode, with many expressing that it was dull and mediocre. Upon airing, the series premiere was viewed by 5.02 million viewers and was viewed by four percent of the audience in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Plot Nick Dalton, an attorney and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, and goes to the storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton‚Äîchecking on his order‚Äîwitnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck with the heel of her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium. Dalton prompts Maureen to hide in a closet, after hearing her fellow Bunny Carol-Lynne entering his condo. The couple begins to flirt and kiss, only to abruptly end after Carol- Lynne discovers a bunny outfit of a coworker. Infuriated, she ends her relationship with Dalton and calls for her things; she finds Maureen hiding in her closet. Carol-Lynne immediately leaves Dalton's condo, and Maureen returns to the Playboy Mansion with her coworkers. The following day, the club's manager Billy Rosen, speaks with the Bunnies regarding the whereabouts of Bianchi. Rosen later finds Carol-Lynne in his office, much to his surprise. He fires her, after finding out that she has been stealing records of the workers. Meanwhile, Nick Dalton meets up with John Bianchi, the son of the deceased Bruno Bianchi. Carol-Lynne is rehired as Bunny Mother of the Playboy Club by Hugh Hefner. She discusses issues with Maureen in her office, and overtly attempts to persuade her to leave Chicago. After being told of a new training program, Maureen proceeds into the changing room, only to be confronted by a member of the Chicago Outfit. She tells Nick Dalton of the situation, and Dalton insists that he will come to her aid. Once entering in the car, Dalton discusses with John Bianchi on finding the murderer of his father. Meanwhile, all of the Bunnies aside from Alice‚Äîwho appears as a meeting for the homophile group Mattachine Society‚Äîgo to an event at the Playboy Mansion. Production =Conception= 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV were the production companies for the show that eventually became The Playboy Club. They had previously attempted to produce the concept during the 2010‚Äì11 television season but the project never came to fruition. After that initial attempt, the companies approached screenwriter Chad Hodge, who became the show's creator and an executive producer. Imagine co-founder Brian Grazer and president Francie Calfo also served as executive producers, as did Richard Rosenzweig, a longtime executive and consultant with Playboy Enterprises. Alta Loma Entertainment, Playboy's entertainment production arm, received copies of all the story outlines and scripts for review but, according to Hodge, took a very hands-off approach and did not get heavily involved in the creative process. Likewise, Playboy Enterprises founder Hugh Hefner reviewed each of the scripts personally, but did not provide much direct input or request major changes. The original title of the series was Bunny Tales, then Playboy, before the final title The Playboy Club was chosen. The show's pilot script was the first new drama series ordered by NBC for the 2011‚Äì12 television season. =Casting= Producers approached Amber Heard for the role of Bunny Maureen. The main cast includes Eddie Cibrian, who was cast as Nick Dalton, the central character in the series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a \\"chameleon\\" and very charismatic. He continued: \\"On the facade, he seems to have it all. He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's one of the first keyholders at the Playboy Club, but he has a very mysterious past.\\" Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, \\"Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's going to take to really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has.\\" Producers of the show cast Naturi Naughton as Bunny Brenda. Naughton auditioned four times for the role before getting cast, singing the Nat King Cole song \\"When I Fall in Love\\" during one of the auditions. In researching the role, Naughton consulted the black former Playboy Bunny Pat Lacey, watched the documentary film The Bunny Years (1999) and read the book 50 Years of the Playboy Bunny. Brenda was loosely based on the model Jennifer Jackson, the actual first Black \\"Playmate of the Month\\", although neither Naughton nor the Playboy Club producers contacted Jackson in preparing the role. Providing the role of the manager of the Playboy Club, Billy Rosen, David Krumholtz exclaimed that he was drawn to the character and wished to play a role different from Charlie Eppes, the character he played for six seasons on the crime drama Numb3rs. Other members of the main cast include Jenna Dewan, Laura Benanti, Leah Renee, Wes Ramsey, and Sean Maher. Hugh Hefner performed a brief voice-over narration during the pilot episode. =Development= Principal photography for the episode took place in Chicago, Illinois, the same city where the story was set. Filming on the pilot episode began on March 15, 2011, with most scenes filmed on a set at Cinespace Studios on West 16th Street. Some scenes were also shot at the former Meigs Field on Northerly Island. The pilot episode was heavily promoted in the weeks leading up to its airing. Laura Benanti appeared on a retro style cover of Playboy magazine released on September 16, 2011. The magazine had a 1961 theme, which included an old-fashioned visual style, photos of 1960s Playboy bunnies and clubs, and the same sixty cent price as that time period. Benanti wore a black bunny costume and held a tray with drinks on the cover photo. NBC also entered into a cross-promotional deal with the Bloomingdale's department store. The Walton Street store in Chicago included display windows inspired by the series, which were unveiled in September 2011 by Benanti, as well as Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey. Chosen for the storefronts due to its close proximity to the original Playboy Club, the Walton Street store allowed visitors to take virtual photos with the show's stars, view photos of the real-life clubs and the show's set, and enter into a contest to win such prizes as a walk-on role on the show and a $5,000 Bloomingdale's shopping spree. Reception =Ratings= The series premiere of The Playboy Club was initially broadcast on September 19, 2011 in the United States on NBC. It was watched by 5.02 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five-0 on CBS and Castle on ABC. That was the lowest viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot, with Castle drawing 13.28 million households and Hawaii Five-0 attaining 12.19 million households. The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next, with an average of 5.36 million households tuning in for the first half-hour and an average of 4.69 million households for the second. The debut earned a 1.6 rating/4 share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings, indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast, which represented 1.6 percent of the total demographic. This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic. Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced, but NBC officials told Deadline Hollywood that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to send a message that the network was willing to give all their new shows the necessary time to find an audience and succeed. Similarly in Canada, the pilot episode was viewed by 485,000 viewers. =Critical response= Critics were generally unimpressed with the series premiere. Mike Hale of the New York Times critically panned the episode, writing, \\"An interesting drama could be made about Mr. Hefner's success in fusing sex, privilege and pseudo-cool into a wildly successful commercial empire during a conservative time, but The Playboy Club sets out to do much less, and succeeds.\\" Similarly, Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4.5 out of ten, signifying a \\"bad\\" rating. Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery, opining that while there were some potential in the show, it would \\"take a lot more work to get this show off the ground.\\" Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode, expressing that it was \\"glossy\\" but dull and mediocre. Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments, writing, \\"The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it's trying to peddle.\\" In conclusion, Blake and Nugent gave the episode a 'C' grade. NPR writer Linda Holmes challenged the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself \\"silly and full of bad dialogue\\" and \\"cheesy more than offensive\\", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that \\"you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's going on in the rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if you have to go to Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage.\\" The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement.The Bizarre Pitch For 'The Playboy Club': It's All About Female Empowerment? In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, \\"The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors‚Äîno gum chewing, constant smiling‚Äîwearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe.\\" Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that \\"The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series.\\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninteresting, calling it a \\"bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once.\\" Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that \\"the truth is [The Playboy Club] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame.\\"Pergament, Alan (September 19, 2011). Emmy forgiven, \\"Broke\\" sells, \\"Playboy\\" disappoints . Still Talkin' TV. Retrieved November 22, 2011. Several critics drew comparison to the television series Mad Men. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons opined that the episode blatantly mimicked the show's style, and called Eddie Cibrian's performance an imitation of Jon Hamm's Don Draper and even citing specific shots and camera angles similar to those in Mad Men. Lyons wrote, \\"[The Playboy Club] can't copy the lyricism or narrative potency that make Mad Men what it is, which is more than a collection of artfully arranged period hairdos and moody pairs of people in front of rectangle-patterned backgrounds. [But] it's sure trying!\\" TVLine Matt Webb Mitovich felt that despite evoking an accurate depiction of the 1960s, it did not succeed as well as Mad Men. He felt the series was too claustrophobic and that Cibrian was not strong enough for his part.

He also taught law at the University of Denver and the University of Tennessee, and served in the Tennessee state legislature. He was a candidate for governor or senator numerous times between 1912 and 1954. Known as \\"The Great Objector\\" for his uncomprising (and often unpopular) support of progressive causes, Neal was among the U.T. faculty members fired in 1923 by the school's administration in a controversy that became known as the \\"Slaughter of the Ph.Ds.\\" He campaigned for civil liberties, public control of waterways, and workers' rights, and defended striking workers pro bono on several occasions. Neal is often remembered for his eccentric personality and unconventional behavior, which included an almost total disregard for his own appearance. Early life Neal was born John O'Brien Neal in Rhea Springs, Tennessee, the son of John Randolph Neal and Mary Elizabeth Brown Neal. His father had been an officer in the Confederate army during the Civil War, and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1885 to 1889, when he died. Following his death, his son took his name. Neal was educated by private tutors. He received his A.B. from the University of Tennessee in 1893, and obtained his law degree from Vanderbilt in 1896. Neal graduated from Columbia University with a Ph.D in History in 1899. His dissertation, entitled, \\"Disunion and Restoration in Tennessee,\\" analyzed the state's post-Civil War period. In late 1899, Neal moved to Denver, where his sister lived, and accepted a position teaching law at the University of Denver. State legislature In 1906, Neal ran successfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives for the district encompassing his native Rhea County and adjacent Meigs County. He continued lecturing at the University of Denver during months when the legislature was not in session, however, and thus lived in the district he represented for only part of the year, causing some agitation among his constituents. Neal spent his term in the House advocating legislation to better organize boards of education, acquiring consistent funding for schools, and implementing more rigid mine inspection standards. In 1908, Neal was elected to the Tennessee State Senate, representing Rhea and surrounding counties. In early 1909, the senate attempted to pass a bill transferring the power to select county election officials from the governor to the legislature. Neal vehemently opposed this bill, and formed a committee in hopes of defeating it. When it became clear he lacked the votes, he and twelve other senators fled to Kentucky, preventing a quorum in the senate and stalling the vote on the bill. The bill's sponsors called a joint meeting of the General Assembly to sidestep senate procedural rules, however, and managed to get the bill passed. By 1910, Neal had alienated the governor and had made numerous enemies within his own party, and both factions began calling for his ouster. He was defeated in the senate primary that year, and blamed his defeat on the \\"snap conventions\\" engineered by county election officials. \\"Slaughter of the Ph.Ds\\" Neal joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee as a part-time lecturer in 1909, and became a full-time member of the faculty in 1917. His unconventional style, while popular with students, frustrated university administrators, especially the law school dean, Malcolm McDermott. Neal frequently failed to show up for class or grade examinations, and sometimes simply gave every student in the class a \\"95\\" regardless of their performance. He also had a habit of ignoring the prescribed lessons and instead gave rambling lectures on current events. In 1923, a controversy known as the \\"Slaughter of the Ph.Ds\\" erupted when U.T. president Harcourt Morgan opted not to rehire seven professors, including Neal. One of the terminated professors, Jesse Sprowls, stated he was fired because he had refused Morgan's request that he not teach the Theory of Evolution, and Neal suspected he had been fired for coming to Sprowls's defense (historians suggest that while Morgan wasn't personally opposed to the theory, he was concerned that a state legislature hostile to the theory might cut the school's appropriations).Edward Larson, Summer for the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion (New York: Basicbooks, 1997). The American Association of University Professors investigated the incident, but found no evidence that the firings were over the teaching of Evolution. The firing of Neal caused outrage among College of Law alumni, who petitioned the Board of Trustees to reinstate him. Governor Austin Peay, a member of the board, expressed his concern, but reserved judgement until he had heard from both sides. He ordered an open meeting of the board to be held at the Farragut Hotel in downtown Knoxville. At the meeting, Morgan spoke first, and accused Neal of frequently missing classes with no excuse, giving extremely easy exams which he often failed to monitor or even grade, never keeping record of attendance, and ignoring the smoking ban in Ayres Hall. In his response, Neal pointed out that his examination habits were hardly different from those of other professors, and denied he had missed more than a few classes (he also pointed out that McDermott was absent 25% of the time). Several former students spoke on Neal's behalf. In the end, the board voted 5-2 to uphold the terminations, with Peay as one of the dissenters. Following the hearing, Neal convinced the legislature to open an investigation of U.T.'s administration. He stated that the Board of Trustees was illegally constituted (it lacked the requisite number of alumni), blasted President Morgan as \\"legally, morally, and mentally incompetent,\\" and pointed out that the school was the only one in the country that had virtually no Ph.Ds among its president and deans. The investigation quickly fizzled. Scopes Trial In 1925, Dayton teacher John T. Scopes was arrested for teaching the Theory of Evolution, in violation of the state's Butler Act. Neal immediately offered to defend Scopes, and would serve as chief counsel for the duration of the trial. Daytonians, many of whom hoped the high-profile trial would give the town an economic boost, initially welcomed Neal as the first notable figure to arrive, but he quickly alienated them when he asked for the trial to be moved to Chattanooga or Knoxville (his request was rejected). As Neal organized his defense team, renowned defense lawyer Clarence Darrow offered Scopes and Neal his services. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which was interested in the case's constitutional aspects, advised Neal to decline the offer, fearing Darrow would turn the trial into a religious debate. Neal ignored the ACLU, however, and added Darrow to the defense team. He also added ACLU attorney Arthur Hays and former Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby. Upon Darrow's arrival in Dayton, he and Neal immediately began fighting over trial strategy, and each conspired to have the other removed from the defense team. Neal, still bitter over his dismissal from U.T., wanted to defend the rights of teachers, while Darrow wanted the trial to be an indictment of religious intolerance. Neal consistently stated that the trial was not about whether or not the Theory of Evolution was true, but instead involved \\"the freedom of teaching, or more important, the freedom of learning.\\" Following Scopes's conviction, the ACLU grew frustrated over Neal's handling of the case, especially after he missed the deadline to file a bill of exceptions to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which essentially meant they couldn't base their appeal on the state's handling of the case. While Neal's role was somewhat minimized, he nevertheless remained part of the defense team throughout the appeals process, and consistently sought to move the case into the federal court system. Tennessee Valley Authority Throughout the 1920s, Neal was a persistent advocate for government control of the Tennessee River and its watershed. He stated that the nation's navigable waterways and the electricity they generated belonged to the people, and warned that private control of the river would give energy companies monopolistic power. Neal was present (often uninvited) at virtually every meeting on the river's future in the late 1920s, and was often the lone dissenter in favor of public control. Neal took an active interest in the government's completion of Wilson Dam in Alabama in the early 1920s (one of the charges against him during the \\"Slaughter\\" incident was that he missed numerous classes while travelling to Muscle Shoals). In 1925, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the river, and held a meeting in December of that year to discuss allowing power companies to bid for dam sites. At the meeting, Neal warned that private control of the Upper Tennessee River would doom Wilson Dam. He continuously quizzed speaker after speaker, and eventually had to be silenced by Major Harold Fiske. In January 1926, Senator George Norris, in response to a plea from Neal, convinced the Federal Power Commission to suspend further action regarding bids for dams on the Tennessee River, and introduced legislation that would turn development of the river over to the federal government. Though this bill failed, Neal continued campaigning against the power companies. He was the lone dissenter at an Athens, Tennessee, conference on the private development of the Hiwassee River in May 1927, and again at the Southern Appalachian Power Conference in October 1927. Reporting on Neal's presence at the latter, the Knoxville News-Sentinel wrote that he was \\"unqualified to vote, uninvited to attend.\\" By the early 1930s, sentiments had begun to shift, as many Tennesseans wanted the river developed, and didn't care whether or not it was developed by the government or private power companies. With the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Norris's act was finally able to pass, creating the Tennessee Valley Authority. The News-Sentinel reported that Neal was \\"the individual most active in behalf of the Norris program.\\" There was a movement to have Neal appointed to the TVA Board of Directors, but the appointment went to Harcourt Morgan. Though he remained a supporter of TVA, Neal constantly criticized the agency throughout the 1930s. He complained that its wages were too low, accused it of favoritism toward large industries, and complained that it was too slow in buying out independent power companies. After TVA had bought out most independent power companies, Neal complained that the loss of the companies hurt Tennessee counties which had relied on their tax dollars. When TVA forced Neal to sell his Rhea Springs property during the Watts Bar project (when the entire community was inundated), Neal sued, and was eventually paid $55,000 for the land. Political campaigns In the 40 years following the loss of his state senate seat, Neal, a Democrat, ran for U.S. senator 18 times, for governor 9 times, and for the U.S. House of Representatives once, always losing by a substantial margin. He briefly ran for governor in 1910, but withdrew before the primary. He ran again in 1912 (even though he continued teaching at the University of Denver during the campaign), but again withdrew before the primary. That same year, he campaigned for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats, but lost. In 1924, Nashville Banner publisher E.B. Stahlman, an opponent of Governor Peay, recruited Neal to oppose Peay in the gubernatorial primary, but Peay won easily.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000). In 1930, Neal ran for U.S. senator, but lost in the primary to William Brock. He again ran for the senate in 1934, but was defeated in the primary by Kenneth McKellar. In 1944, Neal ran for governor, but lost in the primary to Jim Nance McCord. Two years later, he ran for both governor and senator, and when he lost in the primary in each election, he ran as an independent in the general election. Neal's last campaign was in 1954, when he ran for governor against Frank G. Clement. Later life In the years after the Scopes Trial, Neal took on a number of liberal causes. In 1929, he defended several Gastonia, North Carolina, cotton mill workers who had been accused of killing a foreman during a strike. That same year, he defended several striking workers in Elizabethton, Tennessee, and worked as an advocate for striking students at Lincoln Memorial University. In 1932, he defended striking workers who had been chased out of Harlan, Kentucky. Following the \\"Slaughter\\" incident at U.T., Neal formed his own law school, the John Randolph Neal School of Law. This school reached its peak in the mid-1930s, graduating over 40 students in 1935 alone. It was forced to close in 1943 after the state passed a law requiring full-time attendance at law schools. Neal spent the last few years of his life at his home in Spring City, occasionally visiting nearby Watts Bar Dam. He died of pneumonia in Rockwood, Tennessee, on November 23, 1959. Personality Neal was legendary among his peers for his eccentric personality and his lack of concern for his appearance. He rarely bathed, and slept in his suits, which he would often wear for days without washing. He once appeared on a platform with Eleanor Roosevelt with his shoes untied and shirt and pants unbuttoned, and spent much of the Scopes Trial unshaven and disheveled. In The Great Monkey Trial, L. Sprague de Camp described Neal as \\"eccentric and absent-minded,\\" and \\"as dirty as some early Christian saints.\\" Commenting on Neal's reputation as a wishy- washy politician, humorist Will Rogers wrote, \\"I don't know about the wishy, but he certainly is not washy.\\"William Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), p. 54. After the Scopes Trial, Neal's hygiene deteriorated to the point where he was banned from the S&W; Cafeteria in downtown Knoxville. He was also kicked out of the Watauga Hotel (where he lived in Knoxville) when he refused to clean his room or allow hotel staff to clean it. When asked about his appearance, Neal said he dressed as he did to protest conformity, and stated that neither the government nor society was going to tell him how to dress. Neal also had a habit of never bothering to cash checks, often carrying them around in his coat pocket for weeks. U.T.'s accountants had to consistently plead with Neal to cash his paychecks so they could balance their books, and many students at his law school attended for free since Neal often forgot to cash their tuition checks. A TVA auditor once confronted Neal after he neglected to cash the $55,000 check for his Rhea Springs property, and recalled that Neal sifted through nearly three dozen uncashed checks before finding the crumpled TVA check in his back pocket. In Cormac McCarthy's 1979 novel, Suttree, the title character runs into Neal, who had been a friend of his father's, while walking through the streets of Knoxville in the 1950s. He describes Neal as, \\"a lifelong friend of doomed defendants, causes lost, alone and friendless in a hundred courts.\\"Cormac McCarthy, Suttree (Vintage, 1992), p. 366.

The attack left at least 26 people dead. The victims were Shi'a Muslim pilgrims of the Hazara community, suggesting the attack to have been a targeted killing of sectarian nature. The attack occurred in Luck Pass area near Mastung. The bus was leaving Quetta for Taftan, Balochistan. In addition, 2 others were killed in a follow-up attack on a car on its way to rescue the survivors of the bus attack, which raised the death toll to 28 on that day. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni extremist Pakistani militant group designated as a terrorist organization by Pakistan and the United States claimed responsibility for the attack. Background Many Hazaras, due to economic problems, travel to far and remote areas in search of employment. One of the locations is Taftan, a border town with Iran, which provides many income opportunities for thousands of people daily. Some Hazaras even move to Mashhad and Tehran to earn a living. As majority of Hazara people are from the Shia sect of Islam, likewise thousands of other people from around the world, go to Iran for the pilgrimage of shrine of Imam Reza. Mastung is a town located in the north-west of Balochistan. The majority of the population is Sunni Balochs. Massacre A group of around 10 men on two vehicles, armed with rocket launchers and Kalashnikovs assault rifles, stopped a passenger bus carrying pilgrims in the Ganjidori area of Mastung. The bus was travelling from Quetta to Taftan a border town with Iran. 45 passengers were on board, but only the Hazaras were identified and asked to step out. They were lined up and the assailants started shooting non-stop for ten minutes, which left 26 dead at the end of the day. =Perpetrators= The banned Pakistani Sunni extremist militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) claimed the responsibility for the massacre. The same terrorist group has also been involved in Hazara Town massacre, Ashura massacre, Mosque masscre, and Quds Day bombing. Funeral The burial ceremony was conducted next day, in Hazara Town cemetery. The bodies were taken to 26 Imabargahs within Hazara Town region Protest and reactions Protesters held a peaceful protest against the attack on Hazara pilgrims. The protesters demanded the resignation of Balochistan Chief Minister, Aslam Raisani. Thousands of women and children took part in the protest and demanded United nations to take notice of what has been happening to Hazara people Protests, rallies and demonstrations were held in the wake of the terrorist attack in many different parts of the country, including in Karachi, Skardu, Muzaffarabad, Nawabshah, Sukkur, Ghotki and Multan. The President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, Balochistan Governor Zulfiqar Magsi, Chief Minister Aslam Raisani, The Universal Muslim Association of America (UMAA) and others strongly condemned the barbaric attack on Hazara Shia minority in Quetta. The Chief Justice at the Balochistan High Court took suo moto notice of the killings and issued notices to the federal and provincial Government of Balochistan in the wake of the attack. A committee was formed by Balochistan Chief Minister, to probe the incident and report within 15 days. The committee comprised Interior Secretary Major (R) Chaudhry Qamar Zaman, Inspector General Balochistan Police Rao Mohammad Amin Hashim, Commissioner of Quetta and Khuzdar Division Naseem Lehri, Capital City Police Officer Quetta Ehsan Mahboob, Deputy Commissioner of Quetta Shaukat Ali Maraghzani and Mastung Deputy Commissioner Noorul Haq Baloch. The license of the company which was carrying the pilgrims was canceled by Home Minister Mir Zafarullah Zehri. Iranian Government closed the Taftan border with Iran after the incident.

According to Samuel More‚Äôs account, he was cited before the High Commission Court and Council of the Marches. Samuel‚Äôs testimony states that Jacob and Katherine continued to live at Larden during this period (1616‚Äì1618) and the next action against Jacob was an accusation of trespass. Samuel More‚Äôs account states that Jacob was brought before Justice Warburton in the 1618 Lent assizes, and that Samuel was awarded damages of ¬£400. Samuel goes on to say that Jacob appealed to the Kings Bench, but that the judgment was confirmed, whereupon Jacob \\"to prevent execution fled\\". Nothing is known of Blakeway after this, and Samuel, in his declaration, makes no mention of any efforts to find him. . Katherine More continued to try to regain custody of her children through the courts but, after a four-year legal battle, the case was lost on approximately 8 July 1620. Following the final court action, Katherine's four children were transferred, without her knowledge or consent, to the care of various pilgrim families soon to depart for the New World on a ship called the Mayflower. In Samuel More‚Äôs statement, he wrote that he took this action because of the: \\"great grief of such a spurious brood\\", and the children were dispatched to America in order to \\"provide for the education and maintenance of these children in a place remote from these parts where these great blotts and blemishes may fall upon them\\".The Shropshire Records and Research Center 1037/10/8 and 9 No record of Katherine is found after June 1622.  The More children and the Mayflower  At the time of the Mayflower's sailing in September 1620, the children were aged between four and eight. The indentured servants were intended to be labour in the colony of (Northern) Virginia (present day Long Island). This was the Mayflower's intended destination until winter weather forced the ship to anchor at Cape Cod. A number of colonists travelled as paying passengers on the Mayflower. Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known. Many homeless waifs from the streets of London were to be sent to the New World as labourers. The children were amongst this group.Donald F Harris, The More Children of the Mayflower, Part I, The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 43, no. 2 (July 1993), p. 124R.C.

With many others who died that winter, her name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Cole's Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. * Jasper More, age 7, servant of John Carver. He died of a 'common infection' in Dec. 1620 while the Mayflower was in Cape Cod Harbor. He was buried ashore in what is now the Provincetown area.

She died sometime in the winter of 1620/1621. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been on Cole's Hill in Plymouth in an unmarked grave as with so many others buried there that winter. As with her sister Ellen, she is recognised on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb in Plymouth, misidentified after her sister's name as \\"and a brother (children)\\" ‚Äì the statement of calling her \\"a brother\\" mistakenly coming from William Bradford's failing memory years after the event of her death. * Richard More, age 6, servant of William Brewster. He resided with the Brewster family until about mid-1627 when his term of indentureship expired. This is about the time that his name appears, at age 14, in a census as a member of the Brewster family, in what was called then 'New Plimouth'. By 1628, Richard was in the employ of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, who was engaged in trans-Atlantic trading.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims.

Birth and education Aline Bernstein was born on March 25, 1914, in New York City, the daughter of Irma (Lewyn) and Allen Milton Bernstein, both of German Jewish descent. Her father was the head of an investment firm and an amateur painter. Her mother also painted, and she was encouraged to take an interest in the arts. She graduated in 1931 from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in Riverdale, the Bronx, New York, then went to Vassar College where she studied art and developed an interest in journalism. She graduated in 1935 with an A.B. degree. On 17 June 1935 Aline married Joseph H. Louchheim, a public welfare administrator. The same year she enrolled at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts to study the History of Architecture, graduating with an A.M. degree in 1941. She had two sons during this period, Donald in 1937, and Harry in 1939. Art and architecture critic Aline obtained a job with Art News magazine in 1944, becoming managing editor from 1946 to 1948. From 1948 to 1953 she was associate art editor and critic at The New York Times, and published articles on art and cultural trends in various magazines. She frequently wrote about modern architecture and the link between modern art and architecture. Aline divorced Joseph Louchheim in 1951. In January 1953 she went to Detroit to interview the Finnish-born architect Eero Saarinen, who had recently been acclaimed for his General Motors Technical Center. They were attracted to each other at once. Her profile of Saarinen, titled Now Saarinen the Son, appeared in The New York Times Magazine on 23 April 1953. She married Saarinen in 1954, moving to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where his firm had its headquarters. After their marriage, Aline stopped writing on architecture owing to potential conflict of interest. She continued writing for the Times as an associate art critic, now using the byline Aline B. Saarinen. She became \\"Head of Information Service\\" at Eero Saarinen & Associates, a job that included bringing her husband's work to the attention of magazine editors with whom she had once worked. In December that year they had a son, Eames. In 1957, Aline was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship with which she wrote the best selling book The Proud Possessors, a collection of biographies of American art collectors. Eero died suddenly in 1961. Aline stayed with the firm while unfinished projects were completed and in 1962 edited the book Eero Saarinen on His Work. Television In 1962, Saarinen first appeared on television, discussing art. The show was successful, leading to demand for more appearances. In the fall of 1963 she became art and architecture editor for NBC's Sunday show, and art critic for their Today show.

His interest in the alto saxophone developed when he witnessed the close attention his uncle paid to the Charlie Parker record One Night In Washington. Walden was able to procure an alto sax from his middle school music appreciation teacher, and a saxophone player who lived in his building gave him an instruction book. Walden was self-taught until he enrolled in the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art, where he met frequent collaborators Dwayne Burno and Eric McPherson. Walden went on to attend the Manhattan School of Music, and in 1993 won first place in a Charlie Parker competition, which earned him a guest spot with Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra.Myron Walden: Kind of a ComebackPanken, Ted. \\"Windows Wide Open.\\" Downbeat 77.2 (2010): 46-49. Print. Walden began his professional career playing with Roy Hargrove's big band at the Jazz Gallery in 1995, then performed at Smalls with artists such as Kurt Rosenwinkel, Eddie Henderson, Kevin Hays, Stephen Scott, Greg Hutchinson and Eric Harland before earning a regular gig on Wednesday nights with his Apex Trio, featuring McPherson (drums) and Burno (bass). Walden primarily played his own original compositions with the Apex Trio, and recorded four solo albums between 1996 and 2005. During this period, he became a member of Brian Blade's Fellowship Band and The New Jazz Composers Octet, which made three recordings as a unit and two with Freddie Hubbard (with whom they performed several times at the Iridium). Walden took a nearly five-year break from recording as a leader in order to develop his skills on the tenor and soprano saxophones while composing specifically for those instruments. In 2009, he hired Shore Fire Media to promote his new projects, playing five Wednesday nights with five different bands in September at the Jazz Gallery (with all proceeds going to the non-profit venue), and releasing seven albums on his new record label, Demi Sound, over the course of 2009 and 2010. Playing style and critical reception According to JazzTimes, Walden \\"plays with a Phoenix- like virtuosity and an attention to rhythmic detail rarely heard among saxophone players\\". All About Jazz cites him as \\"one of the true bright stars of his generation\\" who \\"has a very distinctive sharp tone with a rounded nasaly-inflection\\" and \\"has shown the ability to develop solos with both an incisive logic and an organic level of invention.\\"\\"Myron Walden: Higher Ground (2002)\\". All About Jazz, September 18, 2002. Accessed January 18, 2014. Describing his performance on tenor sax, writer John Kelman said that Walden was \\"as thoughtful yet fiery a player on the bigger horn as he is on alto\\" and called his 2009 release Momentum \\"a document of one of the modern mainstream's most provocative saxophonists, composers, and bandleaders,\\" favorably comparing Walden's composition \\"Like a Flower Seeking the Sun\\" to Wayne Shorter's title track from Miles Davis's album Nefertiti.Kelman, John, \\"Myron Walden: Momentum (2009)\\", All About Jazz, November 23, 2009. Accessed January 18, 2014. Writing in Down Beat magazine, Ted Panken describes Walden as \\"a widely respected musician's musician with a keening, instantly recognizable voice.\\" Walden frequently plays in a pianoless trio or quartet format, though his 2010 album Countyfied featured an organ trio, the sound of which Walden described as \\"Southern-fried soul meets a little blues and rock 'n' roll,\\" and his dual In This World releases took a \\"harmonically fortified quiet storm\\" approach (according to Panken) with a quintet featuring guitarist Mike Moreno and keyboardist Jon Cowherd, among others.

Main characters of the series The protagonists of this series are the members of the Bear family. In The Big Honey Hunt, the first Berenstain Bears book, the family consisted of Mama Bear, Papa Bear, and their son Small Bear. In 1974, Small Bear was renamed Brother Bear, and authors Stan and Jan Berenstain added Sister Bear to the family. In 2000, they added Honey, a baby daughter. *Papa Bear is the father or dad of the family. He works as a professional carpenter. At the same time, he loves fishing, hunting, eating, drinking and spending time in the woods. He is often portrayed as clumsy and bumbling, though well-meaning. He also loves honey. He is a light disciplinarian (although prone to overreacting when pushed past his limit), often leaving those responsibilities to Mama or assuming the cubs are simply young and will learn as they grow. He tends to think he is above the rules, often resulting in him being used as an example by Mama or having to pay the price in chores. He is voiced by Brian Cummings in 1985 and Benedict Campbell in 2003. *Mama Bear is the mother or mom of the family. She likes to make quilts, work in the garden, and take care of her family. She is gentle and she always wants to settle things peacefully, although she can occasionally lose her temper. She is the main disciplinarian of the family and often uses chores or housework to teach lessons and responsibility. She is strongly opposed to guns and gambling. She is voiced by Ruth Buzzi in 1985 and Camilla Scott in 2003. *Brother Bear (formerly Small Bear before Sister Bear was born) is Papa Bear and Mama Bear's eight-year-old son who is in the third grade. Brother loves all sports but his favorite is soccer. He is often heard to say, \\"soccer is how I get my kicks.\\" He is also a big fan of T. Rex dinosaurs and model airplane building. Sometimes he lifts up rocks to see what strange bugs lurk underneath. Brother is shown to be more quiet than Sister Bear, and he's always willing to make friends. He is voiced by David Mendenhall in 1985 and Michael Cera and later Michael D'Ascenzo in 2003. *Sister Bear is Papa Bear and Mama Bear's six-year-old daughter who is in the first grade. Her hobbies include playing with dolls and her best friend Lizzy Bruin. She also is quite athletic, which showed in various books that she plays baseball with her brother and runs the \\"Bear Country 3-mile run\\" with her family. She can be greedy about her toys, though this generally results in her learning a lesson at the end of the book. When she first met Brother Bear as a baby, she punched him instead of greeting him, but they quickly became loyal towards each other. She's best friends with Lizzy Bruin and, to a lesser extent, Queenie and Babs Bruno. She's more social and outgoing than Brother Bear. She was also jealous of the arrival of the new baby Honey Bear and was mad at her family because she felt that her baby sister has replaced her position in the family. She is voiced by Christina Lange in 1985 and Tajja Isen in 2003. *Honey Bear is the youngest member of the family, and the last to be introduced in the series. Though she can only say a few words, she is considered smart as a baby. She was first introduced in 2000 in The Berenstain Bears and Baby Makes Five, after the series dealt with Mama Bear's pregnancy in The Birds, the Bees, and the Berenstain Bears. Between the two books, there was a contest for readers to name the baby, and the winning name was Honey (the winner was Christian Greaves of Rochester, New York). She is absent in the 2003 series though it can be seen that Sister and Honey, Mama's cousin Audra's daughter have a close relationship in The Berenstain Bears Go to the Doctor but she is seen as possibly four or five years old. Supporting characters *Lady (formerly Little Lady) is the Bear family's loving dog. Brother & Sister Bear adopted her from Farmer Ben's farm in The Berenstain Bears' The Trouble With the Pets. *Too-Tall Grizzly is the tough, troublemaking school bully. He is the leader of a schoolyard gang and, as his name indicates, he is a head taller and larger than the other cubs in his class, though still the same age as them. He has an older sister named Too-Much; their father and mother are Two-Ton and Too-Too, respectively. In the 1985 TV series, Too-Tall is drastically taller, wears a different outfit, and leads a different gang as opposed to in the books, as well as being much less prominently featured. In the 2003 TV series, Too-Tall gradually becomes less of a thuggish bully and more of the cubs' gruff frenemy with a soft side the more he mellows out and befriends Brother Bear. *Queenie McBear is Too-Tall's on-and-off girlfriend, a feminist, and a friend of Brother and Sister. also sometimes being depicted as a crush to Brother Bear in the books, and gets a somewhat crush on Ferdy in the 2003 series, although she originally used him to do hers and Too-Tall's homework, she eventually befriends him near the end. Although she initially bullies Sister, she later becomes friendly to all the cubs at school. In the books, she is the new cub in town that starts an 'in crowd' and excludes Sister for being too small, wearing bows, and riding a tricycle. In the 2003 series, she has been shown to always be a friend of Sister. She is very flirtatious. Although she is Brother's age and classmate in the books, she is inconsistently shown in both Brother and Sister's classrooms in the 2003 TV series. *Cousin Freddy is Brother, Sister, and Honey's cousin and best friend. He is often referred to as Cousin Fred. His father, Artie and Papa Bear are brothers. He likes to read the dictionary for fun, and tends to be cowardly. He owns a hound dog named Snuff. In the 2003 series, he does not own a dog but a chameleon named Carl and is shown to be allergic to chocolate in The Pet Show and Papa's Pizza. *Elizabeth \\"Lizzy\\" Bruin is one of Sister's best friends. She is very competitive and can be snobbish at times. In the books and 1985 series, she is a new cub in town that Sister befriends immediately, but they fight during a playdate and temporarily stop being friends. In the 2003 series, they have been best friends since the first day of Kindergarten, and Lizzie is implied to come from a more well off family, as she is said to have every \\"Bearbie\\" doll. *Bonnie Brown is a part-time model who attends Bear Country School and befriends with Brother and Sister. Bonnie and Brother Bear are sometimes portrayed as having a crush on the other. Bonnie is a very caring and sweet cub, and the niece of Squire and Lady Grizzly. She was first introduced in the Big Chapter Book series. *Raffish Ralph: is a con man who typically works as a swindler. He also goes by the name Ralph Ripoff. Though he is scheming and underhanded, he maintains a somewhat cordial relationship with Papa, Brother, and Sister. He appears in one storybook, the chapter books, and the Berenstain Bears Save Christmas! music album. In the 1985 TV series, he is mostly seen working with Weasel McGreed in an attempt to take over Bear Country. *Weasel McGreed is a weasel who is an antagonist in the 1985 TV series. In the series, he attempts to take over Bear Country on numerous occasions, only to have his plans foiled by Brother and Sister each time. He also works alongside Raffish Ralph during his schemes. *Farmer Ben is the local farmer, a neighbor and friend to the Bear Family and Papa Bear's best friend. Though essentially good-hearted, he can lose his temper when he feels things are unfair or not to his standards. He once hired Brother, Sister, and their friends to help with chores when he and his wife were about to lose their farm. In one of the chapter books, he is angry when protesters come by to demand he stop harvesting tobacco. *Mrs. Ben is Farmer Ben's wife. It is hinted that she often tells Farmer Ben what to do. *Squire Grizzly is the richest bear in all of Bear Country and a friend to Papa. Papa often does woodwork for the squire in \\"Grizzly Mansion,\\" the squire's home. He has a touchy relationship with Farmer Ben, over who owns the land adjacent to his. *Lady Grizzly is Squire Grizzly's wife. She is also a friend to the Bear family, though it is hinted that she wishes the Bears were more in their class of people. *Grizzly Gramps and Gran are Papa Bear's parents. Gramps likes to build ships in a bottle and complain about the government. Gran likes to plant flowers and tell other bears their fortunes for fun. In the 2003 series, Sister Bear learns more about Gran's past and her involvement in the community, such as entertaining sick people, fighting to keep a lake from being filled with dirt, and was the one to get a crossing guard for the school. *Horace J. Honeypot is the mayor of Bear Country, known for his numerous spoonerisms; however, in the storybooks and the 2003 series, he is known to speak normally. *Professor Actual Factual is the community intellectual, always pictured as slim and bespectacled. He is a good friend of Brother and Sister, and the purveyor and owner of the Bearsonian Institution, Bear Country's museum. *Bigpaw is a giant of a bear, a throwback to prehistoric cave bears. As his name suggests, he is the bear version of Bigfoot. He lives in a cave and hibernates. Never shown wearing anything but his own fur and foraging/fishing for sustenance, he is also referred to in the books as \\"Great Natural Bear\\". Despite his size and appearance however, Bigpaw Bear is often portrayed as a gentle giant. *Ferdy Factual, or \\"Nerdy Ferdy,\\" is Actual Factual's nephew, and an unusually intelligent cub. Though he adjusts slowly to life at Bear Country School, he becomes close friends with Brother, Sister, and their friends, and he even stands up to Too-Tall and his gang on occasion. He has a crush on Queenie. *Bill Bunny is a hare who appears in the television specials and the chapter books. *Benjamin Frog is a frog who in the television specials and the chapter books. *Firefly is a firefly in the television specials and the chapter books. *Trudy Brunowitz is a nerdy female cub and a friend of Ferdy. *Harry McGill is the first disabled cub in the series. He made his debut in The Berenstain Bears and the wheelchair comando in the Big Chapter Book series. He is smart and is good friends with Ferdy. After standing up to Too-Tall, he eventually became his chess buddy. He also helps new cubs adjust to Bear Country School. *Bertha Broom is a muscular female cub. She is athletic, kind, and a feminist. She is one of the few cubs to stand up to Too-Tall on a regular basis. She is a heavyweight on Bear Country School's wrestling team and a fullback on the football team. In the 2003 series, she is known as Betsy. *Milton Chubb is a fifth grader who is probably the largest cub in school. Milton is the target of sarcasm when he first arrived at the school (especially by Too-Tall and his gang), but he adjusts in time. He joins the wrestling team and is good friends with all the cubs, especially Bertha, his secret crush. *Lenny is a cub who appears in the 2003 TV series. Though he means well, some of his actions can come off as selfish or sinister, such as joking that Sister would make the baseball team and Brother wouldn't, or showing up late to the movies and leaving Brother to find a seat alone while he snags a good seat. *Skuzz is the second-in-command of Too-Tall's gang. He wears a whoopee cap and is as ruthless as Too-Tall. *Smirk is the silly one of Too-Tall's gang, though he is still sarcastic. He wears a baseball cap, which he sometimes wears sideways or backwards, and likes to build model airplanes in his spare time. *Vinnie is the least intelligent member of Too-Tall's gang. He wears a snow cap similar to that of a skater, though only for looks (although in several books, he is seen without a hat), and usually does not understand the jokes told by the rest of the gang. In the 2003 TV series, he is only occasionally seen and never speaks. *Unnamed Bully is a member of Too-Tall's gang who does not appear in as many books as the other gang members, nor appears in either TV series. He wears a beanie-like baseball cap and primarily appears in the First Time Books. *Dr. Gert Grizzly is Beartown's doctor. She is a kind person who advocates healthy eating. *Babs Bruno is the daughter of Beartown's police chief, Chief Bruno. A feminist and aspiring poet, she is good friends with Queenie and Bertha. She also occasionally hangs out with Sister and Bonnie. *Barry Bruin is Lizzy's older brother, although Lizzy is initially portrayed as having no siblings. He loves to tell and play jokes, but he is always willing to help his friends. He is mentioned in the books and the 2003 series, mainly in 'The Big Blooper', when Sister and Lizzie watch one of his movies and repeat the bad language (the book implying it to be an actual curse word, while the 2003 series uses the word \\"furball\\"). *Teacher Bob is the third grade teacher in Bear Country School. Easygoing but firm, he teaches Brother, Fred, Too-Tall, and Queenie. *Teacher Jane is the first grade teacher in Bear Country School and the Bear Scout troop leader. Very gentle and soft-spoken, she teaches Sister and Lizzy. *Chief Bert Bruno is the police chief of Beartown and the father of Babs. He often calls on the Bear Detectives to help him solve local crimes, though he worries that they may get hurt while dealing with criminals. His assistant deputy is Officer Marguerite. *Officer Marguerite is Bear Country's main police officer. She is the only officer mentioned in the books. *‚Äô‚Äô‚ÄôProfessor Actual factual‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô Minor characters *Grumpy Grizzly is the Bear Country School groundskeeper.

The work contains multiple plates and maps and is prefaced with the author naming himself \\"head of his race\\" and \\"chief of the prostrated people of this nation\\". Content The book is in two volumes. The first volume describes the history of the Gaels from prehistoric times up to their departure from Spain. The second volume describes their conquest of Ireland. Throughout, the text is written as if it is from authentic ancient texts, the content of which is commented upon and explained in detailed footnotes written in O'Connor's own person. =Preface= The book begins with a letter to O'Connor's friend Francis Burdett, in which O'Connor describes alleged conspiracies against his life and his family, and refers to the military exploits of his son Francis Burdett O'Connor, named after his friend. He then predicts the honour with which Burdett's name will be remembered. A preface follows in which he speaks of the many trials he had in writing the book, which is a \\"literal translation into the English language (from the Phoenician dialect of the Scythian language) of the ancient manuscripts, which have, fortunately for the world, been preserved through many ages, chances and visissitudes\\".O'Connor, R., Chronicles of Eri: being the history of the Gaal Sciot Iber Volume 1, R.

This describes the origin and migrations of the Gaels. According to this text, the Gaels originated among the Phoenicians, and migrated to Sythia and Sidon, where the people who would become the Ancient Britons split off from the group that would become the Gaels. They eventually migrated to Spain. =Volume two= The second volume describes the Gaels' conquest of Ireland. When the Egyptian king Sesostris invaded Spain, he sought to establish \\"idolatry\\", which the Gaels resisted. In 1006 BC, they sailed from Spain to Ireland and conquered the land. They brought with them other anti-Sosostris peoples from Spain. In Ireland they established a religion based on fire worship, in which the chief deities were Baal, identified with the sun, and Re, identified with the moon. Critical views Of the supposed original Phoenician manuscripts, the only evidence O'Connor ever produced for examination was an eighteen-inch-long scroll purporting to be \\"a facsimile of part of the great roll of the Laws of Eri\\", currently held in the John Rylands Library of the University of Manchester.Holdings: A roll bearing lettering stated by Roger O'Connor in his Chronicles of Eri to be the laws of Eri in the Phoenician dialect of the Scythian language., National Library of Ireland Scholars who have examined this manuscript \\"are unable to find in them the likeness of any known ancient language\\".

The theatre building was constructed in 1854 as Landport Hall. It was converted to a theatre two years later. It was rebuilt in 1884 by Charles J. Phipps and again in 1900 by Frank Matcham. The Theatre reopened in October 2015 after a ¬£4.7M refurbishment project. New Theatre Royal History =Dickens and early theatre in Portsmouth= The present site was built to replace a theatre located in the High Street (now designated \\"old Portsmouth\\". The theatre features in Charles Dickens' novel Nicholas Nickleby. A popular music hall, it hosted performances by Niccol√≤ Paganini and Franz Liszt and Mr Keane the leading actor manager of the early nineteenth century. It closed in 1854 and was demolished in 1856 with a number of other buildings to allow for the construction of a military establishment, the Cambridge Barracks. This building now houses Portsmouth Grammar School, a fee paying independent school. The three-arch entrance to the school occupies the location of the theatre. The city archives contain an 1824 poster/playbill of a performance of The Merchant of Venice starring Mr Keane and paintings of the exterior and interior of the theatre. These show the theatre to have been a low building with no windows and a door with a Grecian portico typical of larger houses of the era.The interior was rectangular with two tiers of boxes along each wall and standing in the pit. It would have had a smaller audience capacity than the theatre which replaced it. The illustration of the Portsmouth Theatre by Phiz in Nicholas Nickleby is true to reality though not to scale. Extract from 'Nicholas Nickleby' \\"They groped their way through a dark passage, and, descending a step or two, threaded a little maze of canvas screens and paintpots, and emerged upon the stage of the Portsmouth Theatre. 'Here we are,' said Mr Crummles. It was not very light, but Nicholas found himself close to the first entrance on the prompt side, among bare walls, dusty scenes, mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty floors. He looked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes, gallery, orchestra, fittings, and decorations of every kind,--all looked coarse, cold, gloomy, and wretched. 'Is this a theatre?' whispered Smike, in amazement; 'I thought it was a blaze of light and finery.' 'Why, so it is,' replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised; 'but not by day, Smike‚Äînot by day.' \\" Newly painted Nicholas Nickleby Charles Dickens 1838‚Äì39 Did Dickens perform at the Portsmouth Theatre? Dickens was born in Portsmouth and visited the theatre in 1838 to research Nicholas Nickleby. He was not only a brilliant writer but a consummate performer and would-be actor. His readings were legendary and made him a 19th-century celebrity. There is a belief that he may have performed at the Portsmouth Theatre but this is unlikely. His descriptions in Nicholas Nickleby show that in addition to the auditorium he visited the stage and back stage but his career as a public performer began some ten years into his literary success and long after its publication. He is known to have performed in Portsmouth later but at St Peter's Hall. Sadly, he did not perform at the current theatre and there is no evidence of his visiting it though it is possible. =Henry Rutley and the Portsmouth Theatres Company= In the same year the old theatre was demolished, Mr Henry Rutley opened a new venue on the present site. Rutley (born Newcastle 1816) was an impresario and circus proprietor who had arrived in Portsmouth in 1854 and purchased the Swan Tavern in Commercial Road and the adjoining Landport Hall, a racquet court. He converted the hall to accommodate equestrian displays and applied to the magistrates for permission to construct a new theatre on the site. The magistrates, believing theatres places of ill-repute, granted a licence for a limited period with the condition that there was no direct access from the tavern. A door to the hall, bricked in during building, was temporarily uncovered during renovation work in 2004. The Theatre Royal opened on 29 September 1856 with a production entitled 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts'. Rutley managed the venue with J W Boughton as his assistant and was highly successful. In a typical week the theatre would host two plays a night with matinees at the weekend. Rutley died of 'dropsy' in 1874. His grave can be seen in Highland Road Cemetery in Southsea. Boughton became manager of the theatre in 1876 and, after the death of Rutley's successor J C Hughes, took over control of the Portsmouth Theatres Company in 1882. Rutley's widow eventually sold the theatre to him. Architects  =C J Phipps= Boughton decided on a major rebuild demolishing and replacing the theatre with the present building which re-opened on 4 August 1884 with Gilbert and Sullivan's \\"Princess Ida\\". He engaged the most famous theatre architect of the day, C J Phipps, who had earlier built London's Gaiety, Theatre Royal and Haymarket theatres among others. The new building had a four tier auditorium (stalls or pit, dress circle, upper circle and gods). The theatre reflected the rigid social distinctions of the day. The 6-door frontage led to the dress circle to accommodate the wealthy. Patrons in the other floors entered by single doors to the side of the main foyer. Seating capacity was under 1000 but there was space for standing patrons with refreshment bars on each level. The stage was 40 ft deep with a 30 ft proscenium, fly tower and traps. Phipps also designed the Empire Theatre (aka Empire Palace Theatre) in Edinburgh Road, built by Corke of Fratton, which opened in 1891. A two-tiered music hall with a small stage, it was a milestone in design for public safety. Phipps' Exeter Theatre Royal had been destroyed in a fire shortly after opening in 1886. The Empire was a radical improvement in build quality and design. The Empire struggled to compete with the Royal, Princes and Kings. A plan in the early 1900s to build a 'super theatre' on the site today occupied by the \\"Zurich\\" offices was rejected by magistrates and the Empire was extensively redecorated and reopened with Marie Lloyd in 1913. It continued to stage variety shows, even when the other venues converted to screening films, but the quality of these declined to the extent that it ended staging \\"We never clothe 'em\\" shows, soft core striptease. The Empire was demolished to make way for a supermarket in 1958. It is said that the Empire Company applied unsuccessfully to lease the Theatre Royal. =Frank Matcham= The continued success of the theatre led Boughton to decide to enlarge the stage and he engaged Frank Matcham to renovate the building and build a 65 ft stage in 1900. Matcham was arguably the greatest theatre architect in UK history. His buildings are loved by a variety of artistes as the ideal place to perform. He built over a hundred and fifty theatres across the country including the Tower Ballroom Blackpool, Sadlers Wells and the London Palladium, his greatest success. (The exact number is not known as much of the Matcham archive was destroyed in the WW2 bombing of London.) A brilliant and innovative architect, Matcham perfected increasingly larger floors of seating without supporting pillars, shaped to allow full view of the stage from all seats. He developed 'raked' stages (built at an incline toward the audience) to improve vision from the upper circle and gods, and decorative mouldings and shaped frontage to the balcony fronts that encouraged better acoustics. Matcham constructed the stage and auditorium area to form a natural bell chamber to project and amplify. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck has said of the Palladium that you can \\"feel the sound roll around the theatre\\". Matcham's genius was to create palaces of entertainment which were not only opulent and beautiful but efficient and intimate both for audience and performer. Matcham enlarged the Theatre Royal stage, rebuilt the dress circle and modified the upper circle and added a cast iron conservatory to the front of the building to allow more patrons into the dress and upper circle bars. The Theatre Royal stage featured a \\"run-on\\" or \\"stage-roller\\", a large treadmill that allowed horses and vehicles to appear to move on stage. It was a feature of the annual pantomime and it is believed that two racing chariots appeared in a production of Ben Hur shortly after the renovation. Boughton's success led him to engage Matcham to build two more theatres in Portsmouth, the Prince's Theatre in Lake Road and Kings Theatre in Southsea. The Kings opened in 1907 and is still operating. The Princes Theatre was of a similar structure to the Theatre Royal with a similar cast iron conservatory. It was destroyed in a daylight bombing raid on the city in 1942 during a children's cinema matinee. The three theatres constituted the Portsmouth Theatres Company with a common repertory troupe. Other surviving Phipps-Matcham theatres include the Tivoli Aberdeen, Famous Performers Most of the famous performers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appeared at the Theatre Royal. Sir Henry Irving and his leading lady and mistress, Ellen Terry, appeared many times both individually and together. Sarah Bernhardt performed there on several occasions, including her legendary appearances in later life when in a wheelchair. She left her signature on the wall of the dressing rooms (it was retrieved after the fire in 1972). Marie Lloyd was also a regular. Laurel and Hardy appeared before fame in Hollywood and Oliver Hardy chose the theatre as the venue for his birthday party in 1954. Similarly Morecombe and Wise were among many twentieth-century variety stars who appeared early in their career. Irving died on tour in a Bradford hotel in 1905 but his last complete set of performances was completed two weeks earlier at the Theatre Royal Portsmouth. Ellen Terry was appearing there the week he died. During some of performances his private secretary and theatre manager, Abraham ('Bram') Stoker - author of his biography and of the classic Gothic novel Dracula - worked in the offices backstage. Theatre Programming At its height from the Victorian to pre-WW2 eras, theatres provided a dynamic programme of entertainment to the communities they served typically, boasting \\"two shows nightly\\" with weekend matinees. Like cinemas, the evening programme ran a major and supporting show. As the Victorian wealthy liked to dine late after a trip to the theatre, the main performance started at 7.30 and the support (shorter and usually less demanding such as a light drama or farce) opened afterwards. Audiences could pay to attend either or both performances. With three venues in Portsmouth from the 1900s to the second world war, the city had a stunning level of entertainment choice and provision. Programming also provides an insight into the talent and workload of the acting profession. In most weeks, the performances would change with as many as three distinct programmes of shows. Posters from the 1860s show an actor taking the lead in Hamlet followed by the lead in a farce at the start of the week, and the lead role in different plays at the weekend, a formidable memory load. Theatre Royal and New Theatre Royal From Shakespeare's time onward, theatre was subject to control and censorship partially out of its moral reputation and partially through recognition of its influence as the world's first form of mass communication. In the eighteenth century legislation insisted that drama could only be performed by theatres that had been granted a royal charter or licence (1737) making them 'patent' theatres. This dispensation entitled them to be known as \\"Theatre Royal\\" and display a royal insignia. This accounts for the fact that this is the most common name for 19th-century theatres across the UK. The original 'Portsmouth Theatre was not patented when Dickens wrote Nicholas Nickleby but gained authorisation at some point thereafter. The patent and title passed to Rutley's theatre in 1856 probably because he reassured the local magistrates that his theatre would be unlike the several 'dubious' places of entertainment then in the city and designed for \\"middle class families\\". There is no clear evidence of when or why people began to refer to the theatre as 'New'. From 1856 to 1976 the theatre was official the Theatre Royal. At some point the 'New' was informally added. Evidence from local newspapers held in the theatres archive at the Victoria and Albert Museum confirm that this was in use by the middle of the century and either began when Rutley's building replaced the one in the High Street or when the CJ Phipps building replaced Rutley's. The frontage of the theatre says both \\"Theatre Royal\\" and \\"New Theatre Royal\\" indicating that the name was in use by the time CJ Phipps was contracted to design the present building. Archived material indicates that each name was used on material such as programmes. The Theatre Royal officially became New Theatre Royal when the present trust was incorporated in 1976. Decline By the 1920s, radio and cinema led to the decline in attendances and, coupled with economic depression and war costs, theatres began to close or convert to film screening. These including the Prince's and Kings. The Theatre Royal was home to a repertory company, The Denville Players, until 1932 when it too had a projection room installed and became a cinema. Portsmouth was subject to extensive damage during the WW2 blitz. The neighbouring Guildhall was gutted by fire and the Prince's destroyed by a direct hit during an afternoon matinee for children but the Royal escaped unharmed. It continued as a cinema until 1948 when it reverted to a variety theatre. According to local academic and musician David Allen, the theatre was the venue for the first live rock 'n' roll performance in the UK in 1954. Additional competition from television continued to force closures across the country and the Theatre Royal was eventually forced to shut in 1955. In 1956 Bernard Delfont's 'Brilliant Summer Revue' starring David Nixon was in the Theatre Royal for a Summer Season. In 1957 it opened as a repertory theatre under local impresario Hector Ross but this was short lived and from 1960 it operated only as a bingo hall and a venue for wrestling. For a brief period a young Australian, Robert Stigwood, was Ross's assistant. In the 1960s Stigwood would become one of the leading impresarios in popular music. In 1966 the owners of the theatre, Portsmouth Theatres Company, sought permission from the council to over-ride its 'listed' status and demolish it. The council agreed, describing the theatre as \\"an eyesore in the centre of our fine city.\\" A pressure group was formed to oppose this, leading to a council decision in which the proposal was beaten by only one vote! The empty building began to attract vandals. In 1968 squatters occupied it and valuable brass fittings and roof lead were stolen. The continuing decay and damage led to the formation of the Theatre Royal Society which pressured to defend and preserve the building. This campaign included the locally born actor Brian Murphy who had starred in 'The Boyfriend' and is now a patron of the theatre. The society became the New Theatre Royal trust in 1976. The Boyfriend In 1971 the controversial director, Ken Russell chose the theatre as the location for a film version of the hit musical \\"The Boyfriend\\". The play written by Sandy Wilson had been a stage hit in the UK and USA. A love story set on the Riviera in the 1920s, it uses Shakespearean techniques of false identity and final revelation. Russell, who wanted to make a parody of the work of Busby Berkley, added a story twist by setting it amongst a run- down repertory company with the love story on stage mirrored in one off. He chose the ballet dancer Christopher Gable and the model Twiggy for the lead roles backed by an ensemble cast of experienced stage actors including Barbara Windsor, Brian Murphy, Murray Melvin, Georgina Hale and dancer Tommy Tune. Vladek Sheybal played a visiting impresario and there was a cameo role for Glenda Jackson (not listed in the credits). A young composer, Peter Maxwell Davies, adapted the score. Russell (who would go on to produce a film version of The Who album \\"Tommy\\" in Portsmouth) shot most of the film on location in the empty theatre and adjoining streets giving it an eerie sense of period and reality. It was to be the Victorian theatre's last performance. The Fire The following year, 1972, children entered the theatre and lit fireworks setting the stage on fire. A member of the public alerted a patrolling policeman to the smoke but by the time the fire brigade arrived the rear of the theatre was ablaze. Early in the fire the ropes of the safety curtain burned through causing it to fall into place saving the auditorium. (Ironically, the curtain had been faulty and temperamental for many years and regularly refused to operate.) The stage, fly tower and the entire building behind the proscenium arch was destroyed. Once again, demolition was proposed but the Theatre Royal Society was there to oppose the plan. Amongst those who campaigned to save the theatre was the actor Brian Murphy who had appeared in \\"The Boyfriend\\". Murphy was born on the Isle of Wight and spent his childhood in Portsmouth. In 1975, volunteers were allowed back into the building to start the long process of repair and renovation and a trust was formally established to care for the theatre. The New Theatre Royal (Portsmouth) Limited was registered in 1976 with a subsidiary trading company, NTR Trading Limited, as regulations did not allow charities to retail. The Theatre Royal was finally officially the New Theatre Royal. Leading figures in the restoration and rebirth included local teacher John Offord and Jean Salisbury who was made a \\"Cultural Champion\\" by the Minister for Sport and Culture in 2010. The theatre was gradually repaired, largely by volunteers, and slowly came back into operation. In 1984 a small temporary stage was built over the orchestra pit in front of the proscenium arch. Productions were largely restricted to amateur performances. Memorabilia Damage to the theatre extended beyond the fire in 1972. Thieves stole valuable brass fittings and other artefacts in the 60's. In the 70's thieves with a van stole auditorium doors which had been removed for renovation whilst volunteers worked in the theatre. In the early 70's artefacts, papers and records including a large collection of posters were moved from the managers office for safekeeping. (The offices and dressing rooms along with the Strand lighting unit were situated to the 'audience' left of the stage behind the White Swan and survived the fire. They were demolished in 1980.) These records were transferred too an empty shop nearby in Guildhall Walk. Two years later, the entire content of the shop were found to have disappeared. Neither the volunteers or the owner of the shop had authorised or knew of their removal. These items were never retrieved. Sarah Bernhardt left her signature on the wall of the dressing room. This was retrieved after the fire and is now in the possession of the trust. In the early 'noughties', builders renovating a house in Southsea found a number of posters from the Rutley theatre under floorboards. Most dated from the 1860s. They were sold to Langford Antiques in Albert Road Southsea where they were framed and sold. Several were purchased for the theatre trust. Fundraising =Boyden Report and Onyx Funding= In 2003, faced with on-going financial stringency, the Board of Trustees commissioned the Boyden Report which advised a short closure and re-launch and the appointment of an experienced professional director. Shortly after this appointment, the Project Director of a local social enterprise (The Portsmouth and SE Hampshire Partnership) which had been entrusted with finding suitable projects for ¬£1m from the Onyx environmental trust, added the NTR as a last minute addition to the shortlist. The theatre was awarded ¬£440,000, the largest single grant given by the Onyx Trust. With additional funding, the Matcham cast iron portico was renovated, central heating and a new pit bar installed, and original vintage seating in the stalls which had previously been used on the set of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge. A larger stage was built in front of the proscenium. To accommodate this, the frontage of the lower boxes had to be removed. Investigation revealed that these were prefabricated and fitted using large bolts. They were stored beneath the stage until eventually reinstatement when the new stage house was built. An external lighting rig was erected over the open stage. The renovation led to a dynamic programme development endorsed by the trust board. Drama, stand up comedy, music and dance became features of each season whilst work with local schools and community groups was expanded. The trust developed links with the university of Portsmouth, a funder with the city council. The New Theatre Royal gained prominence on the cultural scene of the city. However, performances were still restricted by the lack of a proper stage and get-in and limited seating capacity. Inevitably, lack of operating finance became problematic again necessitating a period known as \\"NTR Lite\\" with less risky but less exciting programing. Shortly after the recruitment of a new executive (artistic) director, the trust embarked upon the most challenging an exciting period since the remodelling by Matcham. =\\"Let's Make It Great\\"= The board of trustees appointed a sub-committee to investigate and advise on the options for capitalising on its vacant \\"back lot\\". The outcome was a plan to rebuild the stage and back stage accommodation in addition to teaching facilities for the university. In 2009, London-based architects Peynore and Prasad were contracted to design the building and a professional fundraiser was appointed to raise the estimated ¬£4m cost to the trust. A fund raising programme \\"Let's Make It Great\\" began at the opening of 2010 with a weekend finishing with a gala performance MC'd by comedian and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and headlined by the actor Sheila Hancock, chancellor of the university. Broadcaster and musician Paul Jones and actor Christopher Timothy were among the cast list which included popular and classical music, comedy, opera and dance. At the end of the evening, Sheila Hancock accepted the invitation to become the patron of the theatre. In May 2010, the theatre hosted the first screening in nearly three decades of \\"The Boyfriend\\", an honour it shared in the same week with the Verona Film Festival. The screening was preceded by an interview with the director Ken Russell and cast members Twiggy, Brian Murphy, Georgina Hale and Murray Melvin and the score composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davis, former Master of the Queens Music. The interview was hosted by local television personality Sally Taylor. Following this event, Twiggy, Sir Peter and Brian Murphy agreed to join Sheila Hancock as patrons.

It is the only remnant of the medieval city of Rotterdam. History The church was built between 1449 and 1525. In 1621 a wooden spire was added to the tower, designed by Hendrick de Keyser. Poor quality of its wood caused the spire to be demolished in 1645. A stone cube was added to the tower, which proved too heavy for the foundation in 1650. New piles were driven under the tower and in 1655 the tower stood straight again. This basilica was the first all stone building in Rotterdam. Many important events took place here. The last priest of the Laurenskerk was Hubertus Duifhuis. The Reformation took place in 1572 and the Laurenskerk became a Protestant church. Ministers of the church include Laurens Johannes Jacobus van Oosterzee, Abraham Hellenbroek, Jan Scharp and J.R. Callenbach, who wrote a book about the history of the church a few years before the Rotterdam Blitz. The church is still used for worship of the Protestant Church. In the Rotterdam Blitz on May 14, 1940 the Laurenskerk was heavily damaged. At first there were calls to demolish the church, but that was stopped by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The provisional National Monuments Commission had both supporters and opponents of restoration. In particular, committee member and architect J.J.P. Oud opposed rebuilding in 1950 and presented an alternative plan which would preserve only the tower. Next to the memorial a new, smaller church would be built. This alternative plan was rejected, particularly because restoration of the Laurenskerk was viewed as a symbol of the resilience of Rotterdam's community. In 1952, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands laid the foundation stone for the restoration, which was completed in 1968. In 1971 the Laurenspastoraat community was established (as part of the Reformed Church of Rotterdam) in order to resume church services. The community received a Cross of Nails replica from Coventry Cathedral in order to become a local center for peace and reconciliation. In 1981 the liberal Maaskant/Open Grenzen community joined the church and since then the two communities alternate their services.

Significant communities of Hazara people also live in Quetta, Pakistan and Mashad, Iran as part of the Hazara and Afghan diasporas. The persecution of the Hazara people dates back to the 16th century, to the reign of Babur who was from Kabulistan. It is reported that during the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan (1880‚Äì1901), thousands of Hazaras were killed, expelled and enslaved. Syed Askar Mousavi, a contemporary Hazara writer, claims that half the population of Hazarajat was killed, displaced and shipped to neighbouring Balochistan in British India and Khorasan Province in Iran. This led to Pashtuns and other groups occupying parts of Hazarajat. The Hazara people have also been the victims of massacres which were committed by the Taliban and al- Qaeda. Conditions have improved for the Hazaras in Afghanistan in the post- Taliban era. However, Hazaras who live in the Southern provinces of Afghanistan continue to face unofficial discrimination at the hands of Pashtuns. Moreover, Hazaras in Afghanistan are still subjected to attacks by the Taliban and the latest attack was committed on Hazara's home land in Malistan. Hazaras in Balochistan continue to face attacks from militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. In recent years, the security situation has also improved for Hazaras in Balochistan. However, the improved protection that has resulted from the placement of walls and checkpoints around their city has also made their lives difficult. Afghanistan Hazaras are historically the most restrained ethnic group in the state and as a result, they have only experienced slight improvements in their circumstances even with the setup of modern Afghanistan. The discrimination against this ethnic group has continued for centuries, and it has been instigated against them by Pashtuns and other ethnic groups. Syed Askar Mousavi, a contemporary Hazara writer, estimates that more than half of the entire population of Hazarajat was driven out of its villages, including many who were massacred. \\"It is difficult to verify this estimate, but the memory of the conquest of the Hazarajat by Abdur Rahman Khan certainly remains vivid among the Hazaras themselves, and it has heavily influenced their relationship with the Afghan state throughout the 20th century. The British from neighboring British India, who were heavily involved in Afghanistan, did not document such a large figure. Hazara Genocide: An estimated 60% of the Hazara population was exterminated during the 1890s genocide of Hazaras in Hazarajat and its lands were confiscated. Others claim that Hazaras began to leave their homeland of Hazarajat in search of employment due to injustice and poverty, mostly during the 20th century. Most of these Hazaras immigrated to neighbouring Balochistan, where they were provided permanent settlement by the government of British India. Others settled in and around Mashad, Iran. The Hazaras of Afghanistan faced severe political, social and economic tyranny and denial of basic civil rights. In 1933, Abdul Khaliq, a Hazara student assassinated king Nadir Khan. = Persecution and marginalization = Notably, after the Second Anglo-Afghan War, Shah Abdur conducted a campaign of repression in Hazarajat, but it was met with fierce opposition by Hazara tribal leaders. The first uprising was conducted in correlation with Shah Adbur's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq who sought to overthrow the Shah. This revolt of Hazara nationalists and anti-Shah partisans was brief, because Shah Adbur astutely used sectarian strife to divide the Hazara Shias and the Sunni partisans, thus allowing him to easily defeat his foes.The history of Hazara people. The defeat of the Hazaras in their first revolt allowed Shah Adbur to impose taxes on Hazarajat for the first time, and they severely impeded the autonomy of Hazarajat, because numerous Pashtun soldiers and government officials were garrisoned in Hazarajat in order to ensure its compliance with the Pashtun-run state. Subsequently, the Pashtuns garrisoned in Hazarajat, treated the local Hazaras inferiorly and often committed arbitrary acts of cruelty and brutality against them. This caused great unrest and a deepening hatred between the Hazaras and their Pashtun rulers, causing the Hazaras to reach their tipping point in 1892. The outrage that followed allowed the Hazaras to unite once again in order to overthrow most of the local Pashtun garrisons in Hazarajat. This newfound zealous fever fermented fierce resistance against Shah Adbur and his forces. Witnessing the rising tide, Shah Adbur felt he had no choice but to wage a jihad against the Shia Hazaras, and under this casus belli Shah Adbur was able to muster around 150,000 troops. The resulting conflict was brutal and led to a great loss of life on both sides. The Hazaras fought with vigour but the attrition they faced due to lack of rations, led to their demise at the uprising's epicenter of Oruzgan. The aftermath of the uprising was a genocide at the hands of Shah Adbur, who wiped out more than half of the entire Hazara population, and caused a myriad of people to be driven out of their villages. Although once an ethnic group with a significantly larger population in Afghanistan, they now constituted 9-15% of the population. In order to stifle Hazara influence Shah Adbur fragmented Hazarajat and demarcated it so that it would encompass numerous other provinces. =Improvements and recognition= Despite the \\"democratic\\" 1964 constitution that contained universal suffrage, political and social rights for minorities were still not guaranteed. That decade the first Hazara minister was appointed by the King. Under the first communist Khalq government, Hazaras were persecuted again, a particular episode being the Chindawol uprising in 1979 when hundreds of Hazaras went missing. Their persecution was not kept secret - for instance Abdullah Amin, brother of Hafizullah Amin, expressed anti-Hazara comments during a public speech that year. Following the Soviet Union's intervention and creation of the Parcham government under Babrak Karmal, Hazara rights had improved and the party's constitution declared all races and ethnicities in Afghanistan as being equal. During the 1980s, Hazaras became more prominent in the army and the ruling communist party, and one Hazara politician, Sultan Ali Keshtmand, would serve as Prime Minister for most of the decade. The Hazaras were split over the Soviet-Afghan War - most of the urban population supported and fought for the communist regime in Kabul, where they were now officially equal, but most of the rural Hazara population rejected the reforms and resisted.http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs;=1554153397094~147 =Post-communist era= The Hazara Hezb-e Wahdat militia and party joined the new mujahideen government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and some members held government posts. However they would soon be discriminated against and would be excluded from the administration. At the same time, violent ethnic conflict broke out between Hezb-e Wahdat and the Saudi-backed Wahhabi Ittihad-i Islami militia led by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. The Hazara claim the Taliban executed 15,000 of their people in their campaign through northern and central Afghanistan.  Afshar  In February 1993, a two-day military operation was conducted by the Islamic State of Afghanistan government and its allied Ittihad-i Islami militia. The military operation was conducted in order to seize control of the Afshar district in west Kabul where the Shia Hezb-e Wahdat militia (which was allied to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Sunni Hezb-i Islami and backed by Pakistan) was based and from where it was shelling civilian areas in northern Kabul. The operation also intended to capture Wahdat leader Abdul Ali Mazari. The Afshar district, situated on the slopes of Mount Afshar west of Kabul, is a densely populated district. The area is predominantly inhabited by Shia Hazaras. The Afshar military operation escalated into what became known as the Afshar massacre when the Saudi backed Wahhabi militia of Ittihad-e-Islami went on a rampage through Afshar, killing, raping, looting and burning houses. Two out of nine Islamic State sub-commanders, Anwar Dangar (later joined the Taliban) and Mullah Izzat, were also reported as leading troops that carried out abuses. The Islamic State government in collaboration with the then enemy militia of Hezb-e Wahdat as well as in cooperation with Afshar civilians established a commission to investigate the crimes that had taken place in Afshar. The commission found that around 70 people died during the street fighting and between 700 and 750 people were abducted and never returned by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's men. These abducted victims were most likely killed or died in captivity. Dozens of women were abducted during the operation as well.  Mazar-i-Sharif  Following the 1997 massacre of 3,000 Taliban prisoners by Abdul Malik Pahlawan in Mazar-i-Sharif (which the Hazaras did not commit ) thousands of Hazaras were massacred by other Taliban members in the same city in August 1998.https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0.htm The slaughter has been credited to a number of factors‚Äîethnic difference, suspicion of Hazara loyalty to Shia Iran, anger at the loss of life suffered in an earlier unsuccessful Taliban takeover of Mazarwas‚Äîincluding takfir by the Taliban of the Hazaras.Rashid, Ahmed (2002). \\"Mazar-e-Sharif 1997: Massacre in the north\\". Taliban: Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia. London: I.B. Tauris. p. 55‚Äì75. . Retrieved 30 September 2018. After the attack, Mullah Niazi, the commander of the attack and the new governor of Mazar, declared from several mosques in the city in separate speeches: > Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you > shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. (...) > Hazaras are not Muslim, they are Shia. They are kofr [infidels]. The Hazaras > killed our force here, and now we have to kill Hazaras. (...) > If you do not show your loyalty, we will burn your houses, and we will kill > you. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. (...) > [W]herever you [Hazaras] go we will catch you.

What > [Hizb-i] Wahdat and the Hazaras did to the Talibs, we did worse...as many as > they killed, we killed more. At 10 am on 8 August 1998, the Taliban entered the city and for the next two days drove their pickup trucks \\"up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i- Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved‚Äîshop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys.\\"Rashid,Taliban (2000), p.73. More than 8,000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan.Goodson, Afghanistan's Endless War, (2001), p.79. In addition, the Taliban were criticized for forbidding anyone from burying the corpses for the first six days (contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immediate burial) while the remains rotted in the summer heat and were eaten by dogs.THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF, THE FIRST DAY OF THE TAKEOVER. In these killings 2,000 to 5,000, or perhaps up to 20,000 Hazara were systematically executed across the city. The Taliban went door to door of Hazara households searching for combat age males, shooting them and slitting their throats right in front of their families. Hazaras were shoved into trailers were they suffocated to death or died of heat strokes, and were later dumped into piles in the middle of the desert. The Taliban randomly shot anti-aircraft weapons at civilians into the middle of the city; causing drivers to swerve out of control and run people over. Human rights organizations reported that the dead were lying on the streets for weeks before the Taliban allowed their burial due to stench and fear of epidemics. Niamatullah Ibrahimi described the killings as \\"an act of genocide at full ferocity.\\" Members of Pakistan's ISI claimed the killings were only done after trials, however the Taliban had Pakistani fighters alongside them during their siege of the city.  Robatak Pass  The pass connecting the settlements of Tashkurgan and Pule Khumri is known as Robatak Pass. A mass murder was carried out there by Taliban in May 2000 in which 31 people were reported dead. Twenty-six of the victims were Ismaili Hazara from Baghlan province. Their remains were found to the northeast of the pass, in a neighborhood known as Hazara Mazari, on the border between Baghlan and Samngan provinces. The victims were detained four months before their execution by Taliban troops between January 5 and January 14, 2000.  Yakawlang  In January 2001 the Taliban committed a mass execution of Hazara people in Yakawlang District of Bamyan province, Afghanistan. This started on January 8 and lasted for four days; it took the lives of 170 men. Taliban apprehended about 300 people, including employees of local humanitarian organizations. They were grouped to various assemblage points where they were shot dead in public view. Around 73 women, children and elderly were taking shelter in a local mosque when Taliban fired rockets at the mosque.  Bamyan  The United Nation investigated three mass graves allegedly containing victims of massacres in 2002 within Bamyan. =Post-Taliban era= There has been a significant improvement in the status and treatment of Hazaras in Afghanistan since the Karzai administration came to power.https://www.refworld.org/docid/3f52085b4.html The new 2004 Afghan constitution now recognizes them as one of the country's ethnic minorities, and they now have the full right to Afghan citizenship. Hazaras were well represented in Karzai's government,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/06/afghanistan- hazaras-160623093601127.html and in 2010 Afghan parliamentary election, Hazaras won around 25 per cent of the seats. As of 2007, Hazaras have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions. For example, Muhammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hizb-i-Wahdat party, ran in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have been poured into Afghanistan for several large- scale reconstruction projects that took place from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in the Bamyan Province. There is still a large degree of discrimination against Hazaras, however. A new danger in the form of ISIS has become especially prominent in recent years, and they have carried out abductions, extortions and violent killings against Hazaras. The rising power of warlords, who the Hazara people perceive as a direct threat, has also been a matter of concern. There have been ethnic tensions and violent clashes with nomadic Kuchis over land access issues. Taliban fighters continue to abduct and execute Hazaras travelling in vehicles. Furthermore, anti-Hazara sentiments became stronger when the former director of the National Directorate of Security, Amrullah Saleh, accused Iran of interfering in Afghan affairs through Shias. Hazara activists still believe that the government does not serve their people's security needs sufficiently. Parts of central Afghanistan, like the unofficial Hazara capital Bamiyan, are among the country's poorest and often lack even basic necessities like water and electricity. Hazara people held a protest in March 2016 against the government's decision to move a proposed power line project out of Bamiyan, seeing it as another form of ethnic discrimination. 2010 Khas Urozgan attack In June 2010, at least nine Hazara men were killed in an ambush in Khas Urozgan District of Uruzgan Province. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack. 2015 Zabul beheadings In November 2015, Afghan militants claiming loyalty to the Islamic State beheaded seven ethnic Hazara civilians who had been abducted in Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan. Their throats were cut with metal wire. The victims were four men, two women, and a 9-year- old girl named Shukria Tabassum. 2016 Dehmazang bombings On July 23, 2016 two Islamic State suicide bombers blow themselves during the peaceful protest 'Junbish Roshnaye' in Kabul killing 160 and wounded over 200 people. The attackers were reportedly from the local affiliate of the so-called Islamic State, known as the \\"Khurasan Province\\" (IS-Khurasan). 2016 Ashura attacks 18 people were killed and 54 were injured in July 2016 at Kabul's landmark Sakhi Shrine by a gunman wearing an Afghan National Security Forces uniform. The attack took place on the eve of Ashura, the Shia mourning day. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State, or ISIS. The next morning, an improvised electronic device (IED) killed at least 15 Hazara people in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan. ISIS claimed responsibility for this attack as well. These attacks show the growing threat of the IS to the Hazara people. 2018 university preparatory academy bombing In August 2018, a bomb hit a university preparatory academy in a Hazara neighborhood of Kabul. The bombing, which left 48 dead and 67 others injured, was claimed by ISIS. 2019 wedding bombing attack On August 17, 2019, a wedding of a Hazara couple in Kabul was bombed. Responsibility for the attack, which left 63 people dead and 182 injured, was claimed by ISIS. 2020 mourning ceremony attack ON March 6, 2020, a mourning ceremony was held in commemoration of the death of Abdul Ali Mirza, a Hazara leader, in 1995. The commemoration, held in the Dashte Barchi neighborhood of Kabul, was attacked by gunmen, with 32 people killed and between 58 and 81 people injured. According to Nasrat Rahimi, the interior ministry spokesman, all of the casualties were civilians. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by ISIS. 2020 maternity hospital attack On May 12, 2020, gunmened storm a maternity hospital in Dashte Barchi, a majority-Hazara neighborhood of Kabul. The attack left at least 24 people dead, including two newborns. Pakistan The history of Hazara people in Pakistan dates back to the 1840s, when Hazara tribesmen from Hazarajat began migration to colonial India because of persecution by Pashtuns and Tajiks. Many Hazaras were enlisted in the British Indian Army during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1838-1840). The mass-migration and permanent settlements started in the 1890s when Emir Abdul Rahman Khan started persecuting the Hazaras of Afghanistan.http://minoritysupportpakistan.com/The_Hazara_Shia_of_PakistanvApril_16_edited.pdf The majority of Hazara are Shi'a Muslims with a sizable Sunni Muslim. Pakistan is home to an estimated 20% Shia Muslim population. Sectarian violence in Pakistan started in 1980s. =Quetta= In 2011 the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta has left at least 1300 dead and more than 1500 wounded. The victims include high-profile community members, laborers, women and children. One third of the victims are children. The major attacks included assassinations of Hussain Ali Yousafi, Olympia Abrar Hussain, bombing of a Hazara mosque, Ashura massacre, Quds Day bombing, Play ground massacre, Mastung massacre, January 2013 Quetta bombings, February 2013 Quetta bombing, Hazara Pilgrims carnage, Akhtarabad massacre & other terrorist attacks on Hazara People in Quetta. The Al-Qaeda affiliated Pakistani Sunni Muslim extremist militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, has claimed responsibility for most of these attacks. In response to these killings, worldwide demonstrations were held to condemn the persecution of Hazaras in Quetta. The Hazara diaspora all over the world, namely in Australia, Western Europe, North America as well as the Hazara in Afghanistan, have protested against these killings and against the silence of international community. Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, the political leader of the Hazara in Afghanistan, has also expressed solidarity with the Hazara community in Quetta. The persecutions have been documented by the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Asian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.Retrieved 2.4.2012 Retrieved 2.4.2012 Accessed 2.4.2012 EU parliamentarian Rita Borsellino has urged the international community to address the plight of Hazara people in Quetta. The members of British Parliament, Alistair Burt, Mark Lancaster, Alan Johnson, and Iain Stewart asked the government to pressure Pakistani authorities concerning the absence of justice for Hazara community in Pakistan As a consequence of the attacks there has been a recent exodus of Hazaras trying to flee the violence. They are headed mainly to Australia & other Western Countries, where thousands of them have taken shelter and successfully relocated after obtaining refugee status. To get there, they complete an illegal and treacherous journey across Southeast Asia through air, land and sea that has already left hundreds of them dead. The most recent attack occurred on October 10, 2017, when two unidentified attackers on a motorcycle opened fire on a van heading for a nearby vegetable market, killing the driver and four others, continuing the trend of attacks against Hazaras in Quetta. This series of bombings, attacks and assassinations have forced them to retreat to two heavily protected enclaves on either side of the city: Marriabad and Hazara Town. =Response= In response, many members and leaders of Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) have been killed in military operations conducted by the army and the police.

He is \\"among the first Native photographers to document Native life in Yosemite and California through his own vision.\\"  Early life Robert Dugan Aguilar was born on August 8, 1947, in Susanville, California, where he grew up. His mother's family was Maidu from the Green River Rancheria and Achomawi living on Hat Creek. His father was Northern Paiute from the Walker River Indian Reservation in Nevada. Aguilar also has some Irish ancestry and preferred the name Dugan, because it means \\"of dark complexion\\" in Gaelic.  Military service  Leonard Lowry, one of the most decorated Native American war heroes of the U.S. military, was Aguilar's uncle. Lowry joined the United States Army in 1940, served in Australia, New Guinea, the Philippines, and Japan during and after World War II. Lowry won the Distinguished Service Cross in Korea in 1950, and retired after 27 years as a lieutenant colonel. Aguilar served in the Vietnam War for 13 months. The Maidu community made him a warrior when he returned and gave him a beaded golden eagle feather award. His mother transformed his uniform into a quilt.  Education  Aguilar graduated from California State University, Fresno in 1973. He studied photography at the graduate level at University of California, Santa Cruz; University of California, Davis; and University of Nevada, Reno.  Art career  Ansel Adams was an influence and inspiration to Aguilar. After Aguilar first saw photos by Adams at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco in 1973, he decided to learn how to print negatives in a similar way. He took a workshop with Ansel Adams in 1978, and decided to concentrate his career on documenting the Native Americans of California and Nevada. He has used techniques advocated by Adams such as previsualization and use of red filters to create a dark sky. According to independent curator and scholar Brian Bibby, \\"Aguilar's work is informed by familiarity and affiliation with his subject.\\"  Death  Dugan Aguilar died on October 6, 2018, in Elk Grove, California.

The turreted frame house combines the Queen Anne style with elements of Colonial Revival architecture. Hempstone, a Baltimore businessman, retired to the property that was then on the southern outskirts of Leesburg. The house was built by John Norris and Sons, who were responsible for many prominent houses, churches and commercial structures in Leesburg. Norris' son, Lemuel Watson Norris, became an architect in Washington, D.C. and designed projects for his father's firm. Description Described as \\"opulent,\\" the 2-1/2 story house is arranged with a square main section to the front, with a rear service wing. The front, on the west side of the house, is sheltered by a full-width single-story porch that wraps partway around the north and south sides. The main entry is a pair of doors with a fanlight transom. The interior features a center hall plan with a monumental stair offset to one side. The stair features a stained glass Palladian window on the landing between the first and second floors. The expansive central hall is flanked by drawing rooms, a dining room, and a smaller parlor. The rear wing houses service areas with servant quarters on the second floor. The main house is isolated from the servants' quarters on the second floor. A turret on the attic level is the only finished room on the third floor. History Hempstone died in 1913. After several owners, the house became a restaurant in the 1950s, then a private school in the 1970s. The house was restored in the 1980s. Following a fire, Waverly was again restored in 1995 and is the main feature of an office center. Waverly is itself used for offices.

Idiosyncrasy credits are but one of a number of concepts that attempt to explain how some minority views are influential, while others are not (see Minority influence). Idiosyncrasy credits are also relevant to the study of leadership, as leaders with many credits are often afforded a greater ability to try innovative strategies to meet group goals.  Overview Hollander's (1958) original work on idiosyncrasy credit is premised on the assumption that all individuals sharing a common group membership also share common group- based expectations of each other, and failure to fulfil these expectations will result in expulsion from the group. Individuals who fulfil these expectations will benefit other group members, prompting them to accord the fulfilling individual greater positive status within the group. Hollander posits that one component of this positive status is \\"idiosyncrasy credit\\", a functional status buffer that permits the individual to deviate from group expectations. Hollander believed that idiosyncrasy credit is expended by exhibiting deviant or innovative behaviours, influencing others to engage in same such behaviours, or by failing to perform an expected task. Leadership Idiosyncrasy credits also play a role in group situations that require leadership. Hollander (1958) argued that leaders who acted in a highly conformist manner also accumulate idiosyncrasy credits over time (and thus, as they climbed the organizational ladder). Thus, when a highly conformist leader arrives at the top of the organizational ladder, he or she is free to 'spend' their accumulated idiosyncrasy credits by behaving in an innovative and creative manner. =Transactional leadership model= Idiosyncrasy credit is frequently invoked to explain how leaders influence their followers to adopt new and innovative attitudes, behaviours and values. The most commonly employed framework is the transactional leadership (TLM), which explains the relationship between a leader and their followers on an individual-individual basis. According to TLM, followers accord leaders idiosyncrasy credit as a function of how the leader fulfils each follower's personal expectations of a leader, and how the leader's decisions impact the follower as an individual. From a TLM perspective, a leader's idiosyncrasy credit is the sum of the idiosyncrasy credit extended to them by each of their followers. =Social identity analysis= An alternative framework is social identity approach (SIA) which explains the relationship between group leaders and followers as a function of each follower's psychological belonging to the group. Followers that identify with the group will accord status to their leader as a function of that leader's prototypicality. SIA studies have suggested that, ceteris paribus, the status accorded by high-identifying followers to prototypical leaders contains a component of idiosyncrasy credit. Within the SIA framework, idiosyncrasy credit permits leaders to make counter-normative or innovative decisions. Followers evaluate how new decisions impact upon the leader's and the group's prototypicality and deduct credits accordingly. According to SIA, a leader's idiosyncrasy credit is the sum of the idiosyncrasy credit extended to them by each of their followers. Although this is also the case according to TLM, the theories differ regarding the psychological processes that motivate idiosyncrasy credit. Examples Numerous research studies support Hollander's initial claims. For example, a study by Hollander and Julian (1970) found that leaders of groups involved in decision-making tasks who were democratically elected (presumably because they had acted in the most conformist way to the group, and thus had many idiosyncrasy credits) garnered more support from the group, felt more competent, and were more likely to suggest unique and divergent from the other members of the group than those who were not democratically elected. Similar results were obtained in a study by Merei (1949) that examined children's leadership potential. In this study, older children were placed into small groups of younger children in a Hungarian nursery. The children who exhibited the most success were those who initially acted in a conformist manner, and only later introduced minor variations in group practice. More recent research (e.g., Hogg, 2001; Knippenberg & Hogg, 2003) has explained this phenomenon by stating that group normative behaviour on the part of the leader effectively communicates to the group that the leader is \\"one of their own\\" ‚Äì a central, contributing member who identifies with the group, and acts in the best interest of the group. Thus, leaders with many idiosyncrasy credits are afforded more trust and leeway when suggesting unique or innovative ways of conducting the group's activities, as the group believes that whatever is suggested by the leader is in the best interest of the group. In popular culture * In The Simpsons, Episode 3x01 (Stark Raving Dad), Homer Simpson unwittingly raises his shortage of idiosyncrasy credits among colleagues by stating \\"I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different!\\" (Idiosyncrasy credit is a component of popularity that permits being different). * The oft rephrased saying \\"He who is known as an early riser can stay in until noon\\" is an example of a person spending idiosyncrasy credits.

The driver, who was trapped in his van, was talking to emergency services on his mobile phone when his vehicle was hit by an oncoming train, killing him. The incident happened exactly a year to the day after the similar Great Heck rail crash. Details John Fletcher, a 47-year-old delivery driver, was driving a white Mercedes van along a stretch of road parallel to the B1188 near Nocton when he turned off along a disused road. The road had once led towards a bridge over the railway line; however this bridge had been removed in 1968 and the approach to the line was blocked by a brick wall. Despite this, the road camber remained in place. After travelling along the road, Fletcher's van smashed through the wall and fell onto the railway, trapping him inside the vehicle. At 18:30, as Fletcher was talking on his mobile phone to an emergency services operator, the 15:42 Central Trains service from Birmingham New Street station to via Lincoln, a two-carriage Sprinter train (156409) travelling at , impacted his van and shunted it along the tracks.

One of the assailants was killed in the immediate exchange of fire, and two others later on turned themselves in to the Palestinian Authority, were indicted by the PA, and were sentenced to 15 years in prison each. Two of the attackers belonged to the Fatah, one of them was a soldier in the Palestinian National Security Forces. The attack On Friday morning, 28 December 2007, Ahikam Amihai and David Rubin, two IDF soldiers and residents of Kiryat Arba, were traveling in civilian clothes (but with their military weapons) while on vacation, along with another young girl named Naama Ohayon, to the Nahal Telem wadi, which starts in Area C under Israeli control, and spreads into in Area B, where the Palestinians have civic responsibility, but Israel maintains security responsibility. Rubin, aged 21, served as a combat soldier in Shayetet 13. Amihai, aged 20, who was the grandson of Rabbi Moshe-Zvi Neria, served as a commander in the Israeli elite Air Force commando unit Shaldag. During their trip an SUV passed by the travelers, and the attackers in it opened fire at the travelers. Amihai and Robin returned fire using their own military weapons. In the exchange of fire, Amihai, Rubin, and the militant who was driving the SUV were killed. Before the attackers left the scene of the attack, they shot Amihai and Robin at close range to make sure they were all dead, and they stole their military weapons. During the battle, Ohayon was hidden behind a rock in the riverbed,2 Israeli Settlers Killed - New York Times and after the attackers fled the scene she contacted the Israeli security forces. Following the attack the Israeli security forces deployed roadblocks and attempted to capture the attackers, but inadvertently the militants managed to pass through a roadblock without being caught.  The perpetrators  An investigation conducted after the incident revealed that although Fatah, the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas claimed responsibility immediately after the attack, the attack was actually carried out by three Palestinians, Ali Hamid Rajeb Dandis Aa, Omar Badr Halim Taha,and Samer Nabil al Natsha. The first two were Palestinian policemen at the time, as well as Fatah members. Al Natsha, who was killed by the return fire, was a member of the al-Quds squads of the Islamic Jihad and the son of businessman Nabil al- Natsha. Dandis and Taha turned themselves to Palestinian Authority security forces, returning the weapons they stole from the dead. After the surviving attackers turned themselves over to the PA, the Palestinian Authority announced that they would not extradite the attackers to Israel. On January 22, 2008 the attackers were convicted in a Palestinian military court and sentenced to 15 years in prison each. Later on the Shin Bet claimed that the attackers ambushed the travelers in the wadi, in order to carry out the attack. When one of the attackers spotted the travelers approaching the wadi he immediately reported it to the other attackers, whom came over and assisted him carrying out the attack. Official reactions ;Involved parties : * During the cabinet meeting held after the attack Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert talked about the attack and stated, among other things, \\"The incident underscores what the Israeli government has been saying all through the political process between Israel and the Palestinians: As long as the Palestinian Authority does not take the necessary measures necessary against the terrorist organizations, the Israeli government will not be able to perform changes which would expose Israel to dangers and produce problems for Israel's security\\". Olmert also stated that \\"The soldiers fought bravely and were killed by terrorists.\\" : * The Palestinian Authority condemned the attack. Aftermath Following the attack Israel filed a complaint to the head of the United Nations Security Council and to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In the letter of complaint it was stated that \\"While Israel remains committed to advancing the peace process and committed to the principles of the Annapolis Conference and holds continuous meetings with the Palestinian Authority, they do not fight to prevent terrorism or to meet the various obligations including the Road map for peace plan.

It has large purple interambulacral regions with undulating lavender lines, while the remainder of the epithelium is coloured olive or light brown. This makes it highly sought-after by collectors, which may threaten the species. However, too little is known about the species to confirm their number. The purpose of the pigmentation, which is present in both the skin and skeleton, is also unknown, given the low light conditions of its habitat.

It was named after a gemstone Beryl. Design and description The Perla-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, p. 309 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Perla class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .Bagnasco, p. 154 The boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti- aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns. Construction and career Berillo was built by CRDA at their shipyard in Monfalcone, laid down on 14 September 1935, launched on 14 June 1936 and completed on 5 August 1936.Pollina, pp. 152‚Äì53 After entering service, the submarine was assigned to the 35th Squadron based at Messina but relocated to Augusta. Berillo at Monfalcone Naval Museum During 1936 Berillo underwent an intensive endurance training cruise in the central Mediterranean, sailing between Tobruk, Benghazi, Marsa el Hilal, Bardia, Leros and Naples. During January through September 1937 she participated in the Spanish Civil War, carrying out three missions. On 1 January Berillo left Naples under command of Captain Vittorio Prato for the first mission to be carried out off Cartagena. She returned to the base on 17 or 18 January without any sightings. On 5 August Berillo left from Augusta, under command of captain Andrea Gasparini, for the second mission to patrol an area northwest of Pantelleria, between Cape Lilibeo and Cape Bon. She remained on station for eleven days during which there were 45 sightings and attack attempts. On 14 August she fired two torpedo at a steamer, but missed.Frank, p. 96 Two days later she returned to the base. On 28 August Berillo set off on her third mission this time again off Cartagena. On 6 September she returned to the base without sighting any suspicious ships. In 1938 Berillo was transferred together with and to the Red Sea base at Massawa in Eritrea. In spring of 1939 she returned to the Mediterranean base at Taranto but subsequently transferred to Augusta. In January of 1940 Captain Camillo Milesi Ferretti assumed command of Berillo. At the time of Italy's entrance into World War II, Berillo, together with and , was assigned the 13th Squadron (I Submarine group) based at La Spezia, operating from Augusta. Early in the war, she performed missions in the central Mediterranean without encountering enemy ships. On 13 July 1940 she was deployed along with the largest submarines , and to an area east of Gibraltar. She did not encounter any enemy ships. In a subsequent mission she was sent to patrol an area off Malta, but again she did not encounter any enemy traffic. On 18 September 1940 Berillo was ordered to patrol off Sidi Barrani and Marsa Matruh in support of the Italian offensive in Egypt. During her trip to the area of operation, Berillo was plagued by a number of breakdowns. First her stern pump went off, but was fixed quickly. Then her aft hydroplanes went out of order, which were fixed but her steering was left rather impaired. On 25 September Berillo reached her patrol area, north of Ras Ultima. Two days went by without any sightings. In the evening of 27 September, after surfacing, Berillo suffered another breakdown ‚Äì her diesel engines suddenly died while she was sailing on the surface. Despite the crew's effort, they could only partially restart port side engine. For the next two days Berillo continued moving using electric engines and trying to repair her diesel ones but unsuccessfully. At 21:30 on 29 September, Berillo received a radio message informing her about a scattered enemy battle group that was detected nearby consisting of a battleship, an aircraft carrier, five cruisers and nineteen destroyers. Obviously the submarine could not possibly pass on such a juicy target, and even though moving at the exasperatingly low speed of , Berillo managed to reach her new assigned sector off Sidi Barrani, about further north than the previous sector, at 07:00 on 30 September. In the evening of 30 September when the submarine surfaced, the starboard engine finally came back to life. At dawn on 1 October, the submarine submerged again, and remained at the periscope depth for the rest of the day. Once again, no enemy ships were sighted. That evening, Berillo surfaced again to charge the batteries and to replenish air supply. When she tried to start her diesels again, one of the oil pumps failed. The crew spent the night fixing it, as well as working on the port-side engine, which was malfunctioning again. At about 03:00, enemy ships were finally spotted. The destroyers and were approximately away, returning to Piraeus after escorting Convoy AN-4. While remaining on the surface, Captain Milesi Ferretti continued his approach towards enemy ships. The speed of the closest ship was estimated at about . Berillo continued closing in until she was about away. The captain ordered a torpedo attack, but torpedo electric launches failed this time, so the crew had to do a manual launch. Time went by, but there were no explosion as the target was apparently missed, but the enemy destroyer detected the attack. As the distance shortened to , Ferretti ordered two more torpedoes fired but they missed their intended target again, with one of them going just under one of the destroyers without exploding.Giorgerini, p. 245. He then ordered hard to starboard to launch from the stern tubes, but at this point, the British ships simultaneously illuminated Berillo with four searchlights, and at the same time fired from their guns. While their shots missed the submarine, they forced her to abandon the attack. Ferretti ordered a crash dive as one of the destroyers accelerated towards the submarine with a clear intent to ram her. Berillo went to about in 32 seconds, and the depth charge attacks commenced, knocking out her electricals, intercom system, pressure gauges and diving planes. The submarine started experiencing problems with buoyancy, falling down to , and then rising to after some compressed air was blown. The next set of attacks damaged and knocked out the engines, propellers, started a fire in the aft compartment and opened water leaks in the hull. The submarine continued her up-and-down swings between , sometimes sinking to . Another attack sent Berillo sinking even deeper, or perhaps even more. The captain ordered to blow all air to try to save the submarine and her crew, and Berillo started slowly rising and eventually at 05:30 on 2 October, she flew out of the water with a list of 45¬∞.Giorgerini, p. 245 Two crewmen were sent to open the hatches, but they were all jammed due to the damage suffered by the hull. British destroyers meanwhile wasted no time in opening fire on the surfaced submarine. One of the shots knocked out the deck gun, and the other one penetrated the conning tower, killing two crewmen who were trying to open the hatch. In the process, the shell dislodged the hatch and the rest of the crew was able to abandon ship. As everyone left the submarine, she sank in the approximate position about north of Sidi Barrani.Rohwer, p. 43  Notes  References    External links *Coastal submarines: Perla class Category:Perla-class submarines Category:World War II submarines of Italy Category:Lost submarines of Italy Category:Maritime incidents in October 1940 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:1936 ships Category:Ships built by Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico Category:Ships built in Monfalcone Category:Submarines sunk by British warships ","title":"Italian submarine Berillo"},{"id":"33155528","text":"Irandegan District () is a district (bakhsh) in Khash County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

During his apprenticeship as Baker and Confectioner he played for the youth teams of FC Ostermundigen. In 1957 he transferred to FC Lugano and during the season that he was with them he made his league debut. For the next season he transferred to neighbouring FC Locarno as second goalkeeper, but he did not play a league game for them. For the 1952‚Äì53 Nationalliga A season Stettler moved on to FC Bern and advanced to becoming first goalkeeper for the team. But at the end of the 1953‚Äì54 Nationalliga A season the team suffered relegation and Stettler moved on to play for Luzern. Here he played for three seasons, despite that fact that they were also relegated to the second tier of Swiss football. Stettler joined FC Basel's first team for their 1957‚Äì58 season und manager Rudi Strittich. After playing in three test games, Stettler played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game at the Landhof on 25 August 1957 as Basel won 8‚Äì1 against Winterthur. Stettler stayed with Basel for seven seasons. In their 1962‚Äì63 season, with trainer Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka, Stettler was part of the Swiss Cup winning team as Basel beat the favourites Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich in the Final. In the Wankdorf Stadium on 15 April 1963 Heinz Blumer and Otto Ludwig scored the goal as Basel won 2‚Äì0. A well- documented curiosity was the fact that during the winter break of their 1963‚Äì64 season the team travelled on a world tour. This saw them visit British Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, Mexico and the United States. First team manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka together with 16 players and 15 members of staff, supporters and journalists participated in this world tour from 10 January to 10 February 1964. Team captain Bruno Michaud filmed the events with his super-8 camara. The voyage around the world included 19 flights and numerous bus and train journeys. Club chairman, Lucien Schmidlin, led the group, but as they arrived in the hotel in Bangkok, he realised that 250,000 Swiss Francs were missing. The suitcase that he had filled with the various currencies was not with them. He had left it at home, but fortunately Swiss Air were able to deliver this to him within just a few days. During the tour a total of ten friendly/test games were played, these are listed in their 1963‚Äì64 season. Five wins, three draws, two defeats, but also three major injuries resulted from these test matches. A broken leg for Peter F√ºri, an eye injury for Walter Baumann and a knee injury for Bruno Michaud soon reduced the number of players to just 13. Stettler was a member of this tour. He played in nine of these games. During his time with the club Stettler played a total of 253 games for Basel. 160 of these games were in the Nationalliga A and during these games he held a clean sheet on 29 occasions. Stettler played 20 games in the Swiss Cup, two games in the European Cup Winners' Cup, three in the Cup of the Alps, six were in the International Football Cup and 62 were friendly games. Following his time with Basel, Stettler moved on to play for Young Fellows Z√ºrich who at that time were in Nationalliga B, the second tier of Swiss football. Stettler and Young Fellows won promotion during his first season. He stayed here as goalkeeper for four seasons. He stayed with the club as youth trainer. From March 1978 he acted as trainer ad-interim for the first team until the end of the season and during this short period he stood on the field as a defender once. In the next season he acted as first team manager. International career Stettler was called up to the Swiss national team in 1962. He played his national team debut on 9 May 1962 as Switzerland were defeated 3‚Äì1 by England. He was nominated as third goalkeeper for the 1962 FIFA World Cup but did not play a game at the tournament. Stettler played his second and last game for the Swiss team, which was also against England, on 5 June 1963, this time the Swiss were defeated 8‚Äì1.

Background  It is not known when Zheng Yanchang was born. His family was part of the Zheng clan known as the \\"Northern Ancestor\\" branch and traced its line from the ruling house of the Spring and Autumn period state Zheng; its ancestors also included officials of Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420), Later Zhao, Former Yan and/or Later Yan, Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty. Of Zheng Yanchang's closer relatives was his third cousin Zheng Congdang, who was a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xizong. (Zheng Congdang's grandfather Zheng Yuqing was a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xizong's great-great-grandfather Emperor Dezong.) However, Zheng Yanchang's own immediate ancestors did not appear to be particularly prominent‚Äîas his great-grandfather Zheng Shen () was a county sheriff and his grandfather Zheng Zezhi () was an imperial guard officer, although his father Zheng Yi () was a prefectural prefect. He had at least one older brother, Zheng Yunsheng (), and one younger brother, Zheng Yanji ().New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Zheng Yanchang passed the imperial examinations late in the Jinshi () class late in the Xiantong era (861-874) of Emperor Xizong's father Emperor Yizong. He later became an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi ().New Book of Tang, vol. 182.  Service under Zheng Tian and subsequent career  When the former chancellor Zheng Tian (not related to Zheng Yanchang) became the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) during the reign of Emperor Xizong, probably in 879,New Book of Tang, vol. 185. he invited Zheng Yanchang to serve on his staff. After the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao attacked the imperial capital Chang'an in 880, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu, Emperor Xizong left Zheng Tian in command of the remaining Tang forces in the capital region. Zheng Tian put Zheng Yanchang in charge of the logistics of supplying the soldiers with food, as well as issuing orders to the armies to comfort them. After Zheng Tian later joined Emperor Xizong's administration-in-flight at Chengdu as chancellor again, in 882,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Zheng Tian had Zheng Yanchang made Sixun Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), as well as an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). Later (it is unclear whether Zheng Tian was still chancellor by this point), Zheng Yanchang was made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang), the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region), and the acting director of finances (Âà§Â∫¶ÊîØ, Pan Duzhi).  Chancellorship and after chancellorship  In 892, by which time Emperor Xizong had died and been succeeded by his brother Emperor Zhaozong, Zheng Yanchang, who was then the minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu), was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. He was then also made the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu). His service as chancellor was said to be undistinguished. In 893, when the warlord Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang tried to foster protests at Chang'an against Emperor Zhaozong's planned campaign against him, the protest crowd surrounded Zheng and fellow chancellor Cui Zhaowei on one occasion and attacked them, forcing them to take refuge in people's houses. In 894, Zheng was removed from his chancellorship and made You Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), as he was ill. He subsequently died‚Äîwith his biography in the New Book of Tang implying that the death was shortly after his removal, but giving no dates.

It is a relatively new category of call center technology that shows promise in improving call center productivity and compliance.  Types of agent-assisted automation  ;Desktop integration Desktop integration is focused on how the agents interact with their desktop tools. The main challenge is that there are often many desktop tools, some new, some legacy system. These tools can make the process of handling customers‚Äô requests quite cumbersome and time consuming. That time on the phone can often be frustrating for customers and expensive for companies. By using software to integrate the tools, the process can be streamlined. For example, information can be entered once and populated across multiple tools or doing a step in one tool can automatically accomplish a different step in another desktop tool. ;Pre-recorded audio Pre-recorded audio (sometimes referred to as soundboard (computer program) or as soundboard technology) is another form of agent-assisted automation. The purpose of using pre-recorded messages is to increase the probability (and in some cases error- proof the process so) that the right information is provided to customers at the right time. The required disclosures are pre-recorded to ensure accuracy and understandability. By integrating the recordings with the customer relationship management software, the right combination of disclosures can be played based on the combination of goods and services the customer purchased. The integration with the customer relationship management software also ensures that the order cannot be submitted until the disclosures are played, essentially error-proofing (poka-yoke) the process of ensuring the customer gets all the required consumer protection information. Phone surveys are ideal applications of this technology. Whether surveying market preferences or political views, the pre-recorded audio with an agent listening allows the questions to be asked in the same way every time, uninfluenced by the agents' fatigue levels, accents, or their own views. ;Fraud prevention Fraud prevention is a specialized type of agent-assisted automation focused on reducing ID theft and credit card fraud. ID theft and credit card fraud are huge threats for call centers and their customers and few good solutions exist, but new agent-assisted automation solutions are producing promising results. The technology allows the agents to remain on the phone while the customers use their phone key pads to enter the information. The tones are masked and the information passes directly into the customer relationship management system or payment gateway in the case of credit card transactions. The automation essentially makes it impossible for call center agents and also call center personnel that might be monitoring the calls to steal the credit card number, social security number, or other personally identifiable information. ;Outbound telemarketing Another specialized application space of agent-assisted automation goes under numerous headings including outbound prospecting, cold calling, solicitation, fund-raising, etc. Turnover is high among agents engaged in this kind of work because the task is tedious and emotionally difficult. It is tedious because you spend the bulk of your day, not talking to qualified leads, but in getting wrong numbers and answering machines. As good and as ubiquitous as predictive dialing technology has become, it still makes a lot of mistakes because the phone number inputs are outdated. It is emotionally difficult work because, beyond the tedium, you spend a lot of time hearing the word ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù, getting hung-up on, and cussed at. The pre-recorded audio allows you to dispense with wrong numbers and answering machines while you move onto the next call. Agents can easily handle two or three overlapping calls, an immediate productivity hit. Additionally, agents using the technology don‚Äôt seem to take the gruff treatment as personally. They report that it feels as if the customer is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the software, not to them. Finally, contribution amounts and conversion rates can be improved by adding some intelligence into the scripts, for example by raising and lowering the initial contribution amount based on the wealth of the area you are calling into or using pre-recorded audio with different accents, Southern when calling in the South, for example. Another benefit of the technology is that it enables the work to be done by lower cost agents in offshore locations. Benefits Just as automation has benefited manufacturing by reducing the mental and physical effort required of workers while simultaneously improving throughput, quality, and safety, agent-assisted automation is improving call center results while reducing the tiring aspects of the job for agents. In some cases, the agent-assisted automation streamlines the process and allows calls to be handled more quickly. By eliminating cutting and pasting from one application to another, by auto- navigating applications, and by providing a single view of the customer, agent-assisted automation can reduce call handle time and increase agent productivity. Second, in theory, the more steps that can be automated and the more logic that can be built into the call flow (e.g., if the customer buys items 2 and 9, then disclosures a, c, and f are read by the pre-recorded audio), then companies may be able to reduce the amount of training that is required of the agents while at the same time ensuring more consistency and accuracy. However, no published studies have reported this result yet. But an even larger problem in call centers is between-agent variation in behavior and results. Agents differ in the amount of training and coaching they receive, they differ in the amount of experience they have, their jobs are repetitious and tiring, and the process and procedures the agents are supposed to follow constantly change. Moreover, there are significant individual differences between agents in their intelligence, personality, motivations, etc. which all affect performance. Despite the large amount of money call centers have spent over decades trying to reduce between-agent variation, the problem is still so prevalent that one large study of customer interactions with call centers found that a customer‚Äôs experience was completely a function of the quality of the agent who happened to answer the phone.Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J. (July-August, 2005) Manage Your Human Sigma, Harvard Business Review, p.111 Therefore, the most significant benefit of agent-assisted automation may prove to be in how the automation error-proofs or poka-yoke the process and ensures that something that needs to be done or said happens every time. Properly implemented, the between-agent variation for whatever step of the process the automation is applied to may be able to be reduced to near zero.Patel, S. (2008) How to win a no-win situation.

It was directed by Alina Teodorescu. Synopsis Using a half road-movie, half documentary style, the film presents work and life of a Cuban band living in Guantanamo, Cuba. The film contains many music clips with well-done subtitles, as well as rehearsal work or live acts. In interview parts the musicians also explain how they develop their song concepts out of difficulties of daily life. Cast Yasel Gonz√°lez Rivera Gerald Thomas Collymore Rafael Oca√±a Creagh Angel Rubio Espinoza Yoannis M√©ndez Centeno Musicians Madera Limpia developed a unique mixture of hip hop / Rap lyrics accompanied by afro-Cuban rhythms and traditional music (e.g. Changui). This blend is often referred to as Latin Alternative or Rap Cubano. The band name ('clean wood') refers to driftwood used as very basic musical instruments. They sing about youth with no real chances (Verdad Global), love affairs (e.g. Punto de Partida or Descarga Fula, which is about a girlfriend going away with a tourist), or growing crime and unsocial behaviour in their neighborhood (Sue√±o Canino - A dog's dream). The band presented their music on a tour to Europe in 2005. After their first CD (Para√≠so OST) they recorded one more international CD. In Cuba there are also several 'unofficial' or bootleg recordings circulating on the streets, containing more open lyrics than is possible in an official production. German Der Spiegel called their lyrics 'Widerstandspoesie' (resistance poetry). Awards The film gained several worldwide awards, mainly on Latin-American festivals, e.g. * 2004 German Cinematography Award - Editing Award Nomination * 2004 Premio independiente.doc - Asociacion de la Prensa de Cadiz * 2005 AluCine Toronto - Best Non-Latino documentary References External links * * Website of production company, with detailed notes and clips from the film * Band review on NPR music Category:2003 films Category:Cuban films Category:German films Category:Spanish-language films ","title":"Para√≠so (2003 film)"},{"id":"33155825","text":"Hans Weber (8 September 1934 ‚Äì 10 February 1965) was a Swiss football midfielder who played for Switzerland in the 1962 FIFA World Cup.

The church, consecrated in 1869 was designed in a gothic revival style by British architect Sir George Gilbert Scott. After 1875, upon the appointment of Bishop William Russell as the first Church of England Bishop in the Diocese of North China, the church was commonly referred to as a cathedral, and the senior priest was known as the Dean. This cathedral designation was however mainly by way of common convention than fact as the titular bishop of the Anglican Communion located in Shanghai at the time was Channing Moore Williams of the Episcopal Church. The church has recently been restored and since 2006 has served as the main church and headquarters of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in Shanghai. However, as at June 2018 the church was still not open for worship. The bookshop in the former school was open. History Holy Trinity Church, Shanghai pictured in 1908Prior to the construction and dedication of Holy Trinity in 1847, church services attended by the British community were held in the British Consulate. Thomas Chaye Beale of Dent & Co. purchased and donated the current site of Holy Trinity as a gift to the church. The first church structure on the site was of poor quality; the roof collapsing on 24 June 1850. The neo-gothic design of the current church by Sir George Gilbert Scott, was modified by William Kidner, a junior architect in Scott's office due to budget constraints and in an effort to accommodate a growing congregation. The foundation stone was laid in 1866 and the church was eventually dedicated in 1869. A spire was added to the original tower in 1901 although this was later removed during the Cultural Revolution. Holy Trinity faces Jerusalem, which is roughly in the west. When introduced in 1914, the church had the largest organ in Asia an instrument supplied by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London. Before the forced amalgamation of Anglican denominations in mainland China into the lianghui in 1958, the church served as the Anglican cathedral of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui, known as Holy Trinity Cathedral (), and the oldest such cathedral in China. It was colloquially known as \\"the Red Church\\". It was the English speaking Anglican church of Shanghai in 1866-1949. It also had a boys' school attached, built in 1928. This was attended by the author JG Ballard in his youth, and it features in his novel, Empire of the Sun. The 1st Shanghai Baden-Powell Group was based there. Later, it became the cathedral of the Diocese of Chekiang in 1930, still an English speaking church. Location Its address is 219, Jiujiang Road. The nearest station on the Shanghai Metro is Nanjing Rd East Station. It has a separate carillon. Renovations Its spire was destroyed during the cultural revolution and has since been restored. During the cultural revolution, it was confiscated by the Huangpu District authorities and converted into a cinema. A stage was installed in the chancel, a second floor and sloping floor were introduced and the brickwork was covered by plaster and painted. Peter Hibbard, who described it as \\"a central feature of British life in a faraway land,\\" was consulted in its restoration. The restoration was carried out by Zhang Ming Architectural Design Firm. Carved teak pews were provided by a furniture factory in Zhejiang province. Current use It now serves as the headquarters of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, having been used for police offices and the exit visa bureau. The church complex was handed back to the lianghui in 2006.

Aged just 16 years old he made his Nationalliga A debut with Chiaso. In the summer of 1956 he transferred to FC Schaffhausen and stayed with them for two seasons. Frigerio joined Basel's first team for their 1958‚Äì59 season und manager Rudi Strittich. After playing in five test games, Frigerio played his domestic league debut for his new club in the away game on 31 August 1958 as Basel were beaten 2‚Äì1 by La Chaux-de-Fonds. He scored his first league goal for his club on 28 December in the away game as Basel won 1‚Äì0 against Lugano. In the following season, on 20 March 1960 he scored his first hat-trick for Basel as they won the away league game 3‚Äì2 against Z√ºrich. After two season with Basel, Frigerio moved on to play for La Chaux-de-Fonds, where he also played for two seasons. Again he moved on, this time to Lausanne-Sport. Frigerio played here for 18 months and in the winter break of Basel's 1963‚Äì64 season he returned to his former club. A well- documented curiosity was the fact that during the winter break of their 1963‚Äì64 season the team travelled on a world tour. This saw them visit British Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, Mexico and the United States. First team manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka together with 16 players and 15 members of staff, supporters and journalists participated in this world tour from 10 January to 10 February 1964. Team captain Bruno Michaud filmed the events with his super-8 camara. The voyage around the world included 19 flights and numerous bus and train journeys. Club chairman, Lucien Schmidlin, led the group, but as they arrived in the hotel in Bangkok, he realised that 250,000 Swiss Francs were missing. The suitcase that he had filled with the various currencies was not with them. He had left it at home, but fortunately Swiss Air were able to deliver this to him within just a few days. During the tour a total of ten friendly/test games were played, these are listed in their 1963‚Äì64 season. Five wins, three draws, two defeats, but also three major injuries resulted from these test matches. A broken leg for Peter F√ºri, an eye injury for Walter Baumann and a knee injury for Bruno Michaud soon reduced the number of players to just 13. Frigerio was a member of this tour. He played in 10 of these games and scored 10 goals. Frigerio won the Swiss championship title in Basel's 1966‚Äì67 season. Basel finished the championship one point clear of FC Z√ºrich who finished in second position. Basel won 16 of the 26 games, drawing eight, losing twice, and they scored 60 goals conceding just 20. Frigerio was the team's top goal scorer with 16 league goals. In that season Frigerio won the double with Basel. In the Cup final on 15 May 1967 Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In the former Wankdorf Stadium, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via penalty. The game went down in football history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1‚Äì1, referee Karl G√∂ppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty. Andr√© Grob√©ty had pushed Hauser gently in the back and Hauser let himself drop theatrically. Subsequently, after the 2‚Äì1 lead for Basel the Lausanne players refused to resume the game and they sat down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee had to abandon the match. Basel were awarded the cup with a 3‚Äì0 forfait. Between the years 1958 to 1960 and again from 1963 to 1968, Frigerio played a total of 256 games for Basel scoring a total of 176 goals. 144 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 23 in the Swiss Cup, 18 in the european competitions (Cup of the Alps, Inter- Cities Fairs Cup, European Cup) and 71 were friendly games. He scored 74 goals in the domestic league, 22 in the Swiss Cup, 7 in the european competitions and the other 73 were scored during the test games. The highest number of goals that he scored for Basel in a league match was four and this was on 29 October 1966 in the home game at the Landhof as Basel won 10‚Äì0 against FC Moutier. The highest number of goals that he scored for Basel in a test match was six. This was achieved twice, on 16.02.1966 in a 9-0 victory against Black Stars and in July by another 9‚Äì0 victory against local club FC Allschwil. Following his time in Basel, Frigerio moved on to play three seasons for Bellinzona and then he moved on to play for US Gambarogno, in a lower tier of Swiss football, where he ended his active football career.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has also been known as the T. N. Taylor Home. and One of the oldest pioneer buildings in the state, the Clark‚ÄìTaylor House was built around 1854. Thomas N. Taylor, a Provo Mayor, LDS bishop, and stake president, along with being a chairman of the board of trustees of BYU, lived in this home. The Clark‚ÄìTaylor House was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Registry on March 7, 1996.  Structure  Still sturdy, the Clark‚ÄìTaylor House is ‚ÄúBuilt in two sections, the two-story western section is a rectangular, gabled roof, single depth, 2/2 ‚ÄúI-form‚Äù structure. The eastern section has one story with a large attic. It is situated laterally with respect to the western section and has a broad gabled end (Hinckley/ Roberts p. 2).‚Äù The Clark‚ÄìTaylor House is one of the rare examples of a home still in reasonably good condition marking the time of the arrival of the pioneers coming to Provo in 1847.  History  The first mentioning of the Clark‚ÄìTaylor House is found in a consecration deed by Edward W. Clark to Brigham Young on July 24, 1855. The deed gives up ownership to the property to the church. Built just after the pioneers settled in Provo, the Clark home is one of the oldest pioneer structures in the state of Utah. Edward Clark relocated from England to Provo in the year 1852. An influential man, Clark eventually became bishop of the Provo Third Ward, a war veteran, and director of the Utah County branch of the Agricultural and Manufacturing Company. After Clark the home passed to John H. Carter, an alderman and a blacksmith who had served as Clark's counselor in his capacity as a bishop for the LDS Church. In the 1870s, after adding a second story to the home in 1863, Carter relinquished the home to Benjamin Bachman, in exchange for 85 acres of land. George H. Church attained the property in 1897, and in turn sold it to Thomas N. Taylor in 1898. Taylor bestowed the home upon his son, T. Sterling, as a wedding present in the year 1915. The house remains in the family to this day.  Thomas N. Taylor  Thomas N. Taylor was born in 1868 in Provo, Utah, the son of George Taylor Sr. and Eliza Nicholls Taylor. His father, George Taylor Sr., had founded the Taylor furniture store in 1866, which was the first furniture store in Provo. The company continued to grow, and eventually became incorporated as Taylor Brothers furniture in Provo. Thomas' education consisted of attending Provo schools and eventually Brigham Young Academy (now university). He married Maud Rogers in the L.D.S. Manti temple in the year 1889. Thomas was a political man. He was mayor of Provo from 1900 to 1903, and a candidate for governor of Utah as a democrat in 1920, although he did not win the election. Thomas was also active in his religion. A prominent member of the L.D.S. faith, Taylor served as bishop of the Provo Third Ward for nineteen years and subsequently served as president of the Utah Stake for twenty years. Taylor also served as a stake patriarch within the LDS church. Also active within the community, Thomas was a member of the board of trustees of Brigham Young University and served as chairman of that group and of the University of Utah Board of Regents. Taylor also helped to establish the Utah Valley Hospital. Thomas Taylor died in 1950. See also *Thomas N.
