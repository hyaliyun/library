Pentaphragma is the sole genus in Pentaphragmataceae, a family in the order Asterales. These species are fleshy herbs, with asymmetrical leaf blades.They are found in Southeast Asia.Pentaphragma is rayless, but eventually develops rays in at least one of the species studied. This is interpreted as related to secondary woodiness or upright habit within a predominantly herbaceous phylad. The vessel elements of Pentaphragma have features universally interpreted as primitive in dicotyledons: scalariform perforation plates with numerous bars; pit membrane remnants in perforations; scalariform lateral wall pitting; the genus also has fiber-tracheids with prominently bordered pits.The presence of occasional scalariform perforation plates, often aberrant, in secondary xylem of families of Asterales sensu lato - Campanulaceae, Pentaphragmataceae, Valerianaceae, and even Asteraceae (e.g., certain Lactuceae) - can be attributed to paedomorphosis, extending these plates into secondary xylem from primary xylem. Raylessness in Pentaphragma can be described in terms of secondary woodiness or paedomorphosis. The fact that fiber-tracheids are shorter than vessel elements in Pentaphragma is believed related to raylessness also, because some fiber-tracheids are produced from 'potential' ray areas.

It is a subsidiary of the Estée Lauder Companies. As of 2019, Clnique has over 22,000 customer consultants worldwide. History Farmers department store In 1967, American Vogue magazine published an article called “Can Great Skin Be Created?”, written by beauty editor Carol Phillips with Norman Orentreich, discussing the significance of a skin-care routine. Evelyn Lauder, daughter-in-law of Estée Lauder, read the article and brought it to Estée’s attention. Both Carol Phillips and Orentreich were recruited to help create the brand, and in April 1968, Clinique premiered as the world’s first allergy tested, dermatologist-driven line at Saks Fifth Avenue in the New York, USA launched with 117 products. Evelyn Lauder, an executive at Estée Lauder and member of the Lauder family, created the Clinique brand name and developed its line of products. Lauder worked as the training director for Clinique. She was the first person to wear the trademark white lab coat, now worn by Clinique Consultants worldwide. Clinique was the third brand that was \\"born\\" from the Lauder Group after Estée Lauder and Aramis. In 2008, Clinique announced a partnership with Allergan, the maker of Botox and former cosmeceutical partner of Elizabeth Arden, with the result being a new line called Clinique Medical. The line is only available in physician's offices.

Structure =Origin= The auriculotemporal nerve arises as two roots from the posterior division of the mandibular nerve. The mandibular nerve is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN5), and the mandibular nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale.Gray's Anatomy for Students, 2nd edition (2010), Drake Vogel and Mitchell, Elseview These roots encircle the middle meningeal artery (a branch of the mandibular part of the maxillary artery, which is in turn a terminal branch of the external carotid artery). The roots encompass the middle meningeal artery then converge to form a single nerve. =Course= The auriculotemporal nerve passes between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, gives off parotid branches and then turns superiorly, posterior to its head and moving anteriorly, gives off anterior branches to the auricle. It then crosses over the root of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, deep to the superficial temporal artery. =Innervation= The somatosensory root (superior) originates from branches of the mandibular nerve (cranial nerve V), which pass through the otic ganglion without synapsing. Then they form the somatosensory (superior) root of the auriculotemporal nerve. The two roots re-unite, and shortly after the branching of secretomotor fibers to the parotid gland (parotid branches), the auriculotemporal nerve comprises exclusively somatosensory fibers, which ascend to the superficial temporal region. There, it supplies the auricle, external acoustic meatus, outer side of the tympanic membrane and the skin in the temporal region (superficial temporal branches). It also carries a few articular branches that go on to supply the temporomandibular joint. The parasympathetic root (inferior) carries postganglionic fibers to the parotid gland. These parasympathetic, preganglionic secretomotor fibers originate from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) as one of its branches, the tympanic nerve, which enters the tympanic cavity through the inferior tympanic canaliculus. The tympanic nerve and postganglionic sympathetic fibers, which come with the arteries-related head, make the tympanic plexus on the promontorium. This plexus gives off the lesser petrosal nerve. This nerve synapses in the otic ganglion and its postganglionic fibers form the inferior, parasympathetic root of the auriculotemporal nerve. The two roots re-unite and shortly after the \\"united\\" auriculotemporal branch gives off parotid branches, which serve as secretomotor fibers for the parotid gland. Clinical significance This nerve, as it courses posteriorly to the condylar head, is frequently injured in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery, causing an ipsilateral paresthesia of the auricle and skin surrounding the ear. It is the main nerve that supplies the TMJ, along with branches of the masseteric nerve and the deep temporal. After a parotidectomy, the nerves from the Auriculotemporal Nerve that previously innervated the parotid gland can reattach to the sweat glands in the same region. The result is sweating along the cheek with the consumption of foods (Frey's syndrome). Treatment involves the application of an antiperspirant or glycopyrrolate to the cheek, Jacobsen's neurectomy along the middle ear promontory, and lifting of the skin flap with the placement of a tissue barrier (harvested or cadaveric) to interrupt the misguided innervation of the sweat glands. Pain from parotitis, a condition that can be caused by mumps, will be carried by the auriculotemporal nerve and great auricular nerve to the brain.

Education Rogers was educated at Bournemouth School in his hometown, the south-coast town of Bournemouth in Dorset, at which his father taught history. After a gap year in Bremen, in north-western Germany, he studied History for three years at Balliol College at the University of Oxford, followed by the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. This was followed by another three years at Balliol, at which he pursued doctoral studies in the history of socio-biology and eugenic thinking on the political left, though he did not finish his degree.  Career  Rogers successfully applied for a place on the civil service's 'fast track', and chose the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1992, he was seconded to the Treasury and did not return to his former department. He served in the Treasury, including as Private Secretary, to Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer. He then was seconded to the European Commission as Chief of Staff to Sir Leon Brittan, returning to be Director, European Strategy and Policy and later Director of Budget and Public Finances under Gordon Brown. In 2003, Rogers was chosen to succeed Jeremy (later Sir Jeremy) Heywood as the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. After three years in this role, Rogers left the civil service in 2006 to become Head of the UK Public Sector Group at Citigroup. In 2010 Rogers transferred to be Head of the Public Sector Industry Group, UK and Ireland, at Barclays Capital from 2010 to 2011. In 2012, Rogers returned to the civil service as the Prime Minister's Adviser for Europe and Global Issues and the Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat, based in the Prime Minister's Office at Number 10, replacing Jon Cunliffe who had become the senior British diplomat at the EU. On Cunliffe's move to the Bank of England the next year, Rogers succeeded him again, moving to Brussels in 2013. As of 2015, Rogers was paid a salary of between £170,000 and £174,999 by the Foreign Office, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time. Following the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Rogers became a key civil servant in the negotiations to leave. Personal views of the EU and resignation In December 2016, an internal memo Rogers had written suggesting difficulties for agreement was leaked. According to this leaked memo, Sir Ivan privately held the view that a settlement between the UK and the European Union might not be reached for 10 years, if at all, which did not reflect the Government's view. Questions were raised in the press whether Downing Street could any longer have confidence in his advice. He resigned on 3 January 2017, nine months ahead of the nominal end of his posting in October 2017. On 11 October 2018, in Cambridge,Trinity College, Cambridge. October 2018. Rogers] Rogers delivered a lecture on \\"Brexit as Revolution\\", in which he said that he continued to think that the risks of an accidental \\"no deal\\" Brexit caused by persistent British misreading of others' incentives and views, and by the EU's frequent inability to comprehend UK politics, were higher than was in the price.Ivan Rogers – Cambridge 2018 In a lecture that Rogers delivered on 13 December 2018 at the University of Liverpool he said that the EU was always adroit at reframing things that have already been agreed, such as the \\"backstop\\", in ways that \\"make the medicine slip down\\".Sir Ivan Rogers on Brexit, University of Liverpool Rogers was very critical of the strategy pursued by the British team in their negotiations with the EU following the triggering of Article 50. On 4 March 2019, while speaking to the Institute for Government, he pointed out the similarities in the tactics adopted by Theresa May's government and the tactics used by David Cameron's government in their renegotiations with the EU prior to the 2016 referendum. He said that May and her advisers' approach was to attempt to deal directly with the leaders of the major governments within the EU but the \\"reflex in the British system (is) always to think that we can deal direct with the organ grinders and not the monkeys: it never works like that. It didn't work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either. That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It's done via the bureaucrats, and the sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.\\"  Book  * 9 Lessons in Brexit. Short Books Ltd, 7.

Its name originates with its use: Party hats are worn most often at birthday parties, especially by the guest of honor, with a significant minority being worn for New Year celebrations. In Britain the hat is made of paper and is the shape of a crown, and is most typically worn during a Christmas dinner. The party hat has its origins in the dunce cap worn by misbehaving or poorly performing schoolchildren from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, with its festive decoration and society's positive attitude toward the wearer indicating a relaxation, abrogation, or even reversal of certain social norms: During the occasion in question, the wearer is permitted or encouraged to engage, rather than discouraged from engaging, in frivolous and foolish behavior for which the required wearing of the dunce cap would in other situations constitute a punishment. Party hats have originated in England Non-conical hats worn to signify an occasion's informal and festive status include decorated top hats, hats made from balloons, the beer hat or \\"beer helmet\\" (invented in 1983 by Buffalo Bills fan Jeremy Gumbo), and Mickey Mouse ears. In more extreme cases, partygoers may wear other objects such as lampshades or beer boxes, although the wearing of such objects often meets with social disapproval.

He was a child prodigy who had already acquired a broad understanding of Dharma philosophy and meditation by the age of ten. His teacher, Pomdrakpa, had received the full Kagyu transmission from Drogon Rechen, the first Karmapa's spiritual heir. Pomdrakpa realized, through certain very clear visions, that the child in his charge was the reincarnation of Dusum Khyenpa, as indicated in the letter given to Drogon Rechen. The young Karma Pakshi is said to have assimilated the deepest teachings effortlessly and required only one reading of a text to be familiar with it as he was already enlightened. Nevertheless, Pomdrakpa made a point of formally passing on all the teachings through the traditional empowerments, so that the stream of the empowerment lineage would be unbroken. This has been the case ever since: despite their innate clarity, young Karmapas receive all the transmissions formally. The second Karmapa spent much of the first half of his life in meditation retreat. He also visited and restored the monasteries established by the first Karmapa and is famous for having introduced to the Tibetan people communal chanting of the Om mani padme hung mantra of compassion. At the age of forty-seven he set out on a three-year journey to China, in response to an invitation from Kublai, grandson of Genghis Khan. While there, he is said to have performed many spectacular miracles and played an important role as a peacemaker. Although requested to reside there permanently, he declined, not wishing to be the cause of sectarian conflicts with the Sakyapas, whose influence was strong in China at that time. (There is an independent western reference to his presence in the court of Kublai Khan in The Travels of Marco Polo). Over the next ten years the Karmapa travelled widely in China, Mongolia, and Tibet and became famous as a teacher. He was particularly honoured by Möngke Khan, Kublai's brother, who ruled at that time and whom the Karmapa recognised as a former disciple. After Munga's death, Kublai became the Khan. He established the city of Cambalu, the site of present-day Beijing, from which he ruled a vast empire stretching as far as Burma, Korea, and Tibet. However, he bore a grudge against the Karmapa, who had refused his invitation to remain in China some years before and had been so close to his brother. He ordered his arrest. The legend tells that each attempt to capture, or even kill, the Karmapa was thwarted by the latter's miracles. At one point the Karmapa 'froze' a battalion of 37,000 soldiers on the spot, by using the power of mudra, yet all the time showing compassion. He eventually let himself be captured and put in exile, knowing that his miracles and compassion would eventually lead to Kublai Khan having a change of heart which did in fact happen. Returning to Tibet towards the end of his life, he had an enormous (sixteen-meter) statue of the Buddha built at Tsurphu Monastery, to fulfill a dream he had had long before. The finished work was slightly tilted; it is said that Karma Pakshi straightened it by sitting first in the same tilted posture as the statue and then righting himself. The statue moved as he moved. Before dying, he told his main disciple, Urgyenpa, details concerning the next Karmapa's birth. :This text is based on the abstract from Ken Holmes book Karmapa on the web site used with the author's permission.

It represents a listener's agreement with the point being made by a speaker. It was originally an imperative for directing attention to speakers, and has since been used, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, as \\"the regular form of cheering in the House of Commons\\", with many purposes, depending on the intonation of its user. Its use in Parliament is linked to the fact that applause is normally (though not always) forbidden in the chambers of the House of Commons and House of Lords. The phrase hear him, hear him! was used in Parliament from late in the 17th century, and was reduced to hear! or hear, hear! by the late 18th century. The verb hear had earlier been used in the King James Bible as a command for others to listen. Other phrases have been derived from hear, hear, such as a hear, hear (a cheer), to hear-hear (to shout the expression), and hear-hearer (a person who does the same).

The Puppet Master uses radioactive clay to make puppets in the likenesses of real people, whom he can then control by attaching the clay puppets to strings and moving them about. Presumably he has some sort of psionic ability that enables him to do this. He has a deep hatred of the Thing, who is romantically interested in his stepdaughter, Alicia Masters. He once tried to take over the world but was thwarted in this effort by the Fantastic Four. Publication history The Puppet Master's first appearance was in Fantastic Four #8 (November 1962), and he was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. His origin is told in Marvel Team- Up #6 (January 1973). Fictional character biography Phillip Masters, the man who becomes the Puppet Master, was born in Dragorin, a town in the small fictional Balkan nation of Transia. He moved to the United States at the age of eight. Growing up he was socially maladjusted and had no friends. (According to Spider-Man Family #4, his mother died when he was young and he was often picked on, which caused him to turn to his puppets for \\"friendship\\".) After he finished college he went into business with Jacob Reiss. Philip was jealous of Reiss' wealth and of his family and decided to sabotage his workplace, but Reiss caught him in the act. The two of them break into a fight which results in an explosion that kills Reiss and blinds his daughter Alicia, who was also caught in the blast. Phillip plays the explosion off as an accident, and then starts a relationship Reiss' wife, Marcia. He marries Marcia and adopts Alicia. Later, Marcia dies and it is more than he can bear and he loses his sanity. He begins experimenting with the radioactive clay puppets that he uses to control specific individuals' bodies. When the Human Torch interferes with one of his experiments, he sets about bringing down the Fantastic Four. He captures the Invisible Girl and the Thing, and masterminds a mass jailbreak using the warden's trustee. He then falls through a window to his death after tripping over Alicia's hand.Fantastic Four #8 Though his fatal fall is alluded to in his subsequent appearance, it is never explained how he is still alive. He has himself committed to a sanitorium for several months in the belief that this will allow the world to forget him. Upon release he takes control of Namor and uses him to battle the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #14 He also pits the Human Torch and the Thing against each other.Strange Tales #116 He teams up with the Mad Thinker and uses the original X-Men to battle the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #28 Teaming up again with the Thinker, who would become his frequent ally, he battles the Thing and the Torch again,Strange Tales #126 using animated life-size mannequins to battle the pair.Strange Tales #133 The Puppet Master is later seen among a group of criminals assembled by Doctor Doom.Fantastic Four Annual #3 He then controls Namor again.Tales to Astonish #78-79 He opposes the original X-Men through the mind-controlled Mimic.X-Men #27 He also sparks a battle between the Hulk and Namor by controlling the Hulk.Tales to Astonish #100 The Puppet Master next allies with the Mad Thinker and Egghead in their attempt to blackmail the U.S. He forces Iron Man to battle Captain Marvel.Fantastic Four #14; Avengers #63; Captain Marvel #14 He again teams with the Thinker, and attacks the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes.Fantastic Four #100 He controls Ballox the Monstroid, and battles Spider- Man and the Vision.Marvel Team-Up #5 With the Thinker, he battles Spider-Man and the Thing.Marvel Team-Up #6 He then forces Thor to battle the Fantastic Four.Marvel Two-in-One #9 He then controls the Wrecker and Power Man.Fantastic Four #168-170 Eventually, the Puppet Master returns to his homeland, where he encounters Modred the Mystic.Marvel Two-in-One #74 With Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master traps the Fantastic Four within the miniature artificial city of \\"Liddleville\\", their minds trapped inside tiny cybernetic, part-organic copies of their original bodies. However, Doom perverts what had been intended by the Puppet Master as a chance to give Alicia and Ben a normal life into a trap, and he eventually helps the Fantastic Four learn the truth and escape Liddleville while trapping Doom in the android body he had used to monitor the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #236 He is defeated by Doom in Liddleville Micronauts #41 and seemed to have been destroyed,Fantastic Four #246 but his mind is then resurrected in a body of living radioactive clay.Thing #4 He battles the Thing on the mental plane, and his physical clay body is destroyed.Thing #6 He is eventually resurrected in his original body by the Sphinx.Thing #34 He was once thought to have been killed when he fell out of the window of a fairly tall building, but miraculously survived. The Puppet Master has exhibited an uncanny ability to cheat death, dodging mortal threats that have included bomb blasts, drownings, and even a giant squid attack. Liddleville would later be used against the Micronauts and X-Force. The jealous Puppet Master often uses his clay to manipulate the lives of the Fantastic Four, especially where his stepdaughter was concerned. He is particularly concerned with guarding his precious Alicia from marrying the likes of the Thing. But he is later just as outraged when she is engaged to Johnny Storm, also a member of the Fantastic Four. With the Thinker and the Wizard, Masters attempts to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia. The plan was to launch an attack on the church after the wedding ceremony, but when he sees how happy Alicia is to marry Johnny, Masters is overcome with remorse and turns on his associates, launching the Dragon Man against them: his wedding gift to Alicia and Johnny.Fantastic Four #300 Later, Masters is reformed, remarried, and has a stepson; the toys he crafts for his son inadvertently caused a battle between Power Pack and the alien Ciegramites.Power Pack #60 He reveals to the Thing that he had discovered that the Alicia Johnny had married was actually a Skrull.Fantastic Four #357 The Puppet Master has been shown on two occasions attempting to leave his (overtly) criminal life behind. In the first, he found some measure of spiritual enlightenment in the service of the billionaire philosopher/cultist Satori. Satori employs Masters to construct a \\"perfect man\\" from his clay, which would then receive life and the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer and absorb Satori's mind, so that he might survive his body's death and serve as a proper leader to his flock. Masters at some point left this cult, and entered a S.H.I.E.L.D.-maintained witness protection program, using his abilities to aid the government through the dulling of memories of other so-protected criminals' previous associates. Masters reached out through his powers to control Ben Grimm and Alicia, duping Ben into a \\"married life\\" with his despondent daughter, whom Ben had stopped seeing years before. Ben was freed, but the Fantastic Four were prevented from taking any measure of revenge upon Masters, given his S.H.I.E.L.D. affiliation. The Puppet Master returned to criminal life and affiliated himself with the Mad Thinker. Utilizing a device constructed by Mad Thinker, he was able to control a large number of non- super-humans, most notably members of the Yancy Street Gang to escalate a battle between the two different factions in the superhero Civil War. In that same issue he reveals that he always planned to kill the person he was working with in past team-ups and that he has anger management problems. Mad Thinker gives him the number of a good therapist. This exchange seems to contradict previous interactions between the two.Fantastic Four #538 (August, 2006) The Puppet Master is then in the business of selling slaves (primarily females). Some of those under his control are superhuman females captured by members of the Chilean Army, and among those held captive are Dusk, Tigra, Silverclaw, Stature, and Araña. The Puppet Master also has random male slaves fight to the death.Ms. Marvel #18 Once again the Puppet Master is presumed dead when he detonates explosives hidden beneath the house he used as a base, in a battle against Ms. Marvel.Ms. Marvel #20 During the Fear Itself storyline, Puppet Master is seen in a comatose state in the Raft's infirmary. It is revealed that Purple Man was the one who had Puppet Master manipulate Misty Knight's Heroes for Hire organization to establish a criminal organization for him while he was in jail. Before he could kill Puppet Master, Elektra and Shroud arrive and prevented Purple Man from killing Puppet Master. Purple Man spared Puppet Master and took control of some inmates to attack Elektra and Shroud before escaping from the Raft.Heroes for Hire #9-10 Puppet Master later appears by Misty Knight's side where he uses the villains on Misty Knight's side as payback on Purple Man.Villains for Hire #3 Later, the Puppet Master has been murdered, with all evidence pointing to the Thing as the person responsible. The crime took place in a sealed room that even Mister Fantastic could barely enter with Alicia as the only witness, and even she cannot decipher what has happened.Fantastic Four (vol.5) #7 Although the Thing claims innocence, he allows himself to be locked up.Fantastic Four (vol. 5) #8 As it turns out, the dead Puppet Master was a decoy and the real Puppet Master had been hidden away by the Quiet Man, the mastermind behind Thing's framing and other misfortunes the Fantastic Four had suffered. Mister Fantastic later finds the real Puppet Master captive in the Quiet Man's building.Fantastic Four #645 Powers and abilities The Puppet Master has no revealed superhuman abilities, but he possesses a genius-level intellect and was once a brilliant biologist with a doctorate in biology. He is an extremely talented craftsman and very gifted in experimental science. His greatest strength was his ability to create extremely lifelike marionette puppets with extreme speed that he modeled after real people. Through intense concentration, he is able to control the physical actions of anyone after whom he models one of his puppets. How he did this was never adequately explained other than he used some type of special radioactive mixture. The clay he used in this mixture was magical, slightly radioactive, and came from a remote area near Wundagore Mountain, Transia, site of the prison of the elder god Chthon. He cannot control the actions of essentially mindless creatures, and his control can be broken by beings with supremely strong will-power. His control is limited to one person at a time, and the degree of control decreases with the distance from the person controlled. In other media =Television= * The Puppet Master appeared in the 1982 Incredible Hulk episode \\"Bruce Banner: Unmasked\\", voiced by Bob Holt. He gets control of the residents in Mesa City while also attempting to control the Hulk - his Hulk 'doll' even allows him to exert some slight influence over Bruce Banner, although Banner simply feels uncomfortable rather than falling under the Puppet Master's control - simultaneously causing the Hulk's true identity to be revealed, although even when the Hulk is in his natural state his sheer strength of will allowed him to eventually throw off Puppet-Master's influence. The only person he doesn't make a puppet of is his stepdaughter Alicia, which allows Bruce and Rick to track him down, Rick subsequently using the Puppet Master's equipment to erase all memory of the Hulk's true identity prior to its destruction. * The Puppet Master appeared in the two-part Fantastic Four episode \\"Origin of the Fantastic Four\\", voiced by Neil Ross. Unlike the comic version, this Puppet Master despised Alicia, treating her as a burden and a pawn to be used against the Fantastic Four. He took control of the Thing and used him to capture Invisible Woman. Mister Fantastic freed the Thing from his control and defeated the Puppet Master. Upon returning to his apartment to reclaim his final doll, Puppet Master ended up in a fight with Alicia and then he apparently fell to his death from the apartment window. The Fantastic Four weren't able to find his body and claimed that he \\"vanished from Earth\\". * The Puppet Master appears in Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes TV series, voiced by Alvin Sanders. As is the case with Alicia, the Puppet Master is African-American in this series. Debuting in the episode \\"Puppet Master,\\" he was a sculptor whose clay was hit from a fragment of the same space station where the Fantastic Four were in when they got their powers. After touching his clay, he discovered he can manipulate the person of whoever he sculpts, resulting in him taking over the Thing and kidnapping the award-winning artists and Alicia. When the other Fantastic Four members arrived, the Puppet Master sculpted the Human Torch and took control of him until Alicia broke the sculptures and the Puppet Master is jailed. However, the ending hints at him escaping as he disguised some clay as a pair of sunglasses. In the episode \\"Strings\\", Puppet Master had manipulated his guards into bringing him enough of his clay to control all of the city officials like the mayor and the police chief. This allowed him to have the Fantastic Four evicted from the Baxter Building and turned into wanted criminals. Puppet Master's ultimate goal was to have Mister Fantastic enhance his powers, but he was foiled. In the final scene while locked up in the Vault, he removes some clay from under his false teeth only for Invisible Woman to appear and take it from him. =Film= * In the extended edition of the Fantastic Four DVD, the Thing notices puppets in a scene with Alicia Masters at her art gallery. She says that they belong to her father.Fantastic Four extended edition DVD =Video game= * The Puppet Master appeared in the 2005 Fantastic Four video game, voiced by James C. Mathis III. Although the Fantastic Four doesn't fight him directly, he sends several exhibits at a museum (ex. mummies and dinosaurs) after the Fantastic Four when they protect Alicia. In the end after the heroes destroyed the statue of Horus, he escapes to the back door. Puppet Master's last line is \\"Next time, Fantastic Fools, the Puppet Master will not fail.\\" The heroes aren't aware that he was responsible for the disaster, believing it instead to be a side-effect of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers. In the instruction booklet that comes with the game, Puppet Master's bio is given explaining that he uses radioactive clay to control whoever he chooses. This is probably how he made the exhibits in the museum come to life and attack the Fantastic Four. Reception In August 2009, TIME listed the Puppet Master as one of the \\"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\\".

It was rated PG-13 by the MPAA. The film is a remake of Hodet over vannet by Norwegian film director Nils Gaup. Plot Nathalie's considerably older husband George (Harvey Keitel) is a stern and prominent judge whose only weak spot is Nathalie herself. The two are happily married and enjoying their beach vacation. Their nearest neighbor, Lance (Craig Sheffer), is attractive and lively and has a childhood history with Nathalie. To Nathalie's dismay and chagrin, George ventures on an overnight fishing trip with Lance to clear the air between them. Nathalie's initial reluctance is due to her fear of being left to her own devices (of which the true reason is later learned). Anxious and longing for her husband, she receives an unexpected visit from an old lover named Kent (Billy Zane). Seizing her chance for company that night, she welcomes him inside and the two reminisce on old times. Kent reveals that his girlfriend recently left him because of his drinking problem; it is revealed that he has a medical condition which is worsened by alcohol. While Nathalie is in the bathroom, Kent takes it upon himself to grab a bottle of liquor from her husband George’s supply. The two whimsically frolic all night and the scene ends with them exhausted by the night’s activities. Come morning, Nathalie discovers Kent dead, apparently from alcohol poisoning. Panicked and terrified, Nathalie quickly stores Kent’s naked lifeless body in a food cellar under the floorboard. When George returns from his fishing trip, she tries her best to conceal the night’s events and act normal. As the two talk, George notices the loose floorboard that is situated under the dining table. This is where the food cellar is located and Kent’s head is making the floorboard protrude outward. George stomps on the floorboard and corrects the problem. As Nathalie’s panic grows more desperate, George finds flowers and chocolate that Kent gave to Nathalie that night. Questioning her, Nathalie admits to Kent being present in the house the night of his fishing trip. When she reveals his location, George, believing him to be still alive, taunts him. When Nathalie reveals that he is dead, George comes to understand the true desperation of the situation. Taking his body to the nearby tool shed they debate over what course of action to take. The situation is further complicated because Kent’s clothes are missing and his neck was broken by George stomping on the cellar door. George's being a prominent judge and Nathalie's history (as it is now revealed) of early legal trouble for a pill addiction leave them little legal option but to dispose of the body themselves. Although Nathalie still insists that the authorities should be notified and the situation explained, George insists that it is not possible. The two decide to dispose of his body in the ocean by tying him down with an old stove. As the two are carrying it to the house, Lance inadvertently shows up and foils their plan and the two are forced to rethink their original strategy. Nathalie and George return home and get into a heated argument. Nathalie expresses her disdain over George’s annoying ability to strangely store items in unconventional places, such as storing sausages in a cigar box. When George questions how Kent could have possibly died, Nathalie mentions his “weak heart” and the fact that he was drinking from George’s personal liquor supply. George reveals that “the blue liquor bottle” which Kent drank was in actuality not (ethyl) alcohol but methanol (methyl alcohol) which is poisonous. Kent’s heart problems along with the disguised powerful liquid drug led to his death. As the two leave each other in frustration over not having disposed of the body, Nathalie goes out for a swim. Coming back from her swim Nathalie notices Kent’s white linen suit resting on the porch of Lance’s house. Seeing her opportunity to do the right thing, she insists for the suit to which Lance happily agrees. Believing her troubles are over, Nathalie goes in search of George to reveal the good news to therefore dress Kent and explain their situation to the police. Nathalie spots George on the veranda. She sees blood embedded in the newly constructed concrete steps. It is revealed that George cut Kent’s body into pieces and mixed them in with the concrete steps. Horrified, Nathalie runs but is quickly captured by George. Having taken her back to the house and tied her up and gagged her so she can’t escape, George goes out to finish the rest of the work. Nathalie manages to free herself only to take refuge with Lance. She explains the situation and is relieved by Lance’s calm demeanor and support. The two are noticeably smitten by each other and it can be seen that Lance never really stopped loving Nathalie all those years. As Nathalie is in the house she notices a postcard intended for her. Lance says he meant to give it to her but forgot and insists he hasn’t read it. The postcard was in fact the very same one of which Kent spoke of foretelling his visit. Nathalie quickly concludes that Lance knew Kent was coming all along and spiked George’s liquor supply in order to kill him. Horrified, she runs to George, believing him to be an innocent victim in Lance’s murder plot. Lance, insisting upon his innocence, follows Nathalie outside to the beach. Shockingly, as Lance and Nathalie are confronted by George, the situation ends in a shootout in which George shoots Lance. Nathalie runs but is captured by George soon thereafter. George has been drinking heavily and is completely disoriented but manages to take Nathalie to the veranda and cement her legs shut in a metal crate. Finally revealing that he was in actuality behind the whole ordeal, George explains that he knew Kent was coming that night from the postcard he purposefully placed in Lance’s mailbox to frame him and keep Nathalie from knowing about Kent’s visit. He spiked the liquor before the trip, knowing Kent would drink it and die. Afterward, George starts to have trouble walking and says that he can't see. Nathalie realizes that George has unknowingly drunk the spiked liquor, that Lance had borrowed it earlier, and that Kent really did die of a heart attack. George then falls off the high rise veranda and is killed when the top of it falls down and pierces his body straight through. As a domino effect, Nathalie is thrown into the water but is unable to surface due to her cemented legs in the metal crate. Luckily, there is a local beach patrol boat nearby and Nathalie is rescued. The scene ends with Nathalie in her own boat telling the beach patrolman her story from the very beginning.

Its aim is to strengthen the administration of justice and respect for human rights by investigating, documenting, and raising awareness about past instances of human rights violations, particularly unresolved murders, that occurred during Guatemala's 30-year-long Civil War. Its main tool in pursuing this goal is the application of forensic anthropology techniques in exhumations of clandestine mass graves. Its endeavours in this regard allow the relatives of the disappeared to recuperate the remains of their missing family members and to proceed with burials in accordance with their beliefs, and enable criminal prosecutions to be brought against the perpetrators. History In 1990 and 1991, various groups of survivors began to report to the authorities the existence of clandestine graves in their communities, most of which contained the bodies of Maya campesinos massacred during the \\"scorched earth\\" policy pursued by the government in the early 1980s. The forensic services of the Guatemalan judiciary began to investigate some of these cases, but they failed to pursue them to their conclusion. Consequently, in 1991, the survivors' groups contacted Dr. Clyde Snow, a renowned U.S. forensic anthropologist who had previously overseen exhumations in Argentina in the wake of that country's Dirty War and had helped found the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team. Snow arrived in Guatemala, accompanied by forensic anthropologists from Argentina and Chile, and began the dual task of conducting the first exhumations and training the future members of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team (Equipo de Antropología Forense de Guatemala). The Team was supported in its early years by a donation from the American Association for the Advancement of Science of the United States, and its first director was Stefan Schmitt, who has since worked on exhumations in Rwanda and Former Yugoslavia. In July 1992 the EAFG carried out its first field project at San José Pachó Lemoa in El Quiché department. The Team was restyled as a \\"Foundation\\" in 1997. That same year, the Historical Clarification Commission (Guatemala's truth and reconciliation commission, set up as a part of the peace accords that ended the armed conflict) asked it to conduct four field investigations in order to secure physical evidence to back up the testimony it had heard from survivors; this evidence was included in the Commission's final report, Guatemala: Memory of Silence. By October 2004, the FAFG had investigated a total of 349 clandestine burial sites and had recovered 2,982 sets of human remains. The current director of the FAFG is Fredy Peccerelli.

He was special adviser to Jim Murphy MP, the Secretary of State for Scotland from 2008 until 2010. In January 2008, while McTernan was employed as a special adviser to the Secretary of State for Scotland, it emerged that in 2002 McTernan had branded Scotland as being \\"narrow\\" and \\"racist\\" during the period he worked for the Scottish Arts Council. In an email to the then Labour MSP Karen Gillon, who was about to make a trip to Sweden, McTernan wrote: \\"If you’ve not been to Sweden before, I think you’ll really like it – it’s the country Scotland would be if it wasn’t narrow, Presbyterian, racist etc. etc. Social democracy in action.\\" The email was obtained by the London Sunday Times under freedom of information legislation. = Work in Australia = In 2007 he worked on the November 2007 Australian Labor Party federal election campaign.

ABC News. 5 March 2013. = Later career = In January 2015, McTernan was appointed Chief of Staff to Jim Murphy, then Scottish Labour leader, ahead of the 2015 general election, and oversaw media and policy in this role. McTernan strongly opposed Jeremy Corbyn, the eventual winner, in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, describing Corbyn's popularity as a \\"strange psychological emotional spasm\\". He asserted: \\"I can’t see any case for letting him have two minutes in office, let alone two years in office because I think the damage that will be done to the Labour party in that period makes it incredibly hard to recover\\". The MPs who nominated Corbyn were \\"moronic\\", according to McTernan. Following the 2016 revelations about David Cameron's earlier offshore earnings, and Corbyn's call for an investigation, McTernan argued in his Daily Telegraph column that tax avoidance is an expression of basic British freedoms. In February 2016 McTernan joined the policy and media advice agency Westminster Policy Institute as an associate. He continued to write a regular column for The Daily Telegraph. In November 2016, McTernan bet blogger Stuart Campbell $100 on a Clinton victory in the 2016 US presidential election, which he lost.

It was the seat of the Grey and Bennett (later Earls of Tankerville) families from the 15th century until the 1980s, when it became the home of Sir Edward Humphry Tyrrell Wakefield, 2nd Baronet, who is married to a member of the original Grey family. A large enclosed park in the castle grounds is home to the Chillingham cattle, a rare breed, consisting of about 90 head of white cattle. The castle is a Grade I listed building. In addition to the castle itself, a number of structures on the grounds of the castle are listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. These include the West Lodge and gateway, the garden wall to the west, the gateway and garden wall to the north, the gateway and garden wall to the south east, and the garden wall to the west. A pair of urns in the Italian Garden are also listed Grade II. History A 19th-century view of the castle from the south The castle was originally a monastery in the late 12th century. In 1298, King Edward I stayed at the castle on his way to Scotland to battle a Scottish army led by William Wallace. A glazed window in a frame was specially installed for the king, a rarity in such buildings at the time. The castle occupied a strategically important location in medieval times: it was located on the border between two feuding nations. It was used as a staging post for English armies entering Scotland, but was also repeatedly attacked and besieged by Scottish armies and raiding parties heading south. The site contained a moat, and in some locations the fortifications were thick. The building underwent a harsh series of enhancements, and in 1344 a Licence to crenellate was issued by King Edward III to allow battlements to be built, effectively upgrading the stronghold to a fully fortified castle, of quadrangular form. The castle from the east, across its Italian Garden Anne of Denmark and her children stayed in the castle on their way to London on 6 June 1603.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (London, 1930), p. 126. In 1617, James I, whose reign unified the crowns of England and Scotland (James I of England was also James VI of Scotland), stayed at the castle on a journey between his two kingdoms. As relations between the two countries became peaceful following the union of the crowns, the need for a military stronghold in the area declined. The castle was gradually transformed; the moat was filled, and battlements were converted into residential wings. A banquet hall and a library were built. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the grounds underwent landscaping, including work carried out by Sir Jeffry Wyattville. The once extensive park is now under a separate ownership from the castle. The Prince and Princess of Wales stayed at Chillingham Castle en route to Scotland, in 1872. Great hall, used as a filming location for Elizabeth. The fireplaces are film props. During the Second World War, the castle was used as an army barracks. During this time, much of the decorative wood is said to have been stripped out and burned by the soldiers billeted there. After the war, the castle began to fall into disrepair. Lead had been removed from the roof, resulting in extensive weather damage to large parts of the building. In 1982, the castle was purchased by Sir Humphry Wakefield, 2nd Baronet, whose wife Catherine is descended from the Greys of Chillingham, and Wakefield set about a painstaking restoration of the castle. In 1997, the castle was used as a filming location for Elizabeth, featuring as Leith Castle and as the hunting lodge. The fibreglass fireplaces from the film remain in the great hall, covering 18th century white marble fireplaces from Wanstead House. As of 2020, sections of the castle are open to the public including for late night ghost tours, and eight apartments within the castle and its outbuildings are available for holiday rentals. Chillingham's ghosts Lady Mary Berkeley, whose ghost is said to be faintly heard in the castle Its current owners market the castle as being the most haunted castle in Britain. It has been investigated on television, Most Haunted, I'm Famous and Frightened!, Scariest Places On Earth, Holiday Showdown, Alan Robson's Nightowls, The ParaPod, Ghost Hunters International, and A Blood Red Sky (2013). Some of these ghosts are referred to in a 1925 pamphlet by Leonora, Countess of Tankerville. Others, such as John Sage, are of more recent invention. The most famous ghost of the castle is the \\"blue (or radiant) boy\\", who according to the owners used to haunt the Pink Room in the castle. Guests supposedly reported seeing blue flashes and a blue \\"halo\\" of light above their beds after a loud wail. It is claimed that the hauntings ceased after renovation work revealed a young boy inside a wall. Documents dating back to the Spanish Armada were reportedly also found within the wall. In literature In the novel The Bride of Lammermoor (1819) by Sir Walter Scott, Chillingham Castle is singled out as a last refuge for an ancient breed of Scottish cattle. The castle and cattle served as inspiration for Eva Ibbotson's 2005 children's book, The Beasts of Clawstone Castle.

It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its role in the savings and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank regulators, it was paid by the banks it regulated. The OTS was initially seen as an aggressive regulator, but was later lax. Declining revenues and staff led the OTS to market itself to companies as a lax regulator in order to get revenue. The OTS also expanded its oversight to companies that were not banks. Some of the companies that failed under OTS supervision during the financial crisis of 2007–2010 include American International Group (AIG), Washington Mutual, and IndyMac. The OTS was implicated in a backdating scandal regarding the balance sheet of IndyMac. Reform proposals from Henry Paulson, President Barack Obama, and the U.S. Congress proposed to merge the OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of 21 July 2011. The OTS ceased to exist on 19 October 2011. Funding OTS did not receive a government budget; instead, they were funded by the banks they regulate, like other U.S. federal bank regulators.The Watchmen. p. 11. Other regulatory agencies like the OTS include the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve System, and the National Credit Union Administration. If banks regulated by OTS fail, revenues for the agency decline; conversely, if the OTS regulates more banks, revenues increase. History The OTS was established in 1989 in response to the savings and loan crisis. On television, President George H. W. Bush said, https://www.npr.org/transcripts/106021328 and \\"trashed\\" the predecessor Federal Home Loan Bank Board; soon thereafter, the sign was changed to the \\"Office of Thrift Supervision\\".The Watchmen. p. 10–11. Savings and Loan legislation—the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989—\\"abolished\\", or renamed, the independent Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed it under Department of the Treasury supervision. On 22 March 1990, in a setback to the George H. W. Bush Administration, Federal District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that OTS appointments of the former director and acting director, M. Danny Wall and Salvatore R. Martoche, had been unconstitutional because they were not nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In 1992, under Director T. Timothy Ryan, the OTS aggressively shut down troubled Savings and Loan (S&L;) outfits, and was criticized by the industry and industry lawyers for not allowing some S&Ls; that might survive to have a chance. Ryan contrasted the OTS cleanup of the S&L; industry to the former situation. S&Ls; were \\"dropping like flies\\" and this presented problems for OTS staff—declining revenues led to a declining staff. The OTS responded by marketing itself at industry meetings. At one such meeting, federal regulators were \\"announcing a campaign to ease regulation\\" and they were in a photo-op over a stack of the federal regulations—holding garden shears signaling their intent to cut through them. OTS Director James Gilleran brought a chainsaw. \\"Companies got the message.\\"The Watchmen. p. 12. In 1998, OTS approved 43 charters, with more than a third going to non-banks. In 2004 Gilleran said \\"our goal is to allow thrifts to operate with a wide breadth of freedom from regulatory intrusion\\". The OTS \\"adopted an aggressively deregulatory stance toward the mortgage lenders it regulated... [and] allowed the reserves the banks held as a buffer against losses to dwindle to a historic low.\\" In March 2007, a Government Accountability Office report noted that \\"In contrast [to the Federal Reserve], a substantial minority of the firms OTS oversees—especially the large, complex ones—have primary businesses other than those traditionally engaged in by thrifts, such as insurance, securities, or commercial activities.\\" Section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of 21 July 2011. The OTS ceased to exist on 19 October 2011. The end of the OTS prompted at least one thrift, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, to convert to a credit union rather than meet the \\"strict\\" insurance regulations set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. Reform * In 2008, then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson proposed merging the OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. * On 17 June 2009 President Barack Obama announced that he would ask the United States Congress to merge OTS into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates federally chartered banks. * In 2009, both the House and Senate proposals included merging OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. * In 2010, the US Senate passed legislation that would strengthen oversight of large financial institutions, but would continue to allow smaller banks to shop for their own regulator, a loophole sought by the Independent Community Bankers of America and the American Bankers Association. Responsibilities OTS supervised holding companies as well as thrift institutions. This resulted in OTS providing consolidated supervision for such well-known firms as General Electric (GE), AIG, Inc., Ameriprise Financial, American Express, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch. OTS's consolidated supervision program for GE, AIG Inc., and Ameriprise was recognized as \\"equivalent\\" by the European Union—allowing these firms to operate their financial businesses in the EU without forming an EU holding company and submitting to supervision in the EU. The OTS was the primary regulator of Federal Savings Associations (sometimes referred to as Federal thrifts). Federal savings associations include both Federal Savings Banks and Federal Savings and Loans. The OTS was also responsible for supervising Savings and Loan Holding Companies (SLHCs) and some state-chartered institutions. Institutions regulated The following are some of the larger institutions that were regulated by the OTS: * American Express Bank, FSB – Salt Lake City, UT * American International Group – New York City, NY (Note 4) * Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association – Long Island City, NY * BankUnited, FSB – Coral Gables, FL now (BankUnited) * Capital One, F.S.B. – McLean, VA (Note 1) * Chevy Chase Bank, Federal Savings Bank – McLean, VA * Citicorp Trust Bank, FSB – Wilmington, DE * Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania – Philadelphia, PA * Countrywide Bank, FSB - Alexandria, VA (Note 2 - now a part of Bank of America) * Downey Savings, F.A. – Newport Beach, CA (now a part of US Bank) * E-Trade Bank – Arlington, VA * Flagstar Bank, FSB – Troy, MI * Guaranty Bank – Austin, TX * H&R; Block Bank - Kansas City, MO * Hudson City Savings Bank, FSB – Paramus, NJ * IndyMac Bank, FSB – Pasadena, CA (Note 3) * ING Bank, FSB – Wilmington, DE * New York Community Bank – Flushing, NY * Ohio Savings Bank / Amtrust – Cleveland, OH * PFF Bank & Trust - Rancho Cucamonga, CA (Note 2 - now part of US Bank) * Sovereign Bank – Wyomissing, PA * USAA Federal Savings Bank – San Antonio, TX * Washington Mutual FSB - Seattle, WA (Note 2 - now a part of JPMorgan Chase) * Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB - Wilmington, DE =Indymac= In March 2008, OTS Director John M. Reich stated that the Savings and Loan industry remained vibrant due to the effectiveness of regulators. Reich blamed Indymac's 11 July 2008 failure on $1.3bn of withdrawals in the fortnight following concerns raised from Senator Chuck Schumer over the bank's solvency. Schumer faulted the OTS. The failure of IndyMac Bank was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history. Prior to IndyMac's failure on 11 July 2008, the bank had come to rely heavily on higher cost, less stable, brokered deposits, as well as secured borrowings, to fund its operations. The bank had focused on stated income and other aggressively underwritten loans in areas with rapidly escalating home prices, particularly in California and Florida. On 21 July 2008, Mr. Reich described \\"interference with the regulatory process by reporting and disseminating speculation about the condition of financial institutions, thereby undermining public confidence in those institutions and causing serious harm\\" as a contributor to the failure of IndyMac as well as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers. On 22 December 2008, Mr. Reich removed his agency's western director, Darrel W. Dochow for allowing IndyMac to backdate a capital infusion of $18 million from its parent company so that the bank would appear \\"well capitalized\\" in its 10-Q for the period ending 31 March 2008. According to a source with knowledge of the incident, at another point Mr. Dochow limited the scope of a review by OTS regulators of IndyMac's portfolio of loans and other assets, overruling the advice of others in the agency. Mr. Dochow played a central role in the savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s, overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize Lincoln Savings, the giant savings and loan owned by Charles Keating. Mr. Reich called the backdating irregularity \\"a relatively small factor\\" in the collapse of IndyMac. On 12 February 2009, Mr. Reich resigned, announcing he would step down 27 February. On 26 February 2009, the Treasury Department's inspector general released a report citing laxity at the OTS under Reich for adding significantly to the $10.7 billion in FDIC losses from the IndyMac failure, as well as the estimated $270 million in losses suffered by uninsured depositors. The report concluded that, under the law, OTS should have taken Prompt Corrective Action against IndyMac in May 2008. Commenting on the report, Inspector General Eric Thorson dismissed Reich's claim that Senator Schumer's letters caused the failure. Marla Freedman, the assistant inspector general for audit, detailed a pattern of excess risk-taking and abuse of the lending process at IndyMac and the OTS's consistent and concurrent failure to act. Mr. Reich said in a letter to the inspector general that he agreed with the agency's filings. On 27 February 2009, Mr. Reich stepped down amidst the continuing audit of backdating at IndyMac and four other institutions. Scott Polakoff, OTS senior deputy director and chief operating officer, hired under Mr. Reich, became acting director on his departure. On 26 March 2009, Polakoff was removed and placed on leave by United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner, amidst an announced further review and investigation of the backdating scandal by the U.S. Treasury's Inspector General. =AIG= The OTS was pressed by the Senate Banking Committee to admit partial blame for the failure of American International Group (AIG). In a congressional hearing, after Donald Kohn described how there was no regulator for AIG Financial Products or the company overall, Scott Polakoff interrupted.The Watchmen. p. 8. Polakoff stated that it was time for the OTS to take some responsibility because they had been \\"deemed an acceptable regulator for both US domestic and international operations\\".The Watchmen. p. 8–9. Due to OTS regulation of AIG, the Mayfair-based (London, UK) AIG Financial Products division was not subject to Financial Services Authority regulation.

The episode was written by executive producer Michael Piller and Jill Sherman Donner, and was directed by Corey Allen. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, Tosk (Scott MacDonald) arrives on the station and befriends Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney), but is soon pursued by the Hunter (Gerrit Graham), who follows him through the wormhole. Scott MacDonald would later appear in several further roles in the franchise as well as a recurring character during season three of Star Trek: Enterprise. Graham, who appears in a guest role as the Hunter, had previously been considered for the main cast role of Odo. Michael Westmore designed the make-up for Tosk to resemble an alligator; his initial design for the Hunters was changed for budgetary reasons. The episode was praised by the cast and crew, and received a Nielsen rating of 12.9, placing it as one of the four most watched episodes of the first season. Critical reception was mostly positive, with critics approving of Meaney and MacDonald's performances, but disliking the formulaic nature of the plot. The episode won an Emmy Award for best make-up for a series. Plot A damaged, unidentified vessel from the Gamma Quadrant docks at Deep Space Nine for repairs. Its reptilian pilot, identified only as Tosk (Scott MacDonald), is the first known life-form from the Gamma Quadrant to visit the station. Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) suspects Tosk is running from something, due to evidence of weapons fire on his vessel. O'Brien befriends Tosk and tries to help him repair his ship. However, Tosk attempts to steal from a weapons locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois). Uniformed aliens arrive in the Alpha Quadrant through the wormhole, beam onto the DS9 promenade, and start a phaser battle with a team led by Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). The aliens fight their way into the brig where Tosk is being held. Sisko, O'Brien and Odo enter the room as one of the aliens, the Hunter (Gerrit Graham) removes his helmet and expresses his disappointment to Tosk for capturing him alive; Tosk, it transpires, is the aliens' quarry. He commands Sisko to lower the forcefield and release Tosk, but Sisko refuses. They discuss the issue and the Hunter agrees to place the Bajoran Wormhole out of bounds for future hunts. As much as he detests this practice, Sisko believes that under the Prime Directive he must release Tosk to the aliens. After talking to Quark (Armin Shimerman) in his bar, O'Brien realises that he can change the rules of the hunt before Tosk is taken away by the Hunters. He lies to Odo and convinces him to release Tosk into his care, claiming it is a Starfleet, not a Bajoran matter. O'Brien escorts the Hunter and Tosk to an airlock, but the Chief has it rigged to overload, knocking out the Hunter, allowing O'Brien to help Tosk escape. In Ops, Sisko is informed about the situation and tells Odo to pursue the duo at a leisurely pace, giving O'Brien time to help Tosk escape the station with the Hunters in pursuit. Later, an angry Sisko reprimands O'Brien for his actions; the Chief expresses his surprise at not being apprehended immediately by Odo. Sisko claims that he must have slipped up and smiles wryly after O'Brien has left his office. Production Colm Meaney (pictured) called \\"Captive Pursuit\\" his favourite episode of the first season. Originally titled \\"A Matter of Breeding\\",Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 26 director Corey Allen said the episode intended to move away from the \\"squeaky clean\\" plots of Star Trek: The Next Generation.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 27 After the franchise's creator Gene Roddenberry banned disagreements between characters in The Next Generation, this became one of the main elements that the producers wanted to include in the new series.Reeves-Stevens & Reeves Stevens (1994): p. 66 In the episode, this was shown by O'Brien releasing Tosk, but originally, during the teaser segment at the beginning, it was intended to show dabo girl Miss Sarda propositioning Commander Sisko. \\"We had long conversations on that and ultimately came down on the conservative side, but we'd never even had that kind of conference on TNG\\", Allen explained. Executive producer Michael Piller wrote the episode with writer Jill Sherman Donner, who had previous credits on television shows such as Magnum P.I.Reeves-Stevens & Reeves Stevens (1994): p. 50 Michael Westmore designed the make-up in the episode, drawing inspiration from an alligator he saw in National Geographic magazine to create Tosk's appearance. The Hunters were initially intended to appear more alien-like, with steam rising out of their masks as they opened to reveal a demonic face with huge eyes and scaly skin. However, due to budgetary restraints, the original costume and make-up plans were scrapped and the description was revised to become \\"a rather mundane humanoid face, not far off human.\\"Reeves- Stevens & Reeves Stevens (1994): p. 35 The transporter effect used by the Hunters was inspired by the science fiction film Metropolis (1927), specifically by the scene in which the robot Maria undergoes a transformation.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 28 \\"Captive Pursuit\\" marked the first appearance in the Star Trek franchise for both Scott MacDonald and Gerrit Graham. MacDonald appeared a week later in The Next Generation episode \\"Face of the Enemy\\" as Subcommander N'Vek. He would also appear in the DS9 episode \\"Hippocratic Oath\\" and the Star Trek: Voyager pilot \\"Caretaker\\". In Star Trek: Enterprise, he was cast in the recurring role of the Xindi- Reptilian antagonist Guruk Dolim through the third season. Graham was once considered, along with René Auberjonois and Andrew Robinson, for the role of Odo, which went to Auberjonois. Robinson was later cast as Elim Garak. Graham later gained the role of Quinn, the second Q in Voyager, in the episode \\"Death Wish\\".Ruditis (2003): p. 85 The episode was positively received by the cast and crew. Meaney called \\"Captive Pursuit\\" a \\"classic Star Trek story\\" and praised MacDonald's performance, naming the episode his favourite of the first season. Michael Piller said it was one of his favourite episodes of the season,Gross & Altman (1996): p. 43 while Rick Berman said it was his favourite out of the first six episodes of the series and noted that the connection between Tosk and O'Brien was \\"charming\\".Gross & Altman (1996): p. 44 Reception and home media release \\"Captive Pursuit\\" was first released in broadcast syndication on January 31, 1993. It received a Nielsen rating of 12.9 percent, placing third in its timeslot. This was the fourth highest rated episode of the season, behind \\"Emissary\\", \\"Past Prologue\\" and \\"A Man Alone\\". It won the Emmy Award for outstanding individual achievement in make-up for a series.Erdmann & Block (2000): p. 8 Keith DeCandido gave the episode a warp factor rating of 7/10 for Tor.com, calling it a \\"good, solid, well-put- together episode anchored by two excellent performances,\\" despite believing the first season of DS9 was weak prior to the episode \\"Duet\\". DeCandido noted that \\"Captive Pursuit\\" was a good Prime Directive themed episode with interesting alien cultures. He described Colm Meaney as \\"magnificent\\", and said that Scott MacDonald gave a \\"superb performance\\". Zack Handlen, in his review for The A.V. Club, said that the episode was formulaic, lacked substance, and was simply designed to give Meaney something to do. He praised the dynamic between Meaney and MacDonald, but said that \\"while not a classic, [the episode was] entertaining enough\\" and it helped to set up O'Brien's character as one to balance the complexity of some of the newer characters introduced on the show. In 2015, Geek.com suggested this episode as a \\"recommended episode\\" for their abbreviated Star Trek: Deep Space Nine binge- watching guide. The first home media release of the episode was on VHS cassette in the United States on September 10, 1996. It was part of the initial launch of cassettes by Paramount Home Video which saw the first six episodes released and was on a single episode cassette. It was released on DVD as part of the season one box set on June 3, 2003.

This article lists some of the famous rivalries in the NBA. Rivalries are classified into three primary groups; intradivisional, interdivisional, and interconference. Interconference rivalries comprise games between opponents in different conferences. A team plays each opponent from the other conference in one home game and one away game. Intradivisional rivalries comprise games between opponents in the same division. Since the 2004–05 NBA season, there are 30 teams in six divisions of 5 teams each. Each team plays each division opponent 4 times during the regular season (twice at home, twice away) for a total of 16 games out of 82 total regular season games. Interdivisional rivalries comprise games between opponents in different divisions but within the same conference. A team plays against each team from the other two divisions in its conference either three or four times. The total interdivisional games an NBA team plays is 36. Conference games are often important, as a team's record in common games, as well as its overall record against its conference, are sometimes used as tiebreakers for playoff seeding at the end of the regular season. Also, many regular season opponents have met again in the playoffs, and the result of a regular season game can affect where the playoff game will be played.

It is depicted in art of the period as small to medium-sized, white in colour, with short legs, large powerful feet, a deep chest with slender waist, long drooping ears, and a very long curled tail. It is shown in one well-known example at Haddon Hall with a fierce facial expression. It is now extinct but is believed to be an ancestor of the modern beagle and bloodhound. It is uncertain whether it was a scent hound (bred for the quality of its nose), a sight hound (bred for the quality of sight and speed), or a dog used for digging out quarry. Nor is it known what type of quarry it hunted, whether deer, fox, boar, etc.  History  Carter of Castle Martin: a talbot standing on a mural crown. 1891 artist's impression The breed is said to have originated in Normandy, perhaps to have been the white St. Hubert Hound, and to have been brought to England by William the Conqueror, but this is not supported by evidence. There are no known references to the talbot as a breed of hound in Medieval French, and none have been found in English before the mid-16th century. In Medieval times, \\"Talbot\\" was a common name for an individual hound, as used before 1400 in Chaucer's The Nun's Priest's Tale (line 3383), and is used as an example of a hound name in George Turberville's 1575 work The Noble Art of Venerie or Huntyng. By the 17th century it clearly existed as a breed or type. Large, heavy, slow hounds were 'talbot-like', whatever their colour, though the 'milk white' was 'the true talbot'. In his poem \\"The Chase\\", published in 1735, William Somervile describes the use of \\"lime-hounds\\" (leash hounds) on the Scottish Borders to catch thieves, obviously referring to the bloodhound and the sleuth hound, but adds that the (white) talbot was the \\"prime\\" example of this type of hound. The origin of both the name and the animal is uncertain. In a quotation from about 1449, the king referred to John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury as \\"Talbott, oure good dogge\\", perhaps as a play on his name, or in allusion to that family's heraldic badge.The Oxford English Dictionary In a 1445 illuminated manuscript in the British Library John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury is depicted presenting a Book of Romances to Queen Margaret of Anjou, with a short-legged and long-eared white hound standing behind him, which serves to identify him symbolically. It is very similar to a 15th- century depiction on a ceiling at Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, made following the marriage of Sir Henry Vernon (1445-1515) to Ann Talbot, daughter of John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury. Talbot Hounds Fountain in Trevelyan Square, Leeds, a modern imaginary image of the talbot The talbot and the greyhound were, apparently, the only hounds used in English heraldry, and it could be that the talbot originated as an emblematic or heraldic hound.Lampson S. M. \\"The Mystery of the Talbot Hound\\" in Country Life 1965 References to this heraldic talbot seem to be earlier than any references to a real dog.The Oxford English Dictionary The talbot appears in many coats of arms, for instance in later ones of the Earls of Shrewsbury, in which two talbots appear as supporters. It is quite plausible that from these beginnings the name \\"talbot\\" was extended to any large heavy white scent hound, and from there helped to establish a breed or type. It was certainly similar to the bloodhound (\\"white\\" is given as one of the colours of the bloodhound in the 16th and 17th centuries)Topsell, Edward (1607), The History of Four Footed Beasts as regards size, and as regards use to a leash-hound. As earliest references to this dog are much later than those to bloodhounds it cannot convincingly be regarded as an ancestor of the bloodhound. Unusual black Talbot on an inn sign at Iwerne Minster, Dorset, a modern imaginary image of the talbot The talbot seems to have existed as a breed, a little distinct from the bloodhound, until the end of the 18th century,Edwards, Sydenham Teak (1800), Cynographia Britannica after which, like two other large breeds to which it may have been related, the Northern Hound and the Southern Hound, it disappeared. Some early dog-shows apparently offered classes for talbots, but attracted no entrants so were dropped.  Cultural legacy  =Public house signs= \\"The Talbot\\" (or \\"Talbot Arms\\") is most familiar as a name of English public houses or inns and is usually depicted on the signs as a large white hound with hanging ears, sometimes with spots. Heraldic inn signs usually displayed the arms or heraldic badges of the lord of the manor in which they were situated, who was probably the owner of the freehold interest, together with that of most other houses in the village.For example the Dolphin Inn in the village of Kenton, Devon, on the Powderham Castle estate of the Courtenay family, whose heraldic badge is a dolphin As the Talbot family possessed countless manors throughout England, the sign would have been well known. Such signs helped to identify the inn for the illiterate. An inn called The Talbot in Iwerne Minster, Dorset, UK, showed as its sign a black dog, apparently the crest of the Bower family, who owned the manor from the late Middle Ages till 1876. The \\"Talbot Inn\\" in Mells, Somerset is an allusion to the arms of the Horner family of Mells Manor: Sable, three talbots argent, the arms being possibly a play on the surname as hunting hounds are controlled by the blowing of horns. =Arms of Sudbury= The mayor and corporation of the market town of Sudbury, Suffolk, has for arms: Sable, a talbot hound sejeant argent on a chief gules a lion passant guardant between two fleurs-de-lys or (a white hound sitting erect). The crest is A talbot head and neck erased. Such a hound is also used as a logo for a local school and for many local sports clubs. The dog is always depicted with its tongue protruding. This refers to Simon de Sudbury (c.1316–1381), Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England, born in the town, whose coat of arms was A talbot hound sejeant within a bordure engrailed, as is visible sculpted in stone on a wall in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral.See image =Other= Arms of the Marquess of Sligo; the talbot is the dexter supporter, on the left side of the image The arms of the Carter family of Castle Martin (see Carter-Campbell of Possil) include a talbot. The arms of the Earls Waldegrave have supporters of two talbots. The Talbot hound was also the symbol of Weston Road High School in the county town of Stafford, Staffordshire. It used to be used in all school stationary and was displayed as white on a navy blue background on ties and jumpers in the school uniform. It was removed when Weston Road became an academy. The talbot also appears as a supporter in the arms of the Marquess of Sligo.

It joins the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, at the level where the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen, but exits through a different route. The chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves. Structure The chorda tympani exits the cranial cavity through the internal acoustic meatus along with the facial nerve, then it travels through the middle ear, where it runs from posterior to anterior across the tympanic membrane. It passes between the malleus and the incus, on the medial surface of the neck of the malleus. The nerve continues through the petrotympanic fissure, after which it emerges from the skull into the infratemporal fossa. It soon joins the pathway of the larger lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve. The fibers of the chorda tympani travel with the lingual nerve to the submandibular ganglion. Here, the preganglionic fibers of the chorda tympani synapse with postganglionic fibers which go on to innervate the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Special sensory (taste) fibers also extend from the chorda tympani to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue via the lingual nerve. Function The chorda tympani carries two types of nerve fibers from their origin with the facial nerve to the lingual nerve that carries them to their destinations: *Special sensory fibers providing taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. *Presynaptic parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion, providing secretomotor innervation to two salivary glands: the submandibular gland and sublingual gland and to the vessels of the tongue, which when stimulated, cause a dilation of blood vessels of the tongue. Right chorda tympani nerve, viewed from lateral side =Taste= There are similarities between the tastes the chorda tympani picks up in sweeteners between mice and primates, but not rats. Relating research results to humans is therefore not always consistent. Sodium chloride is detected and recognized most by the chorda tympani nerve. The recognition and responses to sodium chloride in the chorda tympani is mediated by amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. The chorda tympani has a relatively low response to quinine and varied responses to hydrochloride. The chorda tympani is less responsive to sucrose than is the greater superficial petrosal nerve. =Chorda tympani transection= The chorda tympani nerve carries its information to the nucleus of the solitary tract, and shares this area with the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves. When the greater superficial petrosal and glossopharyngeal nerves are cut, regardless of age, the chorda tympani nerve takes over the space in the terminal field. This takeover of space by the chorda tympani is believed to be the nerve reverting to its original state before competition and pruning. The chorda tympani, as part of the peripheral nervous system, is not as plastic in early ages. In a study done by Hosley et al. and a study done by Sollars, it has been shown that when the nerve is cut at a young age, the related taste buds are not likely to grow back to full strength. In a bilateral transection of the chorda tympani in mice, the preference for sodium chloride increases compared to before the transection. Also avoidance of higher concentrations of sodium chloride is eliminated. The amiloride-sensitive channels responsible for salt recognition and response is functional in adult rats but not neonatal rats. This explains part of the change in preference of sodium chloride after a chorda tympani transection. The chorda tympani innervates the fungiform papillae on the tongue. According to a study done by Sollars et al. in 2002, when the chorda tympani has been transected early in postnatal development some of the fungiform papillae undergo a structural change to become more “filliform-like”. When some of the other papillae grow back, they do so without a pore. Dysfunction Injury to the chorda tympani nerve leads to loss or distortion of taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue. However, taste from the posterior 1/3 of tongue (supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve) remains intact. The chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves.

For example, see:<> It is also referred to as Lakhon Luong (, lit. \\"the king's theatre\\").Cravath; romanized as lakhon lueng (\\"the king's dancers\\")Fletcher 2001, p. 306 During the Lon Nol regime of Cambodia, the dance tradition was referred to as Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer (, lit. \\"Khmer theatre of the ancient style\\"), a term alienating it from its royal legacy.Sasagawa 2005, p. 437 Khmer classical dancers, as a whole, are frequently referred to as apsara dancers by laymen; this usage would be incorrect with the modern form of the dance, as the apsara is just one type of character among others in the repertoire. Regardless, the tradition's romanticized affiliation with the apsaras and devatas of the ruins of Angkor still persists.  History  Angkor and pre-Angkor era One of the earliest records of dance in Cambodia is from the 7th century, where performances were used as a funeral rite for kings.Brandon 1967, p. 20 In the 20th century, the use of dancers is also attested in funerary processions, such as that for King Sisowath Monivong. During the Angkor period, dance was ritually performed at temples. The temple dancers came to be considered as apsaras, who served as entertainers and messengers to divinities.Becker 1998, p. 330 Ancient stone inscriptions describe thousands of apsara dancers assigned to temples and performing divine rites as well as for the public. The tradition of temple dancers declined during the 15th century, as the Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya raided Angkor. When Angkor fell, its artisans, Brahmins, and dancers were taken captive to Ayutthaya. Royal dance troupe of King Sisowath, early 1900s. French colonial era Dancers of the court of King Sisowath were exhibited at the 1906 Colonial Exposition in Marseilles at the suggestion of George Bois, a French representative in the Cambodian court.Jacobsen, p. 156 Auguste Rodin was captivated by the Cambodian dancers and painted a series of water colors of the dancers. George Groslier, the French-colonial director of the Phnom Penh Musée Sarraut (today the National Museum), had 're-invented' large parts of the ballet through his studies of the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat.Falser 2013 Post-independent Cambodia Queen Sisowath Kossamak became a patron of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. Under the Queen's guidance, several reforms were made to the royal ballet, including choreography. Dance dramas were dramatically shortened from all-night spectacles to about one hour in length.Sasagawa 2005 Prince Norodom Sihanouk featured the dances of the royal ballet in his films.

Retrieved July 21, 2007. Khmer classical dance training was resurrected in the refugee camps in eastern Thailand with the few surviving Khmer dancers. Many dances and dance dramas were also recreated at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Cambodia. In 2003 it was inducted into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.  Performance  The Royal Ballet of Cambodia at curtain call (Paris, France 2010) Princess Buppha Devi performs a propitiation dance (c. 1965) as a '. Note the dancers of lower ranks (') in obeisance. Royal Ballet of Cambodia perfoming Robam Moni Mekhala During the era of the French Protectorate of Cambodia and before, it was customary for guests of the royal palace to receive a performance of the royal ballet. In propitiation ceremonies (, '), it was performed at Wat Phnom and the Silver Pagoda and Throne Hall of the Royal Palace.This can be noted in vintage photographs and film. UNESCO's video presentation of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia depicts a modern-day propitiation ceremony at Wat Phnom. For entertainment, performances were often staged inside the pavilions of royal palaces. In Phnom Penh, the Moonlight Pavilion was built for and is still used occasionally for classical dance performances. Nowadays, venues for performances by the Royal Ballet include the Chenla Theatre and the Chaktomuk Conference Hall, designed by architect Vann Molyvann during the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era.These venues have been mentioned on news reels on Cambodian news programs. See this article for an example: http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011031447331/Lifestyle/discover- classic-dance-outdoors-by-chaktomuk.html Tourist restaurants in Cambodia, notably in Siem Reap, also serve as venues for classical dance performances by amateur troupes.This can be seen in many photographs posted on Flickr and videos on Youtube. Restaurants include 'Jasmine Angkor' and 'Koulen'. Canby Publications has a section on this at . = Stage and props = The traditional stage for classical dance drama performances contains a table with a decorative pillow, sometimes laid on an Oriental rug or carpet.As seen in this photograph: and as depicted in other photographs and video. This table of low stature, called a krae (, lit. \\"bed\\"), is constant throughout the performance and thus is used as a prop that represents many places and things (a bed, a throne, living quarters, etc.).Cravath romanizes this term as kré. In this photo of the Reamker :File:Cambodian dance Reamker.png, parts of the krae can be seen behind the main group of dancers. In many dance dramas, characters often wield weapons such as bows, swords, staves, and clubs.This is notable in many media provided by laymen online as well as photos provided in this article. See http://www.jiras.se/preahsamuth/index.html, which shows the dance drama Preah Samut and characters wielding bows and staves. In some dances, dancers hold items such as flower garlands, fans, and gold and silver flowers as a tribute (see ).See [File:Cambodian_Classical_Dance_of_Tribute.ogv] as an example where dancers hold gold flowers as a tribute. Performances of ' (the makara dance) entail devas dancing in leisure and using fans to represent the scales of the mythical makara while the goddess Manimekhala leads the mimicry with her crystal ball of magic.As seen in the Khmer classical dance video posted on this webpage: and many others.  Movement and gestures  Khmer classical dancers use stylized movements and gestures to convey meaning and tell a story. These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers. Hand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called ' (meaning \\"style\\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts. The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.  Characters  Four main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ' (male), ' (female), ' (ogres or asuras), and the ' (monkeys).Bois, p. 4 These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ', for example, would be a leading male role and a ' (or ') would be a maiden-servant. The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the '. Most roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.  Costume  Classical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit. = Female costume = The typical female, or ', costume consists of a ' (or '), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then pleated into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a shawl-like garment called a ' (also known as the ', literally \\"back cover\\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the sbai these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the sbai is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a '. Jewelry for the female role includes a large, filigree square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists bracelets and bangles, an armlet on the right arm, and body chains of various styles. = Male costume = Male characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or neay rong, the ' is worn in the ' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered hem around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of epaulette that arches upwards like Indra's bow (known as '). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ' while the two side pieces are known as a '; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a '. Male characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a '; it may be made of gold- colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ' (named after the bo tree leaf), which serves as a center point for their ';. = Headdress = There are several types of crowns that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the '; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. Divinities and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ' for male characters and a ' for female characters. The ' (Groslier romanizes this as '), reserved for princes and generals ('), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ' attached. = Floral adornments = Dancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of Jasminum sambac strung together with Michelia flowers, being either Michelia × alba or Michelia champaca. The ' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The apsara role is most often adorned with the flowers of either Plumeria obtusa or white cultivars of Plumeria rubra; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.  Music  The music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of xylophones, drums, oboes, gongs, and other musical instruments. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [əː], eung [əːŋ], and euy [əːj] in various patterns. = Musical instruments = = Music pieces = Khmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking. These musical pieces are arranged to form a suite. New pieces of music are rarely created. Below is a select list of music pieces used in the repertoire: *' : () a song of blessing used for propitiation, often used to commence a performance *' : (), also known as ' (), overture of the ' (ogre) characters, a display of power as they go into combat or battle *' : () used for the introduction of a character or a group of dancers in a scene *' : () used to present a character's departure from the scene; leaving the stage *' : () lit., euphonic '; music characterized by the constant percussion of drums and small cup- shaped cymbals;Robert K. Headley 1997, Cambodian-English Dictionary used to present an action such as commencing a journey or flying *' : () music used in tune with aquatic recreation (e.g. dancers miming the action of rowing a boat) *' : () lit., \\"royal bathing of the Mon\\"; a song used to represent a character dressing up their appearance *' : (); also known as ' (), a music piece used to present dancers marching (e.g. the beginning of ') *' : () used to show the grace and beauty of a character wielding his weapon *' : () - lit., \\"cream color\\", in reference to complexion, a soft and slow feminine melody *' : () - a music characterized by the ', often used for certain actions such as combat, but not limited to such *' () *' () *' () *' ()  Repertoire  According to The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre (1997), the Royal Ballet's repertoire contained approximately 40 dances and 60 dance dramas. Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably robam monosanhchettana by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as Apsara Mera. Sophiline Cheam Shapiro has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ', an adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello and ', an adaptation of Mozart's The Magic Flute. = Dance dramas = The repertoire of dance dramas (, ') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ', which is limited only to the Ramayana. Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the lakhon nai dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as Roeung Preah Thong- Neang Neak; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003. The plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a damsel in distress or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as karma. A dance of tribute used in a dance drama titled Preah Ket Mealea, circa 1965  Select repertory of dance dramas  = Dances = In contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as '. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many robam are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ' and ' (the latter being from the '). The 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the bas-relief of apsaras on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the Angkor period.

In addition, pregnenolone is biologically active in its own right, acting as a neurosteroid. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, pregnenolone has been used as a medication and supplement; for information on pregnenolone as a medication or supplement, see the pregnenolone (medication) article. Biological function Pregnenolone and its 3β-sulfate, pregnenolone sulfate, like DHEA, DHEA sulfate, and progesterone, belong to the group of neurosteroids that are found in high concentrations in certain areas of the brain, and are synthesized there. Neurosteroids affect synaptic functioning, are neuroprotective, and enhance myelinization. Pregnenolone and its sulfate ester may improve cognitive and memory function. In addition, they may have protective effects against schizophrenia. Biological activity =Neurosteroid activity= Pregnenolone is an allosteric endocannabinoid, as it is a negative allosteric modulator of the CB1 receptor. Pregnenolone is involved in a natural negative feedback loop against CB1 receptor activation in animals. It prevents CB1 receptor agonists like tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active constituent in cannabis, from fully activating the CB1. Vallée, M., Vitiello, S., Bellocchio, L., Hébert-Chatelain, E., Monlezun, S., Martin-Garcia, E., Kasanetz, F., Baillie, GL., Panin, F., Cathala, A., Roullot-Lacarrière, V., Fabre, S., Hurst, DP., Lynch, DL., Shore, DM., Deroche-Gamonet, V., Spampinato, U., Revest, JM., Maldonado, R., Reggio, PH., Ross, RA., Marsicano, G., Piazza, PV. , \\"Pregnenolone Can Protect the Brain from Cannabis Intoxication\\", Science, January 2014 Science 343(6166):94-8. Pregnenolone has been found to bind with high, nanomolar affinity to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the brain. In contrast to pregnenolone, pregnenolone sulfate did not bind to microtubules. However, progesterone did and with similar affinity to pregnenolone, although unlike pregnenolone, it did not increase binding of MAP2 to tubulin. Pregnenolone was found to induce tubule polymerization in neuronal cultures and to increase neurite growth in PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor. As such, pregnenolone may control formation and stabilization of microtubules in neurons and may affect both neural development during prenatal development and neural plasticity during aging. Although pregnenolone itself does not possess these activities, its metabolite pregnenolone sulfate is a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor as well as a positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor. In addition, pregnenolone sulfate has been shown to activate the transient receptor potential M3 (TRPM3) ion channel in hepatocytes and pancreatic islets causing calcium entry and subsequent insulin release. =Nuclear receptor activity= Pregnenolone has been found to act as an agonist of the pregnane X receptor. Pregnenolone has no progestogenic, corticosteroid, estrogenic, androgenic, or antiandrogenic activity. Biochemistry Steroidogenesis, showing pregnenolone near top left. =Biosynthesis= Pregnenolone is synthesized from cholesterol. This conversion involves hydroxylation of the side chain at the C20 and C22 positions, with cleavage of the side chain. The enzyme performing this task is cytochrome P450scc, located in the mitochondria, and controlled by anterior pituitary trophic hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle- stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, in the adrenal glands and gonads. There are two intermediates in the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone, 22R-hydroxycholesterol and 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol, and all three steps in the transformation are catalyzed by P450scc. Pregnenolone is produced mainly in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain. Although pregnenolone is also produced in the gonads and brain, most circulating pregnenolone is derived from the adrenal cortex.https://www.questdiagnostics.com/hcp/intguide/EndoMetab/EndoManual_AtoZ_PDFs/Pregnenolone.pdf To assay conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, radiolabeled cholesterol has been used. Pregnenolone product can be separated from cholesterol substrate using Sephadex LH-20 minicolumns. =Distribution= Pregnenolone is lipophilic and readily crosses the blood–brain barrier. This is in contrast to pregnenolone sulfate, which does not cross the blood–brain barrier. =Metabolism= Pregnenolone undergoes further steroid metabolism in one of several ways: * Pregnenolone can be converted into progesterone. The critical enzyme step is two-fold using a 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a Δ5-4 isomerase. The latter transfers the double bond from C5 to C4 on the A ring. Progesterone is the entry into the Δ4 pathway, resulting in production of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione, precursor to testosterone and estrone. Aldosterone and corticosteroids are also derived from progesterone or its derivatives. * Pregnenolone can be converted to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone by the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1). Using this pathway, termed Δ5 pathway, the next step is conversion to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) via 17,20-lyase (CYP17A1). DHEA is the precursor of androstenedione. * Pregnenolone can be converted to androstadienol by 16-ene synthase (CYP17A1). * Pregnenolone can be converted to pregnenolone sulfate by steroid sulfotransferase, and this conversion can be reversed by steroid sulfatase. =Levels= Normal circulating levels of pregnenolone are as follows: * Men: 10 to 200 ng/dL * Women: 10 to 230 ng/dL * Children: 10 to 48 ng/dL * Adolescent boys: 10 to 50 ng/dL * Adolescent girls: 15 to 84 ng/dL Mean levels of pregnenolone have been found not to significantly differ in postmenopausal women and elderly men (40 and 39 ng/dL, respectively). Studies have found that pregnenolone levels are not significantly changed after surgical or medical castration in men, which is in accordance with the fact that pregnenolone is mainly derived from the adrenal glands. Conversely, medical castration has been found to partially suppress pregnenolone levels in premenopausal women. Similarly, an adrenalectomized premenopausal woman showed incompletely diminished circulating pregnenolone levels. Chemistry Pregnenolone is also known chemically as pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one. Like other steroids, it consists of four interconnected cyclic hydrocarbons. The compound contains ketone and hydroxyl functional groups, two methyl branches, and a double bond at C5, in the B cyclic hydrocarbon ring. Like many steroid hormones, it is hydrophobic. The sulfated derivative, pregnenolone sulfate, is water-soluble. 3β-Dihydroprogesterone (pregn-4-en-3β-ol-20-one) is an isomer of pregnenolone in which the C5 double bond has been replaced with a C4 double bond. History Pregnenolone was first synthesized by Adolf Butenandt and colleagues in 1934.

The ions are trapped in a Penning trap (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a \\"packet\\" of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum. History FT-ICR was invented by Melvin B. Comisarow and Alan G.

The inspiration was earlier developments in conventional ICR and Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectroscopy.

Theory Linear ion trap – Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (panels around magnet are missing) The physics of FTICR is similar to that of a cyclotron at least in the first approximation. In the simplest idealized form, the relationship between the cyclotron frequency and the mass-to-charge ratio is given by :f = \\\\frac{qB}{2\\\\pi m}, where f = cyclotron frequency, q = ion charge, B = magnetic field strength and m = ion mass. This is more often represented in angular frequency: :\\\\omega_\\\\text{c} = \\\\frac{qB}{m}, where \\\\omega_\\\\text{c} is the angular cyclotron frequency, which is related to frequency by the definition f = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{2\\\\pi}. Because of the quadrupolar electrical field used to trap the ions in the axial direction, this relationship is only approximate. The axial electrical trapping results in axial oscillations within the trap with the (angular) frequency :\\\\omega_\\\\text{t} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{q\\\\alpha}{m}}, where \\\\alpha is a constant similar to the spring constant of a harmonic oscillator and is dependent on applied voltage, trap dimensions and trap geometry. The electric field and the resulting axial harmonic motion reduces the cyclotron frequency and introduces a second radial motion called magnetron motion that occurs at the magnetron frequency. The cyclotron motion is still the frequency being used, but the relationship above is not exact due to this phenomenon. The natural angular frequencies of motion are :\\\\omega_\\\\pm = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}}{2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{c}}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac{\\\\omega_\\\\text{t}^2}{2}}, where \\\\omega_\\\\text{t} is the axial trapping frequency due the axial electrical trapping and \\\\omega_+ is the reduced cyclotron (angular) frequency and \\\\omega_- is the magnetron (angular) frequency. Again, \\\\omega_+ is what is typically measured in FTICR. The meaning of this equation can be understood qualitatively by considering the case where \\\\omega_\\\\text{t} is small, which is generally true. In that case the value of the radical is just slightly less than \\\\omega_\\\\text{c}/2, and the value of \\\\omega_+ is just slightly less than \\\\omega_\\\\text{c} (the cyclotron frequency has been slightly reduced). For \\\\omega_- the value of the radical is the same (slightly less than \\\\omega_\\\\text{c}/2), but it is being subtracted from \\\\omega_\\\\text{c}/2, resulting in a small number equal to \\\\omega_\\\\text{c} - \\\\omega_+ (i.e. the amount that the cyclotron frequency was reduced by). Instrumentation FTICR-MS differs significantly from other mass spectrometry techniques in that the ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides an increase in the observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration. =Cells= A cylindrical ICR cell. The walls of the cell are made of copper, and ions enter the cell from the right, transmitted by the octopole ion guides. A review of different cell geometries with their specific electric configurations is available in the literature. However, ICR cells can belong to one of the following two categories: closed cells or open cells. Several closed ICR cells with different geometries were fabricated and their performance has been characterized. Grids were used as end caps to apply an axial electric field for trapping ions axially (parallel to the magnetic field lines). Ions can be either generated inside the cell or can be injected to the cell from an external ionization source. Nested ICR cells with double pair of grids were also fabricated to trap both positive and negative ions simultaneously. The most common open cell geometry is a cylinder, which is axially segmented to produce electrodes in the shape of a ring. The central ring electrode is commonly used for applying radial excitation electric field and detection. DC electric voltage is applied on the terminal ring electrodes to trap ions along the magnetic field lines. Open cylindrical cells with ring electrodes of different diameters have also been designed. They proved not only capable in trapping and detecting both ion polarities simultaneously, but also they succeeded to separate positive from negative ions radially. This presented a large discrimination in kinetic ion acceleration between positive and negative ions trapped simultaneously inside the new cell. Several ion axial acceleration schemes were recently written for ion–ion collision studies. =Stored-waveform inverse Fourier transform = Stored-waveform inverse Fourier transform (SWIFT) is a method for the creation of excitation waveforms for FTMS. The time-domain excitation waveform is formed from the inverse Fourier transform of the appropriate frequency-domain excitation spectrum, which is chosen to excite the resonance frequencies of selected ions. The SWIFT procedure can be used to select ions for tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Applications Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a high-resolution technique that can be used to determine masses with high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the mass defect of the elements. FTICR- MS is able to achieve higher levels of mass accuracy than other forms of mass spectrometer, in part, because a superconducting magnet is much more stable than radio-frequency (RF) voltage. Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures, such as biomass or waste liquefaction products, since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) to be detected as distinct ions. This high resolution is also useful in studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges, which can be produced by electrospray ionization. For example, attomole level of detection of two peptides has been reported. These large molecules contain a distribution of isotopes that produce a series of isotopic peaks. Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the m/z axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful. FTICR-MS is very useful in other studies of proteomics as well. It achieves exceptional resolution in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD), collisional-induced dissociation (CID), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) are all utilized to produce fragment spectra in tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Although CID and IRMPD use vibrational excitation to further dissociate peptides by breaking the backbone amide linkages, which are typically low in energy and weak, CID and IRMPD may also cause dissociation of post- translational modifications. ECD, on the other hand, allows specific modifications to be preserved. This is quite useful in analyzing phosphorylation states, O- or N-linked glycosylation, and sulfating.

This established the Anglo-Scottish border in a form that remains almost unchanged to modern times (the only modifications have been regarding the Debatable Lands and Berwick-upon-Tweed). The treaty detailed the future status of several feudal properties and addressed other issues between the two kings, and historically marked the end of the Kingdom of Scotland's attempts to extend its frontier southward. The treaty was one of a number of agreements made in the ongoing relationship between the two kings. The papal legate Otho of Tonengo was already in the Kingdom of England at Henry's request, to attend a synod in London in November 1237. Otho was informed in advance by Henry of the September meeting at York, which he attended. This meeting was recorded by the contemporary chronicler Matthew Paris, who disparaged both Alexander and Otho. Paris' untruthful allegations towards Alexander, portraying him as boorishly uncivil and aggressive, have been repeated uncritically in several historical accounts.  The agreement  Alexander II Henry and Alexander had a history of making agreements to settle one matter or another, and related to this was their personal relationship. Alexander was married to Henry's sister Joan and Alexander's sister Margaret had married Hubert de Burgh, a former regent to Henry. On 13 August 1237 Henry advised Otho that he would meet Alexander at York to treat of peace. An agreement was reached on 25 September \\"respecting all claims, or competent to, the latter, up to Friday next before Michaelmas A.D. 1237\\". The title of the agreement is Scriptum cirographatum inter Henricum Regem Anglie et Alexandrum Regem Scocie de comitatu Northumbrie Cumbrie et Westmerland factum coram Ottone Legato and the particulars of the agreement are: (an English translation of the agreement) * The King of Scotland: quitclaims to the King of England his hereditary rights to the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland; quitclaims 15,000 marks of silver paid by King William to King John for certain conventions not observed by the latter; and frees Henry from agreements regarding marriages between Henry and Richard, and Alexander's sisters Margaret, Isabella, and Marjory. * The King of England grants the King of Scotland certain lands within Northumberland and Cumberland, to be held by him and his successor kings of Scotland in feudal tenure with certain rights exempting them from obligations common in feudal relationships, and with the Scottish Steward sitting in Justice regarding certain issues that may arise, and these, too, are hereditary to the King of Scotland's heirs, and regarding these the King of Scotland shall not be answerable to an English court of law in any suit. * The King of Scotland makes his homage and fealty – de praedictis terris. * Both kings respect previous writings not in conflict with this agreement, and any charters found regarding said counties to be restored to the King of England. Historians have shown little interest in the agreement, either mentioning it in passing or ignoring it altogether. Stubbs does not mention it in his Constitutional History of England, nor does Hume in his History of England. Skene's Celtic Scotland refers to it as an agreement in his background discussion for the reign of Alexander II's successor, Alexander III, while Burton's History of Scotland mentions that claims of land were discussed in 1237 and briefly describes some of them, but makes no reference to an agreement or treaty. James Hill Ramsay's Dawn of the Constitution gives a fuller discussion of the agreement, but does not give it any particular prominence.  The account of Paris  Engraving of Henry's great seal The treaty gained additional prominence due to the chronicler Matthew Paris (c. 1200–1259), who is known for his rhetorical passion and his invectives against those with whom he disagreed. Paris describes the Papal legate Otho in negative terms, as someone who was weak and timid in the face of strength but overbearing in his use of power over others, and as someone who avariciously accumulated a large amount of money. (page 36 and elsewhere throughout Otho's stay in England) He describes Alexander and Henry as having a mutual hatred in 1236, with Alexander threatening to invade England. He describes the 1237 meeting at York as the result of Henry's and Otho's invitation to Alexander, and that when Otho expressed an interest in visiting Scotland, Alexander claimed no legate had ever visited Scotland and he would not allow it, and that if Otho does enter Scotland he should take care that harm does not befall him. Paris goes on to say that in 1239 as Otho was leaving for Scotland, that when Alexander had previously met with Otho in 1237 he had become so excited in his hostility at the possibility of Otho's visit to Scotland that a written agreement had to be drawn up concerning Otho's visit. There is nothing to recommend Paris' account as having any validity, as it is contradicted by known facts regarding dates and correspondences, and by knowledge of previous visits to Scotland by legates. Legates had visited Scotland in the reigns of Alexander's father William I, his uncle Malcolm IV, and his grandfather David I, and Alexander himself had seen a Papal legate hold a council at Perth for four days, making his alleged outrage and threats incongruous and highly improbable.

He was chairman of the board of the Postal Telegraph and Cable Corporation and president of the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company. Early life He was born on April 17, 1874 in San Francisco, California to Louise Antoinette (née Hungerford) Bryant Mackay (1843–1928) and John William Mackay (pronounced MACK-ee). His father was a silver miner and telegraph mogul who had been born in Dublin and emigrated to America with his parents. After arriving in America, his father died soon after, and John sold newspapers and got a shipyard job to support his mother and sister. Eventually, he went west, and with three partners, formed a mining corporation and discovered the \\"Big Bonanza\\" in Virginia City, Nevada, which became the largest single deposit of gold and silver ever found. More than $100 million dollars worth of gold (over $2.5 billion in today's currency) was extracted from that mine before it was exhausted in 1898, making all of them unimaginably wealthy. His father then married his mother and adopted her daughter by an earlier marriage. They lived between Paris and New York, where they brought up this daughter and their two sons, John and Clarence. Career Clarence sold his major source of income, the Postal Telegraph Company, to the new International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) for an enormous amount of stock. The 1929 stock market crash wiped him out; he survived the Great Depression by selling his art and antiques. He was eventually reconciled with Ellin and her husband when he went to comfort her on the cot death of her baby; Irving Berlin always treated his father-in-law with respect and affection. Both Ellin Berlin and Clarence's granddaughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, were successful writers. Personal life Mackay's first wife, Katherine Duer Mackay. Around 1897, Mackay met Katherine Alexander Duer (1880–1930), who was a beautiful debutante from an old, high society, New York family that he met on a steamship crossing between New York and England. She was a direct descendant of Lady Kitty Duer, daughter of Lord Stirling. They fell in love and were married on May 17, 1898. Harbor Hill in Roslyn, Long Island, the site of their future estate with the striking view of Hempstead Harbor, was Katherine's and Clarie's wedding present from the senior Mackays. Katherine oversaw much of the design and building of their mansion at Harbor Hill which was designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead, and White and was the largest home White ever designed. Katherine was a suffragette and a champion of women's rights and became the first woman member of the Roslyn school board in 1905. Together, Clarence and Katherine were the parents of three children: * Katherine Mackay (1900–1971), who married Kenneth O'Brien (1895–1954) in 1922. They divorced and she remarried to Robert Ziemer Hawkins (1903–1979) in 1938. * Ellin Mackay (1903–1988), who fell in love with the popular composer Irving Berlin, to the fury of her father; Berlin was a Russian immigrant, an Orthodox Jewish widower fifteen years older than she. When Ellin insisted on marrying Berlin in 1926, Clarence disinherited her. However, Berlin was already wealthy at this stage, the most popular songwriter of his time. * John William Mackay (1907–1988), who married Josephine Gwendolyn Rose (1908–2004) in 1929. In 1910, Katherine left Clarence and her three children to run away with Dr. Joseph Blake, the doctor who had cured Clarence's throat cancer. Blake then cured her eye cancer, and he in turn ran away with her nurse. The marriage officially ended in divorce in Paris in 1914. Katherine returned to New York in 1930, the same year she died from cancer. Because of religious convictions, he was a traditional Irish-American Catholic, Mackay would not remarry as long as his first wife, Katherine, lived. Therefore, Clarence and Anna Case (1888–1984) waited until after Katherine's death in 1930, and were subsequently married in 1931 at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Roslyn, New York. His wedding gift to Anna was a platinum-set emerald and diamond necklace. The emerald was mined in Colombia and the necklace designed by Cartier. Anna was a lyric soprano who sang with the Metropolitan Opera and as a concert soloist. \\"Her life changed dramatically following an engagement to sing at a private musicale given in the home of Clarence H. Mackay (c. 1916). Taken with her beauty, he sent a carload of flowers to her at her next Carnegie Hall recital, enclosing a small diamond band with an enamel bluebird in the center.\\" He died of cancer on November 12, 1938. His funeral was at St. Patrick's Cathedral where the New York Philharmonic played. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. =Legacy= Anna Case Mackay donated her diamond necklace to the Smithsonian Institution in 1984. Clarence Mackay was a noted collector of medieval suits of armor, some of which he sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the early 1930s. An aviation trophy, administered by the United States National Aeronautic Association and awarded yearly by the United States Air Force for the \\"most meritorious flight of the year\\" by an Air Force person, persons, or organization, is named in Mackay's honor.

She was unknown until a cache of 26 votive offerings to her were discovered in 2002 in an undisclosed field at Ashwell End in Hertfordshire by metal detectorist Alan Meek. Her imagery shows evidence of syncretism between a pre-Roman goddess with the Roman Minerva (for a parallel, cf. Sulis Minerva, the Romano-British goddess worshipped at Bath). Senuna's shrine consisted of a ritual midden, onto which offerings were thrown, surrounded by a complex of buildings including workshops and accommodation for pilgrims. It was certainly no humble crossroads shrine. The dedicatory artefacts kept in the shrine were subsequently buried together on the edge of the midden, perhaps intended for temporary safe-keeping, in the late 3rd or 4th century CE.\\"A New Goddess for Roman Britain: The 'Near Baldock' Hoard\\" from the British Museum's Department of Prehistory & Europe. Offerings to Senuna Votive leaf plaques The offerings to Senuna include silver plaques with gold highlights, seven gold plaques and a superb set of jewellery, including a brooch and cloak clasps. The plaques still have the metal tabs which allowed them to be set upright, and are so thin that they would then have shivered and glittered in any draught. Some votive plaques were punched out in tiny holes, some incised. The jewellery incorporated older gems and glass beads, including a superb carved cameo of a lion trampling an ox skull which was already old and worn before it was set into the brooch. All of the jewellery shared intricate decoration in minutely coiled wire, and the set may have been specially made as an offering.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1941, and was a prominent cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.  Early life  Clubb was born in Morris, Manitoba, the son of George Clubb and Alice Jix, and was educated at Manitoba public schools, the Winnipeg Business College and Manitoba Agricultural College. He worked as a farmer, and served on the Morris municipal council from 1916 to 1920. In 1913, he married Gertrude Barbara Kastner.  Political career  He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1920. Clubb ran as an independent farmer candidate in the constituency of Morris, and defeated rival candidate Alex Ayotte by 165 votes. For the next two years, he sat with a small farmer's caucus led by William Robson. In 1921, Clubb served with John Bracken on a special committee to review the prices of oil and gas for Manitoba's agricultural community. He was impressed with Bracken's knowledge of the province, and with his presence of mind in the discussions. He later joined the United Farmers of Manitoba, and defeated Ayotte by a greater margin in the 1922 election. The United Farmers and their allies won an unexpected majority government in the 1922 election, and took office as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. As the UFM did not have a leader, the party caucus met on July 20, 1922 to choose a premier. Clubb recommended Bracken for the position, and his name was allowed to stand. At the end of the meeting, the only others candidates still under consideration were federal Members of Parliament Thomas Crerar and Bob Hoey. On July 21, 1922, Clubb telephoned Bracken to inform him that he was one of three candidates under consideration for the job. Bracken, who had not previously considered a career in politics, allowed his name to stand after a brief discussion. The next day, Crerar and Hoey both rejected the UFM offer. Bracken was non-committal, and but made a strong impression on the party caucus. He was persuaded to accept the position, and appointed Clubb as his Minister of Public Works. He was formally sworn into cabinet on August 8, 1922. The custom of the age required him to resign and contest a by-election; he was returned without opposition. Clubb was the only member of Bracken's cabinet with prior legislative experience, and was one of Bracken's most trusted confidantes in the government's early years. Re-elected by a landslide in the 1927 election, Clubb helped oversee a controversial leasing arrangement with the Winnipeg Electric Company (WEC) in the late 1920s. This arrangement provoked a scandal in 1929, when Clubb acknowledged before a royal commission that he had purchased WEC shares the previous year, when negotiations were still in progress. Bracken initially defended Clubb, but was pressured into accepting his resignation from cabinet on February 22, 1929. In Clubb's defence, it may be noted that other legislators from various parties had also purchased shares while the negotiations were in progress. In fact, his share purchase was arranged by John Thomas Haig, a prominent Conservative legislator and personal friend. Clubb maintained that he did nothing improper in the transaction. Bracken never regarded Clubb's suspension from cabinet as permanent, and on May 18, 1929, he was returned to cabinet in his previous portfolio. In late 1929, Clubb and other prominent ministers supported a policy of cooperation with the provincial Liberal Party. This policy of cooperation led to a formal alliance in 1932, and Clubb was re-elected in that year's provincial election as a supporter of the \\"Liberal-Progressive\\" government. The parties were effectively merged after the election, and government members became known as Liberal-Progressives. Just before the election, Clubb had been given additional cabinet responsibility as Manitoba's first Minister of Labour. He continued to hold both the Public Works and Labour portfolios throughout the 1930s. Clubb faced a difficult re-election in the 1936 campaign, and resigned from cabinet in 1940 with the creation of an all-party coalition government. He did not seek re-election in 1941.  Later life  From 1940 to 1956, he was commissioner of the Manitoba liquor board. Clubb was also an avid curler and flyer. He died in Morris at the age of 77.

Clothes are often bought from thrift stores such as the Salvation Army, Goodwill, or Value Village. Originally popular among the hippies of the late 1960s, this fashion movement resurfaced during the mid-1980s among teenagers, and expanded into the 1990s with the growing popularity of such music and style influences including the grunge band Nirvana. Thrift store chic can be considered as an anti-fashion statement because it does not follow fashion trends and does not attempt to look expensive or new. Thrift store chic is often composed of vintage T-shirts (striped tees and anything with vintage graphics, in particular), sweaters, flannel ‘lumberjack’ shirts, and worn and torn jeans. This laid back, nonchalant, and aloof look became fashionable and trendy without attempting to. Originally worn for a variety of reasons, which include an homage, or attempt to resurrect earlier styles, or even in protest to the exploitation of third world child workers in sweat shops. By the late 2000s many of the younger indie kids wore thrift store clothes primarily for its ironic anti-fashion connotations, attempting to look like a homeless person who can afford expensive electronics.Sweat free Chicago Thrift store chic is also popular among people who enjoy creating their own outfits from pieces of used clothing.

The screenplay by Steve Martin is based on his 2000 novella of the same title. The film is about a complex love triangle between a bored salesgirl, a wealthy businessman, and an aimless young man. Produced by Ashok Amritraj, Jon Jashni, and Steve Martin for Touchstone Pictures and Hyde Park Entertainment, and distributed in the United States by Buena Vista Pictures, Shopgirl was released on October 21, 2005 and received positive reviews from film critics. The film went on to earn $11,112,077 and was nominated for four Satellite Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Plot  In 2003, Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes) is an aspiring artist from Vermont who works at the evening gloves counter at Saks Fifth Avenue, Beverly Hills. Her quiet, orderly existence filled with both the mundane – futon furniture and an aging pickup truck – and the serious – a large student loan and a supply of antidepressants – is disrupted by the sudden appearance of two disparate men. Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman) is an immature, socially inept, penniless graphic designer for an amplifier manufacturer and an aspiring typographer who meets Mirabelle in a laundromat. Mirabelle, aching for meaningful contact, gives Jeremy a chance but it quickly fizzles after a halfhearted date, followed by a woefully underwhelming sexual encounter. Ray Porter (Steve Martin) is an older, suave, wealthy, divorced logician who charms Mirabelle over several dates, one of which ends at his house. Mirabelle offers herself to him, and the morning after they have sex, Ray tells her that he does not intend for their relationship to be serious due to his constant travel between L.A. and Seattle. Each has a different understanding of this talk: Ray tells his psychiatrist that Mirabelle knows he will see other people, and Mirabelle tells her acquaintances that Ray wants to see her more. Mirabelle and Ray embark on a lengthy affair, while Jeremy attempts to have one last liaison with Mirabelle before leaving as a roadie for the band Hot Tears, but she spurns him due to her relationship with Ray. While on tour, the band's lead singer introduces Jeremy to the world of self-improvement and how to better relate to the opposite sex. Mirabelle becomes increasingly devoted to Ray, who showers her with expensive gifts, such as paying off her student loans, instead of emotional affection. When Mirabelle's depression hits hard, as she has ceased taking her antidepressants because Ray makes her happy, he takes her to the doctor and cares for her, further deepening her reliance on him. Ray invites Mirabelle on a trip to New York, and has her fitted in the dress shop at Armani. During a business trip, Ray has dinner with an old girlfriend who propositions him and he accepts, confessing the liaison to Mirabelle. Devastated, Mirabelle ends the relationship, abandons her trip to New York, and visits Vermont instead. While she basks in the warmth and familiarity of home, Ray calls to apologize for hurting her and asks her to meet him in New York. There, he takes her to a large party where she is the youngest guest and feels alone and out of place. At the hotel room, Ray wants to be intimate but Mirabelle rejects him. Returning to California, Mirabelle encounters Jeremy on the way to an art show, and they arrive together. Her coworker Lisa, suspicious of Mirabelle’s new clothes, mistakes Jeremy for Ray, and Jeremy's self-improvement is obvious to everyone but Mirabelle. After the show, Mirabelle goes home with Ray, and Lisa goes home with Jeremy thinking he is Ray. In the morning, Ray devastates Mirabelle by announcing his plans to find a bigger house in case he meets someone and decides to have kids. Jeremy calls Lisa, but learns she has no interest in anything but Ray Porter and his money. Mirabelle permanently ends her relationship with Ray and, after a brief period of mourning, quits her job at Saks to become a receptionist in an art gallery. Jeremy pursues her again, properly, and they fall in love. Mirabelle is invited to show her work at the gallery, and Ray attends the opening with his new girlfriend, a gynecologist. Jeremy is clearly proud of Mirabelle, and their relationship is in stark contrast to Ray and Mirabelle, whose conversation is full of recognition yet noticeably strained. Ray apologizes for how deeply he hurt her and admits that he did love her and Mirabelle is visibly touched by his admission, and runs lovingly into Jeremy's arms. Watching the healthy, openly loving couple, Ray remarks that he feels a loss even though he had kept Mirabelle \\"at arm's length\\" to avoid the pain of their inevitable breakup.

According to Evolution of a Novella: The Making of Shopgirl, a bonus feature on the DVD release, Saks Fifth Avenue actively pursued participation in the film by presenting a proposal to the producers and director and promising full cooperation with filming schedules. The gloves in the counter are not from Saks, but a boutique in Toronto, where some of the film was shot. According to Martin's book Born Standing Up, there are many parallels to Martin's own life. Early in his career, he lost a girlfriend to an older, suave gentleman resembling Ray Porter, real-life Mason Williams. Williams had a house that matches the description of Ray Porter's, it overlooked Los Angeles from roughly the same vantage point and the descriptions of the two houses are the same. Williams was an actuary at one point, whereas Porter was a logician. Martin and Williams both vied for the attention of a girlfriend, Nina. The relationship ended when Martin, much like the Schwartzman character, goes on a cross-country tour as a roadie. These parallels make the novella somewhat autobiographical. In addition, character Mirabelle is partially based on artist Allyson Hollingsworth who was a consultant to the movie, and who had a relationship with Martin in the '90s. Photographs and drawings attributed to Mirabelle in the movie are by Hollingsworth. Martin had Tom Hanks in mind for the role of Ray Porter at the time he was writing the screenplay, but director Anand Tucker felt that Martin was so close to the material and had such a strong understanding of the character that Martin should play the part himself. After auditioning numerous actresses, he knew Claire Danes was perfect for the role of Mirabelle as soon as she began reading lines with Martin. He found Jeremy much more difficult to cast, and remembered Jason Schwartzman (but not his name) from his performance in Rushmore only two weeks before filming was scheduled to begin. The apartment building used for Mirabelle's residence is located at 1630 Griffith Park Boulevard in Los Angeles. The songs \\"Lily & Parrots\\", \\"Carry Me Ohio\\" and \\"Make Like Paper\\" were written and performed by Mark Kozelek. Tucker remembered him from his appearance in Almost Famous and cast him as the lead singer of Hot Tears. Both \\"Carry Me Ohio\\" and \\"Lily and Parrots\\" were tracks on Ghosts of the Great Highway, the first CD released by Kozelek's real-life band Sun Kil Moon. \\"Make Like Paper\\" was a track from Songs for a Blue Guitar, an album by Kozelek's earlier band Red House Painters. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005. It was shown at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. The film grossed $10,284,523 in the US and $1,303,682 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $11,588,205.  Critical reception  On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 6.27 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \\"Shopgirl is precariously slight, but it has some intriguing moments, and Danes is luminous.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 37 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \\"B-\\" on scale of A to F. In his review in The New York Times, A.O. Scott called the film \\"elegant and exquisitely tailored . . . both funny and sweetly sad\\" and added, \\"[It] is a resolutely small movie, finely made and perhaps a bit fragile. Under the pressure of too much thought, it might buckle and splinter; the characters might look flimsy, their comings and goings too neatly engineered, their lovability assumed rather than proven. And it's true that none of them are perfect. From where I sit, though, the film they inhabit comes pretty close.\\"New York Times review Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as \\"a film of wisdom, emotional subtlety and power . . . directed with a rare combination of delicacy and decisiveness.\\" In Variety, Joe Leydon observed, \\"Martin hits all the right notes while subtly conveying both the appealing sophistication and the purposeful reserve of Ray. But he cannot entirely avoid being overshadowed by Danes' endearingly vulnerable, emotionally multifaceted and fearlessly open performance. (In a few scenes, she appears so achingly luminescent it's almost heartbreaking to watch her.) The two stars bring out the very best in each other, particularly in a poignant final scene.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said the film is \\"like Pygmalion for the upper-middle-brow business class flier. Which isn't to say it's bad. On the contrary, it's smart, spare, elegant and understated . . . Danes can fill a scene with one wounded glance, and her body language alone conveys a richness of character that makes an otherwise not very expressive character mesmerizing.\\" In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers rated it three out of four stars and commented, \\"The May–December thing worked in Lost in Translation and it works here, thanks to the perceptive and gracefully romantic script that Martin has adapted from his novella. This is not the wild-and-crazy Martin of Bringing Down the House, this is the Martin who writes for The New Yorker with erudition and wit.\\"Rolling Stone review Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times graded the film C and called it \\"too slight to be considered a movie yet padded enough to pose as a feature-length work . . . The blessing and curse of cinema is its ability to compress ideas into simple images. When the ideas are this simple, cinema crushes them to dullness. Mirabelle's unremarkable life simply doesn't deserve big screen treatment. Any author other than a Hollywood favorite like Martin likely wouldn't get it done.\\" In New York, Ken Tucker stated, \\"The challenge of the movie consists of making you believe that these two people, separated by age and status, could fall in love. Shopgirl succeeds in this with a confidence so sure and serene that you feel through much of the movie as though you’re listening to a fairy tale, an effect enhanced by the voice-over narration provided in soothing tones by Martin-as-Ray.\\" Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said, \\"A serene luminescence surrounds Claire Danes [who] – reduced of late to action drivel (Terminator 3) or bit roles (The Hours) — finally fulfills the potent promise of her mid-'90s TV series My So-Called Life. Los Angeles doesn't look half-bad, either. When director Anand Tucker isn't training his camera on the jewel-like traffic lights below or the sparkling cosmos above, he portrays the City of Angels as a haven of spare elegance and urbane stylishness, as if it were Woody Allen's Manhattan but with better weather and inviting outdoor pools.

It is a first-tier key school in Hunan's public school system and is one of the most selective schools in the nation. Admission is competitive, based mainly on the score in city-wide or province-wide examinations as well as talent in science, music, sports, and the arts. The school and other three prestigious high schools in Changsha (including First High School of Changsha, Changjun High School and High School Attached to Hunan Normal University), are recognized \\"the Famous Four\\". In 2007, Yali was included in the \\"Top 100 Schools\\" list published by the Top One-Hundred Schools website in China. It topped the list of the five schools that made to the top 100 from Hunan Province (This list published the schools by province and does not rank them nationally.) History Founded in 1906 by Yale-in-China (), the Yali School () was an American-owned private school during the first half of the 20th century and has been a public school since then. The name Yali 雅礼 (pinyin: Yǎ Lǐ) comes from the Analects of Confucius, meaning elegance of expression (ya 雅) and propriety of conduct (li 礼), and is a transliteration of Yale in the early 20th century. Yali's school colors are blue, white (Yale colors) and red (China). Yale-in-China faculty =Founding years= Brownell Gage, Warren Seabury, Lawrence Thurston, and Arthur Williams, all graduates of Yale College in the 1890s, founded Yale-in-China, and brought the mission to Changsha between 1901 and 1905. In 1906, the mission's preparatory school, or the Yali School, began operations. During the same year, Edward H. Hume, M.D., commenced the medical work in Changsha. His experiences are described in his 1946 book Doctors East, Doctors West: An American Physician's Life in China, (W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.). In 1912 Yali's first graduates received degrees. =Continued success= The campus was expanded in 1914. By 1928, Yali started opening up its administrative and leadership roles to Chinese educators. While Yali students were known for their academic performance, they were also athletes, with the school's athletic teams - soccer, volleyball, track, for example - winning provincial and national tournaments. =World War II years= In 1938, Yali students and faculty moved to Yuanling in western Hunan to avoid bombing in Changsha during the Japanese invasion of China. Teaching continued in Yuanling for seven years before the school returned to Changsha in 1946. =Early PRC years= In November 1948, the US government started evacuating Americans in China. Dr. Dwight Rugh became the last Yale- China representative in China. In 1951, Dr. Rugh was brought to the new gym on the Yali campus in a school-wide meeting to condemn \\"American Capitalist Invaders\\"; he returned to America via Hong Kong soon after. During the same year, the municipal government of Changsha took over the administration of the Yali School and changed its name to Changsha Number Five Middle School to be integrated into the city's public school system. The School's tie with Yale- China was cut off. During the next few decades, Yali experienced political turbulence that swept much of China. Dwight Rugh is the father of Betty Jean Rugh (now BJ Elder), who grew up in Changsha and later moved to the United States with her parents. BJ Elder published a book in 2003 titled The Oriole's Song - An American Girlhood in Wartime China (see cited sources below), describing her childhood in Changsha on the Yali campus and the various trips she made back to China in the decades following the family's forced departure. =After the Cultural Revolution= In 1980, Yali, known at the time still as Changsha Number Five middle School, returned to operations from a whole decade of chaos. With the new \\"reform and opening-up\\" policy instituted by Deng Xiaoping, more freedom to connect with the outside world was realized. Yali alumni from the first half of the 20th Century started working between Changsha and New Haven, seeking to re-establish the Yale-China connection. In 1985, the school revived its relationship with the Yale-China Association and was once again known as Yali. The next year, Yale-China bachelors, now known as English Language Instructors (\\"ELI\\", also a nickname for Yalies), arrived on campus and resumed teaching responsibilities in the English Department. =Today= Since 1986, Yali has reinvented itself again as an institution of secondary education in China. While following a standard curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education, it expanded its education philosophy to include extracurriculars and specialty education. The school has received provincial and national recognitions for its high quality education to young minds. In 1992, it was recognized as one of the first Provincial Key Schools in Changsha, establishing it as a premier institution in China's public school system. Yali has reached out to institutions in many other countries and established sister school relationships internationally. In 2001, the school received a delegation from Yale University led by Yale's president, Richard Levin, in celebration of both the Centennial of Yale-China Association as well as the Tercentennial of Yale University. In 2006, Yali celebrated its own Centennial, bringing back alumni and former teachers from all parts of the world. Since 1999,Yali School have established several branches, some are complete secondary schools and some only contain junior high school. In 2006, the junior department of Yali stopped enrollment owing to certain education policy. The teachers and other staffs were moved to different Yali branches. Campuses Soccer practice and main school building at Yali =Yali School= Yali school, or called the \\"Yali Headquarters\\", is a day school located near the city-center (on Laodong Road between Furong Ave and Shaoshan Ave). The main teaching building is rebuilt in 2012. There are over 3000 students study there in 2018. The International Department which was founded in 2011 is also at Yali School. =Nanya Middle School= Nanya Middle School (, literally \\"South Yali Middle School\\" ), or \\"Yali Boarding Middle School\\" formerly, is a boarding school campus located in the southern Changsha (on Xiangzhang Road), with over 7000 students through Grade 7 to 12 in 2012. It was a private school at its establishment in 2002, but changed to public since 2012. It is one of the top schools in Hunan and is considered to be a second choice for students who prefer Yali. Its junior department is one of the major student sources of Yali: one-third of new students of Yali in 2013 are from Nanya. =Beiya Middle School= Beiya Middle School (, literally \\"North Yali Middle School\\" ), is a public boarding school campus located in the northern Chansha, with about 3000 students within Grade 7 to 9 in 2012, which was established in 2009. =Other Members of Yali Group= * Yiya Middle School is a high school set up for the residents of Yihaixincheng, the residences in suburban Changsha County in 2010. * Yali Tianxin Middle School, formerly named Changsha Normal School, is a public junior high school which was taken over by Yali Group in 2013 supported by the Tianxin district government. * Yali Yuhua Middle School is a public junior high school located on Huahou Road near Nanya, established in 2011. * Yali Experimental School is a public junior high school set up in 2012, which was located on Laodong Road, about 100 meters from Yali, which was the temporary \\"west campus\\" for senior 2 and 3 students of Yali during the rebuilding of main teaching building from 2010 to 2012. In 2014, the school moved to Zuojiatang. * Changya Experimental School is a public junior high school located in Beicheng Delta in Northern Changsha established in 2013. * Yali-Peicui School is a private school located in the former Yali Experimental campus on Laodong Road established in 2016, which is the fruit of co-operation with Peicui Middle School. * Yali Yanghu Middle School is a public high school located in the Xiangjiang New Area of Hunan in the west part of Changsha set up in 2017. = Other related schools = * Deya Middle School of Jinshi is a public junior high school set up for the educational cooperation between Changsha and Jinshi, a small city in Western Hunan in 2010, with 1800 students in 2011. * Changya Middle School was a private school first set up in 1999, sharing the campus with Yali, specially for the students who haven't reach the standards of Yali's enrollment but are willing to pay a small fortune. The school revoked several years later, but the special \\"Changya Classes\\" remains until 2011. Curriculum and extracurricular =Academics= Yali graduates score among the highest in China's college entrance examinations and are accepted by the country's finest universities. Furthermore, numerous graduates from the school are accepted by various foreign institutions, either in North America or other countries. In recent years, many a graduates are admitted by first-tier universities, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Yale University, Cornell University, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, etc., which is rare among Chinese high schools. For all students, Chinese, Math, English, and physical education are required. Aside from these compulsory subjects, other curricular requirements include: *10th Grade: History, Physics, Biology, Politics, Chemistry, Geography, Music, Oral English, Information Technology *11th Grade: Fine Arts for all students, History, Politics, and Geography for students focusing on the Arts, and Physics, Chemistry, and Biology for students focusing on the Sciences. *12th Grade: History, Politics, and Geography for students focusing on the Arts, and Physics, Chemistry, and Biology for students focusing on the Sciences. This final year is mostly a preparatory year for the national college matriculation examinations. All science classes have lab sessions. Courses are also offered in computer science, graphic design, mechanics and robotics, research-oriented seminars, and others. =Specialty education= With its strength in science education, Yali has a long history of emphasizing and participating in science olympiads, for which purpose the \\"01\\" class of each grade is established to give students specialized education in the natural sciences. In recent years, Yali students are noted for their achievements in all five natural science subjects, and in particular informatics: Yali students have won 9 gold medals and 1 silver medal in International Olympiad in Informatics and dozens of medals in National Olympiad in Informatics, which ranked first in the whole country, while the medals in other subjects including 1 gold and 1 silver medal in IMO, 1 gold medal in IChO, 1 gold medal in IBO and 2 gold medals in APhO. The school has also started a research-oriented seminar program for students to carry out group projects in the social sciences, the arts, and community engagement. The school also started a partnership with China's Central Conservatory of Music, in which a Yali Center for the Arts was established between the two institutions located in Nanya. The purpose of the partnership is to bring high-quality music education and discover young talent. =Sports= Yali School sports field The school has an annual Yali Cup soccer game; each class unit in the same grade organizes its own teams and compete with other teams. With soccer and basketball being the most popular sports, the men's soccer team and women's basketball team have repeatedly won provincial tournaments and are placed high in national rankings. Physical education is required for students in all grades. =Clubs= Yali students participate in various extracurricular activities, including student newspaper, magazine, student union, radio station, TV station, orchestra, band, drama and traditional dance.

Branches of the OA supply all the structures in the orbit as well as some structures in the nose, face and meninges. Occlusion of the OA or its branches can produce sight-threatening conditions. Structure The OA emerges from the internal carotid artery usually just after the latter emerges from the cavernous sinus although in some cases, the OA branches just before the internal carotid exits the cavernous sinus. The OA arises from the internal carotid along the medial side of the anterior clinoid process and runs anteriorly passing through the optic canal with and inferolaterally to the optic nerve. The ophthalmic artery can also pass superiorly to the optic nerve in a minority of cases. In the posterior third of the cone of the orbit, the ophthalmic artery turns sharply and medially to run along the medial wall of the orbit. =Central retinal artery= The central retinal artery is the first, and one of the smaller branches of the OA and runs in the dura mater inferior to the optic nerve. About 12.5mm (0.5 inch) posterior to the globe, the central retinal artery turns superiorly and penetrates the optic nerve, continuing along the center of the optic nerve, entering the eye to supply the inner retinal layers. =Lacrimal artery= The next branch of the OA is the lacrimal artery, one of the largest, arises just as the OA enters the orbit and runs along the superior edge of the lateral rectus muscle to supply the lacrimal gland, eyelids and conjunctiva. =Posterior ciliary arteries= The OA then turns medially, giving off 1 to 5 posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) that subsequently branch into the long and short posterior ciliary arteries (LPCA and SPCA respectively) which perforate the sclera posteriorly in the vicinity of the optic nerve and macula to supply the posterior uveal tract. In the past, anatomists made little distinction between the posterior ciliary arteries and the short and long posterior ciliary arteries often using the terms synonymously. However, recent work by Hayreh has shown that there is both an anatomic and clinically useful distinction.Hayreh, SS. \\"Posterior Ciliary Artery Circulation In Health and Disease\\" Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science 2004 Mar;45(3):749-757. The PCAs arise directly from the OA and are end arteries which is to say no PCA or any of its branches anastomose with any other artery. Consequently, sudden occlusion of any PCA will produce an infarct in the region of the choroid supplied by that particular PCA. Occlusion of a short or long PCA will produce a smaller choroidal infarct, within the larger area supplied by the specific parent PCA. =Muscular branches= The OA continues medially the superior and inferior muscular branches arise either from the OA directly or a single trunk from the OA subsequently divides into superior and inferior branches to supply the extraocular muscles. =Supraorbital artery= The supraorbital artery branches from the OA as it passes over the optic nerve. The supraorbital artery passes anteriorly along the medial border of the superior rectus and levator palpebrae and through the supraorbital foramen to supply muscles and skin of the forehead. =Ethmoidal arteries= After reaching the medial wall of the orbit, the OA again turns anteriorly. The posterior ethmoidal artery enters the nose via the posterior ethmoidal canal and supplies the posterior ethmoidal sinuses and enters the skull to supply the meninges. The OA continues anteriorly, giving off the anterior ethmoidal artery which enters the nose after traversing the anterior ethmoidal canal and supplies the anterior and middle ethmoidal sinuses, as well as the frontal sinus and also enters the cranium to supply the meninges. =Medial palpebral arteries= The OA continues anteriorly to the trochlea, where the medial palpebral arteries (superior and inferior) arise and supply the eyelids. =Terminal branches= The OA terminates in two branches, the supratrochlear (or frontal) artery and the dorsal nasal artery. Both exit the orbit medially to supply the forehead and scalp. Branches Because of the obvious importance of the ocular globe, branches of the ophthalmic artery often are subdivided into two groups: those that supply the eyeball (ocular group) and those that supply non-ocular orbital structures (orbital group). =Orbital group= The orbital group, distributing vessels to the orbit and surrounding parts, includes: * Lacrimal artery A. lacrimalis * Supraorbital artery A. supraorbitalis * Posterior ethmoidal artery A. ethmoidalis posterior * Anterior ethmoidal artery A. ethmoidalis anterior * Medial palpebral artery A. palpebralis medialis * Frontal artery, also called the Supratrochlear artery A. supratrochlearis * Dorsal nasal artery A. dorsalis nasi =Ocular group= The ocular group, distributing vessels to the eye and its muscles, includes: * Long posterior ciliary arteries Aa. ciliares posteriores longae * Short posterior ciliary arteries Aa. ciliares posteriores breves * Anterior ciliary artery A. ciliares anterior * Central retinal artery A. centralis retinae * Superior muscular artery A. supraorbitalis * Inferior muscular artery A. infraorbitalis Function Branches of the ophthalmic artery supply: *Frontal belly of the occipitofrontalis muscle *Inferior oblique muscle *Inferior rectus muscle *Lacrimal gland *Lateral rectus muscle *Levator palpebrae superioris muscle *Medial rectus muscle *Nasalis muscle *Procerus muscle *Superior oblique muscle *Superior rectus muscle Clinical significance Severe occlusion of the ophthalmic artery causes ocular ischemic syndrome. As with central retinal artery occlusions, ophthalmic artery occlusions may result from systemic cardiovascular diseases; however, a cherry-red spot is typically absent and the vision is usually worse. Amaurosis fugax is a temporary loss of vision that occurs in two conditions which cause a temporary reduction in ophthalmic artery pressure: orthostatic hypotension and positive acceleration.Phelps GK, Phelps CD. \\"Blood pressure and pressure amaurosis.\\" Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science 1975 Mar;14(3):237-40. Even complete occlusion of the ophthalmic artery may possibly leave the eye without symptoms, probably because of circulatory anastomosesA case of ophthalmic artery occlusion without manifestation of ocular ischemic syndrome.

The central retinal artery is approximately 160 micrometres in diameter. =Variation= In some cases - approximately 20% of the population - there is a branch of the ciliary circulation called the cilio-retinal artery which supplies the retina between the macula and the optic nerve, including the nerve fibers from the foveal photoreceptors. If this artery is present, the central vision will be preserved even in case of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). =Development= The central retinal artery is formed from the proximal part of the hyaloid artery after atrophy of its distal part has formed the hyaloid canal.Larsen's human embryology 2009, p. 610 Function The central retinal artery supplies blood to all the nerve fibers that form the optic nerve, which carries the visual information to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, including those that reach over the fovea. Its blood flow can be revealed by fluorescein angiography or laser Doppler imaging.Puyo, L., M. Paques, M. Fink, J-A. Sahel, and M. Atlan. \\"In vivo laser Doppler holography of the human retina.\\" Biomedical optics express 9, no. 9 (2018): 4113-4129. Clinical significance Thus if the central retinal artery gets occluded, there is complete loss of vision in that eye even though the fovea is not affected. The entire retina (with the exception of the fovea) becomes pale and swollen and opaque while the central fovea still appears reddish (this is because the choroid color shows through). This is the basis of the famous \\"Cherry red spot\\" seen on examination of the retina on funduscopy of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). However it should be remembered that the Cilio retinal artery itself is a branch of the Short Posterior Ciliary Arteries which is derived from the Ophthalmic Artery. Therefore, its possible for the cilio retinal artery itself to occlude causing significant visual loss in the perfused macula region (surrounding visual field will remain intact). Other animals In dogs, it is the continuation of the long ciliary artery.  Additional images  Image:Gray879.pngInterior of posterior half of bulb of left eye.

The manufacturing company, a subsidiary of the Croatian ARMA-GRUPA Corporation, has been manufacturing the ERO and Mini-ERO submachine guns (copies of the Israeli UZI and Mini-UZI respectively) since the mid-1990s.https://oruzjeonline.com/2019/08/11/automati-9x19mm-m97-i-m97k/ The manufacturer tried to push the APS-95 on the international market for several years with no success. History The APS-95 was developed under request of the Croatian Army, which wanted to shift as soon as possible from the then- issued Yugoslavian-made 7.62×39mm Zastava M70 assault rifles to a service rifle chambered for the NATO-standard 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge.http://modernfirearms.net/en/assault-rifles/croatia-assault- rifles/aps-95-eng/ During the Croatian War of Independence, the Croatian side had been supplied by the Croatian businessman Antun Kikaš with several batches of the Vektor R4, a South African copy of the Israeli IMI Galil assault rifle. The Croatian fighters appreciated the weapon and wanted a locally manufactured version of it as the new standard Croatian Army rifle.http://rostec.ru/en/news/4515094/ The APS-95 was officially adopted by the Croatian Army around 1993, acquired and distributed in very small quantities before budgetary constraints stopped procurement.https://web.archive.org/web/20180726091638/https://special- ops.org/weapons/rifle/hs-produkt-vhs-15690/ While the APS-95 was not entirely adopted in the Croatian Army, some of them were used in the Yugoslav Wars. Design The APS-95 was a conventional select-fire assault rifle operating via a gas-driven piston and employing a 35-rounds detachable magazine for 5.56mm ammunition, in all similar to the ones used in the Israeli Galil or South-African R4 assault rifles. The APS-95 was made around a stamped receiver, rather than the refined milled receiver of the Galil and R4, thus achieving reduction in cost and manufacturing time. Its fire selector was based upon two distinct commands located on both sides of the rifle, similarly to the Galil and Vektor R4 but different in operation. They consist of P (Pojedinacno or semi-auto), R (Rafalno or full auto) and Z (Zakoceno or Safe). The lever located on the right side of the receiver, based upon the AK-47 selector, consisted of three modes. The small switch located over the grip on the left side of the receiver, at easy thumb reach, had two positions for semi-automatic and full-automatic fire. The folding stock was made out of stamped steel, and folded on the right side of the receiver; its profile didn't caused any hindrance to the handling of the weapon nor to the operation of the bolt - as such, the APS-95 could be safely fired with the stock folded. The most prominent features of the APS-95 over the Galil and the R4 were its distinctive handguard and front sight, and its carrying handle integrating a 1.5× optical sight and optional backup back iron sights. The pistol grip was also different, featuring finger grooves, much in the style of the M16 rifle The use of polymer magazines issued with the weapon indicates that it's likely from South African sources.

The equipment may have varied, but an example sold in 1969 was mechanically similar to the Morgan +4 of the same year. It had the straight 4 pushrod engine of a Triumph TR4A, giving . The transmission was 4 speed with synchromesh on 2nd, 3rd and 4th. It also shared the suspension with the +4. In front, it had sliding king pins tilted 17 degrees from the vertical, a development of a 1910 design. This was lubricated by grease and by engine oil released by a button under the clutch pedal. It had coil springs (very hard) and bottoming coils instead of rubber pads. The rear had conventional leaf springs with solid rear axle. There was no perceptible body lean, even when cornering very hard. It had disc brakes in front, drums in the rear, hard pedal pressure with no power assist. The frame was Z section steel rails with structural plywood floor, extended by steel tubes in front. The closed envelope two seat body was thin streamlined fibreglass with fixed top and all glass windows (one might expect plastic to achieve this weight), roll-up on the sides, giving it a weight of 1800 pounds (816 kg) and a top speed of around (compared to for the heavier, less streamlined TR4A). Performance was better than +4, because the fibreglass kept the weight low in spite of more interior space, and the more modern shape had less air drag. Sound insulation was limited, but leg room was unusually generous.

Fictional states of the United States Fictional states are not as common as fictional cities, counties, or countries; often, a work will invent a fictional city and simply not reveal its state. Occasionally, however, a fictional state is created to house fictional cities, towns, or counties. Typically, a work that features a fictional state will also reveal the names of several cities within that state. =Non-existent states= Named U.S. states =Comics= * Calisota, in the Duck universe from various Walt Disney comic books, Calisota is roughly equivalent to Northern California. It includes the city of Duckburg, and possibly Mouseton, Spoonerville, and St. Canard. The name is likely derived from California and Minnesota, with possible references to the Northern California town of Calistoga. *Coventry, from Bill Willingham's horror comic book of the same name. *Michisota, from Pierce's fake I.D. in Zits. =Film= * North Montana, from the movie Meet the Robinsons (2007); the former country of Canada, in the future. =Law= * Ames, the fictitious state in which are set many moot court cases and examination problems at Harvard Law School. * Midlands, the fictional (supposedly Midwestern) state in which all American Mock Trial Association cases take place. * Reserve, the fictitious state in which are set many moot court and mock trial cases at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. =Literature= * Apodidraskiana, a slave state referenced in Thomas Love Peacock's novel Crotchet Castle (1831). Located there is Dotandcarryonetown, a haven for people who wish to disappear for one reason or another. The state's name appears to be derived from apodidraskinda (ἀποδιδρασκίνδα), a game similar to hide-and-seek described by the 2nd-century Greek writer Julius Pollux. * Catawba, in Look Homeward, Angel by Thomas Wolfe, is a fictionalized North Carolina. * Dakota, in the Southern Victory series by Harry Turtledove. As a result of the Confederate victory in the War of Secession (1861-1862), Dakota remains one unified state instead of being split into two, possibly as a result of the declining influence of the Republican Party. Dakota becomes a stronghold of an ascendant Socialist Party, being the home state of one-term Socialist President, Hosea Blackford. * Deseret (in real-life, a provisional state proposed in by 1849 by Mormon pioneers) **In Ward Moore's Bring the Jubilee, set in a reality where the Confederacy won the American Civil War and the United States became a dysfunctional rump state, is the only prosperous U.S. state, and the only place where polygamy is still practiced. **In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series, the Mormons attempt to gain independence for Utah as Deseret during the Second Mexican War (1881-1882) and the First (1914-1917) and Second Great Wars (1941-1944). * Dorado in I-0 (1997), a work of interactive fiction. * Euphoria, in the academic novels of David Lodge, based on California. It first appears in Changing Places (1975), much of which is set in Euphoric State University in the city of Plotinus, itself based on Berkeley, California. Euphoria is located between \\"North California\\" and \\"South California\\". * Fremont, a fictional state in James A. Michener's novel Space (1982) located roughly along the border between Kansas and Nebraska, that is meant to stand for the American midwest in general. The origin of its name is clearly stated : \\"Fremont was the most typical of the great Western states. Named for the flamboyant explorer John Charles Fremont, it had honoured in its four major cities those outstanding politicians of the early 19th century whose interest in the West had helped that vast area become an integral part of the nation.\\" (Webster, Calhoun, Clay, Benton - note the relationship with respectively the two great political parties of the US.)page 124 of the pocket book edition of Michener's \\"Space\\" * Hohoq, popularly known as Ar in John Hodgman's The Areas of My Expertise (2005), is a large flying state inhabited by a mix of German-American settlers and bird people known as Thunderbirds. It refuses to send a delegate to the United States Congress but provides the federal government with an annual tribute of bauxite. State Motto: \\"Please do not seek us\\". * Houston, in the Southern Victory series by Harry Turtledove. Named after Sam Houston, the western portion of Texas is taken from the Confederate States by the United States after the First Great War (1914-1917) is won by the Central Powers. Its capital is located in Lubbock. After Union President Al Smith agrees to Confederate President Jake Featherston's request to hold plebiscites in former Confederate states for readmittance into the Confederacy, Houston is readmitted as part of Texas; however, after the Second Great War (1941-1944) and the annexation of the Confederacy by the United States, Houston is recreated and readmitted as a state of the Union, with the independence of the Second Republic of Texas being put into doubt. *Jefferson, in a series of short works called the State of Jefferson Stories by Harry Turtledove. Based on the borders of the proposed Pacific state, this version was created from parts of northern California and southern Oregon in 1919 rather than in 1941. The states capital is located in Yreka. Moreover, sasquatch are real, sentient, and are regular members of Jefferson's society. * Michisota, a fictional state in Lisa Wheeler's children's book Avalanche Annie: A Not-So-Tall-Tale that is a cross between Michigan and Minnesota, has snowy weather, and a mountain called Mount Himalachia. * Mickewa, a state represented by Senator Elias Gotobed, in Anthony Trollope' novel The American Senator (1877). * New Mexico, in the Southern Victory series by Harry Turtledove. As a result of the Confederate victory in the War of Secession (1861-1862), the State of New Mexico encompasses the real-life states of New Mexico and Arizona, possibly as a result of the declining influence of the Republican Party. Following the First Great War (1914-1917), sections of US-occupied Sonora (a Confederate state) were annexed to New Mexico. * Ochichornia, in Vasily Aksyonov's semi- biographic novels and stories, relates to the popular Russian song \\"The Dark Eyes\\" (\\"Очи черные\\", \\"Ochi Chernie\\" in Russian). It has been suggested that Ochichornia is just another name for California. * Oconee, a fictional southern state tucked between Georgia and Tennessee, which appeared in Michael Bishop's satirical superhero/fantasy novel Count Geiger's Blues. The story is set in Oconee's largest city, Salonika, a Metropolis-like stand-in for Atlanta. * Pennsyltucky, a state referenced in Tiny Cracker Zoo, by Christopher Master. *Sequoyah, in the Southern Victory series by Harry Turtledove. A Confederate state in this timeline, Native Americans enjoy a large degree of autonomy in this state and are generally respected by white Confederates. The state is annexed by the United States along with Houston and Kentucky after the First Great War (1914-1917). C.S. President Jake Featherston successfully persuades U.S. President Al Smith to hold referenda in these states to return them to the Confederacy; only Sequoyah votes against re-entry into the Confederacy, becoming one of several casus belli of the Second Great War (1941-1944) in North America. * Toxoplassachusetts, the state occupied by the \\"toxoplasmodic hivemind\\", which constitutes 1/3 of the U.S. population, in John Hodgman's That Is All. * Udana. Made up of Utah and Montana, a location on the itinerary of Humbert-Humbert, in Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita (1955). * Washagon, a state referenced in Robert Grudin's Book: A Novel (1992), clearly a portmanteau of Washington and Oregon. * Winnemac, in the novels of Sinclair Lewis. Several of his novels are set in the Winnemac town of Zenith, and the University of Winnemac is located in Mohalis. Winnemac is bordered by Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. =Radio= * Malebolgia, in the Big Finish Doctor Who audio Minuet in Hell. =Theatre= * Missitucky, in the Broadway musical Finian's Rainbow (1947), with music by Burton Lane and lyrics by E.Y. Harburg, which follows one Finian McLonergan from Ireland in the town of Rainbow Valley in the mythical state of Missitucky, intent on burying a stolen pot of gold in the shadows of Fort Knox, in the mistaken belief it will grow and multiply. The name is a portmanteau of Mississippi and Kentucky. =Television= *Delmarva, the state in which Beach City is located in Cartoon Network series Steven Universe. It is based heavily on a peninsula with same name, the meeting point of Delaware, far eastern areas of Maryland, and a small portion of Virginia. * Keystone, from Keystone Motel (2015); a Steven Universe episode. A fictional version of Pennsylvania. * Moosylvania, from Jay Ward's Rocky and Bullwinkle television series. This state has been contested by the U.S. and Canada in two episodes of the series, \\"Moosylvania\\" and \\"Moosylvania Saved\\". The U.S. says it is a province of Canada, while Canada says it is a U.S. state. It is an island in the middle of western Lake Superior. Bullwinkle is governor of Moosylvania. The state's official sport is farkling. Jay Ward even tried to make the 51st state, which he called \\"Moosylvania\\", by claiming an island off the coast of the U.S. and Canada for himself and promoting it all over the country. When Ward and his publicist, Howard Brandy, arrived at the White House gate with a proposal and signed petition, the guards told them to leave due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. *New Delaware, mentioned in a January 16, 2013 episode of The Daily Show as a state that doesn't exist anymore—an example for Senate officials who \\"pick up the wrong state to change the rules with\\". * New Troy :*In Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, is the state wherein Metropolis is located. New Troy is probably analogous to New York State. The name was never used as a state in the comics, which has placed Metropolis in various locations along the eastern coast of the United States over the decades. :*The place name has also been used by writer Mark Gruenwald as a direct analog of New York State for the original version of the Squadron Supreme in assorted Marvel Universe comics series. * North Texas is referenced on Fringe as a state in the show's alternate universe. A brief shot of a map shows that the Dakotas, Carolinas, and Virginias are each one state, Texas is split in two, Kansas and Oklahoma are combined into a state called \\"Midland,\\" and the western half of California is missing from the map, although whether the coastline is still part of Mexico or has sunk into the sea is unclear. * Oklachusetts, from the Seth MacFarlane animated short The Life of Larry (1995). Larry, who would later become Peter Griffin in Family Guy, described it as \\"where the wind comes sweeping down the Pike\\". * Statesota is the state in which Moralton is located in the Adult Swim series Moral Orel. Based on the overhead map viewable during the show's opening credits, Statesota is made up of much of western Missouri and eastern Kansas. *Wichita, appears in the Spanish humor sketch program La hora de José Mota. Its capital city has the same name: Wichita. =Video games= * Alderney from Grand Theft Auto IV is the surrogate to New Jersey. Alderney replaced New Guernsey (see below) as the parody surrogate state in the Grand Theft Auto series, also getting its name from its Channel Islands namesake. Alderney is depicted in-game as being directly west of the State of Liberty and a location where a portion of Grand Theft Auto IV takes place. * Columbia, a floating city and former state in BioShock Infinite (2013), controversy for its actions in the Boxer Rebellion having prompted its secession. * Liberty is the state that Liberty City is located in the Grand Theft Auto and has been depicted in one form or another the most out of all other fictional states. In Grand Theft Auto IV, Liberty is shown situated directed east of the State of Alderney in and in the 3D universe is stated to be located somewhere close to Carcer City. It is the surrogate to New York. * New Guernsey is a surrogate for New Jersey state and/or Jersey City in various fictional contexts, including the Batman comics, television series and films. Like the real New Jersey, the \\"State of New Guernsey\\" is named after one of the Channel Islands. (The similarly named \\"New Guernsey\\" in the Grand Theft Auto games series, however, is only a city, located in the state of Alderney; see below.) * Temperance, in Gangsters 2 (2001). The state map had an eastern coastline and included several large islands, and was made up of a combination of urban and upstate areas. The architecture and in particular civic institutions like the police seemed largely based on Illinois—the most important fact about it, however, was simply that it was a dry state during Prohibition. * North Yankton, in the video game Grand Theft Auto V (2013), is the birthplace of Michael De Santa (born Michael Townley) and where the prologue took place. Likely based on North Dakota. *San Andreas is the state where Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas game (2004) is set, housing the cities of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). San Andreas also constitutes the setting of Grand Theft Auto V (2013) but only constituting the southern part of the state which contains two counties, one with the City of Los Santos and several other smaller towns. * Ambarino from the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). It is likely based mostly based on Colorado, and their names share a similar etymology; in the Spanish language, ambarino means \\"amber\\", whereas Colorado means \\"reddish\\". * Lemoyne from the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). It is based on Louisiana with the states capital being Saint Denis (a parody of New Orleans). It is located in the Southern United States. * New Austin from the video games Red Dead Redemption (2010) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). It is strongly based on Arizona and New Mexico but also has influences from southern California, Nevada, and Texas. It borders the fictional Mexican state of Nuevo Paraíso. * New Hanover from the video game Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). It is based on several states. The Heartlands are based upon the real-life American Heartlands in states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, and both North and South Dakota. The Cumberland Forest is based upon the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Eastern Colorado. Roanoke Ridge is based upon the Ouachita and Ozarks regions, which include eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, and southern Missouri. The states overall geographic placement roughly corresponds to that of Oklahoma and Arkansas. * West Elizabeth from the video games Red Dead Redemption (2010) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018). The Great Plains region is based on the real-life Great Plains region in Oklahoma and Texas. The Tall Trees region is based on the Calaveras Big Trees State Park and its surrounding areas in Northern California, especially with its sequoia trees, while its placement somewhat corresponds to the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico. Big Valley is primarily inspired by various mountainous and forested areas of Colorado, such as the Rocky Mountain National Park, Gunnison Valley and the San Juan Mountains. The area's pine trees, lush grasslands and rocky mountains are quite reminiscent of Colorado. * North Washington is a mysterious state where Dead or Alive: Northtown novel series takes place, housing the cities and towns of Olyres City (a largest gigantic capital megalopolis of the state), Northtown (a mysterious, sleepy, remote, rural, mining, industrialized, resort, incorporated and company hill city, where there are criminal and supernatural things happen), Southtown, Westtown, Easttown, Willow Creek, Brayle, Farmerville, Ash, Avon's Grove, Comfort, Covenant, Crow's Bridge, Gonen, Otter Ferry, Shoal, Scales, Silvermines, Stoneheim, Strong, Strand, Tallow, Raven City, Tyr, White Falls, Redwood Falls, Yursgrad, Muirthene, Llancarfan, Madrigal, Tandem, Helsford, Myrgard, Avildale Park, Cladsville, Ghostspirit, Dougsfield, Ironmale, Ellywood Springs, Barn City, Bonetown, Jakcsville, Timmsvale, Anthony, Entertainopolis, Landish, Konner, Plains Hill, Cave City, Pine Oaks, Bown, Orange Creek, Beika, Keolloseu, Aelbeageu, Arktuis Vill, White Sand Harbor, Willieoseu, Frost Woods, StoneHammer Vill, Dragon Fangs Vill, Lupes Town, Gothsville, Eastport, Wolf City and Toadstool. The state where there are many criminal and supernatural occurrences. it's the city first appeared in the novel Dead or Alive: Northtown: Chapter 1 - Welcome to Northtown, North Washington and finally appeared in Dead or Alive 7. Unnamed U.S. states * Cherokee State appears on the license plates on the sitcom Malcolm in the Middle; this is likely intended to be a state nickname. * Eagle State likewise appears on license plates on the television series Desperate Housewives. * Hooterville, claimed in an episode of Green Acres \\"A Home Isn't Built in a Day\\" (S02 E11) to be a state named after Rutherford B. Skrug, its first governor. In the Green Acres episode \\"One of Our Assemblymen is Missing\\" (S01 E06) Oliver Douglas visits the unnamed state's governor, who presents him with a souvenir of \\"The Kangaroo State\\", a toy kangaroo. However, Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies place Hooterville in Missouri. * Sideburn State appears on license plates on the television series The Adventures of Pete & Pete. * Sill. is the abbreviation for the state containing Lichfield in the works of James Branch Cabell. * Unnamed State in The Simpsons contains Springfield, Shelbyville, and Capital City from The Simpsons. Producer/director David Silverman once unofficially named Springfield's setting as being in the fictional state of North Takoma. In the episode \\"Duffless\\" Homer's driver's license states that the postal abbreviation of their home state is \\"NT\\". In \\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\\", there is a montage with essayists from different states presenting their work, while the camera pans over a U.S. map. When the map moves to Springfield for Lisa's contribution, we can see the abbreviation \\"NT\\" over the state that Springfield is in. In The Simpsons Movie (2007), Flanders and Bart are at the top of a mountain, where Flanders states you can see the four states that border Springfield: Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky. In the episode \\"Bart vs. Lisa vs. The Third Grade\\", it is stated that the state bird is the pot-bellied finch, the state pasta is futicelli, and the state flag is a Confederate flag rising above an ocean (an embarrassment considering this state was Northern). However, in the episode \\"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\\", the flag of the state is depicted as a green, white, and red triband with a blue star and the caption \\"NOT JUST ANOTHER STATE\\". The state practices capital punishment. *Unnamed State in Joe Klein's 1996 novel and 1998 film Primary Colors, also referred to in the sequel The Running Mate (2000), is a small southern state and home to Governor Jack Stanton (D), whose hometown is Grace Junction. Its capital is Mammoth Falls. Unnamed State is allegorical to Arkansas, and Jack Stanton represents Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. *Unnamed State in Joe Klein's novel The Running Mate (2000) is a Midwestern state and the home state of Senator Charlie Martin (D). Des Pointe is the state capital, largest city and hometown of Senator Martin, but many other locations in the state are mentioned. Industrial centers are Port Sallesby and Singer Rapids. Stated to have 53 counties. Charlie Martin is partially based on Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, but Nebraska and several other Midwestern states are mentioned separately, leaving the identity of Martin's home state unclear *Unnamed State, in Sinclair Lewis' novel It Can't Happen Here (1935), is a Western state and home state of dictatorial President Berzelius \\"Buzz\\" Windrip. Windrip's secretary and chief assistant Lee Sarason is described as having been, at the beginning of Windrip's rise, managing editor of the most widely circulated paper in this state's region. =Alternative representations of The United States= 51st state \\"51st state\\" (and related terms) has been used in books and film, usually in a negative sense: *In Americathon (1979), set in a fictional 1998, Britain (renamed as Limeyland) has become the 57th state, and the logo of the Safeway grocery chain hangs on the Palace of Westminster. *In the alternative universe of Alan Moore's graphic novel Watchmen, the Vietnam War ends with the conquest of the North and annexation of a united Vietnam as the 51st state. *In the novel 51st State (1998) by Peter Preston, Britain leaves the European Union and becomes the 51st state of the United States. *In The Light of Other Days (2000), a novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter, Britain joins the United States, with the Prime Minister serving as governor and the Royal Family exiled to Australia. *The British film The 51st State (released in the United States and Canada as Formula 51), makes fun of Anglo-American relations. * State 51 is an upside- down, floating state featured in the Marvel Comics series Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.. * Saudi Israelia. From the Simpsons episode \\"Future-Drama\\", which takes place in the future. Bart's future girlfriend mentions it as the 51st state. Named after Saudi Arabia and Israel. North American Union The flag used in alternate histories where the American Revolution either failed or never occurred, such as The Two Georges, is like the US Grand Union Flag. The Two Georges world map: British Empire (red); Franco-Spanish \\"Holy Alliance\\" (pink); Portuguese territory (orange); Austrian Empire (purple); Sweden (green); Danish Empire (cyan); Russian Empire (indigo). Territorial evolution of the Confederation of North America in the world of For Want of a Nail. * North American Union, a theoretical economic and political union of Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The concept is based on continental union-theory (such as the European Union), occasionally including a common currency called the Amero or the North American Dollar. A union of the North American continent, sometimes extending to Central America and Union of South American Nations, has been the subject of academic concepts for over a century, as well as becoming a common trope in science fiction. * The Hunger Games – The nation of Panem rules North America in place of the governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico, which failed to survive. *The Two Georges – For more than two centuries, what would have become the continental United States, Canada and Baja California has been the North American Union, a self-governing dominion encompassing the northern portion of the continent except Alaska, retained under the rule of Russia. The Two Georges, a Gainsborough painting, commemorates the agreement between George Washington and King George III that created this part of the British Empire.

By the end of the First Great War (1914-1917), the United States grant statehood to Kentucky and Houston, annexes parts of Virginia, Arkansas and Confederate Sonora, grant territorial status to Sequoyah and the Sandwich Islands, occupy most of Canada (Quebec being made a U.S. puppet state), Newfoundland, the Bahamas and Bermuda and suppress the Mormon uprising in Utah; it was stated that none of the Canadian provinces other than Quebec would be admitted as states. By the end of the Second Great War (1941-1944), the United States has occupied the extraterritorial Mexican state of Baja California and begins the reincorporation of the Confederacy (including the purchased Confederate states of Sonora, Chihuahua and Cuba). By 1944, the United States occupied most of North America, with the exceptions of the Republic of Quebec, the Republic of Texas, the Empire of Mexico and Russian America. *Futurama - In the episode All the Presidents' Heads, Professor Farnsworth travels back in time using the fluid used to preserve the heads of historical figures and attempts to prevent the treasonous actions of his ancestor David Farnsworth. When burning counterfeit currency, Fry unwittingly stole a lantern from the Old North Church, leading Paul Revere to mistakenly warn of a British attack from land rather than by sea. As a result, Great Britain won the American Revolutionary War and by 3011, all of North America (including the continental United States, Canada, Alaska and Central America) was eventually unified as 'West Britannia' and the Farnsworths are a ducal family whose members have served as consorts for the British Royal family. The original timeline was restored by the end of the episode. *For Want of a Nail - Written by Robert Sobel, the novel (written as an undergraduate-level history textbook) depicts the failure of the American War of Independence owing to John Burgoyne's victory at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777 and the negotiation of a truce by Continental Congressional Conciliationists in 1778. The Confederation of North America is established by 1843, comprising a number of smaller confederations. **The Northern Confederation: A union of the Middle and New England Colonies. **The Southern Confederation: A union of the Southern Colonies. **Indiana: A territory encompassing the real-life East North Central states (Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin), analogous with the U.S. Northwest Territory. **Manitoba: A territory encompassing real-life Northern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, eastern Alberta, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. **North Vandalia: The northern half of the former Louisiana Territory. **South Vandalia: The southern half of the former Louisiana Territory. Both Nova Scotia and Quebec, whilst still parts of the British Empire, are independent of the CNA. *Sliders - In the episode Prince of Wails, the Sliders visit a reality where Great Britain successfully suppressed the American War of Independence, establishing the British States of America at some point thereafter. The BSA's exact territorial extent is never specified with the episode being set entirely in San Francisco, itself depicted as the capital. The United States of Canada Map of the United States of Canada (in blue) and Jesusland (in red) *Jesusland map, an Internet meme created after the 2004 United States Presidential election, which satirizes the red/blue states scheme by dividing the United States and Canada into \\"The United States of Canada\\" and \\"Jesusland\\". The map implies the existence of a fundamental political divide between contiguous northern and southern regions of North America, the former including both the socially liberal Canada (sometimes excluding Alberta) and the West Coast, northeastern, and north-Midwestern states of the US, and suggests that these states are closer in spirit to Canada than to the more conservative regions of their own country. The United States, Inc. The world of Jennifer Government.

Collections of existing states as independent sovereign nations Geopolitical variations of sovereign states or nations in North America are a recurring theme due to historical debates regarding partition and secession movements. This is an especially common trope in works of alternative historical fiction involving the United States, which ultimately Balkanizes the country into a series of autonomous commonwealths. =Confederate States of America-variants= The Confederate States and Allied Powers (green) of World War I vs. the United States and Central Powers (yellow). Results: the United States and German Empire are the dominant regional great powers; the resulting reparations and annexation of sovereign territories under the Treaty of Versailles inevitably set the stage for World War II. The United States vs. the Confederate States during World War II. Results: the American Empire, German Empire, and Japanese Empire are the -only- surviving global superpowers. The Confederate States of America ceases to exist after Richmond, Virginia is destroyed by the first atomic bomb and is put into \\"political limbo\\". Flag of the Freedom Party. Map of the Golden Circle with its possible subdivisions. The rest of the Confederate States of America is in light/pale-green. *Southern Victory novel series by Harry Turtledove, where the United States and the Confederate States maintain an eighty-year rivalry. After the U.S. triumphs over the C.S. in an alternate World War I, fictional character Jake Featherston becomes President of the Confederate States of America, acting as the fictional timeline's equivalent of Adolf Hitler, thereby bring about the CSA's final defeat and annexation at the climax of an alternate World War II. *Captain Confederacy, an alternate history comic book by Will Shetterly and Vince Stone (published between 1986 and 1992), tells the story of an African-American superhero created for propaganda purposes in a world in which the Confederate States of America won their independence. *Bring the Jubilee alternate history novel, and the similarly themed movie C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, a 2004 mockumentary directed by Kevin Willmott, explore the results of a Southern victory in the American Civil War. It features a fictional \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" political-mockumentary account of an alternate history in which the Confederates, established the new Confederate States of America. Both works posit the Golden Circle as a plan enacted after the war; it incorporates the former United States, Mexico, Caribbean and nearly half of South-America not annexed by the Empire of Brazil.C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America, Official Website, archived link *Fire on the Mountain by Terry Bisson is set in an alternate timeline whereby John Brown's raid in Harper's Ferry was more successful due to tactical advice from Harriet Tubman, resulting in a slave and abolitionist rebellion during the 1860s which led to the secession of the Southern states as Nova Africa and the reannexation of territory lost by Mexico during the Mexican American War. By 1959, the United States has been reformed into the 'U.S.S.A.', one of many socialist nations in a worldwide utopia. *North American Confederacy States (NAC), an alternate history series of novels created by L. Neil Smith, ostensible point of divergence is the addition of a single word in the preamble to the United States Declaration of Independence, wherein it states that governments \\"...derive their just power from the unanimous consent of the governed.\\" Inspired by this wording, Albert Gallatin intercedes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 to the benefit of the farmers, rather than the fledgling United States government. This eventually leads to the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, the abrogation of the U.S. Constitution, and the reestablishment of government under the revised Articles of Confederation, but with a much greater emphasis on individual and economic freedom. Gallatin's actions would eventually lead to the US to merge with its neighbors to form the North American Confederacy in the 1890s. *Russian Amerika, the alternate history novel, has 20th-century North America made up of several independent sovereign nations:map provided at beginning of book The point of divergence is that the United States lost the Civil War with the Confederacy; and as a post-war consequence, the Union loses all ground west of the Mississippi River as American-claimed western lands secede from the Union. **United States of America (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, the majority of Illinois, and Quebec south of the St Lawrence River.) **Confederate States of America (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, the southwestern portion of Illinois, the eastern half of Kansas, Cuba, and Hispaniola.) **Republic of Texas (Texas, Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico) **First People's Nation (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Arizona, the westernmost portion of New Mexico, the western half of Kansas, the central and southwestern portion of Ontario, and the southernmost portion of Manitoba.) **Deseret (Utah and the northeastern portion of Nevada.) **Republic of California (California, Oregon, and the majority of Nevada.) **French Canada (Quebec north of the St Lawrence River, Newfoundland, Labrador, and the northeastern portion of Ontario.) **British Canada (Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Washington state, the northwestern portion of Ontario, the southeastern portion of the Yukon Territory, and the majority of British Columbia and Manitoba.) **New Spain (Mexico and Central America.) **Danish America (Greenland) **Russian Amerika (Alaska, the majority of the Yukon Territory, and the northwestern portion of British Columbia.) Post- partition United States, as seen in Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG and Appleseed. *, a fictional country appearing in Masamune Shirow's anime and manga series' Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed, consists primarily of the American states that had formed the Confederate States of America, plus parts of the Great Plains and Southwest. After the end of World War III, the United States is partitioned by an unspecified process into three countries: the American Empire, the , and the rump state . The American Empire is the only successor state to play a major role in world politics. Its government seems driven by Golden Circle ideology and a desire to restore its diminished power and prestige, towards which end it adopts a policy of militarist aggression and open imperialism, directed primarily against Latin America. =Fractured States of America-variants= *The Disunited States of America: The United States dissolved in the early 1800s due to the Constitutional Convention failing. The nations of North America including a number of former U.S. states or alternate reality analogues, which have frequently been engaged in a series of small wars since the 1800s. National dissolution was also affected Canada and Mexico. **Alabama **Baja **Boone, a state consisting of what would have been Tennessee and eastern Kentucky. **Carolina, a state created by the reunion of North Carolina and South Carolina. **California **Deseret **Florida, mentioned as having been dissolved after the 'Florida Intervention'. **Mississippi, a black supremacist state created after a Black Insurrection sometime during the 1970s. **Oregon **Russian America, known for its oil production. **Texas, an oil-producing state. **Virginia, a state which competes with Ohio over coal reserves due to its retention of its western counties. **Wabash, a state analogous with Indiana. *The Valley-Westside War: A world in which nuclear warfare took place in 1967. Los Angeles and the rest of the United States are split into several tiny republics, kingdoms, city states, etc. =Rump States of America-variants= USA divided in three parts: The Japanese Pacific States in the west, Das Große Nazi Reich (The Great Nazi Empire) in the east and The Rocky Mountain States (or The Neutral Zone) in the middle * The Man in the High Castle: Giuseppe Zangara's assassination of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 led to the weak governments of John Nance Garner (formerly FDR's Vice President), and subsequently of Republican John W. Bricker in 1941. Both politicians failed to lead the country to recovery from the Great Depression and also maintained the country's isolationist policy against participating in the Second World War; thus, the U.S. had insufficient military capabilities to assist the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany, or to defend itself against Japan in the Pacific. After the war, the United States is divided between the Japanese- controlled Pacific States of America along the West Coast, the Nazi-occupied United States east of the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains States which acts as a buffer zone between the two empires in North America. * In the TV miniseries Amerika, the post-invasion United States is divided into multiple \\"administrative areas\\" following its annexation by the Soviet Union: ::Ameritech: (presumably named after the telecommunications company): Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania ::Appalachia: Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia ::California Special District: California, Nevada ::Central: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska (at the climax of the series, this area is carved out of the United States as a new country called Heartland) ::Mid-Atlantic: Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia ::North Central: Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin ::Northeastern: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont ::Northwest: Oregon, Washington ::South Central: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas ::Southern: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi ::Southwest: Arizona, New Mexico ::Western Semi-Autonomous: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming In addition to these areas, Washington, D.C. constitutes its own National Administrative District, South Florida is described by a character as the \\"Space Zone,\\" and there is a passing reference to three \\"International Cities,\\" one of which is San Francisco. Michigan is separated into two administrative regions, with the Lower Peninsula belonging to Ameritech, and the Upper Peninsula belonging to the North Central region. Alaska is mentioned as never having been pacified, requiring continued engagement by Soviet troops, and there are pockets of armed resistance in the Rocky Mountains and in West Virginia. There is no mention of what happened to Hawaii or to U.S. Territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa. * Coalition States: a fascist empire founded upon the post-apocalyptic ruins of the American Midwest in the Rifts role-playing game. * The Alteration, written by Kingsley Amis, set in an alternate universe where the Protestant Reformation never occurred owing to the prevention of Henry VIII's succession to the English throne and the ascension to the Papacy of both Martin Luther and Thomas More; by 1976, Catholicism and the Papacy dominate most of the Western World. During the course of the book, a number of countries and territories are mentioned. :* Republic of New England – the breakaway country which is the greatest extent to which Schismatic theology has spread. It includes such locations as Cramneria, Hussville, Waldsdenia, Arnoldstown and Wycliffe City. A 'First Citizen' acts as the secular head (Joseph Rudyard Kipling is mentioned as being 'First Citizen between 1914 and 1918) and the Archpresbytor of Arnoldstown acts as the head of the church. New England is scientifically more advanced and culturally freer than the Papal Realms (having invented heavier-than-air flight and allowing the performance of Shakespeare's plays) but practices a harsh penal system and a system of apartheid between whites and Native Americans. :* Louisiana – Mentioned as having fought a war against New England circa 1848. It is not mentioned whether it is a district of New France or an independent country. :* Mexico – Mentioned as having fought a war against New England circa 1848. Mexico is an independent empire existing alongside New Spain. :* Quebec – A French colony. :* Florida – A Spanish colony. :* New Muscovy – A colony of Muscovy, analogous with Alaska. A novel-within-a-novel is mentioned, an alternate version of Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle depicting an alternate reality where the Protestant Reformation occurred. In 1848, England's American colonies revolt and win their independence, going on to conquer all of North America except for New Muscovy and Spanish Florida. * The Handmaid's Tale, written by Margaret Atwood, is set during an indeterminate point in the then future (approximately 2005, the book having been published in 1985). It is set primarily in the Christian fundamentalist theonomy of the Republic of Gilead. In the novel, the only given details of its territorial extent are its setting in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the African-American 'National Homelands' located in the Midwest and the 'Colonies' (assorted agricultural districts and areas of fatal pollution worked by 'Unwomen'). In the television series, however, the Republic of Gilead is shown via a map to occupy the former continental United States minus territories held by rebel militias. A rump United States exists, consisting of the extraterritorial states of Hawaii and Alaska (the capital being relocated to Anchorage) and an American diaspora in Canada; the new United States flag shows forty-eight of the fifty stars in its blue canton as white outlines, presumably representing those states lost to Gilead. * The Difference Engine, co-authored by William Gibson and Bruce Stirling, is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with Charles Babbage's completion of his Difference Engine. The information technology revolution occurs in the Victorian Era and the British Empire is the world's leading power. The British Empire interfered in North American affairs, causing the United States to fragment in order to prevent it from becoming a world power. The following nations are mentioned. :* The United States – The rump state left after fragmentation. :* The Confederate States — The exiled British hereditary nobility are mentioned as having formed a community in Charleston. :* Manhattan Commune :* Republic of California :* Republic of Texas – Sam Houston appears in the novel as the exiled Texian President, having been replaced by a military junta. :* British North America – This is slighter large than in reality. :* Russian America :* Mexico – Under the occupation of the Second French Empire. :* Terra Nullius – This consists mostly of the Missouri Territory and is ruled by different Native American nations. * Fallout, a retro-futuristic United States setting influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. Since the end of The Great War, the United States ultimately dissolves, with various territories broadly referred as the \\"Wasteland\\" or simply the \\"Wastes\\". :*The Brotherhood of Steel is a neo-knightly order founded by deserters of the U.S. Armed Forces shortly before the Great War. They are probably the most widely-spread faction in post-war America, however many Brotherhood divisions have differing ideologies and practices, due to this they vary from location such as the Mojave Chapter and the East Coast Brotherhood. They have appeared in every Fallout game to date, and are the main focus of Fallout: Tactics and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. :*The Enclave is a secretive, militaristic organization established after the Great War, founded by descendants of the pre-War United States government and its military-industrial complex. They consider themselves the legal continuation of the U.S. government and continuously plot their resurgence. They are the main antagonists of Fallout 2, Fallout 3, and its add-on Broken Steel. Remnants of the Enclave's west coast division appear as a faction in Fallout: New Vegas and the Enclave are mentioned by a former Enclave soldier turned follower for the Children of Atom in Fallout 4's add-on Far Harbor. :*The Commonwealth is what is left of the pre-Great War State of Massachusetts in New England Commonwealth of the United States in the alternate history of the Fallout universe. Most of it is a \\"war-ravaged quagmire of violence and despair\\" like much of the rest of the former United States, but it is also where Boston is located. It was first mentioned in Fallout 3 and later appeared in Fallout 4. :*Caesar's Legion is an autocratic, ultra-reactionary, utilitarian slaver army founded in 2247 by Edward Sallow and Joshua Graham. It is largely inspired and partially based on the ancient Roman Empire, though it isn't the Roman Empire or the Roman Republic or even its military, the Legion. It is a slave army with trappings of foreign- conscripted Roman legionaries during the late empire. All military, no civilian, and with none of the supporting civilian culture. It appears only in Fallout: New Vegas. :*The New California Republic (NCR) is a federal presidential republic founded in New California by Aradesh. Comprising five contiguous states, territories and holdings in pre-War regions in Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, and parts of Mexico, the Republic dedicates itself to the values of the old world: democracy, liberty, and the rule of law. It was founded in 2186, is mentioned in Fallout 3, and appears in Fallout 2 & Fallout: New Vegas. :*Shi is a post-apocalyptic nation that is against post- war politics, and uses some of the Chinese culture, such as their ancestors' customs, clothing, language and demeanor. The younger generations, however, seem to rely more on the surviving popular culture interpretations of Chinese culture (such as kung-fu holovideos), rather than actual cultural traditions. It only appears in Fallout 2 and flashback in memories by remains of Kellogg's brain Fallout 4. :*Republic of Dave (formerly Kingdom of Tom, Kingdom of Larry, the Republic of Stevie-Ray, Billsylvania, and the New Republic of Stevie-Ray) is a small farming settlement in the far northeast corner of the Capital Wasteland (Fallout 3) that is considered by its close-knit inhabitants to be a sovereign nation-state. This nation is actually closer to a Micronation, because since on-off monarchies and republics with an only family control it, and they only had one citizen working as a teacher or merchant (optional) during the game. This \\"Nation\\" only appears in Fallout 3. :*The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas is a faction led by Robert House in New Vegas. Although it is formally founded if House establishes sovereignty over the Mojave, in practice, it exists in a practical capacity throughout Mr House's rule in New Vegas. *Shattered Union, on Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C., a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon is detonated, destroying most of the city and effectively wiping out the presidential line of succession. The European Union sends peacekeepers to the New York and Washington metropolitan areas to secure international interests, while the Russian Federation invades and occupies Alaska (under the pretense of \\"expanded humanitarian operations\\"). As wave of secessionist sentiment rises in America; the governor of California declares home rule and secedes from the Union on April 15, 2013. Texas follows a few days later, taking neighboring states with it and re-forming the Republic of Texas. Other factions form in the following months, and by 2014, all hopes for a peaceful resolution are gone, and the Second American Civil War begins. *Countries in Jericho :*Allied States of America: A country in the television series Jericho that forms after nuclear weapons are detonated in many of the United States' major cities. Its capital is Cheyenne, Wyoming, and it controls all of the states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of Texas. :*Republic of Texas: A country that was formerly the state of Texas and has the same borders. Its capital is San Antonio because Dallas and Houston were destroyed. :*United States of America: A country in the television series Jericho.

The name Panem comes from the Latin word for bread. Panem consists of a Capitol city located in the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by thirteen outlying Districts. The government is a totalitarian dictatorship similar to ancient Rome, a police state in which the Districts are subservient to the Capitol, expected to provide economic goods in exchange for protection provided by \\"Peacekeepers\\". * The comic book Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew took place in the \\"United Species of America\\" on the parallel world of Earth-C; the comic featured several analogs of real US states, including: ** Taxes, nicknamed \\"the Lone Stork State\\"; an analogue of Texas. Taxes was the home of supervillain Armordillo, as well as the cities of \\"Hogston\\" and \\"San Antoadio.\\" ** Kornsas, in the midwest; an analogue of Kansas. ** Califurnia, on the western coast of the U.S.; an analogue of California. This state featured the cities \\"Saint Bernardino,\\" \\"Beaverly Hills,\\" \\"Follywood,\\" and \\"Los Antelopes.\\" The Zoo Crew's headquarters was located in Follywood; the city was also the home of team members Yankee Poodle and Rubberduck. * The episode of the animated series Futurama entitled \\"Bendin' in the Wind\\" showed some maps of the US in the year 3000. Many states were humorously respelled (such as \\"eHIO\\" for Ohio). The map also showed two new states: Pennsylvania being divided into the Penn Republic and Sylvania, parodying the breakup of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Other humorous states, such as \\"East West Virginia,\\" are included. Most of the series takes place in New New York, which the episode \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\" confirms is the name of both the state and city. * The animated series The Flintstones presented a few \\"prehistoric\\" versions of modern-day states, including: ** Texarock: A prehistoric version of Texas (though the name \\"Texas\\" was also used interchangeably). ** Arkanstone: A prehistoric version of Arkansas; the former home of various hillbilly ancestors of Fred Flintstone, as well as their rivals, the Hatrock family. Bears a (probably coincidental) similarity to the name of the Arkenstone. ** New Rock: A prehistoric version of New York. * The Grand Theft Auto video game franchise has featured a number of fictional states: ** Alderney, a parallel of New Jersey, neighboring Liberty City. It contains the city New Guernsey. ** Liberty City (also known as Liberty City State), based on New York and appears in Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto IV, albeit in different universes (GTA III era and GTA IV era). ** San Andreas has similarities to California, Arizona and Nevada: Los Santos and San Fierro are based on Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively, while Las Venturas is a version of Las Vegas. The name is derived from the San Andreas Fault. * The video game Red Dead Redemption features two fictional U.S. states and one fictional Mexican state: ** West Elizabeth: a Plains state, based mostly on Colorado. It contains the city of Blackwater. ** New Austin: a Southwestern state, portrayed as a rough combination of Texas and Nevada with areas resembling the Southeast and the Northeast. It contains the cities of Thieves' Landing and Armadillo and borders the fictional Mexican state of Nuevo Paraiso, which itself contains the cities of Chuparosa and Escalera. * In Orson Scott Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series, the United States exists as a much smaller nation, between the area of New England and the Crown Colonies which extend from roughly Virginia south to Georgia. The nation has a significantly higher Iroquois and Dutch influence than in the real world. Member states include: ** Irrakwa ** New Holland ** New Orange ** New Sweden ** Pennsylvania ** Suskwahenny * Barry Shils' 1991 film Motorama contains a number of fictional states, which appear to be in the southwestern US. Three of these (Mercer, Bergen, and Essex) are counties in New Jersey. In order of appearance, they are: ** Mercer (nickname: The Frontier State) ** South Lydon (nickname: The Lonesome State) ** Tristana (nickname: The Green State) ** Bergen (nickname: The Long State) ** Vetner (no nickname given) ** Essex (nickname: The Last State) * State Nº51. In John Katzenbach's novel \\"Games of Wits\\", this state is ruled by a dictatorship. This state is described as square in shape and includes the territory of several other states, including: **Nevada **Utah **Oregon **Idaho **California.

His best known work is derived from interpretations of the music from Spaghetti Westerns, especially his cover version of Ennio Morricone's main theme from the 1966 film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. He composed the musical score for the 1969 Western Charro! which starred Elvis Presley. Biography Montenegro was born in New York City in 1925. He served in the U.S. Navy for two years, mostly as an arranger for the Newport Naval Base band in Newport, Rhode Island. After the war he attended Manhattan College while studying composition and leading his own band for school dances. Newport Navy Band director Frank Rodowicz (left) and Hugo Montenegro at Newport Naval Station, 1944 In the middle 1950s, he was directing, conducting, and arranging the orchestra for Eliot Glen and Irving Spice on their Dragon and Caprice labels. It was he who was directing the Glen-Spice Orchestra on Dion DiMucci's first release when Dion was backed by Dragon recording artists, the Timberlanes. Released on Mohawk #105 in 1957, the songs were \\"Out In Colorado\\" and \\"The Chosen Few\\", which were soon issued on the Jubilee label for better distribution. He was later hired by Time Records as a musical director producing a series of albums for the label, and moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s where he began working for RCA Victor, producing a series of albums and soundtracks for motion pictures and television themes, such as two volumes of Music From The Man From U.N.C.L.E., an album of cover versions of spy music themes Come Spy With Me and an album of cover versions of Ennio Morricone's music for the Clint Eastwood The Man With No Name series of spaghetti Westerns that led to major chart hits. Montenegro began scoring motion pictures with the instrumental music from Advance to the Rear in 1964. Following the success of his albums, he was contracted by Columbia Pictures where he scored such films as Hurry Sundown (1967), Lady in Cement (1968), The Undefeated (1969), Viva Max! (1969) and the Matt Helm films The Ambushers (1967) and The Wrecking Crew (1968). He composed the musical score and conducted the recording sessions for the 1969 Elvis Presley Western film Charro! (1969), and he provided some incidental music for the cult 1970 British film Toomorrow. His last film scores were for the exploitation film Too Hot to Handle and the cult action thriller The Farmer, in 1977. The Farmer (1977) with Montenegro's chilling electronic music score earned an X rating until producer/director David Berlatsky had the review board review the film again without the music score and the rating was changed from X to R, which allowed Columbia pictures to distribute the film for 17 years. The music rights in order to release a DVD sale could not be obtained as the estate could not be found, the score is considered \\"lost\\". Montenegro was also contracted to Columbia's television production company Screen Gems where he is most famous for his theme from the second season of the television series I Dream of Jeannie, his theme song \\"Seattle\\" and music from Here Come the Brides and The Outcasts. He also composed the music for the long running The Partridge Family, (1970). During the mid‑1960s he started producing some of the most renowned works from the space age pop era, featuring electronics and rock in albums such as Moog Power and Mammy Blue. Montenegro's electronic works were decisive and influential for the future generations of electronic musicians, giving a retro/futuristic edge by the use of the Moog synthesizer, and helped to push its popularity. He will be also remembered by his versions of classics such as the main theme to Sergio Leone's film The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, originally composed by Ennio Morricone. This was Montenegro's biggest pop hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart,Whitburn, Joel (2004) The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 435. #3 in the Canadian RPM Magazine charts, and spending four weeks atop the UK Singles ChartUK Singles Chart info OfficialCharts.com.

In 1968, his hit \\"Aces High\\" placed at #11 on the Billboard Year End Chart of the Top Hits of 1968. In the late 1970s severe emphysema forced an end to his musical career, and he died of the disease in 1981. He is buried at Welwood Murray Cemetery in Palm Springs, California.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1941, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken. Griffiths was born in Walsall, Staffordshire, England, the son of William Houghton Griffiths and Alice Griffiths. His father was a manufacturer, working in the production of iron and electrical fixtures. The younger Griffiths was educated at South Wales College, and came to Canada in 1903. In 1906, he married Florence Coles. He worked as a farmer, and served as director of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) in Marquette in 1918-19. When the UFM entered politics in the 1922 provincial election, Griffiths stood as a candidate and was elected for Russell, defeating Liberal incumbent William W.W. Wilson by 396 votes. After this election, the UFM formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Griffiths initially served as a government backbencher, and was returned by 291 votes in the 1927 election. Prior to the 1932 election, the Progressive and Liberal parties formed an alliance to prevent the Conservatives from winning. Government members became known as \\"Liberal- Progressives\\" after this time. Griffiths was re-elected with a much increased majority, and was appointed to cabinet on May 28, 1935 as Minister of Health and Public Welfare. Narrowly returned over an Independent Labour Party candidate in the 1936 provincial election, Griffiths continued to serve in cabinet until the creation of an all-party coalition government in 1940. He resigned from cabinet on November 4, 1940, and did not seek re-election in 1941. He died in Winnipeg at the age of 88.

Silicon is more electropositive than carbon. Silicides are structurally closer to borides than to carbides. Similar to borides and carbides, the composition of silicides cannot be easily specified as covalent molecules. The chemical bonds in silicides range from conductive metal-like structures to covalent or ionic. Silicides of all non-transition metals, with exception of beryllium, have been described.  Overview  Silicon atoms in silicides can have many possible organizations: *Isolated silicon atoms: electrically conductive Cu5Si, (V,Cr,Mn)3Si, Fe3Si, Mn3Si, and nonconductive (Mg,Ge,Sn,Pb)2Si, (Ca,Ru,Ce,Rh,Ir,Ni)2Si *Si2 pairs: 3Si2, and silicides *Si4 tetrahedra: Si, Si, Si *Sin chains: USi, (Ti, Zr, Hf, Th, Ce, Pu)Si, CaSi, SrSi, YSi *Planar hexagonal graphite-like Si layers: β-USi2, silicides of other lanthanoids and actinoids *Corrugated hexagonal Si layers: CaSi2 *Open three-dimensional Si skeletons: SrSi2, ThSi2, α-USi2 A silicide prepared by a self-aligned process is called a salicide. This is a process in which silicide contacts are formed only in those areas in which deposited metal (which after annealing becomes a metal component of the silicide) is in direct contact with silicon, hence, the process is self-aligned. It is commonly implemented in MOS/CMOS processes for ohmic contacts of the source, drain, and poly-Si gate.. = Alkali and alkaline earth metals = Group 1 and 2 silicides e.g. Na2Si and Ca2Si react with water, yielding hydrogen and/or silanes. When magnesium silicide is placed into hydrochloric acid, HCl(aq), the gas silane, SiH4, is produced. This gas is the silicon analogue of methane, CH4, but is more reactive. Silane is pyrophoric, that is, due to the presence of oxygen, it spontaneously combusts in air: :Mg2Si(s) + 4HCl(aq) → SiH4(g) + 2MgCl2(s) :SiH4 \\\\+ 2O2 → SiO2 \\\\+ 2H2O These reactions are typical of a Group 2 silicide. Mg2Si reacts similarly with sulfuric acid. Group 1 silicides are even more reactive. For example, sodium silicide, Na2Si, reacts rapidly with water to yield sodium silicate, Na2SiO3, and hydrogen gas. Rubidium silicide is pyrophoric, igniting in contact with air. = Transition metals = The transition metal silicides are, in contrast, usually inert to aqueous solutions of everything with exception of hydrofluoric acid; however, they react with more aggressive agents, e.g. melted potassium hydroxide, or fluorine and chlorine when red-hot. = Other elements = Mercury, thallium, bismuth, and lead are immiscible with liquid silicon.  List  *Nickel silicide, NiSi *Sodium silicide, Na2Si *Magnesium silicide, Mg2Si *Platinum silicide, PtSi (platinum is actually more electronegative than silicon) *Titanium silicide, TiSi2 *Tungsten silicide, WSi2 *Molybdenum disilicide, MoSi2 See also * Binary compounds of silicon References External links Category:Anions ","title":"Silicide"},{"id":"2182958","text":"Marian Teodor Ludwik Gieszczykiewicz (born May 21, 1889 in Kraków, Austria- Hungary - July 30, 1942 in Auschwitz) was a Polish physician, bacteriologist.

Ron Hubbard in 1950, around when he developed Scientology Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard included space opera narratives in his writings, wherein thetans (the name given to human souls) were reincarnated periodically over quadrillions of years, retaining memories of prior lives, to which Hubbard attributed complex narratives about life throughout the universe. The most controversial of these myths is the story of Xenu, to whom Hubbard attributed responsibility for many of the world's problems. Some space opera doctrines of Scientology are only provided by the church to experienced members, who church leaders maintain are the only ones able to correctly understand them. Several former members of the church have exposed these secret documents, leading to lengthy court battles with the church, which failed to keep the secret. Critics of the church have noted that some of the narratives are scientifically impossible, and have thus assailed the church as untrustworthy for teaching them. The space opera teachings have also been satirized in popular culture. Scholars of religion have described the space opera narratives as a creation myth designed to encourage reverence of Hubbard as a supreme messenger. Several academics have drawn attention to the similarity of the space opera myths to themes of the 1950s Cold War culture in which they were constructed.  Origins  A Scientology e meter, a device for displaying and/or recording the electrodermal activity (EDA) of a human being. The device is used frequently for auditing in Scientology.America's Alternative Religions, by Timothy Miller, 1995, ;page 386 (Although this article regularly refers to Xenu, Hubbard in many of his lectures and writings actually uses the name Xemu). L. Ron Hubbard created a form of therapy known as Dianetics, which he promoted as a scientific, not religious, teaching. Until the early 1950s, he had a negative view of organized religions, but thereafter discussed spiritual topics. In these teachings, he identified subconscious memories of past events, which he called \\"engrams\\", as causes of human dissatisfaction. By 1950, he had begun to ponder past lives, believing that they could be recalled; he attempted to use these recollections to develop a comprehensive narrative of the universe. He founded the Church of Scientology in 1953, advancing his beliefs as religious doctrines. The church was distinct from Dianetics-based groups but incorporated some of their views. Hubbard saw Dianetics as focused on the physical body but viewed Scientology as a way to address spiritual matters. In Hubbard's efforts to shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he introduced the concept of thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought. In the 1950s, as Hubbard's followers recalled their past lives, he recorded many details of these recollections. With this as his source, he constructed an intricate history of the universe, identified as \\"space opera\\". Although Hubbard believed that he had developed a comprehensive history, Urban cites the isolated and incomplete record of the statements, wherein Hubbard identified a thetan universe, separate from the material universe, created by its inhabitants. The material universe, in Hubbard's view, began when other universes created by thetans collided, from which they entered the material universe in six invasion groups roughly 60 trillion years ago. Hubbard also described a series of events, called the \\"incidents\\", that divorced the thetans from their self-knowledge, but maintained that thetans could regain their former divinity, and referred to thetans that freed themselves from the material world as \\"operating thetans\\".  Narratives and civilizations  Imagination August 1956 depicting a space opera story. Hubbard located his first 'incident' four quadrillion years ago, in which a thetan encountered 'loud cracks and brightness' and then observed a cherub and chariot before experiencing total darkness. In Scientology, this is known as \\"Incident 1\\". Another important event in Scientology's chronology of the universe occurred on a space city known as Arslycus, the inhabitants of whom brought about an incident when capturing thetans. The most controversial portion of Scientology's space opera is the myth of Xenu, known as \\"Incident 2\\", in which Hubbard described a group of 76 planets, orbiting stars visible from Earth, organized in a Galactic Confederacy c. 75 million years ago, ruled by the dictator Xenu. The confederacy having become overpopulated, Xenu sent several billion of his citizens onto DC 8 planes to the planet Teegeeack (Earth), ostensibly for tax audition. There, hydrogen bombs were detonated inside volcanoes, killing the exiles, whose thetans were brainwashed on Hawaii and the Canary Islands, introducing various myths, such as the myth of Jesus, to conceal the thetans' origins. Eventually, officers of the Galactic Confederacy launched a rebellion against Xenu, which continued for six years before capturing him and placing him in an electrified prison in the center of a mountain. Hubbard taught that the thetans brainwashed by Xenu's forces remained on Earth, where the \\"body thetans\\", attached to human psyches, contribute to human problems; and that individuals could be freed from these brainwashed thetans and thus attain a type of salvation. Hubbard also taught that, upon the deaths of humans, thetans continued to \\"implant stations\\", including locations on planets near Earth, where their memories were erased and new memories emplaced. On grounds that some \\"implant stations\\" were better than others, Hubbard advised his followers to avoid the one on Venus. After passing an implant station, he taught, the thetan returned to Earth, where it was incarnated. Hubbard taught the Christian concept of heaven was based on a physical location on another planet, which he claimed to have visited. He compared its appearance to Busch Gardens in Pasadena, California, (actual location Van Nuys, California), and noted it contained effigies of characters from the New Testament. Over time, he recalled, the location fell into disrepair. A town nearby contained an implant station, at which thetans were convinced to return there. Another significant encounter in Hubbard's narrative occurred when a large group of planets formed the Marcab Confederacy, described as in search of slaves, and called a \\"decadent\\" society. The author related that this civilization caused a significant implant upon their encounter with thetans. Hubbard discussed the history of human civilizations on Earth, and the lives of ancient sea monsters and fish people, as well. He also said humans could recover memories of previous lives, such as the experiences of clams and Neanderthals. In his mythos, Atlantis was a completely electronic civilization, whose inhabitants possessed disintegration technology; in contrast, Earth was invaded by multiple groups around 1200 BCE, including the \\"fifth invader force from Martian Command\\" against the \\"fourth invasion force from Space Command\\" in battle. On premise that thetans are forced to believe various faulty ideas, the church teaches that their courses allow \\"theta beings\\" to be freed from these beliefs and regain their former abilities. Committed Scientologists pursue courses and procedures offered by the church in the hope of gaining freedom and enlightenment, allegedly permitting travel around the solar system. The author referred to the process of a thetan leaving its human body as \\"exteriorization\\", which he said allowed for space travel. Urban notes that this is similar to Aleister Crowley's teachings of astral projection, although he adds that Hubbard did not use that term.  Space opera and Scientologists  Mike Rinder, a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely \\"a small percent\\" of Scientology's teachings. A glossary on the Scientology website defined the term \\"space opera\\" as a description of actual events: > \\"Space opera has space travel, spaceships, spacemen, intergalactic travel, > wars, conflicts, other beings, civilizations and societies, and other > planets and galaxies. It is not fiction and concerns actual incidents.\\" The Scientology publication Have You Lived Before This Life contains some space opera, describing past lives—including some on warlike planets—which were recalled through auditing. In the 1960s, Hubbard introduced a series of questions, known as \\"security checks\\", to verify members' loyalty. Mikael Rothstein, associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen, sees the Xenu myth as building off of, and the culmination of, these accounts. The Xenu myth was released to Scientologists in the late 1960s, after teachings about thetans and their relationship to the physical body had been disseminated; its release provided the cause and origin of many of the group's teachings. Rothstein describes \\"space opera\\" as \\"Hubbard's introduction of a new reality, and new foundation for everything\\". Although Hubbard spoke openly about space opera in the 1950s, Scientology eventually became an esoteric faith: some teachings are withheld until followers reach a certain point in their spiritual development, and the mythological foundation of the courses are unknown to many members. Over a decade of auditing and study—and donations of tens of thousands of dollars—are required for a member to reach the highest echelons of hidden knowledge. Followers below a certain level (OT III) of growth are denied access to the church's cosmological teachings, and they are given different explanations for the church's teachings. German scholar Gerald Willms notes that in addition to the esoteric foundations, Scientology cites practical justifications for its rituals, so they can be pursued without knowledge of advanced teachings. The Church of Scientology has attempted to prevent the public release of their esoteric teachings, but, through the internet, their confidential aspects have been widely released. The church considers public discussion of their space opera teachings offensive and has asked academics not to publish their details. Scientologists maintain that the true meaning of these texts is only accessible to those who have progressed through their courses, and that those who read them prematurely risk damage to their spiritual and physical conditions. Church leaders have sometimes outright refused to discuss the subject with journalists. Rothstein observes that the church also has a strong financial motivation to keep members from accessing higher level courses, as devotees are required to make large payments to obtain them. Free Zone Scientologists, however, are sometimes more open about space opera. Some Free Zone Scientologists believe that the Church of Scientology has been hijacked by undercover agents of the Marcabian Confederacy. During auditing, Scientology members sometimes recall details of life in space. Rothstein states that this is part of a \\"mythological paradigm\\" that members initially partake of through Scientology's scriptures. He notes, however, that some Scientologists do not believe that there are space opera myths in the group's teachings, and that others have left the group after learning about the higher-level doctrines. Reitman relates that some members accept the space opera teachings by seeing them as similar to seemingly implausible stories of popular religions or simply remain quiet about their doubts. Rothstein states that space opera is a \\"part of the total fabric of Scientological thinking and narrative, but not of prime importance.\\" He argues that these teachings are a \\"second order belief\\", in that they exist to support the group's core teachings about thetans. Mike Rinder, a former spokesman of the Church of Scientology, stated that extraterrestrial auditing is merely \\"a small percent\\" of their canon.  Criticism and leaking  Karin Spaink, a Dutch journalist who helped publicize confidential Scientology doctrines Scientology's space opera teachings were publicized in accounts given by former church members, most notably during court cases. One such case was filed by a former Scientologist, Larry Wollersheim, against the church in 1980. Five years later, Wollersheim offered confidential Scientology materials, including space opera teachings, to the court as evidence, a move that was vigorously protested by the church's attorneys. They were unable to prevent disclosure, however, and the documents were published by the Los Angeles Times in November 1985. This was the first time that some aspects of Scientology's space opera teachings were offered as public evidence about the church. In the mid-1990s, Wollersheim published some of the materials on a website, prompting the church to sue his organization, FACTNet. The Church attested that the space opera narratives were trade secrets; this claim was rejected by the court. In 1990, after being sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, a former member turned critic, offered a large amount of the group's highly confidential teachings in court. The documents, contained in what is known as the Fishman Affidavit, included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet. Former Scientologists and members of the anti-cult movement often discuss Scientology's space opera teachings. They generally take a rationalistic approach to the narratives and see them as absurd, or even as drug-fueled delusions, using them as a source of humor. The doctrines have been satirized in popular culture, most notably in the South Park episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". The anti-Scientology website Operation Clambake prominently uses space opera doctrines in their criticisms of the church, casting the implausibility of the stories as a clear reason to reject the group. Anti-cult critics of Scientology argue that the content of these teachings demonstrates that Scientology misleads its followers; many aspects of the narratives, such as the age of the volcanoes that Xenu is said to have used, contradict scientific consensus. The space opera teachings are, in fact, incompatible with scientific consensus on the age of the universe: around 14 billion years. Rothstein notes that scholars of religion usually do not pursue this line of analysis because all myths contain unscientific content; he notes that cultural conditioning determines whether religious narratives appear reasonable.  Analysis  Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. Rothstein argues that in the construction of the space opera narratives, Hubbard drew from tropes common to his audience. The concept of a Galactic Confederation, Rothstein observes, was present in other UFO religions of the 1950s; * In contrast to the overpopulation and atomic bombs were often discussed therein. Urban cites UFO encounters and alien invasions as popular themes during the Cold War; * Rothstein draws parallels between Hubbard's teachings and the beliefs of UFO religions, citing similarities between thetans trapped in human bodies and the walk-in hypothesis of the Ashtar Command. Andreas Grünschloß notes Scientology's space opera teachings place them in the tradition of the ancient astronaut hypothesis; he states the group's teachings about thetans bears similarities to \\"star seeds\\" found in UFO religions. Grünschloß speculates the UFO-contact narratives may have played a role in the group's development of space opera, specifically citing the resemblance of Hubbard's description of life in Xenu's time to statements by George Adamski, a UFO contactee of the 1950s. Rothstein notes the group's teachings about extraterrestrials varies greatly from most of the UFO movement, particularly in Hubbard's descriptions of demonic characters. Hubbard was a science fiction writer before starting Scientology, and some aspects of the church's space opera bear similarities to his previous writings. Noting similarities between Hubbard's fiction writing and creation of religious myths, Rothstein argues; \\"perhaps no division between such categories should be made\\". Kent posits some of his cosmology, such as the priests and psychiatrists loyal to Xenu, were modeled after events in Hubbard's life, such as his distaste for Christianity and clashes with the psychiatric establishment. Hubbard theorized science fiction writers sometimes recalled portions of events from past lives and incorporated it into their works, and Urban writes Hubbard's science fiction writings \\"contain more than a few seeds of Hubbard's religious movement, the Church of Scientology\\". Rothstein argues Scientology's space opera identify Xenu as the root of evil and Hubbard as the hero, for having uncovered the mysteries of the universe. Rothstein states the group's teachings about \\"salvation\\" may be a means to encourage reverence of Hubbard. In addition, Rothstein notes the space opera teachings also provide fundamental justifications for some practical aspects of Scientology, including the rejection of psychiatry and the formation of the Sea Org. He sees space opera as similar to most types of mythology, involving superhuman beings in the far distant past. Willms states the mythology of Scientology differs from many other religions because it focuses on material beings; but argues the Xenu myth is a religious narrative, although the Church of Scientology has never used this claim in their efforts to be recognized as a religion.

It is the oldest seaside spa in continental Europe. Heiligendamm is part of the town Bad Doberan in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and historically belongs to Mecklenburg. The cluster of resort architecture mansions and spa buildings at the seafront are reminders of the glory days when this part of the Baltic Sea was one of the playgrounds of Europe's aristocracy.Bradley, Kimberly. \\"A Spa Town Reclaims Its Glory,\\" New York Times. June 3, 2007. Due to the classicist white buildings lining the beach promenade, the town is also known as the \\"White Pearl\\" () or the \\"White Town by the Sea\\" (). Today, the area by the sea is occupied by a five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm. A narrow-gauge steam railway, known as the \\"Molli\\", links Heiligendamm with Kühlungsborn and Bad Doberan. History Established in 1793, Heiligendamm is the oldest seaside resort in continental Europe. Panorama of Heiligendamm, 1887 Heiligendamm was developed as an elegant meeting place for the nobility and high society. Among its most prominent guests were the German Emperors. Its founder and first guest in 1793 was the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg Friedrich Franz I; he made the resort fashionable. Between 1793 and 1870, Johann Christoph, Heinrich von Seydwitz, Carl Theodor Severin, and Gustav Adolph Demmler created a veritable Gesamtkunstwerk for bathing and lodging. Heiligendamm was always regarded as the most elegant seaside resort in Germany. Nobility from throughout Europe used it as a summer getaway well into the 20th century. After the Second World War, the buildings of Heiligendamm were used as sanatoria and recovery ward. When Mecklenburg became part of the communist GDR, some of Heiligendamm's famous buildings were demolished and replaced by more utilitarian structures. After the German reunification in 1989/1990, a group of investors bought most of the buildings and undertook a major programme of refurbishment. Grand Hotel A new company, the Kempinski Grand Hotel, opened in spring of 2003 - it used six historical buildings including the historical Kurhaus at the beach of Heiligendamm. The development has led to some conflict with residents, as main streets and cycle paths have been removed or rerouted. Also again a famous building of the ensemble was demolished. The mansion next to the Grand Hotel was reconstructed until 2011, though. Renovations of other mansions are undergoing or planned. On July 13, 2006, United States President George W. Bush stayed at Heiligendamm while on a state visit to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Stralsund. On June 6 to 8, 2007, Heiligendamm's Grand Hotel hosted the 33rd summit of G8 leaders. During this time, thousands of anticapitalist activists from around the world blocked the roads to Heiligendamm and an estimated 25,000 anti-globalization protesters demonstrated in nearby Rostock.\\"An Orgy of Violence as G8 Approaches; German City Rocked by Violent Riots,\\" Der Spiegel. June 2, 2007. In July 2013, the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm was bought by Hannover-based accountant Paul Morzynski, who intends to carefully extend and reorganize the hotel.Luxury hotel bought by accountant (Der Spiegel, German)  Sights  Protestant forest church of 1904 The resort architecture near the beaches of Heiligendamm, consisting of classicist and historicist mansions and spa buildings, is part of a unique heritage, as the first such buildings of the European continent can be seen here. The area of the Grand Hotel is partly accessible to visitors, but should be experienced respectfully to not disturb the hotel guests. The narrow gauge railway known as Bäderbahn Molli (\\"Molli Resort Railway\\") runs through Heiligendamm from Kühlungsborn to Bad Doberan. The line between Bad Doberan and Heiligendamm was built in 1886. The Protestant Forest Church (Evangelische Waldkirche) was renovated after die Wende, the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart (Herz-Jesu-Kapelle) is close by. Heiligendamm also has a 200-metre-long pier into the Baltic Sea that allows great views of the White Pearl Mansions at the beach.Ostsee-Zeitung: Seebrücke in Heiligendamm wieder begehbar Images Image:Heiligendamm_Gedenkstein.jpgFoundation memorial stone Image:Kurhaus, Heiligendamm.jpgThe Kurhaus, earliest example of resort architecture, part of the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm Image:Heiligendamm Beach Villas Panorama 2.jpgBeach villas at Heiligendamm, the so-called Perlenkette.

Canvases may be shaped by altering their outline, while retaining their flatness. An ancient, traditional example is the tondo, a painting on a round panel or canvas: Raphael, as well as some other Renaissance painters, sometimes chose this format for madonna paintings.Arthistory.about.com page on Raphael's \\"de Brécy\\" tondo canvas painting Alternatively, canvases may be altered by losing their flatness and assuming a three-dimensional surface. Or, they can do both. That is, they can assume shapes other than rectangles, and also have surface features that are three-dimensional. Arguably, changing the surface configuration of the painting transforms it into a sculpture. But shaped canvases are generally considered paintings. Apart from any aesthetic considerations, there are technical matters, having to do with the very nature of canvas as a material, that tend to support the flat rectangle as the norm for paintings on canvas. (See Departing from the rectangular below.) In the literature of art history and criticism, the term shaped canvas is particularly associated with certain works created mostly in New York after about 1960, during a period when a great variety and quantity of such works were produced. According to the commentary at a Rutgers University exhibition site, \\"... the first significant art historical attention paid to shaped canvases occurred in the 1960s....\\"Image of a 1935 Abraham Joel Tobias shaped-canvas painting at the Zimmerli Art Museum (Rutgers University)  Pioneers of modern shaped-canvas painting  Peter Laszlo Peri created polychromatic “cut-out” paintings as part of the Constructivist movement between 1921 and 1924. These works which anticipate “shaped canvas” created after 1945 were exhibited widely in the 1920s, notably in two joint exhibitions with Laszlo Moholy-Nagy at Der Sturm Gallery, Berlin, 1922 and 1923, and at the International Exhibition of Modern Art assembled by Societe Anonyme Brooklyn Museum, New York, 1926. https://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/peinture/Peri/153800 https://www.moma.org/collection/works/35125 Abraham Joel Tobias made \\"shaped canvases\\" in the 1930s.Wechsler, Jeffrey; Abraham Joel Tobias; Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum.; Queens Museum.

The untitled work was shown in 1957 at the Brata Gallery...\\" Between the late 1950s through the mid-1960s Jasper Johns experimented with shaped and compartmentalized canvases, notably with his 'Three Flags' painting – one canvas placed on top of another, larger canvas. Robert Rauschenberg's experimental assemblages and \\"combines\\" of the 1950s also explored variations of divided and shaped canvas. Argentine artist Lucio Fontana also began early on the experiment in shaped and compartmentalized canvases with his Concetto Spaziale, Attese series in 1959. Assigning a date to the origin of the postwar shaped canvas painting may not be possible, but certainly it had emerged by the late 1950s.  Postwar modern art and the shaped canvas  Frances Colpitt (\\"The Shape of Painting in the 1960s\\"; Art Journal, Spring 1991) states flatly that \\"the shaped canvas was the dominant form of abstract painting in the 1960s\\". She writes that the shaped canvas, \\"although frequently described as a hybrid of painting and sculpture, grew out of the issues of abstract painting and was evidence of the desire of painters to move into real space by rejecting behind-the-frame illusionism.\\" .The Shape of Paintings in the 1960s Retrieved June 23, 2010 Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Charles Hinman Ronald Davis, Richard Tuttle, Leo Valledor, Neil Williams, John Levee, David Novros, Robert Mangold, Gary Stephan, Paul Mogenson, Clark Murray, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Geometric abstract artists, minimalists, and hard-edge painters may, for example, elect to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. There is a connection here with post- painterly abstraction, which reacts against the abstract expressionists' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as their solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. While the shaped canvas first challenged the formalized rectangular shape of paintings, it soon questioned the constraints of two-dimensionality. According to Donald Judd in his Complete Writings: 'The main thing wrong with painting is that it is a rectangular plane placed flat against the wall. A rectangle is a shape itself: it is obviously the whole shape; it determines and limits the arrangement of whatever is on or in it\\". In 1964, the Solomun R. Guggenheim Museum organised the definitive exhibition 'The Shaped Canvas\\" curated by Lawrence Alloway. Lucy Lippard noted that this show focused exclusively on paintings with a \\"one -sided continuous surface\\" In 1965, Frank Stella and Frank Geldzahler confronted this definition of the shaped canvas by introducing three-dimensional shaped canvases by artists Charles Hinman and Will Insley in their seminal group show \\"Shape and Structure\\" at Tibor de Naguy in New York.Ibid, Meyer The invasion of the third dimension by paintings was an important development of the shaped canvas as it questioned the frontier between painting and sculpture. The apertured, superimposed, multiple canvases of Jane Frank in the 1960s and 1970s are a special case: while generally flat and rectangular, they are rendered sculptural by the presence of large, irregularly shaped holes in the forward canvas or canvases, through which one or more additional painted canvases can be seen. A student of Hans Hofmann, and sharing his concern for pictorial depth as well as his reverence for nature, she also favors colors, textures, and shapes that are complex, nuanced, and organic or earthen – giving her work a brooding or introspective quality that further sets it apart from that of many other shaped-canvas painters. In the late 1960s, Trevor Bell, a leading member of the British St. Ives group introduced dynamic shaped-canvas paintings that combined radical, angular structures with an abstract expressionist sensibility. These works continued to evolve into the 1970s as Bell's works were exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC and The Tate Gallery in London. The artist’s highly chromatic, color field surfaces on massive canvases merged shaped painting and the subsequent blank space surrounding the object into a state of equal importance. The Italian artist Luigi MaliceBarbera, Lucio, Luigi Malice: Percorsi della memoria 1959–1999, Roma: Gangemi Editore, 1999 also experimented with shaped canvases in the late 1960s. Pop artists such as Tom Wesselmann, Jim Dine, and James Rosenquist also took up the shaped canvas medium. Robin Landa writes that \\"Wesselmann uses the shape of the container [by which Landa means the canvas] to express the organic quality of smoke\\" in his \\"smoker\\" paintings.Landa, Robin. An Introduction to Design, Inglewood: Prentis Hall, 1983 According to Colpitt, however, the use of the shaped canvas by 1960s pop artists was considered at the time to be something other than shaped canvas painting properly speaking: \\"At the same time, not all reliefs qualified as shaped canvases, which, as an ideological pursuit in the sixties, tended to exclude Pop art.\\" (op. cit., p. 52)  More recent shaped canvas art  Among shaped-canvas artists of more recent generations, Elizabeth Murray (1940–2007) produced playfully \\"exploding\\" canvases, in which exuberance of shape and color seems to force itself outside the normative rectangle – or, as a 1981 New York Times review put it: \\"...the inner shapes blast off from their moorings and cause the whole painting to fly apart.\\" NY Times review: \\"Art: Exploding Canvases of Elizabeth Murray\\", May 8, 1981. Singapore's Anthony Poon (1945–2006) continued the tradition of cool, abstract, minimalist geometry associated with the shaped canvas in the 1960s. The analytical poise and undulating repetitions in his work somewhat recall the work of modular constructivist sculptors such as Erwin Hauer and Norman Carlberg. The Filipino artist Pacita Abad (1946–2004) stuffed and stitched her painted canvases for a three-dimensional effect, combining this technique (which she called trapunto, after a kind of quilting technique) with free- wheeling mixed media effects, riotous color, and abstract patterning suggestive of festive homemade textiles, or of party trappings such as streamers, balloons, or confetti. The total effect is joyously extrovert and warm – quite opposed to both the minimalist and pop art versions of \\"cool\\". In reference to the shaped paintings of Jack Reilly (born 1950), Robin Landa emphasizes the power of the shaped canvas to create a sensation of movement: \\"Many contemporary artists feel that the arena of painting can be greatly extended by the use of shaped canvases. Movement is established in the container (canvas) itself as well as in the internal space of the container.\\" A 1981 review in Artweek stated \\"These intricately constructed pieces are related to wall sculpture, bridging the gap between painting and sculpture, they have an illusionary sculptural presence.\\"Jaconson, Linda. Two Dimensional Reliefs, Artweek, Vol.12, Nov 21, 1981 An additional function of the shaped canvas in Reilly's earlier work was to emphasize the ambiguity of pictorial space in abstract art. The Argentine artist Ladislao Pablo Győri (born 1963) became interested in non-representative and rigorous geometry formulations in the 1990s.lpgyori.net Győri's digital works, art and poetry, 1984/2003, Madí Paintings-Relief The study of the paintings of the aforementioned Rhod Rothfuss led him to work in the realization of Madí Turning Paintings-Relief (irregular frame) and 3D digital animations of those geometric structures. Gyula Kosice (sculptor, poet, theorist, and one of the founders of the Argentine avant-garde of the 1940s) wrote: \\"He has rationally computerized the primordial ideas of Madi Art... I am convinced that his works radiate an undeniable quality and originality.\\"Győri, Ladislao Pablo. First 25 Visual Years, ARTgentina, 2010, p. 29,  Non-rectangular paintings Artists have often departed from the norm, especially in circumstances requiring special commissions, an example being the paintings Henri Matisse created for Albert C. BarnesBarnes mural . Accessed August 7, 2007 and for Nelson Rockefeller. In certain instances shaped canvas paintings can be seen as painting in relationship to sculpture and to wall relief. During the early to mid-1960s many young painters born in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s made the transition from painting flat rectangles to painting shaped canvases; some of those artists decided to make sculpture and some artists like Kenneth Noland, Frank Stella, and Ellsworth Kelly did both. Other materials can be used in place of canvas. More viable materials might obviate some of the drawbacks of shaped canvas.

Biological Cybernetics, 2012, p. 169 Usually the onset of the startle response is a startle reflex reaction. The startle reflex is a brainstem reflectory reaction (reflex) that serves to protect vulnerable parts, such as the back of the neck (whole-body startle) and the eyes (eyeblink) and facilitates escape from sudden stimuli. It is found across the lifespan of many species. A variety of responses may occur because of individual's emotional state, body posture, cited preparation for execution of a motor task, cited or other activities. cited The startle response is implicated in the formation of specific phobias. Startle reflex =Neurophysiology= Layout of the brain A startle reflex can occur in the body through a combination of actions. A reflex from hearing a sudden loud noise will happen in the primary acoustic startle reflex pathway consisting of three main central synapses, or signals that travel through the brain. First, there is a synapse from the auditory nerve fibers in the ear to the cochlear root neurons (CRN). These are the first acoustic neurons of the central nervous system. Studies have shown a direct correlation to the amount of decrease of the startle to the number of CRNs that were killed. Second, there is a synapse from the CRN axons to the cells in the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (PnC) of the brain. These are neurons that are located in the pons of the brainstem. A study done to disrupt this portion of the pathway by the injection of PnC inhibitory chemicals has shown a dramatic decrease in the amount of startle by about 80 to 90 percent. Third, a synapse occurs from the PnC axons to the motor neurons in the facial motor nucleus or the spinal cord that will directly or indirectly control the movement of muscles. The activation of the facial motor nucleus causes a jerk of the head while an activation in the spinal cord causes the whole body to startle.Davis, M. (2007). \\"Neural systems involved in fear and anxiety based on the fear- potentiated startle test.\\" Neurobiology of Learning and Memory (pp. 381–425). Elsevier Incorporated. During neuromotor examinations of newborns, it is noted that, for a number of techniques, the patterns of the startle reaction and the Moro reflex may significantly overlap, the notable distinction being the absence of arm abduction (spreading) during startle responses. =Reflexes= There are many various reflexes that can occur simultaneously during a startle response. The fastest reflex recorded in humans happens within the masseter muscle or jaw muscle. The reflex was measured by electromyography which records the electrical activity during movement of the muscles. This also showed the latency response or the delay between the stimulus and the response recorded was found to be about 14 milliseconds. The blink of the eye which is the reflex of the orbicularis oculi muscle was found to have a latency of about 20 to 40 milliseconds. Out of larger body parts, the head is quickest in a movement latency in a range from 60 to 120 milliseconds. The neck then moves almost simultaneously with a latency of 75 to 121 milliseconds. Next, the shoulder jerks at 100 to 121 milliseconds along with the arms at 125 to 195 milliseconds. Lastly the legs responds with a latency of 145 to 395 milliseconds. This type of cascading response correlates to how the synapses travel from the brain and down the spinal cord to activate each motor neuron.Davis, M. (1984). \\"The mammalian startle response\\". In R. Eaton (Ed.), Neural Mechanisms of Startle Behavior (pp. 287–351).

Biological Cybernetics, 2012, p. 169 The reflex is typically measured by electromyography, brain imaging or sometimes positron electron tomography.Pissiota, Anna. \\"Amygdala and Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activation During Affective Startle Modulation:a PET Study of Fear\\".

Behavioral Neuroscience, 1992, p. 274 There are many brain structures and pathways thought to be involved in the reflex. The amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and anterior cingulate cortex are all thought to play a role in modulating the reflex.Medford, Nick. \\"Conjoint Activity of Anterior Insular and Anterior Cingulate Cortex:Awareness and Response\\".

The Journal of Neuroscience, 1997, p. 6434 The anterior cingulate cortex in the brain is largely thought to be the main area associated with emotional response and awareness, which can contribute to the way an individual reacts to startle inducing stimuli.Medford, Nick. \\"Conjoint Activity of Anterior Insular and Anterior Cingulate Cortex:Awareness and Response\\". Brain Structure and Function, 2010, p. 535 Along with the anterior cingulate cortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus are known to have implications in this reflex.

Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 2010, p. 552 The role of the BNST in the acoustic startle reflex may be attributed to specific areas within the nucleus responsible for stress and anxiety responses.Lee, Younglim. \\"Role of the Hippocampus, the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis, and the Amygdala in the Excitatory Effect of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone on the Acoustic Startle Reflex\\". The Journal of Neuroscience, 1997, p. 6434 Activation of the BNST by certain hormones is thought to promote a startle responseLee, Younglim. \\"Role of the Hippocampus, the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis, and the Amygdala in the Excitatory Effect of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone on the Acoustic Startle Reflex\\". The Journal of Neuroscience, 1997, p. 6434 The auditory pathway for this response was largely elucidated in rats in the 1980s. The basic pathway follows the auditory pathway from the ear up to the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (LLN) from where it activates a motor centre in the reticular formation. This centre sends descending projections to lower motor neurones of the limbs. In slightly more detail this corresponds to ear (cochlea) → cranial nerve VIII (auditory) → cochlear nucleus (ventral/inferior) → LLN → caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC). The whole process has a less than 10ms latency. There is no involvement of the superior/rostral or inferior/caudal colliculus in the reaction that \\"twitches\\" the hindlimbs, but these may be important for adjustment of pinnae and gaze towards the direction of the sound, or for the associated blink. Application in occupational settings In a 2005 study by Martina et al., at the Department of Aviation and Logistics, University of Southern Queensland, the performance of aircraft pilots following unexpected critical events, in relation to recent aircraft accidents, is examined. The deleterious effects of the startle response was identified as causal or contributory in these events. The authors argue that fear resulting from threat (especially if life- threatening cited ) potentiates startle effects and has significant deleterious effects on cognition. This could contribute to poor performance following an unexpected critical event in aviation. They discuss training strategies for improved performance, which would expose pilots to unexpected critical events more often, and develop greater self-efficacy.

Provo, UT: Ancestry.com 2008. Original data: South Carolina death records: South Carolina Department of Archives and History. were American slaves from Macon, Georgia who escaped to the North in December 1848 by traveling openly by train and steamboat, arriving in Philadelphia on Christmas Day. She passed as a white male planter and he as her personal servant. Their daring escape was widely publicized, making them among the most famous of fugitive slaves. Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution. As the light-skinned quadroon daughter of a mulatto slave and her white master, Ellen Craft used her appearance to pass as a white man, dressed in male clothing, during their escape. As prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and raised five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape. In 1860 they published a written account, Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery. One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the American Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in Great Britain and the United States. After their return to the US in 1868, the Crafts opened an agricultural school for freedmen's children in Georgia. They worked at the school and its farm until 1890. Their account was reprinted in the United States in 1999, with both the Crafts credited as authors, and it is available online at Project Gutenberg and the University of Virginia. Early life Ellen Craft was born in 1826 in Clinton, Georgia, to Maria, a mixed-race slave, and her wealthy planter master, Major James Smith. At least three- quarters European by ancestry, Ellen was very fair-skinned and resembled her white half-siblings, who were her master's legitimate children. Smith's wife gave the 11-year-old slave Ellen as a wedding gift to her daughter Eliza Cromwell Smith to get the girl out of the household and remove the evidence of her husband's infidelity. After Eliza Smith married Dr. Robert Collins, she took Ellen with her to live in the city of Macon where they made their home.Barbara McCaskill, \\"Ellen Craft: The Fugitive Who Fled as a Planter\\", Georgia Women: Their Lives and Times, ed. Anne Short Chirhart, Betty Wood, University of Georgia Press, 2009, p. 85, accessed March 9, 2011 Ellen grew up as a house servant to Eliza, which gave her privileged access to information about the area. William was born in Macon, where he met his future wife at the age of 16 when his first master sold him to settle gambling debts. Before he was sold, William witnessed his 14-year-old sister and each of his parents being separated by sales to different owners. William's new master apprenticed him as a carpenter and allowed him to work for fees, taking most of his earnings. Marriage and family At the age of 20, Ellen married William Craft, in whom her master Collins held a half interest. Craft saved money from being hired out in town as a carpenter. Not wanting to rear a family in slavery, during the Christmas season of 1848 the couple planned an escape. Eventually they had five children together, who were mostly born and reared during their nearly two decades living in England. The Crafts went there after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, because, as a prominent fugitive slave couple, they were in danger of being captured in Boston by bounty hunters. Their children were Charles Estlin Phillips (1852–1938), William Ivens (1855–1926), Brougham H. (1857–1920), Ellen A. Craft (1863–1917), and Alfred G. (1871–1939), all born in England. When the Crafts returned to the United States after the American Civil War, three of their children came with them.Barbara McCaskill, \\"William and Ellen Craft\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia, 2010, accessed March 9, 2011 Ellen Craft dressed as a man to escape from slavery. Escape Ellen planned to take advantage of her appearance to pass as white while the pair traveled by train and boat to the North; she dressed as a man since at the time it was not customary for a white woman to travel alone, let alone with a slave. She also faked illness to limit conversation, as she was uneducated. William was to act as her slave and personal servant. During that time period, domestic slaves frequently accompanied their masters during travel, so the Crafts did not expect to be questioned. To their surprise, they were detained, but only temporarily. An officer had demanded proof that William was indeed Ellen's property. They were finally let on the train due to sympathy from passengers and the conductor. Their escape is known as the most ingenious plot in fugitive slave history, even more ingenious than \\"Henry Box Brown\\". During their escape, they traveled on first-class trains, stayed in the best hotels, and Ellen dined one evening with a steamboat captain. Ellen cut her hair and bought appropriate clothes to pass as a young man, traveling in a jacket and trousers. William used his earnings as a cabinet-maker to buy clothes for Ellen to appear as a white slaveholder. William fixed her hair to add to her manly appearance. Ellen also practiced the correct gestures and behavior. She wore her right arm in a sling to hide the fact that she did not know how to write. They traveled to nearby Macon for a train to Savannah. Although the Crafts had several close calls along the way and neither could read nor write, they were successful in evading detection. On December 21, they boarded a steamship for Philadelphia, in the free state of Pennsylvania, where they arrived early on the morning of Christmas Day. Their innovation was in escaping as a pair. Historians have noted other slave women who posed as men to escape, such as Clarissa Davis of Virginia, who dressed as a man and took a New England-bound ship to freedom; Mary Millburn, who also sailed as a male passenger; and Maria Weems from the District of Columbia. As a young woman of fifteen, she dressed as a man and escaped.Barbara McCaskill, \\"Yours Very Truly: Ellen Craft – the fugitive as text and artifact\\", African American Review, Vol. 28, 1994, cites William Still, The Underground Railroad, 1872, pp. 60–61, 177–89, 558–59, accessed March 9, 2011 Soon after the Crafts' arrival in the North, abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and William Wells Brown encouraged them to recount their escape in public lectures to abolitionist circles of New England. They moved to the well-established free black community on the north side of Beacon Hill in Boston, where they were married in a Christian ceremony. Ellen Craft posed in her escape clothes for a photograph (the basis for the engraving included with this article). It was widely distributed by abolitionists as part of their campaign against slavery. Like her actions, her image as a man challenged viewers' assumptions about the \\"fixity of gender, race, normalcy, and class.\\" During the next two years, the Crafts made numerous public appearances to recount their escape and speak against slavery. Because society generally disapproved at the time of women speaking to public audiences of mixed gender, Ellen typically stood on the stage while William told their story. An article of April 27, 1849, in the abolitionist paper The Liberator, however, reported her speaking to an audience of 800–900 people in Newburyport, Massachusetts.\\"Interesting Meeting\\", The Liberator, April 27, 1849, Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina, accessed March 18, 2011 Audiences were intensely curious about the young woman who had been so bold in the escape. In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased penalties for aiding fugitive slaves and required residents and law enforcement of free states to cooperate in capturing and returning such slaves to their owners. The act provided for a reward to officers and simplified the process by which people might be certified as slaves, requiring little documentation from slave catchers. Commissioners appointed to hear such cases were paid more for ruling that a person was a slave than not. A month after the new law was effective, Collins sent two bounty hunters to Boston to retrieve the Crafts. Willis H. Hughes and John Knight eagerly traveled north from Macon intending to capture William and Ellen Craft; upon arriving to Boston they were met with resistance by both white and black Bostonians. Abolitionists in Boston had formed the biracial Boston Vigilance Committee to resist the new Slave Bill; its members protected the Crafts by moving them around various \\"safe houses\\" (such as the Tappan-Philbrick house in the nearby town of Brookline) until they could leave the country. The two bounty hunters finally gave up and returned to the south. Collins even appealed to the President of the United States, Millard Fillmore, asking him to intervene so he could regain his property. The President agreed that the Crafts should be returned to their owners in the South, and authorized the use of military force if necessary to take them. The Crafts and many other fugitive slaves were no longer safe in the North. That year the couple moved to Liverpool, England, a major port. Flight and life in Great Britain Bounty hunters and slave catchers sought fees for finding fugitive slaves. William Craft described the new law as \\"an enactment too infamous to have been thought of or tolerated by any people in the world except the unprincipled and tyrannical Yankees\\". Aided by their supporters, the Crafts decided to escape to England. They traveled from Portland, Maine overland to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they boarded the Cambria, bound for Liverpool. As William later recounted in their memoir, \\"It was not until we stepped ashore at Liverpool that we were free from every slavish fear\\". They were aided in England by a group of prominent abolitionists, including Wilson Armistead, with whom they were residing in Leeds when the census was taken in 1851 and who recorded his guests as “fugitive slaves”, and Harriet Martineau who arranged for their intensive schooling at the village school in Ockham, Surrey . Having learned to read and write, in 1852, Ellen Craft published the following, which was widely circulated in the antislavery press in both Great Britain and the US. The anti-abolition press had suggested the Crafts regretted their flight to England. She said: > So I write these few lines merely to say that the statement is entirely > unfounded, for I have never had the slightest inclination whatever of > returning to bondage; and God forbid that I should ever be so false to > liberty as to prefer slavery in its stead. In fact, since my escape from > slavery, I have gotten much better in every respect than I could have > possibly anticipated. Though, had it been to the contrary, my feelings in > regard to this would have been just the same, for I had much rather starve > in England, a free woman, than be a slave for the best man that ever > breathed upon the American continent. :— Anti-Slavery Advocate, December > 1852Sarah Brusky, \\"Ellen Craft\\", Voices from the Gap, University of > Minnesota, 2002–2004, accessed 9 March 2011 The Crafts spent 19 years in England, where they had five children together. Ellen participated in reform organizations such as the London Emancipation Committee, the Women's Suffrage Organization, and the British and Foreign Freedmen's Society. They earned speaking fees by public lectures about slavery in the US and their escape. William Craft set up a business again, but they still struggled financially. For most of their time in England, the Craft family lived in Hammersmith. After the end of the Civil War and emancipation of slaves, Ellen located her mother Maria in Georgia; she paid for her passage to England, so they were reunited. Return to the United States In 1868, after the American Civil War and passage of constitutional amendments granting emancipation, citizenship and rights to freedmen, the Crafts returned with three of their children to the United States. They raised funds from supporters, and in 1870 they bought 1800 acres of land in Georgia near Savannah in Bryan County. There they founded the Woodville Co-operative Farm School in 1873 for the education and employment of freedmen. In 1876, William Craft was charged with misuse of funds, and he lost a libel case in 1878 in which he tried to clear his name. The school closed soon after. Although the Crafts tried to keep the farm running, dropping cotton prices and post- Reconstruction era violence contributed to its failure. Whites discriminated against freedmen while working to re-establish white supremacy in politics and economics. By 1876, white Democrats regained control of the state governments in the South. In 1890, the Crafts moved to Charleston, South Carolina to live with their daughter Ellen, who was married to Dr. William D. Crum. He was appointed Collector of the Port of Charleston by President Theodore Roosevelt. The elder Ellen Craft died in 1891, and her widower William January 29, 1900. Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom Their book provides a unique view of race, gender, and class in the 19th century. It offers examples of racial passing, cross-dressing, and middle-class \\"performance\\" in a society in which each of these boundaries was thought to be distinct and stable. While originally published with only William's name as author, twentieth-century and more recent scholarship has re-evaluated Ellen's likely contribution, noting the inclusion of material about Sally Miller and other women slaves. Reprints since the 1990s have listed both the Crafts as authors. Their escape, and particularly Ellen's disguise, which played on so many layers of appearance and identity, showed the interlocking nature of race, gender, and class. Ellen had to \\"perform\\" successfully in all three arenas simultaneously for the couple to travel undetected. Since only William's narrative voice tells their joint story in the book, critics say it is suggestive of how difficult it was for a black woman to find a public voice, although she was bold in action. Brusky says that, in the way that she used wrappings to \\"muffle\\" her during the escape to avoid conversation, Ellen in the book is presented through the filter of William's perspective. Historians and readers cannot evaluate how much Ellen contributed to the recounting of their story, but audiences appreciated seeing the young woman who had been so daring. On one occasion, a newspaper notes, there was \\"considerable disappointment\\" when Ellen Craft was absent.National Anti-Slavery Standard, January 30, 1851, p. 141 Since they appeared over a period of 10 years, as William recounted their escape, they could respond to audiences' reactions to Ellen in person and to hearing of her actions. It is likely their published account reflects her influence.

This scandal arose from corruption in the Office of the Collector of the Port of New York. Background In 1829, President Andrew Jackson appointed Samuel Swartwout to serve as Collector of the Port of New York. Nine years later, Swartwout left office at the expiration of his term in 1838, retaining $201,096.40 with which to pay any pending claims that might be brought against him. He then went to England to raise money on his coal property before ensuring that his account at the customhouse was closed. After he left the country, or perhaps before, his account was \\"adjusted\\" by a subordinate and possibly by his successor, through the instigation of President Martin Van Buren. It was then alleged that Swartwout had embezzled $1,225,705.09 (over $30 million in today's dollars) and fled. One of his assistants was indicted in 1841 for embezzling $609,525.71 of the sum, and, according to Swartwout's trustee, a federal court further reduced the amount by $435,052.21, leaving the remaining amount which Swartwout claimed he owed. Swartwout forfeited his personal property to meet the deficit and returned to the United States in 1841 after federal officials assured him that they would not prosecute him. President Martin Van Buren then appointed Jesse Hoyt to replace Swartwout and to take corrective measures to prevent any future problems in the Collector's office. However, in 1841, allegations began to circulate that Hoyt had also been embezzling, and Hoyt was removed by Van Buren on February 27. =Scandal with the scandal= There was also something of a \\"scandal with the scandal.\\" President John Tyler appointed a special three-person committee, headed by Senator George Poindexter of Mississippi, to investigate the allegations of fraud and embezzlement in the Collector's Office. The committee's report found overwhelming evidence of massive corruption. However, President Tyler had made the political mistake of failing to secure the approval of Congress for the creation of the Poindexter committee; the Congress, miffed at what it viewed as an usurpation of its powers, repudiated President Tyler's action in creating the commission. =Legacy= It is believed that Swartwout's story is the origin of the term \\"Swartwouted out\\", which has since come to define the embezzlement of a large sum of money from the United States government and subsequent escape to a foreign nation to escape punishment.

Filming took place in Seoul, Hong Kong, Istanbul and Cappadocia, Turkey. Although it is a Hong Kong film, much of the dialogue is in English, particularly during communications between the Chinese characters and the Korean and Turkish characters. Despite having a fairly serious and dark plot in some parts, it still features some humour, as is typical of Chan's films. Plot A news reporting team cover a story in an Anatolian village where many people have seemingly died from pneumonia while a team of scientists try to find a cure. A terrorist group disguised as farmers attack and kill everyone there. Some days later, a former North Korean spy shows up at the South Korean embassy in Istanbul. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, Buck Yuen, an exercise equipment salesman, inadvertently foils a bank robbery and becomes a media celebrity. Later that night, a stranger called Manny Liu approaches Yuen and says that he is looking for men of Yuen's age and description on behalf of a terminally ill Korean man, Park Won-jung, who wants to pass his fortune to his long-lost son. Yuen agrees and follows Liu's associate to South Korea to meet Park in a military hospital. Later, Yuen is approached by Carmen, a reporter, who asks him questions about Park. When Yuen returns to the hospital, he saves Park from a group of thugs and accepts Park's offer to play a \\"game\\" – if Yuen wins, he gets everything Park leaves behind for his biological son; if Yuen loses, he will still have fun. Park also gives Yuen a shiny crucifix similar to the one Yuen sees his parents holding in his dreams. After Park's death, Yuen scatters his ashes at his wife's grave and finds a message (\\"wait for me\\") engraved on the tombstone. After leaving the cemetery, Yuen and Carmen narrowly evade attacks from thugs. Yuen later realises that \\"wait for me\\" corresponds to a phone number of a bank in Istanbul. In Istanbul, Yuen uses the crucifix, which turns out to be a stamp, to retrieve the contents of Park's safety deposit box. Shortly after leaving the bank, he encounters several robbers trying to steal his briefcase full of money. He holds off the robbers until the police show up and the robbers flee. While touring Istanbul, Yuen meets a mysterious Chinese woman, Yong, who has \\"wait for me\\" embroidered on her scarf. When Yuen asks her where she got her scarf, she arranges to meet him at a later date and time. When Yuen is at a Turkish bath, he gets accosted by a group of thugs demanding that he hands over \\"the thing\\". After a long chase through the streets, Yuen finally escapes from them but shows up late for his meeting with Yong. Just then, Carmen and her colleague, Philip, approach Yuen and reveal to him that they are actually CIA agents. The \\"thing\\" that everyone is after is a biological weapon, Anthrax II, a more powerful version of anthrax. The weapon had already killed many people in Anatolia, which was chosen as a testing ground. Park developed brain cancer as a result of his involvement in the case. Yuen also learns that Zen, a crime lord, wants to buy the Anthrax II and had sent Yong to get close to Yuen to gather information. Yuen meets up with Yong, who confirms she is working for Zen. Moments later, they are captured by a group of thugs and brought back to the Anatolian village. As the thugs are beating up Yuen to force him to tell them where the Anthrax II is, mercenaries attack the village and gun down all the thugs. In the ensuing chaos, Yuen escapes with Yong on a makeshift raft. They are picked up by Zen, who reveals that he sent the mercenaries to save them. Yuen also learns that Yong is a drug addict enslaved by Zen. Zen offers Yuen a new deal: more money and Yong's freedom in exchange for the Anthrax II. Although Yuen refuses, Zen still gives him time to find the Anthrax II. Yuen recalls that there was a Bible in the safety deposit box so he makes his way to a nearby church and meets a priest who knows Park. The priest leads Yuen to the basement where Park temporarily stayed; Yuen finds two vials of Anthrax II there and a note saying \\"game over\\". Yuen then reluctantly hands over the Anthrax II to Zen in exchange for Yong. It turns out later that Zen had double-crossed Yuen by giving Yong a fatal dose of drugs. After Yong dies at the train station, Yuen gets arrested and thrown into prison but Carmen and Ashley bail him out. Carmen, feeling sorry for Yong's death, secretly reveals to Yuen that the CIA is meeting Zen the next day to discuss buying the Anthrax II from him. Yuen takes matters into his own hands and tries to stop Zen at the airport. While Zen and his henchmen flee in a car, Yuen chases them, fights them and manages to get back the Anthrax II. However, the car gets stuck to the rear of a tanker, which soon catches fire. The tanker has to keep moving at a certain speed or else it will explode. After Yuen manages to save the driver and his son, the tanker is heading straight towards the edge of a disused bridge. Just then, Manny Liu appears in a helicopter and tries to pull Yuen out but fails. Yuen leaps from the tanker and grabs hold of the plastic bridge barrier as he swings down. He rolls down a slope, sustains severe injuries from the fall, and becomes unconscious. Liu searches Yuen for the Anthrax II, finds it and leaves. When Yuen regains consciousness in hospital later, he learns from Liu that his entire adventure was actually a CIA mission arranged to be performed by him as an informal, non-official agent (an \\"accidental spy\\"). He was chosen because of his background as an orphan, his sharp intuition and excellent fighting skills. The dream of his parents is actually an illusion created by Liu, who added drugs into Yuen's drink to put him into a hypnotic state. In a post-credits scene, Yuen, now officially a spy, delivers a briefcase to a drug dealer in Italy and tips off the police to arrest him.

Dimension Films version Dimension Films (then a sub-set of Miramax, which was owned by The Walt Disney Company) acquired the international distribution rights to the film outside of Asia. Like many Jackie Chan films distributed by Disney, scenes were cut, foreign dialogue was dubbed, and the music score was changed. #Buck Yuen's name was changed to Jackie Chan #Zen's name was changed to Lee #The Anthrax II was changed to \\"Opia Maxa\\", a new and more powerful form of opium. The context of the conflict between Zen and the Turkish villagers was changed to be a drug war between Korean and Turkish drug lords. #In some cases, scenes were actually re-arranged. For example, in the HK cut, Buck Yuen and Manny's associate arrive at the South Korean hospital, they talk to the doctor, then Buck visits with Carmen Wong, and then Buck goes back to the hospital, fends off the thugs attacking his \\"father\\", and then converses with him. However, in the Dimension version, they arrive at the hospital, then \\"Jackie\\" talks to his father, then he visits Carmen Wong, and then he returns to the hospital, fends off the thugs, but Dimension added in a \\"flatline\\" sound effect, and used a scene of Mr. Park struggling to breathe to suggest that he died because of the thugs. #A lot of dialog that was actually in English was dubbed over into foreign languages, creating a language barrier between \\"Jackie Chan\\" and other characters that didn't exist in the original Hong Kong version. A lot of English dialogue was dubbed over to change the plot. #Buck's dialog is sometimes dubbed over by a voice that definitely doesn't belong to Jackie Chan, including scenes where he was speaking in English.

He served as the artistic director of Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw during the interwar period (1930–32), and within a short period raised its reputation as one of the leading voices for Poland's new intelligentsia, with groundbreaking productions of Danton's Death by Georg Büchner (1931), The Captain of Köpenick by Carl Zuckmayer (1932), as well as popular Ladies and Husars (Damy i Huzary) by Aleksander Fredro (1932) and The Open House by Michał Bałucki. Life Mira Zimińska and Stefan Jaracz in 1935 Jaracz was born in Stare Żukowice near Tarnów during the Partitions of Poland. He studied law, history of art, and literature at the Jagiellonian University of Kraków, but gave up his studies to join theatre. He moved to Poznań for yet another contract where he was drafted to the Austrian army in 1907. A year later he settled in Łódź where he performed until 1911. He moved to Warsaw in the Russian Partition and worked in Teatr Mały and Teatr Polski (1913). He was sent to Moscow by the Russians (1915). Upon his return to sovereign Poland in 1918 he embarked upon an energetic career in emerging national and experimental theatre, with guest performances in over ninety cities and towns until 1928. In 1930 he took over the Ateneum of Warsaw. He managed it until the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, sharing the responsibilities with Leon Schiller in 1932–33 season. During World War II he was arrested and imprisoned at the Auschwitz concentration camp. Jaracz was released after numerous interventions on 15 May 1941. He died in Otwock, near Warsaw in 1945 due to his ailing health. The repertory Stefan Jaracz Theatre in Łódź, Poland is named after him, and so is the Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw since 1951. Acting Technique Tadeusz Olsza (left) and Stefan Jaracz playing Konstanty Kurczek in 1936 film Jego wielka miłość (His one great love) Jaracz was endowed with a heavy, angular figure and a hoarse yet highly evocative voice. He earned the fame of the most perfect actor of roles of the disadvantaged and the humiliated. He approached them without sentimentality, conveying bitterness and coarseness as well as rebellion, even if they were deeply hidden. With his acting understated and free from affectation, he was able to create characters who were profoundly human, moving and simple. Jaracz was considered to bring to the theater a somewhat plebeian flavor that added verity to his roles. Sometimes he played bluntly, although over time his acting became more detached and would at times reveal a hint of mockery. Nevertheless he was regarded as an actor who empathized with, respected and defended his protagonists, and who conveyed their suffering. He worked hard on his roles, polishing them and sometimes introducing major changes to stagings in other theaters.https://culture.pl/en/artist/stefan-jaracz Partial filmography Statue of Stefan Jaracz in Łódź, Poland * Wykolejeni (1913) - Bankier * Obrona Częstochowy (1913) - Michal Wolodyjowski * Countess Walewska (1914) - Napoleon Bonaparte * Cud nad Wisla (1921) - Jan Rudy * Za winy brata (1921) - Karol Gromski * Niewolnica milosci (1923) * Skrzydlaty zwyciezca (1924) * The Unspeakable (1924) - rada Wolski * Milosc za zycie.

This colourless solid is of interest because it is more basic than pyridine, owing to the resonance stabilisation from the NMe2 substituent. Because of its basicity, DMAP is a useful nucleophilic catalyst for a variety of reactions such as esterifications with anhydrides, the Baylis-Hillman reaction, hydrosilylations, tritylation, the Steglich rearrangement, Staudinger synthesis of β-lactams and many more. Chiral DMAP analogues are used in kinetic resolution experiments of mainly secondary alcohols and Evans auxiliary type amides. Preparation DMAP can be prepared in a two-step procedure from pyridine, which is first oxidized to 4-pyridylpyridinium cation. This cation then reacts with dimethylamine: :450px Esterification catalyst In the case of esterification with acetic anhydrides the currently accepted mechanism involves three steps. First, DMAP and acetic anhydride react in a pre-equilibrium reaction to form an ion pair of acetate and the acetylpyridinium ion. In the second step the alcohol adds to the acetylpyridinium, and elimination of pyridine forms an ester. Here the acetate acts as a base to remove the proton from the alcohol as it nucleophilically adds to the activated acylpyridinium. The bond from the acetyl group to the catalyst gets cleaved to generate the catalyst and the ester. The described bond formation and breaking process runs synchronous concerted without the appearance of a tetrahedral intermediate. The acetic acid formed will then protonate the DMAP. In the last step of the catalytic cycle the auxiliary base (usually triethylamine or pyridine) deprotonates the protonated DMAP, reforming the catalyst. The reaction runs through the described nucleophilic reaction pathway irrespective of the anhydride used, but the mechanism changes with the pKa value of the alcohol used. For example, the reaction runs through a base-catalyzed reaction pathway in the case of a phenol. In this case, DMAP acts as a base and deprotonates the phenol, and the resulting phenolate ion adds to the anhydride. Safety DMAP has a relatively high toxicity and is particularly dangerous because of its ability to be absorbed through the skin. It is also corrosive.DMAP MSDS - Fischer Science  References   Further reading  * * Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Aminopyridines Category:Catalysts Category:Dimethylamino compounds ","title":"4-Dimethylaminopyridine"},{"id":"2183057","text":"Harold Frederick (Fred) Lawrence (December 17, 1887 – 1953) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1932 to 1936. Lawrence was born and educated in Burton upon Trent, England in 1887, and came to Canada in 1907. He worked as a railroad accountant for the Canadian National Railway, and became involved in the provincial labour movement in 1915. From 1917 to 1921, he served as general chairman of the Canadian Brotherhood Railroad Employees Western Lines. Lawrence also became active in Manitoba's Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was first elected to the provincial legislature under its banner in the 1932 general election. Running in St. Boniface, he defeated longtime Conservative representative Joseph Bernier by 504 votes. Bernier actually defeated Lawrence by six votes on first preferences, but lost on transfers; the province was using the single transferable ballot at the time. For the 1936 provincial election, the ILP ran candidates in an alliance with the newly formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). Lawrence again finished second on first preferences, but was declared elected on the third count over Liberal-Progressive candidate L.P. Gagnon. After the election, the provincial ILP organization was gradually superseded by the CCF. In 1940, the Manitoba CCF joined an all-party coalition government. Lawrence sat with his colleagues as a government backbencher, but did not seek re-election in the provincial election of 1941. He died in 1953.

The caption reads: That salary grab—\\"You took it\\". Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 27 December 1873 The Salary Grab Act, officially known as the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Expenses Appropriation Act,A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875, p. xxvii was passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 and sparked a firestorm of controversy among members of the government, the general public, and the press. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for George Washington. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, Ohio ratified what later became the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The controversy surrounding the bill resulted in Republicans losing many seats, resulting in a Democratic majority in the House which began one of the most competitive two- party periods in American history.Dean, 2002, legal essay at FindLawJenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006 Background Salary Grab Act cartoon, featuring Horace Greeley at left Before legislation for an across the board increase in pay for government officials, officials in and out of government had complained that their salaries were insufficient to meet the expenses involved with their office and the high costs of living in Washington, D.C. The president's salary, at $25,000 a year, had not increased since George Washington was president, while the value of the dollar didn't have the same purchasing power.Calhoun, 2017, p. 402Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, p. 678Brands, 2012, p. 514 Congressional salaries had not been increased since 1852.Smith, 2001, 553 While the government provided a house and a domestic staff for the president, Grant, like all presidents before him, paid for his own living expenses. Before passage of the act, salaries for members of Congress and Cabinet members were $5,000 and $8,000 respectively, significantly more than the wages for the average American. Members of Congress were also supposed to pay for their own residences while in Washington, where rents had increased as much as 25% since the Civil War. When President Grant abolished the franking privilege, a considerable yearly sum for government officials who frequently corresponded, their expenses increased further.Calhoun, 2017, pp. 402–403 Professional needs also prompted the effort to increase salaries for government officials. Members of Congress were not provided by the government with a professional staff. Thus any member who employed administrators or personal clerks had to pay them directly out of his own pocket. Any member who was not financially well-off and needed clerical assistance was faced with a financial hardship, as Washington was a very expensive place in which to live.Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, p. 677 To meet the cost of living many government officials were forced to take on other forms of employment on the side, often resuming their former professions, usually between Congressional sessions.Calhoun, 2017, p. 403 =Emergence of the salary act= The idea of increasing the salaries for government officials with legislation that became known as the \\"Salary Grab\\" was conceived in the final days of the 42nd Congress, during the normal course of congressional business, and was first introduced on February 7, 1873, in the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Benjamin Butler, a Stalwart Republican from Massachusetts. The so called \\"Salary Grab Act\\" first attracted attention on February 7, 1873, put forth by Butler, from Massachusetts, who on that day stated that he had been directed by the Committee on the Judiciary to submit a bill lending itself to the subject of salaries in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, along with a report in writing from Butler, who stated, \\"I desire to say that the report is not drawn by myself, but I present it by order of the committee, and I concur in its statements.\\" The bill was received and read aloud twice, and submitted. On February 10, Butler motioned that the Committee on Appropriations be directed to include the salary increase in the Miscellaneous Appropriation Bill, for the committee's consideration. Butler also moved for a suspension of the rules in order to allow that this motion be entertained by the committee.Robinson, 1873, p. 8 The amendment specified that the annual salary for Presidents, which at the time had remained unchanged since the presidency of George Washington, would double to $50,000, while the annual salaries of Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet members would increase to $10,000, and the annual salaries of civil servants would also increase. Moreover, members of Congress would receive a pay increase from $5,000 to $7,500 annually.Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, p. 674 The congressional increase would be retroactive to the beginning of the 42nd Congress, almost two full years earlier.Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, pp. 680–691 This meant that all members of Congress would receive a lump sum payment of roughly $4,000 for \\"services rendered\\" when the session came to a close. The House, on 24 February 1873, assembled to conduct the routine procedure of working out a legislative appropriations bill. Both Houses acted immediately and passed the conference bill; the House by a 102–95 vote, and the Senate by a 36–27 vote, whereafter President Grant signed the bill into law on March 3, 1873, the final day of the 42nd Congress. In little time the proposed salary increase in congressional salaries became a controversial issue in all branches of government as well as with much of the general public and the press. The newspapers immediately characterized the pay raise as the \\"Salary Grab Act\\" and associated its promotion to the recent Crédit Mobilier scandal,Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, pp. 674, 680 and accused the governing Republican majority in Congress of perpetuating an atmosphere of corruption. Most of the criticism, especially from Liberal reformers, was aimed at Republicans.The American Citizen, 20 September 1873, p. 1 Along with the Crédit Mobilier scandal, the so-called Salary Grab Act or \\"Salary steal\\" fueled a widespread notion that the party in power was hopelessly corrupt.Calhoun, 2017, p. 462 However, the connection of the Liberals with the \\"salary grab\\" was easily open to criticism. Four Liberal senators and one representative supported the salary increases, and never returned their back pay.Ross, 1919, p. 195 Elihu Washburne, Minister to France, who was a Republican himself and former ally of Grant, writing from Paris, characterized Congress as \\"simply a gang of thieves...what a pity the President did not veto the salary steal\\". President Grant reasoned that blocking the bill would have rendered all three branches of government underfunded, requiring the new 43rd Congress to conduct a special session to start the process all over again.Calhoun, 2017, p. 403 Due to the large public outcry, and in an attempt to deflect criticism, a few of the Senators and Representatives returned their bonuses to the United States government Treasury Department, while others donated it to colleges or charities. However, the criticism persisted, and the Republicans lost ninety- six seats in the House, including Butler. The huge loss resulted in the Democratic party returning to prominence for the first time since before the Civil War. As a result, the 1874 election initiated one of the most competitive two-party periods in American history, lasting more than twenty years. During the opening of the next Congress, 20 January 1874, House members repealed the Appropriation Act, sustaining only the salary increases for the President and Supreme Court Justices, while all others abandoned any hope of a continuing salary increase.Jenkins; Alston; Nonnenmacher, 2006, p. 681Theriault, 2005, p. 17The Evening Sun, 12 June 1945, p. 12 See also * Presidency of Ulysses S.

Originally built from wood by the Hilton (later Hylton) family shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066, it was later rebuilt in stone in the late 14th to early 15th century.Whittaker, p.83 The castle underwent major changes to its interior and exterior in the 18th century and it remained the principal seat of the Hylton family until the death of the last Baron in 1746.Fry, p.246 It was then Gothicised but neglected until 1812, when it was revitalised by a new owner. Standing empty again until the 1840s, it was briefly used as a school until it was purchased again in 1862. The site passed to a local coal company in the early 20th century and was taken over by the state in 1950. One of the castle's main features is the range of heraldic devices found mainly on the west façade, which have been retained from the castle's original construction. They depict the coats of arms belonging to local gentry and peers of the late 14th to early 15th centuries and provide an approximate date of the castle's reconstruction from wood to stone. Today, the castle is owned by English Heritage, a charity which manages the historical environment of England. The surrounding parkland is maintained by a community organisation. The castle and its chapel are protected as a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. In February, 2016, plans were announced to turn the castle into a community facility and visitor attraction, with the Heritage Lottery Fund awarding £2.9 million, and Sunderland Council £1.5 million, to provide classrooms, a cafe and rooms for exhibitions, meetings and events. History =Early history= The Hylton family had been settled in England since the reign of King Athelstan (c.895–939).Sykes, p.9Timbs & Gunn, p.283 At this time, Adam de Hylton gave to the monastery of Hartlepool a pyx or crucifix, weighing in silver and emblazoned with his coat of arms – argent, two bars azure. On the arrival of William the Conqueror, Lancelot de Hilton and his two sons, Robert and Henry, joined the Conqueror's forces, but Lancelot was killed at Faversham during William's advance to London. In gratitude, the king granted the eldest son, Henry, a large tract of land on the banks of the River Wear. The first castle on the site, built by Henry de Hilton in about 1072, was likely to have been built of wood. It was subsequently re-built in stone by Sir William Hylton (1376–1435) as a four- storey, gatehouse-style, fortified manor house, similar in design to Lumley and Raby.Billings, p.47 Although called a gatehouse, it belongs to a type of small, late-14th-century castle, similar to Old Wardour, Bywell and Nunney castles.Pevsner, p.471 The castle was first mentioned in a household inventory taken in 1448, as \\"a gatehouse constructed of stone\\" and although no construction details survive, it is believed the stone castle was built sometime between 1390 and the early 15th century, due to the coat of arms featured above the west entrance (see Heraldry below).Pevsner, p.470 It has been suggested that Sir William intended to erect a larger castle in addition to the gatehouse, but abandoned his plan.Pettifer, p.30 The household inventory taken on Sir William's death in 1435 mentions, in addition to the castle, a hall, four chambers, two barns, a kitchen, and the chapel, indicating the existence of other buildings on the site at that time. Apart from the castle and chapel, the other buildings were probably all of timber. In 1559, the gatehouse featured in another household inventory as the \\"Tower\\", when floors and galleries were inserted to subdivide the great hall. The eccentric Henry Hylton, de jure 12th Baron Hylton left the castle to the City of London Corporation on his death in 1641, to be used for charitable purposes for ninety-nine years. It was returned to the family after the Restoration, to Henry's nephew, John Hylton, de jure 15th Baron Hylton. =18th century= Hylton Castle and St Catherine's Chapel – Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, 1728 Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), the second son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the interior to form a three- storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, believed to be the one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the doorway to The Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, on the opposite side of the River Wear.Meadows & Waterson, p.42 After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a complementary south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings and removed the door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on the north end of the west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance. When the 18th and last \\"baron\\" died without male heirs in 1746, the castle passed to his nephew, Sir Richard Musgrave, Bt, who took the name of Hylton. It was sold by a private bill (23 Geo. II c.21) in 1749. The new owner was to be a Mr. Wogan who returned from the East Indies to buy the castle for £30,550 (£3.7 million in 2007), but the sale never went through.Sykes, p.220 It was instead bought by Lady Bowes, the widow of Sir George Bowes of Streatlam and Gibside in County Durham. No record of her, or any of her family, ever taking up residence exists and the castle later passed to her grandson, John Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. At this time, a stucco decoration (long since disappeared) to the wine and drawing rooms was added by Pietro La Francini, who worked for Daniel Garrett (who had worked for Lady Bowes on Gibside Banqueting House). William Howitt's Visits to Remarkable Places (1842) notes the rooms had \\"stuccoed ceilings, with figures, busts on the walls, and one large scene which seemed to be Venus and Cupid, Apollo fiddling to the gods, Minerva in her helmet, and an old king\\".Meadows & Waterson, p.43 Garrett probably designed the Gothic porch installed in the west entrance and the Gothic screen and single-storey, bow-fronted rooms installed to close off the east entrance. =19th century= c. 1800 After a long period of remaining empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade. By 1834, the castle was unoccupied again. In 1840, an advert was placed in the Newcastle Courant by Revd. John Wood for \\"Hylton Castle Boarding School\\" and the 1841 census shows Wood, his family, pupils and staff as living on the estate.1841 England Census: Class: HO107; Piece 299; Book: 2; Civil Parish: Monkwearmouth; County: Durham; Enumeration District: 12; Folio: 17; Page: 2; Line: 1; GSU roll: 241347. Joseph Swan was one of the pupils there around this time. The school does not seem to have existed for long as Howitt commented in 1842, that it was \\"a scene of great desolation ... the windows for the most part, all along the front, are boarded up ... the whole of this large old house is now empty ... and in the most desolate state\\". However, he does go on to say the kitchen was occupied a poor family. By 1844, the chapel was used as a carpenter's workshop, and according to the Durham Chronicle in January 1856, the castle set on fire while in the occupation of a farmer, Mr. Maclaren.Billings, p.48 In 1862, the castle was put up for sale by the Strathmores and purchased by William Briggs, a local timber merchant and ship builder. Meadows & Waterson, p.44 Briggs set about to change the appearance of the castle to what he believed to be more \\"authentic[ally] medieval\\". He demolished the north and south wings, gutted the interior and added one, two and three-light cusp-headed windows. He also replaced the Gothic porch with a more \\"severe\\" Gothic doorway (three-bayed with cinquefoil arches) and an overhead balcony. To carry out these changes to the west front, he moved the stone-carved Hylton banner from above the west entrance to the front, left- flanking tower. The interior walls of the four-vaulted ground floor rooms were demolished, the whole floor was raised three-and-a-half feet and two reception rooms were formed.Hugill, p.62 At the east end of the former central passage, dog-leg stairs were constructed leading to the first floor, requiring removal of the oratory and rendering the main staircase inaccessible from the ground floor. The side walls of the great hall were removed to create a large salon and a large bay window was added to the south façade, where the entrance to the south wing would have been. The rooms above were kept untouched, except that a new entrance to the family/chaplain's room had to be formed via the main staircase. Alongside the medieval masonry, Briggs' alterations can still be seen today (albeit in ruins). Briggs' son, Colonel Charles James Briggs (father of Sir Charles James Briggs) inherited the castle in 1871 and built the nearby St Margaret's church (now demolished). =20th century= Interior of castle, 2006 After Colonel Brigg's death in 1900, the castle passed into the hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the expansion of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry.Emery, p.107 The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof. In 1994, Channel 4's Time Team undertook excavations on the Eastern Terrace. Their investigations revealed evidence of a medieval hall to the east of the castle; it has been suggested that the hall was used as a dining area. =Chapel= St Catherine's chapel. A chapel dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria is known to have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval.Huggill, p.58 In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24 sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry dedicated to the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370. The chapel, which is on a small embankment to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was modified from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a Perpendicular Gothic, five-light east window and transepts were added. Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west window, and that the chapel was disused by this time, as it had no roof.Pevsner, p.473 The west façade of the chapel was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up to form a new one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c. 1805. On the north and south sides of the chapel are two transeptal, semi-octagonal bays. Although repairs to the chapel were carried out by the last Baron Hylton and the successive owners in the 19th century, it fell into disrepair until, like the castle, it was taken over by the state in 1950. =Modern= The castle and chapel have been Grade I listed buildings since 1949 and form a Scheduled Ancient Monument under the care of English Heritage, who took over the site in 1984, although Sunderland City Council own the land. In 1999, the Friends of Hylton Dene group was formed by residents of the estates around North Hylton \\"with the aim of co- operating with Sunderland City Council, Durham Wildlife Trust and other agencies to actively involve the local community in the development and upkeep of Hylton Dene and Castle\\". In December 2007, the group was awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a survey for the future for the site. Once restored, the castle could be opened. The chairman of the Castle in the Community John Coulthard described the castle, Sunderland's second oldest building, as \\"an asset in the city – it is a lovely setting and we would love to see it bring in some income\\". There have been four organised International Reunion(s) of Hylton Families over the past few years; most notably on 4 July 2004, when around fifty American descendants of the Hylton family visited the castle to present a flag featuring the Hylton blazon. The flag now flies from the recently installed flagpole, provided by English Heritage. Exterior \\"Hylton Turrets\\", a sketch by Robert Billings in 1846, facing south-west on the roof of Hylton Castle. The sketch shows the south-west tower, the south tower of the central bay on the east façade, and the decaying stone figures on the roof. The west façade of the castle has square towers flanking the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower.Pevsner, p.472 The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade on the ground floor and three ogee arches on the shafts above. The roof was originally covered with sheet lead and adorning the roof are stone warriors and other figures, similar to those of Raby, Alnwick and the gates of York.Huggill, p.60 Originally there were four figures on each corner turret and bartizan; only five have survived. Between the central towers once stood a sculpture of a knight in combat with a serpent (of which only fragments survive), believed to pertain to the tale of the Lambton Worm. The parapet is also machicolated (except on the north façade) and continued between the central towers by a carved-foliage arch (originally with cusping which fell in 1882), instead of corbels. Another feature of the roof was shallow stone troughs on the battlements which fed scalding oil or water into the machiocaltions as a means of defence. In a small chamber in each turret or bastion, a brazier was kept burning to bring the liquids to a suitable temperature. Interior layout A plan of the original floors of Hylton Castle. Note: The diagram does not include the minstrels' gallery. Before the changes made by John Hylton (died 1712), the castle's layout plan was as follows: The ground floor, accessed directly from the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending the depth of the building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room nearest the entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official.Emery, p.108 The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage. The first was floor was accessed via the main staircase, situated in the east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private staircase and the entrance to the oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower.Huggill, p.59 The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall was the head of the west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window. The kitchen, oratory and great chamber rose two floors, therefore only the minstrels' gallery was accessed via the main staircase on the second floor. However, the butlery and pantry was single-storeyed, but held the butler's chamber (with a garderobe) above it, accessed either via a staircase in that room or via the gallery. The rooms on the north and east sides of the third floor were accessed via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby at the top of the private staircase. The room on the south side (separated by the other rooms due to the hall's height) was accessed via the main staircase. This room also had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was probably used by guests. Above the small family/chaplain's room on the third floor, was the servant's room with a corner fireplace and two windows on the mezzanine floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe.Emery, p.109 There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff. Heraldry The castle and chapel are adorned with heraldic devices and shields of arms, providing information as to when the castle was constructed. =West façade= Above the main entrance on the western façade of the castle, there are twenty shields of arms. They are believed to show the political alliances of the early Hyltons, as the banner of the king, and the arms of nobles and knights of Northumberland and the County Palatine of Durham are shown. In relation to the photograph, the shields are: Heraldry on the west façade of Hylton Castle, 2008.

Briggs is believed to have re-arranged the shields, disrupting their original hierarchical arrangement. Nevertheless, the arms give a date for the construction and completion of the castle as between 1390 and the early 15th century, due to the following reasons: *The Earl of Northumberland quartered his own arms with those of his second wife, Maud Lucy, after their marriage in c.1384. *Sir Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy did not quarter his own arms with those of Lucy, until he inherited the Honour of Cockermouth from his stepmother in 1398. *The arms shown of Henry IV are those he adopted c. 1400, after simplifying the French quarters (see Armorial of Plantagenet) =East façade= The east façade of the castle features a slanted shield containing the Hylton arms (Argent, two bars Azure) and a white hart (male deer), lodged, chained and collared with a coronet, Or. The hart is possibly the badge used by Richard II of England (indicating construction began before Richard's deposition in 1399) or an earlier crest used by the family after it was granted by William I of England, in reward for the services of the previously mentioned Lancelot de Hilton. A \\"Moses head\\" (the crest of the Hylton arms) also features on the east façade. Hauntings There is a local tradition that Hylton Castle is haunted by the spirit of Robert Skelton, known as the Cauld (a pronunciation of \\"cold\\" in Mackem) Lad of Hylton. Various versions of how he was killed exist, the most popular being that he was decapitated by Sir Robert Hylton (later de jure 13th Baron Hylton), after falling asleep and failing to get his master's horse ready on time. Skelton's spirit then began to haunt the castle and would move objects, either misplacing them or tidying up. The spirit was said to have been finally laid to rest when the castle servants put a cloak out for him.

He played for 15 seasons in the Major League Baseball and has played 4 seasons of independent and Mexican League baseball since leaving MLB. He most recently managed the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, leading them to the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 Dominican Winter League Championship. During a baseball game on January 16, 2010, Offerman attacked an umpire during an argument and, as a result, was banned from the Winter League for three years.Video of José Offerman hitting an umpire YouTube He managed the Rojos del Águila de Veracruz of the Mexican League in 2014. Early career After attending Colegio Biblico Cristiano High School in San Pedro de Macorís, Offerman signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1986. In , he completed his first season of professional play being named as Best Prospect in the Pioneer League. Progressing rapidly through the minor leagues, he made his major league debut against the Montreal Expos on August 19, becoming the 55th player in major league history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat. Major leagues By , Offerman became the Dodgers' starting shortstop. On opening day 1993, he was the first batter to ever face the Florida Marlins, striking out against Charlie Hough. He made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 1995 but was traded to the Kansas City Royals after the season, mostly because of his very poor defense. After a year as a utility player, he won the starting second baseman job in 1997. Offerman had his best offensive seasons in Kansas City, culminating in , when he hit .315 with a league-leading 13 triples and the fifth most stolen bases, 45. After that season, he signed with the Boston Red Sox as a free agent, making the All-Star Game for the second time in 1999. Known more for his hitting skills than his fielding, Offerman's offense began to decline in . He was sent to the Seattle Mariners during the season, but was released afterwards. In , he joined the Montreal Expos in spring training but was cut before the regular season began. He spent the entire year with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the independent Atlantic League. In , he won a spot on the Minnesota Twins roster and led the league in pinch-hits with 12 in 29 attempts. He started with the Philadelphia Phillies but was released after a slow start. Later, he signed with the New York Mets and was called back up to the majors in June. Post- USA major leagues Most recently, Offerman played in the 2008 Caribbean World Series for the Licey Tigers – Dominican Republic 2 team – where he assisted the team in winning its 10th Caribbean World Series title. During the series he signed a contract with the 2008 Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Summer League. In December, 2008, Offerman was named player-manager of Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League. With Offerman as manager, Licey swept the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five straight against the Gigantes del Cibao. As champions, Licey was then invited to participate in the 2009 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager (the series was ultimately won by Venezuela). (The Caribbean World Series is affiliated with the Winter League programs of Major League Baseball, featuring MLB players and prospects from the Dominican Winter League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.) On January 7, 2014, Offerman was again named manager of the Licey Tigers of the Dominican Winter League, replacing Mike Guerrero. With Offerman at the helm, Licey won the Dominican Winter League Baseball Championships, winning five games to three over the Leones del Escogido. As champions again, Licey has been invited to the 2014 Caribbean World Series with Offerman as manager. At present, his team has qualified for the semifinals of the tournament. =Bat incident= He has not played or managed professional baseball in the United States since 2007. On August 14, 2007, while playing for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, Offerman was thrown out of a game against the Bridgeport Bluefish for charging Bluefish pitcher Matt Beech with a bat after he was hit by a pitch. Beech sustained a broken finger in the resulting melee. Bluefish catcher John Nathans was also hit in the back of the head during the bench-clearing melee, receiving a severe concussion that effectively ended his playing career. Beech and Nathans were taken to Bridgeport Hospital where they were treated and released. After being removed from the game, Offerman was arrested by the Bridgeport Police. On August 15, 2007, he was suspended indefinitely. The independent Atlantic League announced on August 17, 2007 that Offerman would remain suspended at least until the legal case was resolved. On September 24, 2007, Offerman pleaded not guilty to two second degree assault charges. His case was pending in Bridgeport Superior Court GA#2 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was represented by Attorney Frank J. Riccio II. On October 30, 2007, Offerman was given two years special probation called \\"Accelerated Rehabilitation ('AR').\\" The Court determined that his actions on August 14, 2007 were of an aberrant nature. The Court also found that Offerman is not likely to offend again in the future. Nathans filed a $4.8 million civil suit against Offerman in February 2009, claiming that he still has post-concussion syndrome and that the injury allegedly caused by Offerman ended his baseball career.Jose Offerman Sued By John Nathans ESPN.com, February 12, 2009 On July 29, 2014, Nathans won his suit, and Offerman was ordered to pay $940,000. =Dominican Republic Winter League incident= On 16 January 2010, Offerman once again engaged in an on-field assault when he struck an umpire while managing a Dominican Republic winter league game. Offerman, manager of the Licey Tigers, came onto the field during the third inning while losing a 6-0 game to the Cibao Giants, to protest ejection of his catcher for arguing balls and strikes and ended up arguing with first-base umpire D.J. Reyburn. He swung with a right hook at Reyburn, who then fell to the ground. Offerman was detained by stadium security, eventually being transported to the local police station to await the end of the game and Reyburn's decision whether to ask for charges to be pressed against him or not. A day after the incident, the American crew that umpired the game resigned their positions with the Dominican Baseball League and left the country, reportedly due to threats and concerns about their own safety. Because of this incident Offerman received a lifetime ban from the Dominican Republic Winter League, a suspension that was eventually lifted in February 2013. Coincidentally, at the time he was suspended, Offerman was replacing Dave Jauss as Licey manager after Jauss was suspended himself for two years for bumping an umpire during a playoff game. Personal life He is the father of WWE ring announcer and former reality television star JoJo Offerman.

This is the usual name for this part of the Liturgy in Greek-speaking Eastern Christianity. In western Christian traditions which have a comparable rite, the Anaphora is more often called the Eucharistic Prayer for the four modern anaphoras in the Latin liturgy, with the first anaphora having the additional name of the Roman Canon . When the Roman Rite had a single Eucharistic Prayer (between the Council of Trent and Vatican II), it was called the Canon of the Mass. \\"Anaphora\\" is a Greek word () meaning a \\"carrying back\\" (hence its meaning in rhetoric and linguistics) or a \\"carrying up\\", and so an \\"offering\\"Liddell, Henry George & Scott, Robert. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon (revised ed.). Retrieved July 9, 2005. (hence its use in reference to the offering of sacrifice to God). In the sacrificial language of the Greek version of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint, (prospherein) is used of the offerer's bringing the victim to the altar, and (anapherein) is used of the priest's offering up the selected portion upon the altar (see, for instance, , , , ). Elements 8th century Gelasian Sacramentary To describe the structure of the Anaphoras as it became standardized from the 4th century, we can look at the structure of the anaphoras in the Antiochene (or \\"West Syrian\\") family of liturgies, which display an order and logic that finds no equal elsewhere. This structure is still valid, with some significant variations typical of each rite, for the Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Church, while it was modified, both in the pattern and in the underlying theology, during the Protestant Reformation. Beginning with the Oxford Movement of the 1840s and after the Liturgical Reform Movement of the 1950s, a systematic examination of historic anaphoras began and this in turn has caused the reform of many Eucharistic prayers within mainline Protestant denominations. The structure of the standardized 4th century Antiochene anaphora, which is placed after the offertory and the Creed and comes before the Lord's Prayer, the Elevation and the Communion rites, can be summarized as follows: *Sursum Corda or Opening Dialogue: it is the introductory dialogue that opens with a liturgical greeting by the priest (for instance, \\"The Lord be with you\\" in the Roman Rite, or \\"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all\\" in the Byzantine Rite) and the response of the congregation or choir. Classic call and response ties together the response of the priest and congregation to the Glory of God. Then the priest exhorts those participating in the liturgy to lift up their hearts. When they express their agreement (\\"We lift them up to the Lord\\"), he then introduces the great theme of thanksgiving, in Greek (eucharistia), saying: \\"Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\\"; *Preface: is the great prayer of thanksgiving for the work of Salvation or for some special aspect of it; *Sanctus: is a hymn of praise adapted from beginning Holy, Holy, Holy immediately followed by the Benedictus taken from . This hymn is usually introduced by the expression of the desire of the community to unite itself with the heavenly Angelic liturgy; it also follows the words of Christ, taken from Mt 23:39: \\"For I say to you, you shall not see me henceforth till you say: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord\\", itself being a quotation of Psalm 118:26. *Post-Sanctus: is a prayer that links the Sanctus with the following part. It can be very short or resume the great theme of thanksgiving, giving ground for the following requests. *Institution narrative: is an account of the Last Supper, in which are pronounced the Words of Institution spoken by Jesus Christ, changing the bread and wine into his Body and Blood. *Anamnesis: is the statement in which the Church refers to the memorial character of the Eucharist itself and/or to the Passion, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ. *Oblation: is the offering to the Lord of the sacrifice of the Eucharistic bread and wine and of the prayers and thanksgiving of faithfuls. *Epiclesis: is the \\"invocation\\" or \\"calling down from on high\\" by which the priest invokes the Holy Spirit (or the power of His blessing or Christ in some early texts) upon the Eucharistic bread and wine; *Intercessions: is the prayer, sometimes long, in which the Church asks God to help all her members, living and dead, and all the humanity because of the grace given by the Eucharist. In this section there is usually the request to God to grant to the believers the same glory given to Mary and to the saints. The list of the living people who are commemorated (diptychs) includes generally the name of the current pope, patriarch, bishop recognized by the community; *Doxology: is a solemn hymn of praises to the Trinity. This structure can have variations in liturgical families different from the Antiochene one: in the East Syriac Rites the Epiclesis is just before the final doxology and in one case the Institution narrative is missing; the Intercessions can be found after the Preface in the Alexandrian Rite and even before the Sursum Corda in the Mozarabic Rite. An Epiclesis can be found before the Institution narrative in the Alexandrian Rite, and this place of the Epiclesis is the standard in the Roman Canon and in the Latin rites. The anaphoras are addressed by the Church to the Father, even if in antiquity there were cases of Eucharistic prayers addressed to Christ, as the anaphora of Gregory Nazianzen or partially the Third Anaphora of St. Peter (Sharar). Also, the Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church unusually has an Anaphora of the Virgin Mary.Glenday, David K. \\"Mary in the Liturgy: An Ethiopian Anaphora.\\" (1959): 222-226. Most parts of the anaphora, as the Preface, the Institution narrative, the Epiclesis, are always reserved to the celebrant, a bishop or a priest, while the faithfuls usually sung the Sanctus and some acclamations, which can be more or less frequent and length according to the specific rite. Sometime, particularly in the past, in both East and West the main celebrant said a part of his prayers inaudibly or covered by the choir. The Eastern Rites know many anaphoras, but each of them is almost completely invariable. On the contrary the Western Church had for centuries only one anaphora, the Roman Canon, but it has variable parts according to the liturgical year, mainly the Preface. In other Latin rites, as in the Mozarabic Rite or the Gallican rite also the post-sanctus and the prayer after the Institution narrative till the doxology are completely variable. Surviving examples Many ancient texts of anaphoras have survived, and even if no more in use, they are useful to trace the history of the anaphoras, and in general the history of the Eucharist during the centuries. Most of these texts became parts of anaphoras still in use. The earlier liturgical texts related to the celebration of the Eucharist are the chapters 9 and 10 of the Didache, even if there is not consensus among scholars if these texts are meant to be a Eucharist or not. We have next the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, called also the anaphora of Hippolytus, the Liturgy of the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions and the Liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions that developed in the famous Byzantine Anaphora now part of the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, through the lost Greek version of the Anaphora of the Twelve Apostles (of which we have a later Syrian version). The more ancient text of the Basilean family of anaphoras was found in 1960 in a Sahidic Coptic version,J.Doresse and E. Lanne, Un témoin archaique de la liturgie copte de S.Basile, Louvain, 1960 possibly a text written by St. Basil himself, and recent scholars believes that this text, united with the anaphora described in The Catechisms of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, has been the base for the Anaphora of St. James included in the Liturgy of St James. The present Byzantine text of the Anaphora included in the Liturgy of Saint Basil is the final development of this anaphoric family. In the East the more ancient text is probably the ancient form of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, followed by the Maronite Third Anaphora of St. Peter (said also Sharar) and by the Anaphora of Mar Theodore. Another important source is the anaphora described in the Mystagogical Cathecheses of Theodore of Mopsuestia.Tonneau and Devréesse, Les homélies catéchétiques de Theodore de Mopsueste, 1949 In Egypt we have the Anaphora of Barcellona (and its related Louvain Coptic Papyrus), the Prayer into the Euchologion of Serapion, the Deir Balyzeh Papyrus, the Strasbourg papyrus and the ancient Anaphora of Saint MarkCodex Vat gr. 1970 in Greek, which developed in the Coptic Liturgy of Saint Cyril. Scholars find structural similarities in between the Roman and Egyptian anaphoral traditions: for instance the Barcelona Papyrus, as well as Deir Balyzeh Papyrus, include an epiclesis before the Words of Institution as in the Roman Canon. The earliest text similar to the Roman Canon is the quoted in De Sacramentis of Ambrose which include prayers close to the Canon's prayers such as Quam Oblationem, Qui pridie, Unde et Memores, Supra quae - Suplices te. The Roman Canon's prayers Communicantes, Hanc igitur, and the post-consecration Memento etiam and Nobis quoque were added in the 5th century,Josef Andreas Jungmann, S.J., Missarum Sollemnia - Eine genetische Erklärung der römischen Messe (Herder, Vienna 1949), volume I, pages 70-71; cf.

Schmidt, Introductio in Liturgiam Occidentalem (Herder, Rome-Freiburg- Barcelona 1960), page 352 and it achieved practically its present form when modified by Gregory the Great (590-604)\\"Canon of the Mass\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church 2005 (see History of the Roman Canon). Eucharistic Prayer in Western Christianity When referring to the Western Christian uses, the term \\"Eucharistic Prayer\\" is more used than \\"anaphora\\", and sometime it refers only to the portion of the anaphora starting after the Sanctus because the Preface in the Latin rites is variable and follows the liturgical year. =Roman Rite of the Catholic Church= Between the Council of Trent and the reform of the Catholic Mass (liturgy), undertaken in 1969 (see Mass of Paul VI), the only anaphora used in the Roman Rite was the Roman Canon (or Canon of the Mass). For the history of the \\"Roman Canon\\" see also articles Canon of the Mass, Pre-Tridentine Mass and Tridentine Mass. With introduction in 1969 of the Mass of Paul VI, it was allowed to have multiple choices of Eucharistic Prayer, however the authorization of new Eucharistic Prayers is reserved to the Holy See.EUCHARISTIC PRAYERS I - IVThe Mystery of the Swiss Synod Eucharistic PrayerFrom One Eucharistic Prayer to Many: How it Happened and Why All the new Eucharistic Prayers follow the Antiochene structure with the noticeable difference that the Epiclesis is placed, according to the uses of the Roman tradition, before the Words of Institution and not after. The first approved Eucharistic Prayers are four: * Eucharistic Prayer n. 1: it is the ancient Roman Canon with minimal variations. This ancient text is especially appropriate for Sundays, unless for pastoral considerations Eucharistic Prayer III is preferred. * Eucharistic Prayer n. 2: it is based on the ancient Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition with some adaptations to bring it in line with the other prayers. It is quite short, so it is appropriate for weekday use. It has its own Preface, based on the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, but it can be substituted by the proper Preface of the Mass of the day; * Eucharistic Prayer n. 3: it is a new composition that uses the Antiochene structure filled with Alexandrine and Roman themes. Its use is preferred on Sundays and feast days and it is to be used with the proper Preface of the day; * Eucharistic Prayer n. 4: it is a new composition with a strong sacrificial wording and a fuller summary of salvation history. It has its own integral Preface which cannot be substituted. It is based on Eastern anaphoras; especially that of St. Basil the Great. In the years after the reform of Pope Paul VI other Eucharistic Prayers were authorized: * four Eucharistic Prayers for Various Needs and Occasions proposed by the Swiss Synod (these are sometimes called the \\"Swiss Synod Eucharistic Prayers\\") were approved by the Holy See on August 8, 1974. These four prayers, built as a single prayer with four thematic variations, have been allowed to be used in France since 1978, in Italy since 1980, and the English version was approved in 1995. * two Eucharistic Prayers for Masses of Reconciliation were approved provisionally (ad experimentum) in 1975; * three Eucharistic Prayers for Masses with Children were also approved provisionally in 1975. =Other Latin rites in the Catholic Church= A typical characteristic of the Latin rites different from the Roman Rite is the great variability of portions of the Roman Canon which change according to the liturgical year and the Mass. The Mozarabic Rite has as variable texts the Illatio (i.e. the Preface), the Post-Sanctus and the Post-Pridie, that is the prayer said between the Institution narrative and the doxology in place of the Intercessions which are placed before the Sursum Corda. In the Gallican Rite the Preface is named Contestatio or Immolatio and the Institution narrative is named Secreta or Mysterium The Ambrosian Rite during the centuries has lost its ancient variety, even if it maintains a richness of choices for the Preface and its first Eucharistic Prayer is slightly different form the Roman one mainly in the Words of Institution. Recently two typical additional ancient Eucharistic Prayers have been restored, to be used mainly on Easter and Holy Thursday. =Anglican Communion and Western Rite Orthodoxy= The Western Rite Orthodoxy uses adaptations to the Orthodox nous of the Roman Canon (Divine Liturgy of Saint Gregory) or of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer (Divine Liturgy of Saint Tikhon) or own reconstructions of ancient Gallican liturgies (Liturgy of Saint Germanus or The Liturgy of Saint John the Divine). =Methodist Rite= The United Methodist Church has twenty-two Eucharistic Prayers that are modeled on the pattern of the Antiochene pattern; these are contained in the Book of Worship. The \\"notion of a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving\\", dating back to Irenaeus, is emphasized in the United Methodist Church's \\"anamnesis and offering: 'And so in remembrance of these your mighty acts in Jesus Christ, we offer ourselves as a holy and living sacrifice, in union with Christ's offering for us, as we proclaim the mystery of faith: Christ has died...'\\" The Methodist Rite, as with the Presbyterian liturgy, places the Memorial Acclamation \\"after the anamnesis and offering\\". In both the Methodist Church of Great Britain and The United Methodist Church, the \\"post-Sanctus transitioned almost immediately to the Institution Narrative\\". In addition, the \\"offering was our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, and ourselves,\\" reflecting the theology of Thomas Cranmer and Methodism's Anglican patrimony in general. Antiochene Rites This important liturgical family includes many well studied historical anaphoras, as the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition, the Liturgy of the seventh book of the Apostolic Constitutions and the Liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions. The main currently used anaphoras belonging to this family are the following, divided by rite: =Byzantine= Anaphora in the Byzantine Rite The Byzantine Rite uses three anaphoras, which are the core part of the Divine Liturgies which take the same name: *The Anaphora of St. John Chrysostom; *The Anaphora of St. Basil, once used throughout the year, and now used only on some Sundays and feasts; *The Anaphora of St. James The anaphora is introduced with the Opening Dialogue between priest and choir/congregation:The Priest's Service Book. (2003). (Archbishop Dmitri, trans.). Dallas: Diocese of the South, Orthodox Church in America. :The priest chants: \\"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\\" :The choir/congregation respond: \\"And with thy spirit.\\" :Priest: \\"Let us lift up our hearts.\\" :Choir/Congregation: \\"We lift them up unto the Lord.\\" :Priest: \\"Let us give thanks unto the Lord.\\" :Choir/Congregation: \\"It is right and just to worship Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the Trinity one in essence and undivided.\\" While the above response is sung, the priest begins to pray the first part of the anaphora quietly, although in some places this is said aloud. This section, corresponding to the Preface in the Roman Rite, gives thanks to God for the mysteries of creation, redemption, and sanctification. It is followed by the choir and congregation singing the Sanctus. After the Sanctus follows a recapitulation of salvation history, especially the Incarnation, and leads into the words of Jesus over the bread and wine at the Mystical Supper, as Eastern Christians often refer to the Last Supper: \\"Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you, for the forgiveness of sins.\\" and \\"Drink ye all of this; this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\\" The priest always says these words aloud, and the congregation and choir respond: \\"Amen.\\" The priest continues with the Anamnesis in that it references Jesus' command, at least implicitly, to \\"do this in memory of me\\" and states that the gifts of bread and wine are offered to God in memory of Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and second coming. It culminates with the Oblation in which the bread and wine is lifted up while the priest exclaims: \\"Thine own of thine own we offer unto thee on behalf of all and for all.\\" While the people sing a hymn of thanksgiving and supplication, the priest prays the epiclesis. God the Father is invoked to send down the Holy Spirit in order to, according to the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, \\"...make this bread the precious Body of thy Christ... And that which is in this cup the precious Blood of thy Christ... Changing them by thy Holy Spirit.\\" This is the most solemn point of the anaphora, as it is from that point on the bread and wine are considered to be the literal body and blood of Christ and not from the Words of Institution as in some other traditions. The rest of the anaphora consists of a lengthy set of intercessions for the Church, its bishops and other clergy, the leaders of nations, the faithful departed, and the Church as a whole, as well as commemorations of the Saints, especially the Blessed Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, the saint being commemorated that day, and \\"Forefathers, Fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Preachers, Evangelists, Martyrs, Confessors, Ascetics, and for every righteous spirit in faith made perfect.\\" In the Byzantine Rite the anaphora, whether that of St. John Chrysostom or St. Basil, ends with the following doxology sung by the priest: \\"And grant us with one mouth and one heart to glorify and hymn thine all-honorable and magnificent name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.\\" The congregation and choir respond: \\"Amen.\\" =Syro-Antiochene= A West Syriac Rite liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church holding paterissa (crozier) The anaphoras currently used by the Syro-Antiochene Rite (or West Syriac Rite) are numerous and the main are: *Anaphora of Twelve Apostles *Anaphora of St. James, a different anaphora from the Byzantine Rite's one *Anaphora of St. Mark the Evangelist *Anaphora of St. Peter *Anaphora of St. John the Evangelist *Anaphora of St. Xystus of Rome *Anaphora of St. Julius of Rome *Anaphora of St. John Chrysostom, a different anaphora from the Byzantine Rite version *Anaphora of St. Cyril of Alexandria *Anaphora of St. Jacob of Serugh *Anaphora of St. Philoxenus of Mabbug *Anaphora of St. Severus of Antioch *Anaphora of Mar Jacob Bar-Salibi =Armenian= The Armenian Rite, used mainly by the Armenian Apostolic Church, uses currently the Anaphora of St. Athanasius. =Others= The Coptic Church, even if its own rite is the Alexandrian Rite, uses two anaphoras that belong to the literal tradition of the Antiochene rites: *Anaphora of St. Basil, a different anaphora from the Byzantine Rite's one, even if related and probably older *Anaphora of St Gregory The Antiochene Maronite Catholic Church is one of the richest if not the richest in the number of anaphoras contained in its Liturgy, most of them belong to the tradition of the Antiochene rites. There are at least seventy-two Maronite Anaphoras. Alexandrian Rite The main currently used anaphora of the Alexandrian Rite is the Liturgy of Saint Cyril the Great, which is a revision of the first Alexandrian Liturgy composed by Saint Mark. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church makes use of no less than 14 official anaphoras. Some Ethiopian monasteries use additional Anaphoras as a local practice. East Syriac Rite The more important currently used anaphoras of the East Syriac Rite are the following: *Anaphora of Addai and Mari, used today by different Churches in different versions due to many additions. *Anaphora of Mar Theodore of Mopsuestia, used from Advent until the Sunday of the Hossanas *Anaphora of Mar Nestorius, used for the Feast of the Epiphany, Commemoration of St. John the Baptist, Commemoration of the Greek Teachers, Wednesday liturgy of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and the Feast of the Passover (Holy Thursday) See also In some languages, the Anaphora is not distinguished from the Eucharistic Prayer, namely: *:cs:Eucharistická modlitba *:sv:Eukaristiska bönen *:it:Preghiera eucaristica *:la:Prex eucharistica *:nl:Eucharistisch gebed *:pl:Modlitwa eucharystyczna *:de:Hochgebet References External links *Texts of all the current Catholic Eucharistic Prayers *Historical Evolution of Ethiopian Anaphoras *Syriac Anaphoras *Explanation of the Maronite Divine Liturgy and its Traditions (broken link, retrieved 11-20-12) *The Anaphora Eparchy of Saint Maron Commentary on the Holy Mysteries (part 2) *The Holy Mystery of Offering (Qorbono) Eparchy of Saint Maron Commentary on the Holy Mysteries (part 1) *Holy Communion - Methodist Rite Category:Eucharist ","title":"Anaphora (liturgy)"},{"id":"2183112","text":"Selene was the personification of the moon in Greek mythology.

Early life Gernsheim was born in Worms. He was given his first musical training at home under his mother's care, then starting from the age of seven under Worms' musical director, Louis Liebe, a former pupil of Louis Spohr. His father, a prominent Jewish physician, moved the family to Frankfurt am Main in the aftermath of the year of revolutions, 1848, where he studied with Edward Rosenhain, brother of Jakob Rosenhain.Pitt, Lavender. . 1 August 1874 issue. J. Novello. v.52, p.512. He made his first public appearance as a concert pianist in 1850 and toured for two seasons, then settled with his family in Leipzig, where he studied piano with Ignaz Moscheles from 1852. He spent the years 1855–1860 in Paris, meeting Gioachino Rossini, Théodore Gouvy, Édouard Lalo and Camille Saint-Saëns. Career His travels afterwards took him to Saarbrücken, where in 1861 he took the conductor post vacated by Hermann Levi; to Cologne, where in 1865 Ferdinand Hiller appointed him to the staff of the Conservatory (his pupils there included Engelbert Humperdinck and Carl Lachmund); he then served as musical director of the Philharmonic Society of Rotterdam, 1874-1890. In the latter year he became a teacher at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, and in 1897 moved there to teach at the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he was elected to the senate in 1897. In 1877 he married Helene Hernsheim from Karlsruhe. Gernsheim was a prolific composer, especially of orchestral, chamber and instrumental music, and songs. Some of his works tend to Jewish subject-matter, but Gernsheim rarely made explicit references in his music to Jewish heritage. His third symphony, for example, was based on the legend of the Song of Miriam, but directly inspired by a performance of Handel’s Israel in Egypt. His earlier works show the influence of Schumann, and from 1868, when he first became friendly with Brahms, a Brahmsian influence is very palpable. Gernsheim's four symphonies (the first of which was written before the publication of Brahms' First Symphony) are an interesting example of the reception of Brahmsian style by a sympathetic and talented contemporary. Gernsheim's last works, most notably his Zu einem Drama (1902), show him moving away from that into something more personal. He died in Berlin. Due to his Jewish background, his work was banned in Nazi Germany, and his papers and a biography written about him by Karl Holl were removed from music libraries.http://www.warmaisa.de/index.php?id=4595 Style According to the few who have studied Friedrich Gernsheim’s music, he is usually categorized as a Romantic composer heavily influenced by Johannes Brahms. While he certainly did learn from the great composer, Gernsheim began his composition career prior to hearing Brahms and his influence was only discovered later. Christopher Fifield suggests that Gernsheim owes his “instrumentation, thematic shapes, accompaniments, and orchestral textures” to both Brahms and Max Bruch.Fifield, Christopher. . “The German Symphony 1870-1876” in The German Symphony Between Bethoven and Brahms: The Fall and Rise of a Genre. Farnham, VT. Ashgate Publishing Co: 2015. p.254 In fact, some believe Gernsheim’s symphonic work to resemble Bruch more than Brahms, but homages to both masters are present in his music. Unlike Bruch, however, Gernsheim is described as having his own “personal melodic language” and was more daring in his harmony, whereas Bruch was largely inspired by folk songs. After the premier of Gernsheim’s first symphony, which predated Brahms’s first symphony, Gernsheim’s themes were praised for possessing an “abundance of beautiful details,” many of which pass by the listener unnoticed in the first hearing. The same critic claimed that his treatment of instrumentation “reveals a very talented hand,” and many listeners preferred Gernsheim’s symphonies to those by Brahms. Bruch, for one, considered Gernsheim’s first symphony a work that “ranks without question among the best that has been written in this genre in our time.” He even called Brahms’s symphonies overrated and agreed with critics in that Gernsheim demonstrated a great advantage over those of his contemporaries: “its excellent orchestration.” On the other hand, some of Gernsheim’s critics and even his teacher, Ignaz Moscheles, said he fell into the same trap Bruckner did by composing short melodies or themes that were already too complicated to develop further. Granted, some of Gernsheim’s themes can seem fleeting and disconnected since he often inserts short, transitional motives, but he achieves a high degree of contrast between themes through his use of transitions and silence. Moscheles also admitted, after playing Gernsheim’s first piano quartet, that he composed “with great agility in the manner of Schumann” and the Romantic style of the time, but thought his clear motives were often sacrificed to “artificial counterpoint.” Many theorists and music critics today agree with this evaluation of the composer, saying his symphonies and other works tend to be discursive, but all admire his talent in orchestration and achievements in chamber music. In chamber settings, he wrote particularly well for strings and presented his most focused ideas and logical developments. His late orchestral works, such as his fourth symphony and the tone poem Zu Einem Drama, demonstrate the maturity reached in his chamber music but on a larger scale. Throughout his career, Gernsheim proved himself a somewhat conservative composer and a faithful student of Classical form.Jones, Gaynor G. \\"Friedrich Gernsheim\\" from Grove Music Online. https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/978161592630.article.10950 He composed under the belief that every measure should be “essential and inevitable,” which is undoubtedly present in his later works. The discursive ideas with small-scale developments that brought him criticism are often used to add variety within traditional structures. His music that follows sonata- allegro form, for example, usually include at least three expositional themes that establish structural patterns and allow him to undermine them. Common threads and relationships can be traced through his many themes, however, and Gernsheim uses them to achieve a certain balance in his music. Alexander Ringer calls this virtue “Gediegenheit,” or “decency and solidarity,” a principle that served as a constant guide in Gernsheim’s musical and personal life.Ringer, Alexander R. \\"Friedrich Gernsheim and the Lost Generation.

It is based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The overall goal for the publication, as stated by editor and co-founder, Sy Safransky, is to create a feeling of connection between contributors and readers.  History  In 1974, Sy Safransky started the magazine with co-founder, Mike Mathers, who left after 18 months. The partners borrowed $50 and solicited writing by friends and family for the first issue. Safransky typed up the material, Mathers drew illustrations, and it was printed on a copy machine. The first issue was titled the Chapel Hill Sun and was sold for $0.25 each.MacIver, Roderick, Art as a Way of Life, North Atlantic Books, 2009. Cf. pp.38-39. The title was later changed to The Sun. Readership was about 1000 for roughly the first decade and has now increased to more than 70,000. Safransky describes the magazine as one \\"that honors the mystery at the heart of existence.\\" In 1990, when readership reached roughly 10,000, Safransky dropped ads from the magazine and transformed it into a reader-supported publication. Safransky believes this has \\"allowed for an uncommon atmosphere of intimacy in our pages.\\" Format The Sun’s format features a lengthy interview with a “deep thinker” at the front of each issue, followed by fiction, nonfiction and photography.

Horovitz, Joseph, in Grove Music Online (2001) Biography Horovitz was born in Vienna, Austria, into a Jewish family which emigrated to England in 1938 to escape the Nazis. His father was the publisher Béla Horovitz, the co-founder in 1923, with Ludwig Goldscheider, of Phaidon Press. His sister was the classical music promoter Hannah Horovitz (1936-2010). After completing his schooling at The City of Oxford High School Horovitz studied music and modern languages at New College, Oxford, where his teachers included R. O. Morris, Percy Scholes, Bernard Rose and Egon Wellesz.Conway, Paul. 'Joseph Horovitz at 90', in Musical Opinion, October 2016 He later attended the Royal College of Music in London, studying composition with Gordon Jacob. Horovitz then undertook a year of further study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. His musical career began in 1950, when he became music director at the Bristol Old Vic. He was subsequently active as a conductor of ballet and opera, and toured Europe and the United States. Horovitz married Anna in 1956, shortly after coaching at the bi-centenary celebration for Mozart and Glyndeborne. They honeymooned in Majorca, staying in Paguera and visiting Valldemossa. He later used these two names for two clarinet pieces, based on Spanish folk-tunes he had heard there. He has been Professor of Composition at the Royal College of Music since 1961, and a Council Member of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain since 1970. Between 1969 and 1996 he belonged to the board of the Performing Rights Society. Music His works include 16 ballets, including Alice in Wonderland (1953) written for Anton Dolin's Festival Ballet Company, and two one-act operas from the 1950s (The Dumb Wife, libretto Peter Shaffer, and Gentlemen’s Island, libretto Gordon Snell). There is also a more recent three-act opera, Ninotchka (2006), based on the 1939 MGM film starring Greta Garbo. Among his nine concertos, many showing jazz influences, are the Violin Concerto (1950), one of his most serious works, directly influenced by his studies with Nadia Boulanger, the Clarinet Concerto (1948, revised 1956), the Euphonium Concerto (perhaps his most overtly popular concerto in style), and the Jazz Concerto for piano, strings and percussion (1966). The latter was originally composed for George Malcolm to play on the harpsichord and combines jazz and baroque styles.'Horovitz Four Concertos', reviewed in Gramophone The first three string quartets were student works (the third accepted as the final part of his Oxford Bachelor of Music degree in 1948). The fourth, described by the composer as \\"dark and disturbing\\", was composed in 1953 following four years of work on mostly light-hearted music for ballet and opera.Notes to Carducci Classics CS CSQ 6482 (2007) His fifth string quartet, which according to Daniel Snowman is \\"probably his most profound work\\", was first performed to honour the 60th birthday of Ernst Gombrich at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1969 by the Amadeus Quartet. The children's cantata Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo (1970) is perhaps his most popular success.Captain Noah and his Floating Zoo, Wise Music The libretto by Michael Flanders is an adaptation of the Biblical tale of Noah found in Genesis chapters 6–9. It is one of a series of \\"pop cantatas\\" commissioned for school use by the publishers Novello, including The Daniel Jazz (1963) by Herbert Chappell, Jonah-Man Jazz (1966) by Michael Hurd and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Andrew Lloyd- Webber (1968). The piece was first recorded by the Kings Singers in 1972 on an Argo LP.Dutton Vocalion CDLF8120, reissued 2005 His more serious religious vocal works include the psalm setting Sing unto the Lord a New Song (1971), which was the first work commissioned from a Jewish composer for the choir of St Paul's Cathedral. The oratorio Samson for voices and brass band followed in 1977, a commission from the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain. Many of Horovitz's most substantial works were written for wind orchestra and brass band, starting with the Sinfonietta in 1968. Ad Astra for concert band was commissioned by the RAF in 1990 and draws on the composer's memory of London in The Blitz.Miller, Dr Malcolm. 'From Noah to Ninotchka via Samson and psalms', in Jewish Renaissance, July 2006, p 31 In 1959, Horovitz was awarded the Commonwealth Medal, and since then he has received many other awards for his compositions. The city of Vienna awarded him the Gold Order of Merit in 1996. His music for television has included Lillie, Rumpole of the Bailey, The Search for the Nile, The Fight Against Slavery, Wessex Tales and Partners in Crime.

It began when the caliph Uthman was assassinated by rebels in 656 and continued through the four-year reign of Uthman's successor, Ali. It ended in 661 when Ali's heir Hasan ibn Ali concluded a treaty acknowledging the rule of Muawiyah, the first Umayyad caliph. Background The Islamic caliphate expanded very quickly under the first three caliphs. Muawiyah I was appointed Governor of Syria by Umar in 639, after the previous Governor, Muawiyah's elder brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, died in a plague along with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (the Governor before him) and 25,000 other people. The rapid Muslim conquest of the Levant and of Egypt and the consequent Byzantine losses in manpower and territory meant that the Eastern Roman Empire found itself struggling for survival. The Sasanian Empire had already collapsed. The Islamic empire expanded at an unprecedented rate, but there was a cost associated with it. Many desert nomads and some bandits living between present-day Iraq and Saudi Arabia also joined in, not out of commitment to Islam but to share the spoils and benefit from the change in the social order, after the defeat of the Sasanian Empire. Byzantine Empire and Sasanian Empire, 600 CE Before Islam, the Roman–Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sasanian wars had occurred every few years for hundreds of years between 69 BCE and 629 CE. High taxes were imposed on the populations in both the Byzantine and Sassanid empires to finance these wars. There was also continuous bloodshed of the people during these wars. The Arab tribes in Mesopotamia were paid by the Sasanians to act as their mercenaries, while those in Syria were paid likewise by the Byzantines. Each side maintained an Arab satellite state – the Sasanians the Lakhmids, and the Byzantines the Ghassanids – which they used to fight each other in a proxy war.A Chronology Of Islamic History 570-1000 CE, By H.U. Rahman 1999 Page 10 The Syrians and the Mesopotamians had been fighting each other for centuries. Therefore, each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic state to be in their area.Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War By Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi Page 32 As Uthman became very old, Marwan I, a relative of Muawiyah I, slipped into the vacuum and became his secretary, slowly assuming more control and relaxing some of these restrictions. Marwan I had previously been excluded from positions of responsibility. = Qurra Dispute = There was also a movement toward more autonomous tribal groupings, which was particularly strong in Kufa, in Mesopotamia; they wanted to rule their own states. Among them developed a group called the Qurra, which later became known as the Kharijites. The earliest reference to these people are as Ahl al-Qurra, the people of the village, those who fought with Abu Bakr against the desert tribes of Yamama during the Ridda wars when some of the tribes refused to pay the zakat.Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith by Aisha Bewley, page 14, with text from Al- Baladuri Afterwards they were granted trusteeship over some of the lands in Sawad in Mesopotamia and were now called Ahl al Ayyam, those who had taken part in the eastern conquests.Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 13 Some modern scholars like R. E. Brunnow trace the origins of the Qurra and the Kharijites back to Bedouin stock and desert tribesmen, who had become soldiers not out of commitment to Islam but to share the spoils. Brunnow held that the Kharijites were Bedouin Arabs or full blooded Arabs.Modern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites By Hussam S. Timani Page 49 The Qurra received the highest stipend of the Muslim army and they had the use of the best lands that they came to regard as their private domain. The Qurra received stipends varying between 2000 and 3000 dirhams, while the majority of the rest of the troops received only 250 to 300 dirhams. The other Ridda tribesmen in Kufa in Mesopotamia, resented the special position given to the Qurra. The tension between the Ridda tribesmen and the Qurra threatened the Qurra's newly acquired prestige. The Qurra therefore felt obliged to defend their position in the new but rapidly changing society. The Qurra were mainly based in Kufa. They had not been involved in Syria. Later, when Uthman declined to give them more lands in PersiaModern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites By Hussam S. Timani Page 61-65 about the writings of M. A. Shahban, In his Islamic History A.D. 600-750 (A.H. 132): A new Interpretation (1971) they felt that their status was being reduced and therefore started to cause trouble. He also removed the distinction between the Ridda and pre-Ridda tribesmen which was not to their liking and lessened their prestige.Modern Intellectual Readings of the Kharijites By Hussam S. Timani Page 61 Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 14 with text from Al- Baladuri As a result, they rebelled. Some of the people with their tribal names as Qurra had been expelled from Kufa, for fomenting trouble and were sent to Muawiyah in Syria. Then they were sent to Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid, who sent them to Uthman in Medina. In Medina they took an oath that they would not cause trouble and following the example of Muhammad, Uthman accepted their word and let them go.Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 16 They then split up and went to various different Muslim centers and started fomenting rebellion, particularly in Egypt. The Qurra then felt that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari could look after their interests better. In 655 the Qurra stopped Uthman's governor Sa'id ibn al-'As at Jara'a, preventing him from entering Kufa and declared Abu Musa al-Ashari to be their governor.Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 14 In 656, the Qurra approached Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the son of Abu Bakr and the adopted son of Ali and asked him why he was not a governor. They had fought under the service of his father in the Ridda wars. They also asked Uthman's adopted son, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa, whom had refused to appoint as a governor of any province, why he was not a governor. = Siege of Uthman = As Muawiyah and Caliph Uthman were preparing to besiege Constantinople, in 656, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr showed some Egyptians the house of Uthman. Finding the gate of Uthman's house strongly guarded by his supporters, the Qurra climbed the back wall and sneaked inside, leaving the guards on the gate unaware of what was going on inside. Hassan and Hussein were also guarding Uthman at the time.A Chronology Of Islamic History 570-1000 CE, By H.U. Rahman 1999 Page 53 The rebels entered his room and struck him on the head.The Many Faces of Faith: A Guide to World Religions and Christian Traditions By Richard R. Losch Uthman had been besieged in his palace for 49 days before he was killed. Ali had done a great deal to attempt to save Uthman; however, Marwan prevented Ali from being able to help Uthman. Uthman only listened to the advice of Marwan and Saeed bin Aas, and Marwan did his best to act as a barrier between Ali and Uthman. Uthman's death had a polarizing effect in the Muslim world at the time. Questions were raised not only regarding his character and policies but also about the relationship between Muslims and the state, religious beliefs regarding rebellion and governance, and the qualifications of rulership in Islam.Valerie Jon Hoffman, The Essentials of Ibadi Islam, pg. 8. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2012. = Succession of Ali = The people of Medina asked Ali, who had been chief judge in Medina, to become the Caliph and he accepted. Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, a relative of Uthman, and Marwan I wanted the murderers of Uthman arrested, and accused Ali. Ali denied responsibility, but the conspirators continued to conspire against him. The conspirators felt that if there were peace, they would be arrested for the killing of Uthman.Hadhrat Ayesha Siddiqa By Allamah Syed Sulaiman Nadvi Page 44 Many of them later became the Kharijites and eventually killed Ali. Battle of the Camel Aisha bint Abu Bakr (Muhammad's widow), Talhah ibn Ubayd-Allah, and Zubayr ibn al- Awam opposed Ali's succession and gathered in Mecca calling for vengeance against Uthman's killers and election of new caliph through Shura. Later they moved to Basra taking it from Ali's governor, with the intention of strengthening their numbers. Ali in response sent his son Hasan and the leaders of Kufan mutineers to raise an army in Kufa. Ali himself followed them soon; with the combined army, they marched against Basra. The armies met outside Basra. After three days of failed negotiations, battle started in the afternoon of 8 December 656 and lasted till the evening. Zubayr left the field without fighting but was pursued and killed. Ali's army emerged victorious and Talha was also killed. After admonishing Ayesha, Ali sent her back to Medina, escorted by her brother Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Marwan probably paid allegiance to Ali and the latter let him go. Battle of Siffin Combat between the forces of Ali and Muawiyah I during the Battle of Siffin, from the Tarikhnama Ali's inability to punish the murderers of Uthman and Muawiyah's refusal to pledge allegiance eventually led Ali to move his army north to confront Muawiyah. The two armies encamped themselves at Siffin for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Neither side wanted to fight. Then on 29 July 657 (11th Safar), the Mesopotamians under Ashtar's command, the Qurra in Ali's army, who had their own camp, started the fighting in earnest. The battle lasted three days. The loss of life was terrible. Suddenly one of the Syrians, Ibn Lahiya, out of fear of further civil war and unable to bear the spectacle rode forward with a copy of the Quran on the ears of his horse to call for judgement by the book of Allah, and the other Syrians followed suit. Everyone on both sides took up the cry, eager to avoid killing their fellow Muslims - except for the conspirators. The majority of Ali's followers supported arbitration. Nasr b Muzahim, in one of the earliest sources states that al-Ashath ibn Qays, one of Ali's key supporters and a Kufan, then stood up and said: > O company of Muslims! You have seen what happened in the day which has > passed. In it some of the Arabs have been annihilated. By Allah, I have > reached the age which Allah willed that I reach. but I have never ever seen > a day like this. Let the present convey to the absent! If we fight tomorrow, > it will be the annihilation of the Arabs and the loss of what is sacred. I > do not make this statement out of fear of death, but I am an aged man who > fears for the women and children tomorrow if we are annihilated. O Allah, I > have looked to my people and the people of my deen and not empowered anyone. > There is no success except by Allah.

So the fighting stopped.Muawiya Restorer of the Muslim Faith By Aisha Bewley Page 22 from Ibn Hisham from Ibn Muzahim died 212 AH from Abu Mikhnaf died 170 AH Every time Ali tried to negotiate the Qurra and the Sabait started wars and launched night attacks, fearing that if there was peace, then they will be arrested.Hadhrat Ayesha Siddiqa her life and works by Allamah Syed Sulaiman Nadvi translated by Syed Athar Husain and published by Darul Ishaat Page 44 Arbitration It was decided that the Syrians and the residents of Kufa should nominate an arbitrator, each to decide between 'Ali and Mu'awiya. The Syrians' choice fell on 'Amr bin al-A'as who was the rational soul and spokesman of Muawiya. 'Amr ibn al-'As was one of the generals involved in conquering Syria and also Egypt.Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi, Page 31 A few years earlier 'Amr ibn al-'As with 9,000 men in Palestine had found himself confronting Heraclius' 100,000 army until Khalid crossed the Syrian desert from Mesopotamia to assist him. He was a highly skilled negotiator and had previously been used in negotiations with the Heraclius the Roman Emperor.Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Futuh ash-Sham by al-Waqidi Translated by Sulayman al-Kindi Ali wanted Malik Ashtar or Abdullah bin 'Abbas to be appointed as an arbitrator for the people of Kufa, but the Qurra strongly demurred, alleging that men like these two were responsible for the war and, therefore, ineligible for that office of trust. They nominated Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as their arbitrator (during the time of 'Uthman, they had appointed Abu Musa al-Ash'ari as the Governor of Kufa and removed 'Uthman's governor before they started fighting 'Uthman). Ali found it expedient to agree to this choice in order to ward off bloody dissension in his army. According to Usd al-G̲h̲āba, Ali therefore took care to personally explain to the arbitrators, \\"You are arbiters on condition that you decide according to the Book of God, and if you are not so inclined you should not deem yourselves to be arbiters.\\"\\"Usd al-G̲h̲āba\\", vol 3, p. 246. Name of book needed When the arbitrators assembled at Dumat al-Jandal, which lay midway between Kufa and Syria and had for that reason been selected as the place for the announcement of the decision, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand. When the time arrived for taking a decision about the caliphate, Amr bin al-A'as convinced Abu Musa al-Ashari that they should deprive both Ali and Mu'awiya of the caliphate, and give the Muslims the right to elect the caliph. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari decided to act accordingly. As the time for announcing the verdict approached, the people belonging to both parties assembled. 'Amr bin al-A'as requested Abu Musa take the lead in announcing the decision he favoured. Abu Musa al-Ash'ari agreed to open the proceedings, and said, \\"We have devised a solution after a good deal of thought and it may put an end to all contention and separatist tendencies. It is this. Both of us remove 'Ali as well as Mu'awiya from the caliphate. The Muslims are given the right to elect a caliph as they think best.\\" On his turn 'Amr bin al-A'as stated that he agreed with the part of Abu Musa Ash'ari's verdict that 'Ali should be deposed but he himself was in favour of retaining Mua'wiyah on his post. Ali refused to accept the verdict.H.U. Rahman, A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 CE, p.60Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia edited by Alexander Mikaberidze, p. 836 This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The most vociferous opponents of Ali in his camp were the very same people who had forced Ali to appoint their arbitrator, the Qurra.H.U. Rahman, A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 CE, p.59 Feeling that Ali could no longer look after their interests and that they could be arrested for the murder of 'Uthman if there were peace, they broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan, \\"arbitration belongs to God alone.\\" The Qurra then became known as the Kharijites (\\"those who leave\\"). Conflict with Kharijites  In 659 Ali's forces finally moved against the Kharijites and they finally met in the Battle of Nahrawan. Although Ali won the battle, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing. Tom Holland writes \\"Ali won a victory over them as crushing as it was to prove pyrrhic: for all he had done, in effect was to fertilise the soil of Mesopotamia with the blood of their martyrs. Three years later, and there came the inevitable blowback: a Kharijite assassin.\\"In the shadow of the sword, The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World By Tom Holland, Abacus Page 399 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it hard to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions to exert control over his areas and as a result later spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites. As a result, on the Eastern front, Ali found it hard to expand the state.A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 By H. U. Rahman Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. On the 19th of Ramadan, while Praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Kharijite Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer.name=\\"Tabatabaei 1979 192\\" When Alī was assassinated, Muawiyah had the largest and the most organized and disciplined force in the Muslim Empire. Peace treaty with Hassan Six months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Hasan ibn Ali made a peace treaty with Muawiyah. By now Hassan only ruled the area around Kufa. In the Hasan-Muawiya treaty, Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he be just to the people and keep them safe and secure and after his death he does not establish a dynasty.The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate By Wilferd Madelung Page 232 In the year 661, Muawiyah was crowned as caliph at a ceremony in Jerusalem. Ali's caliphate had lasted for four years. After the treaty with Hassan, Muawiyah ruled for nearly 20 years most of which were spent expanding the state.

Spaceland is a science fiction novel by American mathematician and computer scientist Rudy Rucker, and published in 2002 by Tor Books. In a tribute to Edwin Abbott's Flatland, a classic mathematical fantasy about a 2-dimensional being (A. Square) who receives a surprise visit from a higher-dimensional sphere, Rudy Rucker's Spaceland describes the life of Joe Cube, an average, modern-day Silicon Valley hotshot who one day discovers the fourth dimension from an unexpected visitation. Plot summary Joe Cube is a high tech executive waiting for his company's IPO. On the New Year's Eve before the new millennium, trying to impress his wife Jena, he brings home a prototype of his company's new product (a TV screen that turns standard television broadcasting into a 3D image). It brings no warmth to their cooling marriage, but it does attract the attention of somebody else. Joe is suddenly contacted by a Momo, a woman from the fourth dimension she calls the All, of which our entire world (which she calls Spaceland) is like nothing but the thin surface of a rug. Momo has a business proposition for Joe that she won't let him refuse. She is bent on making him start a company that will create a specific product that she will supply. The upside potential becomes much clearer for Joe once Momo \\"augments\\" him, by helping him grow a new eye on a 4D stalk, giving him the power to see in four-dimensional directions, as well as the ability to see into our dimension using a four-dimension perspective.

Initially at the position (10, 10), the particle tends to move to the central point μ. A 3D simulation with θ = 1.0, σ = 3, μ = (0, 0, 0) and the initial position (10, 10, 10). In mathematics, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a stochastic process with applications in financial mathematics and the physical sciences. Its original application in physics was as a model for the velocity of a massive Brownian particle under the influence of friction. It is named after Leonard Ornstein and George Eugene Uhlenbeck. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a stationary Gauss–Markov process, which means that it is a Gaussian process, a Markov process, and is temporally homogeneous. In fact, it is the only nontrivial process that satisfies these three conditions, up to allowing linear transformations of the space and time variables. Over time, the process tends to drift towards its mean function: such a process is called mean-reverting. The process can be considered to be a modification of the random walk in continuous time, or Wiener process, in which the properties of the process have been changed so that there is a tendency of the walk to move back towards a central location, with a greater attraction when the process is further away from the center. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can also be considered as the continuous-time analogue of the discrete-time AR(1) process.  Definition  The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process x_t is defined by the following stochastic differential equation: :dx_t = -\\\\theta \\\\, x_t \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma \\\\, dW_t where \\\\theta > 0 and \\\\sigma > 0 are parameters and W_t denotes the Wiener process. An additional drift term is sometimes added: :dx_t = \\\\theta (\\\\mu - x_t) \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma \\\\, dW_t where \\\\mu is a constant. In financial mathematics, this is also known as the Vasicek model. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is sometimes also written as a Langevin equation of the form : \\\\frac{dx_t}{dt} = -\\\\theta \\\\, x_t + \\\\sigma \\\\, \\\\eta(t) where \\\\eta(t), also known as white noise, stands in for the supposed derivative d W_t / dt of the Wiener process.Risken (1984) However, d W_t / dt does not exist because the Wiener process is nowhere differentiable, and so the Langevin equation is, strictly speaking, only heuristic. In physics and engineering disciplines, it is nevertheless a common representation for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and similar stochastic differential equations.  Fokker–Planck equation representation  The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can also be described in terms of a probability density function, P(x,t), which specifies the probability of finding the process in the state x at time t. This function satisfies the Fokker–Planck equation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\theta \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} (x P) + D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 P}{\\\\partial x^2} where D = \\\\sigma^2 / 2. This is a linear parabolic partial differential equation which can be solved by a variety of techniques. The transition probability P(x,t\\\\mid x',t') is a Gaussian with mean x' e^{-\\\\theta (t-t')} and variance \\\\frac{D}{\\\\theta} \\\\left( 1 - e^{-2\\\\theta (t-t')} \\\\right): : P(x,t\\\\mid x',t') = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2 \\\\pi D (1-e^{-2\\\\theta (t-t')})}} \\\\exp \\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2D} \\\\frac{(x - x' e^{-\\\\theta (t-t')})^2}{1 - e^{-2\\\\theta (t-t')}}\\\\right] This gives the probability of the state x occurring at time t given initial state x' at time t' < t. Equivalently, P(x,t\\\\mid x',t') is the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation with initial condition P(x,t') = \\\\delta(x - x').  Mathematical properties  Assuming x_0 is constant, the mean is : \\\\operatorname E(x_t)=x_0 e^{-\\\\theta t}+\\\\mu(1-e^{-\\\\theta t}) and the covariance is : \\\\operatorname{cov}(x_s,x_t) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\theta} \\\\left( e^{-\\\\thetat-s} - e^{-\\\\theta(t+s)} \\\\right) The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is an example of a Gaussian process that has a bounded variance and admits a stationary probability distribution, in contrast to the Wiener process; the difference between the two is in their \\"drift\\" term. For the Wiener process the drift term is constant, whereas for the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process it is dependent on the current value of the process: if the current value of the process is less than the (long-term) mean, the drift will be positive; if the current value of the process is greater than the (long-term) mean, the drift will be negative. In other words, the mean acts as an equilibrium level for the process. This gives the process its informative name, \\"mean-reverting.\\" = Properties of sample paths = A temporally homogeneous Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process can be represented as a scaled, time-transformed Wiener process: : x_t = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\theta}} e^{-\\\\theta t} W_{e^{2 \\\\theta t}} where W_t is the standard Wiener process. Equivalently, with the change of variable s = e^{2 \\\\theta t} this becomes : W_s = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\theta}}{\\\\sigma} s^{1/2} x_{(\\\\ln s) / (2\\\\theta)}, \\\\qquad s > 0 Using this mapping, one can translate known properties of W_t into corresponding statements for x_t. For instance, the law of the iterated logarithm for W_t becomes : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\sup \\\\frac{x_t}{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\sigma^2 / \\\\theta) \\\\ln t}} = 1, \\\\quad \\\\text{with probability 1.} = Formal solution = The stochastic differential equation for x_t can be formally solved by variation of parameters.Gardiner (1985) p. 106 Writing : f(x_t, t) = x_t e^{\\\\theta t} \\\\, we get : \\\\begin{align} df(x_t,t) & = \\\\theta\\\\,x_t\\\\,e^{\\\\theta t}\\\\, dt + e^{\\\\theta t}\\\\, dx_t \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = e^{\\\\theta t}\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\mu \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma\\\\,e^{\\\\theta t}\\\\, dW_t. \\\\end{align} Integrating from 0 to t we get : x_t e^{\\\\theta t} = x_0 + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\theta s}\\\\theta\\\\,\\\\mu \\\\, ds + \\\\int_0^t \\\\sigma\\\\,e^{\\\\theta s}\\\\, dW_s \\\\, whereupon we see : x_t = x_0\\\\,e^{-\\\\theta t} + \\\\mu\\\\,(1-e^{-\\\\theta t}) + \\\\sigma \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\theta (t-s)}\\\\, dW_s. \\\\, From this representation, the first moment (i.e. the mean) is shown to be : \\\\operatorname E(x_t)=x_0 e^{-\\\\theta t}+\\\\mu(1-e^{-\\\\theta t}) \\\\\\\\!\\\\ assuming x_0 is constant. Moreover, the Itō isometry can be used to calculate the covariance function by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{cov}(x_s,x_t) & = \\\\operatorname E[(x_s - \\\\operatorname E[x_s])(x_t - \\\\operatorname E[x_t])] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = \\\\operatorname E \\\\left[ \\\\int_0^s \\\\sigma e^{\\\\theta (u-s)}\\\\, dW_u \\\\int_0^t \\\\sigma e^{\\\\theta (v-t)}\\\\, dW_v \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = \\\\sigma^2 e^{-\\\\theta (s+t)} \\\\operatorname E \\\\left[ \\\\int_0^s e^{\\\\theta u}\\\\, dW_u \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\theta v}\\\\, dW_v \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\theta} \\\\, e^{-\\\\theta (s+t)}(e^{2\\\\theta \\\\min(s,t)}-1) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\theta} \\\\left( e^{-\\\\thetat-s} - e^{-\\\\theta(t+s)} \\\\right). \\\\end{align} = Numerical sampling = By using discretely sampled data at time intervals of width t, the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process are asymptotically normal to their true values.

Consider an urn containing n blue and yellow balls. At each step a ball is chosen at random and replaced by a ball of the opposite colour. Let X_n be the number of blue balls in the urn after n steps. Then \\\\frac{X_{[nt]} - n/2}{\\\\sqrt{n}} converges in law to an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as n tends to infinity.  Applications  = In physical sciences = The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is a prototype of a noisy relaxation process. Consider for example a Hookean spring with spring constant k whose dynamics is highly overdamped with friction coefficient \\\\gamma. In the presence of thermal fluctuations with temperature T, the length x(t) of the spring will fluctuate stochastically around the spring rest length x_0; its stochastic dynamic is described by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\theta &=k/\\\\gamma, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & =x_0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma &=\\\\sqrt{2k_B T/\\\\gamma}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\sigma is derived from the Stokes–Einstein equation D=\\\\sigma^2/2=k_B T/\\\\gamma for the effective diffusion constant. In physical sciences, the stochastic differential equation of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is rewritten as a Langevin equation : \\\\dot{x}(t) = - \\\\frac{k}{\\\\gamma}( x(t) - x_0 ) + \\\\xi(t) where \\\\xi(t) is white Gaussian noise with \\\\langle\\\\xi(t_1)\\\\xi(t_2)\\\\rangle = 2 k_B T/\\\\gamma\\\\, \\\\delta(t_1-t_2). Fluctuations are correlated as : \\\\langle (x(t_0)-x_0)(x(t_0+t)-x_0) \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{k_B T}{k} \\\\exp(-t/\\\\tau) with correlation time \\\\tau = \\\\gamma/k.

The parameter \\\\mu represents the equilibrium or mean value supported by fundamentals; \\\\sigma the degree of volatility around it caused by shocks, and \\\\theta the rate by which these shocks dissipate and the variable reverts towards the mean. One application of the process is a trading strategy known as pairs trade.Advantages of Pair Trading: Market NeutralityAn Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Framework for Pairs Trading = In evolutionary biology = The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process has been proposed as an improvement over a Brownian motion model for modeling the change in organismal phenotypes over time. A Brownian motion model implies that the phenotype can move without limit, whereas for most phenotypes natural selection imposes a cost for moving too far in either direction.  Generalizations  It is possible to extend Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes to processes where the background driving process is a Lévy process (instead of a simple Brownian motion). In addition, in finance, stochastic processes are used where the volatility increases for larger values of X. In particular, the CKLS (Chan–Karolyi–Longstaff–Sanders) processChan et al. (1992) with the volatility term replaced by \\\\sigma\\\\,x^\\\\gamma\\\\, dW_t can be solved in closed form for \\\\gamma=1, as well as for \\\\gamma=0, which corresponds to the conventional OU process. Another special case is \\\\gamma=1/2, which corresponds to the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model (CIR-model). =Higher dimensions= A multi-dimensional version of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, denoted by the N-dimensional vector \\\\mathbf{x}_t, can be defined from : d \\\\mathbf{x}_t = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} \\\\, \\\\mathbf{x}_t \\\\, dt + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\, d\\\\mathbf{W}_t. where \\\\mathbf{W}_t is an N-dimensional Wiener process, and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} are constant N×N matrices.Gardiner (1985), p. 109 The solution is : \\\\mathbf{x}_t = e^{-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} t} \\\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}(t-t')} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\, d\\\\mathbf{W}_{t'} and the mean is : \\\\operatorname E(\\\\mathbf{x}_t) = e^{-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} t} \\\\operatorname E(\\\\mathbf{x}_0). Note that these expressions make use of the matrix exponential. The process can also be described in terms of the probability density function P(\\\\mathbf{x},t), which satisfies the Fokker–Planck equationGardiner (1985), p. 97 : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\beta_{ij} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_i} (x_j P) + \\\\sum_{i,j} D_{ij} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 P}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\, \\\\partial x_j}. where the matrix \\\\boldsymbol{D} with components D_{ij} is defined by \\\\boldsymbol{D} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^T / 2. As for the 1d case, the process is a linear transformation of Gaussian random variables, and therefore itself must be Gaussian. Because of this, the transition probability P(\\\\mathbf{x},t\\\\mid\\\\mathbf{x}',t') is a Gaussian which can be written down explicitly. If the real parts of the eigenvalues of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} are larger than zero, a stationary solution P_{\\\\text{st}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) moreover exists, given by : P_{\\\\text{st}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = (2 \\\\pi)^{-N/2} (\\\\det \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega})^{-1/2} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{x}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\right) where the matrix \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} is determined from \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^T = 2 \\\\boldsymbol{D}.Risken (1984), p. 156  See also  * Stochastic calculus * Wiener process * Gaussian process * Mathematical finance * The Vasicek model of interest rates * Short rate model * Diffusion * Fluctuation-dissipation theorem  Notes   References    * *  External links  *Review of Statistical Arbitrage, Cointegration, and Multivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, Attilio Meucci *A Stochastic Processes Toolkit for Risk Management, Damiano Brigo, Antonio Dalessandro, Matthias Neugebauer and Fares Triki *Simulating and Calibrating the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, M.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed November 29, 2012 tributary of the Mississippi River in central Minnesota in the United States. It drains small lakes in Stearns County. In the Ojibwe language it is called Ozaagi-ziibi, meaning \\"River of the Sauks\\". It issues from Lake Osakis on the Todd County line and flows east through Guernsey Lake, Little Sauk Lake and Juergens Lake, then south through Sauk Lake and past Sauk Centre, southeast past Melrose and Richmond, then northeast through Cedar Island Lake and Zumwalde Lake, past Cold Spring and Waite Park to the Mississippi River north of St. Cloud. At St. Cloud, MN, the river has a mean annual discharge of 342 cubic feet per second.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/mn/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=05270500&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw The rapids that occur south of the river's mouth on the Mississippi River lent their name to the nearby city of Sauk Rapids. History In 1847, the Mississippi Chippewa ceded their lands about the Sauk River to the United States for the purpose of establishing a homeland for the Winnebagoes, who at the time were being removed out of Wisconsin. However, due to continued skirmishes between the Ojibwe (Chippewa) and the Dakota, the Winnebagoes were placed in constant danger. By their request, the United States relocated the Winnebagoes to south-central Minnesota, then to South Dakota and finally Nebraska. Some of the Winnebagoes, however, returned to Wisconsin despite their removal. The river is named after the Sauk tribe, also called the Sac or Meskwaki, some of whom had come to the area (mostly settled by Sioux or Chippewa) after the Black Hawk War; this tribe now has concentrations in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. The wars between the Sioux and the Chippewa, spurred on by the French fur traders who often sided with the Chippewa, resulted in the establishment of a common hunting grounds to divert conflict between the tribes. This somewhat unsuccessful \\"neutral\\" area was bordered by the Crow River on the south and the Sauk on the north. Early interventions by the white man marked the ensuing decline of Indian populations in this area. The fur traders were the first Europeans into this area, representatives of both the Hudson's Bay Company and French interests, pursuing the fur trade as early as the late 18th century. Abundant beaver and other fur types were paramount to these fur traders. The development of the Red River Valley and points in between Minneapolis – St. Paul and Winnipeg provided the first push for settlement in the area. By the late 1850s numerous settlements started to develop along the Sauk River and adjacent areas. The Red River Trails required various fording points across the river, and some of these sites are still visible today upon close inspection. Waite's Crossing near the Knights of Columbus Park in St. Cloud is marked by a commemorative stone explaining the existence of an important crossing at this point. As increased settlement took place, fur trading took a backseat to agriculture and the logging industry that were becoming more important for the region. Logging of the hardwood forests soon became a vital interest, and the Sauk River provided a corridor for the passage of wood from western and central Stearns County to the rapidly developing St Cloud area. The granite industry likewise flourished with this growth, and the numerous granite outcrops along the river as well as many other sites in the county were obvious targets for exploitation of this resource. Prominent evidences of this industry still exist today along the Sauk as well as in the \\"Granite City\\" of St. Cloud. Throughout this time, the development of a substantial agricultural economy provided for the development of mills along the Sauk. The river provided another resource to the area in this manner. With the advancement of railroads to the area, the small mills along the river declined in usefulness; however, evidence of these sites exist today along the river, with a large mill still operating where the Sauk enters the Mississippi. Water characteristics The Sauk enters the Mississippi River on the north end of St. Cloud, just above the Sauk Rapids of the Mississippi. Numerous waterfowl can be seen in state-managed wildlife areas as the river winds along this section. The river then begins to broaden its banks and deepen its valleys as its course continues. Midway along its path, near Richmond, the river forms a \\"Chain of Lakes\\" where more than 80 miles of continuous shoreline are encountered over a river length of less than 8 miles. As the river continues, a variety of granite outcrops and small hills provide a scenic landscape along the shores. Near St Cloud, the river gradient increases and a series of rapids occur until the river joins with the Mississippi. Vegetation A variety of plant life is found along the Sauk River, ranging from naturally restored prairie grasslands to thick hardwood forests. The river starts in flat swamp vegetation with flora common to most Minnesota wetlands. Prairie-type grasses and flowers are then encountered on the banks and fields above the river. Near the Spring Hill County Park, a naturally restored prairie field is preserved. Oaks, elms, silver maples and willows are the most common trees through most of the valley. One of the most interesting sights along the Sauk is an elevated tamarack bog on the north bank of the river near Rockville, providing beautiful golden scenery in the fall. Wildlife Abundant waterfowl are found in and around two state managed wildlife areas south of Sauk Centre. The marshy swampland that borders the river is prime habitat for a variety of waterfowl. Early in the morning, it is possible to see deer feeding along the river in some wooded areas. Gray fox, red squirrels, and chipmunks are common in the wooded sections, along with an occasional woodchuck, muskrat, or beaver. There have been sightings of such less common animals as otter and mink. A variety of birdlife in the Sauk Valley makes for very interesting bird watching. The forests and grasslands are home to most of the birds native to central Minnesota. Cardinals, woodpeckers and many songbirds are common. Grouse, pheasant and partridge are some of the more popular gamebirds found near the Sauk. Birds of prey such as various hawks, owls and an occasional bald eagle can also be seen when canoeing the river. Along most of the river it is common to see great blue herons. Fish Because of the shallow depth of the river and the somewhat poor water quality, game fish are not abundant in the Sauk River. Redhorse and sucker are found in most parts of the river. However, in the \\"Chain of Lakes\\" area, fishing is very popular with a variety of fish being caught. Panfish, walleye and northern are the most common to anglers in this area. Walleye and northern can also be found where the river enters the Mississippi. The world record Greater redhorse was caught in the Sauk in 2005. Expeditions In June, 2011 Todd Foster and Scott Miller paddled the entire length of the Sauk River. The trip was made to chronicle fences along the river, as well as to highlight the Friends of the Sauk River canoe library, and to promote getting outside and paddling the river.

The cause is believed to be genetic. Nearly 10 percent of pet African pygmy hedgehogs are affected, due to their limited bloodlines. Symptoms The disease slowly degrades the hedgehog's muscle control. This first appears as a wobble while the hedgehog is attempting to stand still. Over time, the hedgehog will lose control of all muscles from the rear of its body to the front. A tentative diagnosis can be based purely on the clinical signs, but definitive diagnosis is only possible from post-mortem examination of spinal cord and brain tissues. The hedgehog's health will deteriorate over the course of weeks or months, and in the advanced stages of this disease, they become completely immobilized, making euthanasia a recommended consideration. Most animals die within two years of diagnosis. Symptoms usually begin in hedgehogs before they reach two years old, but can occur at any age. Treatment There is no known cure for WHS, which has been compared to human multiple sclerosis. Various vitamin supplements, antibiotic and steroid treatments have been used; some appear to temporarily improve the signs or slow the progression of the disease, but as signs of WHS wax and wane, it is difficult to assess the benefit of treatments. No treatment has been shown to prevent the progression of paralysis.

It lies about a mile (2 km) to the west of Swansea city centre, and falls within the Uplands electoral ward. It is centred on the A4118 road, which links Swansea city centre and Sketty. The main road begins as Walter Road from the east, and becomes Sketty Road towards the west. Much of the area is hilly. The population of the community and ward in 2011 was 15,665 and in terms of Welsh identity had the lowest percentage in the county. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W05000548 The area St. James Church, Uplands, Church in Wales. Uplands' main shopping area is located on and around Uplands Crescent, where small businesses mix with fast- food outlets and high-street heavyweights like Boots, Sainsbury's and Tesco. The western side of Bryn-y-Mor Road also has a number of convenience stores, hairdressers, fashion boutiques, pubs and restaurants. The area is becoming increasingly known amongst the people of Swansea for its night-life, with a number of late-night bars and restaurants having opened their doors during the early 2010s, which, along with a diverse range of independent shops and a monthly local produce market in Gwydr Square, put Uplands in TravelSupermarket’s top 20 UK Hip Hang-outs in 2017. The Uplands Tavern pub however, has long been a popular venue, and was once frequented by Sir Kingsley Amis and Dylan Thomas, although the two writers were not residents of Uplands at the same time. The latter's childhood home on Cwmdonkin Drive has a blue plaque marking his birthplace. In 2012 the annual Do Not Go Gentle Festival was launched, hosting live music and literature across various venues, it aims to be \\"a festival Dylan Thomas might have liked\\". Uplands is a relatively salubrious area of Swansea, with property prices above the national average. Council tax rates are quite high because of this, falling into band C and above. The housing stock consists of fairly large properties; three-storey properties and properties containing four bedrooms or more are common. Many of the larger properties have been converted into student houses, making the Uplands area popular amongst students attending the city's two universities. Though a community (civil parish) of Swansea, Uplands doesn't elect a community council. Notable buildings and landmarks 5 Cwmdonkin Drive, birthplace of Dylan Thomas Eaton Crescent, considered to be one of the most upmarket residential areas close to Swansea's city centre, is where Conservative politician Michael Heseltine grew up. The crescent consists mainly of large three-storey semi-detached and terraced 4-6 bedroom town- houses. During the late 1980s, a large number of properties were converted for use as student houses, but since the late 1990s it has mainly returned to housing families. Stella Maris is a convent occupied by the Sisters of Ursulines of Jesus on Eaton Crescent.\\"\\"Built in Quality\\" Awards 2005\\", City and County of Swansea The sisters once ran the Stella Maris Primary School, a former independent convent school that is now closed. St. James' Church, located on Walter Road, was opened in 1867 as a chapel of ease for the nearby St. Mary's in Swansea's town centre. It became a separate parish in 1985. There is a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall on the corner of Walter Road and Mirador Crescent, and the Dharmavajra Kadampa Buddhist Centre is located in Springfield House on Ffynone Road. The Mansion House, the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Swansea, is also on Ffynone Road. The Llwyn-Y-Bryn campus of Gower College Swansea is located just off Walter Road. There are two private schools in the area; Oakleigh House provides primary education and Ffynone House provides senior education for GCSE and A-Level pupils. Local parks are Cwmdonkin Park, Rosehill Quarry Community Park, and Brynmill Park, with the former an important location and source of inspiration for Dylan Thomas, who lived so close to the park during his childhood that \\"on summer evenings I could listen, in my bed, to the voices of other children playing ball\\". Cwmdonkin Park features heavily in the radio broadcasts 'Return Journey' and 'Reminiscences of Childhood' and, most famously, the poem 'The hunchback in the park'. A memorial stone with lines from another of Thomas' poems, 'Fern Hill', was placed in the park in 1963.

Chau's popularity has spread throughout Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and parts of Southeast Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam). As of August 2007, he has released more than 40 albums and held several international concert tours. Biography Wakin Chau was born in a rice store owned by his family at Sai Ying Pun in then-British colony of Hong Kong. Growing up as the fourth son in his seven-member family, Wakin learned to play the guitar when he was about 13 years old. In 1979, he left for Taipei to major in mathematics at National Taiwan University. During his college years, he sang and played folk songs in local coffee shops. This activity was a tradition among NTU students, and it is how Wakin learned to sing in Mandarin, which would be key to his future as a music-maker in Taiwan. Wakin had high hopes to establish a career as a recording artist, and he actively sought out contacts in the music industry. But a persistent lack of interest eventually led him to give up trying to become a performer – instead, he could sign on as an assistant producer at Rock Records, where he wrote marketable pop songs for other artists. Wakin was later encouraged by Chyi Yu to sing some jingles for commercial advertising spots. One of these tunes was for a car commercial, and it happened to catch the attention of Wakin's boss at Rock, who realised it was the voice of his own assistant producer. That moment opened the door for Wakin to record and release his first Mandarin album under the Rock Records label in 1987. For a man who had dreamed of performing professionally but had settled on being a record producer, this was a period of particularly good fortune that launched a succession of chart- topping records. Shortly before his music career took off, Wakin the record producer met an American girl named Constance Woods, whose father was in Taiwan as a Fulbright scholar. Seeming to have plenty in common (including birthdays only one day apart) Wakin and Constance began to date, got engaged and then on 16 November 1986, they married in Taipei. Four months later there was another ceremony with family and friends in the United States of America on 14 March 1987. They have a son named Andrew and a daughter named Anya. From 1985, Emil Chau, who has been using his given name Wakin since 1999, has released more than 40 albums in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. He has become a prominent name in the music of Taiwan and has fans of all ages not only around Asia but also in North America, Europe and elsewhere. His platinum albums such as You Make Me Happy and Sad (), The Flowery Heart (), Music Brings Us Together (), and Emil & Friends () have won awards in Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Wakin has appeared in a number of films and made guest appearances on TV and radio programs in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan. Alongside his singing career, he is a restaurateur and also is active in international charitable causes, such as kidney dialysis charities in Singapore, the January 2002 \\"Take a Deep Breath\\" concert in Taipei to raise money for local health-care organisations, Beijing's 4th Grand Charity Drive for Children in 2005, and Jackie Chan's all- star concerts in Las Vegas. Wakin Chau has formed with distinguished artists Jonathan Lee, Chang Chen-yue, and Lo Ta-yu in the four-member band Superband. In 2010, after finishing all their concerts and tours, they disbanded and resumed their individual careers.

It once again starred Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield (who also co-wrote the special with Davis), and also featured the voices of Thom Huge, Gregg Berger and Julie Payne. The special was first broadcast October 28, 1983 on CBS. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and has been released on LaserDisc and DVD. This was the second of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  Jon becomes concerned about Garfield's behavior after he and Odie mess up his house. While Jon tries to take him to the veterinarian, Garfield accidentally falls out from Jon's car and later becomes lost in downtown. Garfield soon runs into a large gang of unfriendly alley cats known as the Claws. After antagonizing their leader, Garfield flees into an abandoned Italian restaurant, where he is reunited with his long lost mother. The building was Garfield's birthplace and where he discovered his love for lasagna. Meanwhile, Jon calls Garfield's vet, Dr. Liz Wilson, to tell her about Garfield's disappearance, but Liz hangs up on Jon instead. The next day, Garfield's mother takes him to see the rest of his extended family including his tough maternal grandfather, his sickly half-brother Raoul, and his cousin Sly, who is the security guard on watch for the Claws. Garfield is appalled to learn that everyone in the family are mousers. The Claws finally track Garfield down and surround the entire building, demanding that Garfield must come out. The family decides to fight instead of giving up Garfield to the Claws. Garfield cowardly hides while his family fights and finally chase the Claws away. Although Garfield is triumphant, his grandfather advises him to live with Jon instead. Reassured by his mother that they all envy his easy life at Jon's house, Garfield sadly says goodbye to his family and leaves. Exhausted and hungry, Garfield walks along a street and it soon starts to rain. A car drives by and Garfield realizes it is driven by Jon. Garfield pursues Jon's car until he collapses onto the sidewalk and passes out. When Odie finally spots Garfield unconscious, Jon pulls over to reunite with him. Afterwards, Jon drives Garfield home and later put him into bed for the night. The next day, Garfield wakes up at Jon's house and wonders if his entire experience was real or not. However, Garfield glimpses his mother looking at him through the window. His mother quickly disappears, while Garfield smiles and emotionally whispers: \\"Thanks Mom, for everything\\".  Voice cast   Songs   Production  In 2014, Garfield creator Jim Davis identified Garfield on the Town as a personal favorite special. Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, best known for the Peanuts specials, produced Garfield on the Town. The special was directed by Phil Roman, who had previously directed Here Comes Garfield in 1982. It was the last Garfield special Roman directed before founding his own company called Film Roman to produce the specials himself, starting with Garfield in the Rough (1984). The character of Jon Arbuckle was voiced by Sandy Kenyon in Here Comes Garfield, but was recast with Thom Huge in Garfield on the Town. Huge later voiced Jon in the remaining specials and in the Garfield and Friends TV series.  Broadcast and release  The special was originally aired on CBS on October 28, 1983, and was viewed by 40 million people. It has been re-broadcast in subsequent years. Ballantine Books published a 64-page illustrated book adaptation in 1983. In July 2004, Garfield on the Town was released on the DVD Garfield as Himself, along with Here Comes Garfield (1982) and Garfield Gets a Life (1991). It was released on another DVD compilation, The Garfield Holiday Collection, on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.  Reception  At the 36th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1984, Garfield on the Town won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. Louisiana's The Town Talk's 1985 review called Garfield \\"outrageous\\" and said there was \\"popular demand\\" for the special. In 2004, DVD Talk critic Randy Miller judged the Garfield as Himself specials to be \\"quite enjoyable,\\" highlighting \\"a long-lost family reunion.\\" In 2014, with the release of The Garfield Holiday Collection, Jim Davis identified Garfield on the Town as a personal favorite, explaining, \\"Garfield actually meets his mother on that. It was very special.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:1980s American television specials Category:1983 in American television Category:1983 television specials Category:1980s American animated films Category:American films Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:CBS original programming Category:Garfield television specials Category:Television shows written by Jim Davis (cartoonist) Category:Emmy Award-winning programs ","title":"Garfield on the Town"},{"id":"2183256","text":"Adam Kopyciński (; b. 5 August 1907 in Osielcu near Maków Podhalański – 3 October 1982 in Wrocław, Poland) was a Polish conductor and composer.

The line-up has changed as the group splintered and reformed several times, being active from 1982 to 1985, 1987 to 1991, 1994 to 1997 and 2006 to 2008. The August 2006 line-up was Gray with Stephan Fidock on drums; Penny Ikinger on guitar; Spencer P. Jones on guitar; Nick Rischbieth on bass guitar; and Ash Wednesday on keyboards. Past members include: Johnny Crash (aka Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, who were both ex-Models; Terry Doolan on guitar; Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar; and Ian Forrest on keyboards. The group have issued six albums: Sacred Cowboys (1984), We Love You ... Of Course We Do (1985), Trouble from Providence (August 1988), Things to Come (July 1996), Cold Harvest (January 2007) and 1982–85: Nailed to the Cross (February 2008). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as \\"one of the most confrontational live outfits\\" with their music as \\"mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat\\". History Sacred Cowboys formed in early 1982 in Melbourne with Terry Doolan on guitar (ex-Fizztops), Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) on drums, Mark Ferrie on guitar (both ex-Models), Ian Forrest on keyboards (ex-True Wheels), Garry Gray on lead vocals (ex-The Reals, The Negatives) and Andrew Picouleau on bass guitar (ex-Metronomes, Popgun Men, X-Ray-Z). Gray and Ferrie based the name from watching \\"The Groovy Guru\\", an episode of the United States TV comedy series, Get Smart. In it, the Groovy Guru and his rock band, the Sacred Cows, use psychedelic music to control the minds of young people.Initially the group were a covers band playing Credence Clearwater Revival, Alex Chilton, The Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart, Suicide and Bob Dylan. They built a reputation as \\"one of the most confrontational live outfits\\" in the local scene. Within six months, Sacred Cowboys had signed with Mushroom Records' White Label and recorded a single, \\"Nothing Grows in Texas\\", which appeared in November 1982. After a performance on TV pop show, Countdown, the host Molly Meldrum described them as \\"the worst group I've seen in five years\\", a title the band knew meant they were on the right side of the wrong side of the tracks. Gray responded with \\"[Meldrum] had a very good medium at his disposal but he never really used it to benefit the broad spectrum of music that was available in the country\\". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Meldrum's assessment had \\"instantly cemented their nefarious reputation as the local scene's enfants terribles. The band's music mixed post-punk moodiness and country raunch over a mutant swamp-blues backbeat\\". In July 1983 they released a second single, a cover of Chilton's \\"Bangkok\\". In the next month they supported US hardcore punk band, Dead Kennedys, at their Melbourne gig. In December Sacred Cowboys followed with a six-track self- titled extended play on the White Label, which was produced by Tony Cohen (Models, The Birthday Party). At that time Chris Whelan replaced Forrest on keyboards. Early in the next year, a self-titled album on French label, New Rose Records, was issued. Meanwhile, Nick Rischbieth (ex-Related Mechanics) replaced Picouleau on bass guitar and at the same time the band decided to work without keyboards. In 1985 a live, demo compilation, We Love You . . . Of Course We Do, named after a cover of The Rolling Stones single, \\"We Love You\\", appeared on Man Made Records. However, by that time the group went off the road and Gray entered a drug rehabilitation centre to treat his heroin addiction. In August 1988 he declared that the treatment was \\"not easy for anyone but the benefit is to be able to come out and continue working and I had to work better than I have before... not a lot of people can get through that sort of thing... Writing is something I've always enjoyed but now it's a more positive thing\\". Late in 1984 Ferrie and Friedenfelds formed The Slaughtermen, as a post-punk, alternative, southern gospel group. Late in 1987 Sacred Cowboys reformed with a line-up of Doolan, Ferrie, Gray and Rischbieth joined by Stephan Fidock on drums (ex-The Reels). Ash Wednesday briefly joined on keyboards (ex-JAB, Metronomes, Einsturzende Neubauten) but left after recording the album, Trouble from Providence. They signed to Sydney-based label, Citadel Records, which released the album in August 1988. It was produced by Ferrie, Doolan, Cohen, and Martin Armiger (Paul Kelly & the Dots, Stephen Cummings). McFarlane described it as \\"one of the best independent releases of the year\\". It was also issued by Germany's Normal Records, both in the standard nine-track vinyl LP format and as a CD with six bonus tracks. The band issued two singles from the album, the title track in July and \\"Hell Sucks\\" in December. The latter was more popular and became the group's signature tune. Forrest rejoined on keyboards, late in 1990, but the group disbanded again at the end of the following year. From early 1994 Sacred Cowboys reformed with a line-up of Doolan, Ferrie, Fidock and Gray, joined by Spencer P Jones, then Penny Ikinger on guitar (ex-Wet Taxis, Louis Tillett's Aspersion Caste). They released a compilation CD, seven-track EP, Black City, early that year on the Siren label. In 1997 the Australian edition of Rolling Stone listed it as one of the Top 100 albums of the 20th century. Another album, Things to Come, was released in July 1996. It was recorded at Atlantis and Espy Studios for Greasy Pole Records and distributed by Shock Records. By that time Spencer P. Jones had joined on guitar (ex-Beasts of Bourbon, Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls). At various times Sydney-based alternative rock, blues rock band, Beasts of Bourbon, has included Doolan, Ferrie, Friedenfelds or Jones of Sacred Cowboys. By 1997 Sacred Cowboys had gone off the road again, Gray moved to France and was living in Montpellier. In 2005 \\"Hell Sucks\\" was selected for Clinton Walker's compilation of Australian punk and post-punk music, Inner City Sounds. Sacred Cowboys reformed in August 2006 with the line-up of Fidock, Gray, Ikinger, Jones, Rischbieth and Wednesday and in 2008 with Mark Ferrie. They played a series of shows in Melbourne, and the remaining line-up recorded the finishing touches to the album, Cold Harvest, which was released on Bang! Records in January 2007. TJ Honeysuckle at i94bar.com noted that Ikinger and Jones were \\"hugely distinctive presences here\\" while Gray's vocal delivery \\"swings easily from snarling to caressing – he has a snake oil seller's charm at times, a cursing preacher's tone at others\\". Radio station, PBS 106.7FM's review described the album \\"the songs are narrative in style, a kind of urban uprising driven by dysfunctional dreamers and powerless onlookers\\". In February 2008 they issued a compilation album, 1982–85: Nailed to the Cross. Amazon.com's editorial review recalls their early style, \\"[they] played a wild, dangerous and completely unique brand of rock'n'roll inspired by the artists whose material they cover\\". The group toured in support of the release until August that year. http://www.i94bar.com/interviews/proto-punk-is-so-yesterday-garry-gray-on-st- kilda-sacred-cowboys-and-making-sydney-sit-up-and-listen http://www.i94bar.com/albums/dumb-world-negatives-reals-and-judas-iscariot- the-traitors-1974-1978-loaded-skull-discs-shock Members * Terry Doolan – lead guitar, (1982–1985, 1987–1991, 1994–1997) * Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) – drums, (1982–1985) * Mark Ferrie – lead guitar, bass guitar (1982–1985, 1987–1991, 1994–1997, 2008) * Ian Forrest – keyboards (1982–1983, 1990–1991) * Garry Gray – lead vocals (1982–1985, 1987–1991, 1994–1997, 2006–2008) * Andrew Picouleau – bass guitar (1982–1984) * Chris Whelan – keyboards (1983) * Nick Rischbieth – bass guitar (1984–1985, 1987–1991, 1994–1997, 2006–2008) * Stephan Fidock – drums (1987–1991, 1994–1997, 2006–2008) * Ash Wednesday (1987, 2006) * Penny Ikinger – lead guitar (1994–1997, 2006–2008) * Spencer P.

Albert Steiner (1877–1965) was one of Switzerland's outstanding 20th-century photographers. His landscape photographs taken in the Engadine, where he lived and worked for 46 years, are unique on an international as well as a national level. They have had a major influence on an awareness of Switzerland as an unspoiled alpine country of surpassing beauty. Inspired by painters such as Giovanni Segantini and Ferdinand Hodler, Steiner took pictures that reveal a profound respect for and love of nature, as well as a tireless search for timeless beauty and metaphysical truth. His meticulously structured, light-saturated compositions are expressive witnesses of his experience of human insignificance in the face of the greatness and sublimity of the mountain world. Surprisingly, up until now Steiner's work has not been accorded the appreciation it deserves.

It started out as its own coffeehouse chain before being acquired by Starbucks in 2003.  History  The first Torrefazione Italia café opened in Seattle, Washington in 1986. Espresso, coffee and baked goods were served in their cafés. Umberto Bizzarri, Torrefazione's founder, teamed up with Stewart Brother's Coffee (later renamed Seattle's Best Coffee) founder, Jim Stewart, in the mid 1980s to create Seattle Coffee Holdings. This new company built a more modern roasterie on Vashon Island, Washington in 1995 and manufactured Seattle's Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia Coffee. Seattle Coffee Holdings was purchased in 1998 by AFC Enterprises and renamed Seattle Coffee Company. Torrefazione Italia expanded to other cities in North America, notably, Vancouver BC, the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Boston, Chicago, and Dallas. Their coffees are also wholesaled to restaurants, hotels, bakeries and cafés. Starbucks, another Seattle-based coffee company, purchased Torrefazione Italia along with Seattle's Best Coffee in 2003. Starbucks announced in 2005 that all 17 Torrefazione Italia cafés would be closed before the end of the year,Starbucks shutting its Torrefazione coffee bars and all of the San Francisco retail locations were closed on 27 October 2005.

She served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1936 to 1941 as a member of the Social Credit League. She was the second woman and the first woman of Icelandic origin to serve in the provincial legislature. Early life Halldorson was born to Halldor Halldorson and Kristin Palsdottir in Lundar, Manitoba. She was educated at Wesley College in Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. Halldorson worked as a teacher of languages, teaching Latin, French and German from 1918 to 1938 at Jon Bjarnason Academy, a private school started by the Icelandic Lutheran Church in 1913. Career She was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1936 provincial election, defeating Liberal-Progressive incumbent Skuli Sigfusson by 156 votes in the constituency of St. George. She was the first woman elected to the legislature since the resignation of Edith Rogers in 1932. The Social Credit League won only five seats (out of 55) in this election, but held the balance of power by maintaining John Bracken's Liberal-Progressive government in office. In 1940, the party formally entered an all-party coalition government with the Liberal-Progressives, Conservatives and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. Independent Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Lewis Stubbs was initially the only legislator not to join the government. Social Credit split on the coalition issue, and Halldorson broke with the rest of her caucus to serve as the legislature's second opposition member. The Social Credit League subsequently expelled the other four MLAs, although they continued to identify themselves as representatives of the party. The reconstructed Social Credit League endorsed Halldorson's decision, and Social Credit Premier of Alberta William Aberhart also supported her. The 1941 election greatly reduced Social Credit as a political force in the province. All of the anti-coalition candidates were defeated, and Halldorson finished a distant second against Sigfusson in St George. In addition to her career in the legislature, Halldorson served as vice-president and president of the Manitoba Social Credit League in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1943, Halldorson contested a federal by-election in Selkirk as a candidate of the Social Credit Party of Canada. She came a very distant third, finishing almost 9,000 votes behind successful candidate William Bryce of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. She was re-nominated in the 1945 provincial election, but declined to stand. Her brother Christian also served in the Manitoba assembly after her stint there. Later life Halldorson later taught at Morden, Transcona and at Balmoral Hall. In 1953, she wrote against proposed anti-discrimination legislation as unduly restricting the freedom of employers.

Biography Chandler was born in Memphis in 1887 to parents of Scots/English descent, William Henry Chandler and Knoxie (Clift) Chandler. He attended public schools before going on to earn his law degree at the University of Tennessee. He taught school, reported for the Knoxville Sentinel. city attorney of Memphis 1928-1934; delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1940 and 1944; elected as a Democrat to the Seventy- fourth, Seventy-fifth, and Seventy-sixth Congresses and served from January 3, 1935, until his resignation on January 2, 1940, having been elected mayor of Memphis; reelected mayor in 1943 and served until September 1, 1946; resumed the practice of law; temporary president, Tennessee constitutional convention, in 1953; mayor of Memphis in 1955 for unexpired term Career A member of the Tennessee General Assembly, Chandler served in the Tennessee state house of representatives in 1917. He served as a captain in the One Hundred and Fourteenth Field Artillery, Thirtieth Division, American Expeditionary Forces, from July 25, 1917, to April 19, 1919, during World War I. and then was a member of Tennessee state senate from 1921 to 1923. He married Dorothy Wyeth on October 10, 1925. Chandler was elected U.S. Representative from Tennessee 9th District, and served from January 3, 1935 to January 2, 1940, when he resigned. He was mayor of Memphis, Tennessee, from 1940 to 1946, and served in that capacity again in 1955. He was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Tennessee in 1940 and 1944. Although supported by the E. H. Crump machine, Chandler made significant contributions to the world on his own. He was the author of Chapter 13 bankruptcy legislation. He filed the original suit in Baker v. Carr, the U.S. Supreme Court case that argued against Tennessee's status quo of seldom changing the boundaries of congressional districts, even though population growth in urban areas far outstripped the growth in rural areas. By 1960, the district lines had not been redrawn since 1900 despite a provision in the Constitution of Tennessee requiring them to be redrawn every 10 years. In some cases one state representative district might be more populous by a factor of ten than another, more rural district. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Baker, viewing the case not as one of legislative jurisdiction, but as a case of insuring each individual's right to equal representation. Chandler was considered a sensitive and thoughtful man by some, and that he retired from politics in disappointment after E. H. Crump failed to support him for a senate seat. Chandler was an active and contributing member of the West Tennessee Historical Society. His recollections of early life in Memphis provide one of the clearest and most lucid pictures of Memphis at the turn of the 20th century. Death Chandler died in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, on October 1, 1967 (age 79 years, 361 days). He is interred at Forest Hill Cemetery, Memphis, Tennessee. He died in the same year his son, future mayor Wyeth Chandler, was elected to the first Memphis City Council. His son served as Mayor of Memphis from 1972 until 1982 and later as a judge.

He scored 112 in his only Test innings which left him with the highest Test batting average in history. Ganteaume played for Trinidad from a young age and was chosen to play in a Test match against England following his good batting form in 1948. However, his slow scoring probably cost him his place and he never played another Test, although he toured England with the West Indies in 1957. At the time of his death, Ganteaume was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer. Early life Ganteaume was born in Belmont, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. He had no formal cricket coaching but made his first- class debut for Trinidad as a wicketkeeper in 1941 as a 19-year-old. He scored 87 batting at number eight. Over the next few seasons, Ganteaume played regularly for Trinidad in first-class competition and for North Trinidad in a non-first-class island competition. He also played football for the Trinidad team around this time, but his time for sport was restricted by his career in the civil service. From batting in the middle-order, Ganteaume was eventually promoted to open the batting as a theory at the time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed to the conditions while keeping wicket; Ganteaume neither believed this theory nor enjoyed being an opener. He scored his maiden first-class century in 1946; a second followed later in the year. Test match call-up In the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team toured the West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not out in the first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 but was not selected in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection was a result of his underprivileged background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called up into the side. England batted first to score 362, but when the West Indies batted, Ganteaume and his opening partner, George Carew shared a partnership of 173. Once more, Ganteaume was criticised for slow batting, although he later suggested that he had concentrated on scoring singles to allow his in-form partner to face the bowling. On the third day, he carried on batting to reach his century, the first in a Test match by a Trinidadian in Trinidad. The innings took around 270 minutes, but he slowed down as he neared three-figures, and the West Indies' captain sent out a note asking the batsmen to score faster. Other batsmen also batted slowly, and Ganteaume later claimed that England used negative, run-saving tactics to slow the scoring rate. He did not bat in the second innings, when the West Indies needed to score runs quickly in an unsuccessful attempt to win the game. The match was drawn, having been earlier interrupted by rain which cut the playing time, but in the knowledge that quick scoring was vital, Ganteaume's slow batting adversely affected the West Indies' chances of victory. Ganteaume did not play in the next Test match—he was replaced by John Goddard who came into the team as part of a pre-arranged scheme to rotate the captaincy. Ganteaume was chosen in a preliminary 24-man squad to tour India and Pakistan in 1948–49, but did not make the final selection of 16 players, and was overlooked for the 1950 tour of England. He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but played no further representative cricket until 1957. Later career Ganteaume was selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1957 at the age of 36. He played 19 first-class matches on the tour and scored 800 runs at an average of 27.58. He passed fifty in seven innings, with a top-score of 92 against Glamorgan. Norman Preston, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, suggested neither Ganteaume nor any of the other three specialist opening batsmen in the team \\"came up to expectations\\", forcing Frank Worrell to open the batting. He never came close to selection for a Test match. After the tour, Ganteaume played just twice more for Trinidad in first-class cricket, and ended his career with 2,785 first-class runs at an average of 34.81 and five centuries. Having played just one Test innings, Ganteaume was left with a Test batting average of 112, the highest career average by a former player. There are several possible reasons why Ganteaume played no further Test cricket after his single match. Apart from the slow pace of his batting during that hundred—Goddard later suggested that it would have been better for Ganteaume's career to score a rapid 60 than a slow hundred— West Indies' batting was strong at the time and there was plenty of competition for places in the team. Even so, his teammate and later West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer suggested that he was unlucky to be left out of subsequent teams. It is also possible that Ganteaume's career was affected by his attitude to authority. The cricket journalist Martin Williamson suggests: \\"Ganteaume probably paid as much for his anti-establishment attitude as for slow scoring. He was certainly not someone who was going to bow and scrape to the white players who still dominated the region's cricket.\\" In later years, Ganteaume served as a Test selector and was West Indies manager in 1973–74. In 2007, his autobiography, My Story: The Other Side of the Coin was published, in which he criticised the West Indies \\"establishment\\" of his playing days. He died at the age of 95 on 17 February 2016. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving West Indies Test cricketer, and the second oldest in the world.

It is currently on hiatus due to financial constraints. The magazine's concept and relaunch were achieved through the efforts of Sohail Nakhooda, a Jordan- based LSE graduate who was the first Muslim to study Christian theology at the Vatican. His vision for the magazine, as is the vision of the current staff, aims to broaden perspectives on Islam and provide a forum for Muslims to articulate their concerns while establishing cross-cultural relations between Muslims and their neighbors and co-religionists. The magazine is produced in English and draws from scholars, thinkers, writers and activists from around the world. History and profile The magazine was first published in 1992 in the UK, and re-launched in 2004 from Amman, Jordan. In 2009 the magazine was renamed as Islamica. Islamica is published in English on a monthly basis.  Editorial Perspective  Since the re-launch, Islamica has developed a diverse Advisory Board of scholars, thinkers, and academics to help define its editorial perspective. This board includes the following individuals: Umar Faruq Abd-Allah, Osman Bakar, John Esposito, Hamza Yusuf, Jeremy Henzell- Thomas, Anwar Ibrahim, Enes Karic, Nuh Keller, Joseph Lumbard, Ingrid Mattson, Daniel Abdal-Hayy Moore, Abdal Hakim Murad, Sulayman Nyang, S. Abdallah Schleifer, Zaid Shakir The magazine generally takes an orthodox Sunni Muslim perspective. In its earlier years, Islamica had a more Anglo-European outlook on issues, as was reflected by its primarily British-educated editorial team. In 2004, its core editorial staff was expanded to include six editors based in the United States. It was during this time that a more subtle transition was made towards addressing issues related to Islam for a primarily US or American audience. Evidence of this shift can be found in recent articles published by Sherman Jackson, David Cole, Samuel Huntington, John Esposito and other prominent American thinkers. Additionally, regular columnists based in the US including the comedian Azhar Usman, the award-winning poet Daniel Abdal Hayy Moore, the essayist and writer Haroon Moghul and Asma Uddin, a lawyer and research associate for Umar F. Abd-Allah were also added to the magazine. Uddin is also a fellow with the Becket Fund for Religious Freedom. Other regular columnists include Faraz Rabbani, Yusuf Zanella, the British academic, H A Hellyer and Jeremy Henzell Thomas. However, the editor-in-chief, Sohail Nakhooda, remains in Amman.

Mitsubishi manufactured six aircraft under license from Junkers. These aircraft, designated Army Type 92 Heavy Bomber, served through the 1930s. During World War II, the Ki-20 served in a variety of transport and support roles. Design and development In the late-1920s, as Junkers developed the Junkers G.38, Mitsubishi representatives in Germany expressed an interest in a military version of this civilian transport. At the time, the G.38 was the largest landplane in the world. Junkers completed a design study for a military bomber/transport, based on the G.38, designated the K.51. This design was not accepted by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium. The K.51 design study was of interest to Japan. A licensing and manufacturing agreement was reached and in 1932 the first two Ki-20s were completed by Mitsubishi, utilizing Junkers-made parts. A prototype was successfully flown in Japan by a German test pilot in that year. Four additional Ki-20s were built between 1933 and 1935. All of these subsequent models used Mitsubishi-built parts. Ongoing development focused on engine upgrades to all examples to address the persistent issue of the aircraft being underpowered. Several engine upgrades were completed during the lifetime of these aircraft. The initial Junkers L88 engines were replaced by the more powerful Jumo 204 engines, also built under license by Mitsubishi. Additionally Kawasaki Ha-9 engines were utilized for testing purposes. Operational history During World War II, the Japanese originally intended to utilize the Ki-20s to attack the forts at the entrance to Manila Bay in the Philippines and for deep penetration missions into Siberia. For these purposes, they were armed with six gun positions and structurally enabled to carry a 5,000 kg (11,020 lb) bomb load. These aircraft were the largest operated by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service and their existence within it was kept secret. As a result, they were issued their out- of-sequence Kitai number '20' only when they were finally revealed in 1940. Surviving aircraft A single example survived to the end of hostilities as a museum piece in the Tokorozawa Aviation Memorial Hall. All examples of this aircraft were either destroyed during the war or broken up for scrap during the latter portion of the 1940s.

A creation of Stan Allen, it debuted in September 1991, with its first issue featuring Lance Burton on the cover, and over the years it also featured David Copperfield, Siegfried & Roy, Penn & Teller, Mike Caveney, and Mac King. Its final issue was #301, November 2016. Writers for the magazine have included Joshua Jay, Gabe Fajuri, John Lovick, Alan Howard, Max Maven, Peter Duffie, Andi Gladwin, Mark Nelson, Rory Johnston, Timothy Hyde and Shawn McMaster. In 2005 MAGIC Magazine was deemed the world's largest-selling publication for magicians by Guinness World Records. In 2007 MAGIC Magazine was also listed as one of the Chicago Tribune's 50 favorite magazines in their annual summer list.  MAGIC Live!  In 2001 it was announced that MAGIC would be producing a once-in-a-lifetime, never-to-be-repeated event called MAGIC Live. The purpose of the event was to bring to life the stories and features of the print magazine and to immerse MAGIC subscribers in the stories they read each month. The \\"unconventional convention\\" took place August 19–22, 2001 at The Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Due to the critical acclaim for the sold-out event and the urging of many attendees Stan Allen announced an encore event to take place in August 2004. The second event proved to be just as groundbreaking as the first, including a performance of close-up magic in which guests viewed the show as if in a bar, restaurant, trade show floor, and theatre via four connected performance venues. In August 2007 MAGIC Live returned to The Orleans hotel for a third time. The event sold out in record time and many would-be attendees sat on a waiting list in hopes of making it to the convention. In the June 2008 issue of MAGIC it was announced that MAGIC Live would take place August 16–19, 2009 at the South Point Hotel & Casino. The convention featured an innovative dealer's room designed and produced by Brian South as well as a performance of the one man play \\"The Expert at The Cardtable\\" by Guy Hollingworth. A fifth iteration of MAGIC Live took place August 14–17, 2011, coinciding with the 20th anniversary of MAGIC Magazine. The sixth MAGIC Live convention was held August 11–14, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. One of the highlights of the convention was the final performance of Johnny Thompson performing his Dove Act as The Great Tomsoni.

With the mall's name shortened to Bellevue Square a few years later, JCPenney opened a store in 1955. Nordstrom, then a local shoe store, opened in 1958, before adding apparel and becoming the third major anchor in 1966, initially under the name Nordstrom Best. In the 1980s, the mall, then led by the original developer's son, Kemper Freeman Jr., expanded in several phases, finally adding a location for the Seattle-based department store The Bon Marché in 1984. In 1992, with the bankruptcy and closure of Frederick & Nelson and collapse of a deal to lease part of the vacated space to Saks Fifth Avenue, the center used the opportunity to reconfigure the vacant anchor as mall shop space. 1994 saw the addition of a separate The Bon Marché Home Store, while Nordstrom expanded the size of their store by half. In 2003, The Bon Marché stores were renamed Bon-Macy's, and in 2005 they adopted the name Macy's. In 2007, Bellevue Square was linked by a skybridge to Lincoln Square, another Kemper Freeman owned property which opened in 2005 and expanded in 2017.

Bellevue Square continues to be owned by Kemper Freeman Jr. and his family, one of the few shopping centers in the United States that have not been purchased by a real estate investment trust (REIT). In September 2014, JCPenney announced that it was closing its store after staying in the mall for 55 years.

Life and work The daughter of a park superintendent, Smith was educated at a state school before reading Latin at the University of Reading in the early 1970s. After a spell as a journalist in local radio in Manchester, she joined the staff of The Sunday Times in 1979 and stayed at the newspaper until 1984, although Smith still contributes book reviews, usually on crime fiction, to the publication. She has had a regular column in The Guardian's Weekend supplement, also freelancing for the newspaper and has contributed to The Independent, The Independent on Sunday, and the New Statesman. In her non-fiction Smith displays a commitment to atheism, feminism (Misogynies: Reflections on Myths and Malice, 1989) and republicanism\\"I've lost count of the times I've been asked to provide 'a republican voice' by broadcasters, which is a very welcome change.\\" (Down with the Royals, 2015). She is scornful of popular culture and once gave away her television set to her ex-husband, although she acquired a new set almost a decade later. On 15 September 2010, Smith, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. In November 2011, she gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press and media standards following the telephone hacking practised by the News of the World. She testified that she considered celebrities thought they could control press content if they put themselves into the public domain when, in reality the opposite was more likely. Although Smith was opposed to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, disputing the false claims about the Saddam Hussein regime's possession of Weapon of mass destruction, she has taken a different view during the Syrian civil war. As a consequence of the Syrian refugee crisis, and the 2013 Ghouta attacks using chemical weapons, she has called for military intervention. Outside the UK, Smith is probably best known for the Loretta Lawson series of crime novels which were published between 1987 and 1995. What Will Survive (2007) is a novel set in Lebanon in 1997 concerning a journalist's investigation into the death of a model and anti-landmine campaigner. She is a keen supporter of Classics in state schools, describing the 1997–2010 Labour government's failure to act on the matter as \\"hardly their finest hour\\" and is a patron of The Iris Project. Smith is a supporter of the pressure group Republic and a Patron of Humanists UK. In 2015, she was elected chair of Labour Humanists, a group promoting secularist policies and humanist values within the Labour party. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society National Secular Society. Retrieved 27 July 2019 Joan Smith was appointed the Executive Director of Hacked Off in late May 2014 in succession to Brian Cathcart. Smith assumed the position in June, but stood down in late June 2015 to return to her writing career full-time. Personal life Smith was married to journalist Francis Wheen between 1985 and 1993. She had a relationship with Denis MacShane, a British Labour Party politician at the time. On 25 May 2009, during the expenses scandal of 2009 Smith wrote an article for The Guardian titled \\"I am sick of my country and this hysteria over MPs\\" objecting to the furore over MPs' expenses which she cited as an example of bullying in public life, stating that her (then) partner was an (unnamed) MP. The couple subsequently split up in 2010 after seven years together; MacShane was subsequently sentenced to six months of imprisonment for submitting false invoices.

Conceived by Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After Amundsen's South Pole expedition in 1911, this crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the \\"one great main object of Antarctic journeyings\\".Shackleton 1919, p. xi. The expedition failed to accomplish this objective, but became recognized instead as an epic feat of endurance. Shackleton had served in the Antarctic on the Discovery expedition of 1901–1904, and had led the Nimrod expedition of 1907–1909. In this new venture he proposed to sail to the Weddell Sea and to land a shore party near Vahsel Bay, in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the Ross Sea. A supporting group, the Ross Sea party, would meanwhile establish camp in McMurdo Sound, and from there lay a series of supply depots across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier. These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party's survival, as the group would not be able to carry enough provisions for the entire crossing. The expedition required two ships: under Shackleton for the Weddell Sea party, and , under Aeneas Mackintosh, for the Ross Sea party. Endurance became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay, and drifted northward, held in the pack ice, throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually the ship was crushed and sunk, stranding its 28-man complement on the ice. After months spent in makeshift camps as the ice continued its northwards drift, the party took to the lifeboats to reach the inhospitable, uninhabited Elephant Island. Shackleton and five others then made an open-boat journey in the to reach South Georgia. From there, Shackleton was eventually able to mount a rescue of the men waiting on Elephant Island and bring them home without loss of life. On the other side of the continent, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfil its mission. Aurora was blown from her moorings during a gale and was unable to return, leaving the shore party marooned without proper supplies or equipment. Nevertheless, the depots were laid, but three lives were lost before the party's eventual rescue.  Preparations  = Origin = Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\".Huntford 1975, p. 348. By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\".Huntford 1975, p. 50. The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\".Huntford 1975, p. 350. He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea.Murphy pp. 87–102. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.Shackleton 1919, p. 2. News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey.Smith 2015, p. 252. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\". Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans,Huntford 1975, p. 367. although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce. On 29 December 1913, having acquired his first promises of financial backing—a £10,000 grant from the British Government—Shackleton made his plans public, in a letter to The Times.Huntford 1975, pp. 362–363. = Shackleton's plan = Shackleton called his new expedition the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, because he felt that \\"not only the people of these islands, but our kinsmen in all the lands under the Union Jack will be willing to assist towards the carrying out of the ... programme of exploration.\\"Fisher 1957, p. 298. To arouse the interest of the general public, Shackleton issued a detailed programme early in 1914. The expedition was to consist of two parties and two ships. The Weddell Sea party would travel in the and continue to the Vahsel Bay area, where fourteen men would land of whom six, under Shackleton, would form the Transcontinental Party. This group, with 69 dogs, two motor sledges, and equipment \\"embodying everything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers can suggest\\",Shackleton 1919, pp. xii–xv. would undertake the journey to the Ross Sea. The remaining eight shore party members would carry out scientific work, three going to Graham Land, three to Enderby Land and two remaining at base camp. The Ross Sea party would set up its base in McMurdo Sound, on the opposite side of the continent. After landing they would lay depots on the route of the transcontinental party as far as the Beardmore Glacier, hopefully meeting that party there and assisting it home. They would also make geological and other observations. = Finances = Shell Shackleton estimated that he would need £50,000 (current value £) to carry out the simplest version of his plan.Fisher 1957, pp. 306–307. He did not believe in appeals to the public: \\"(they) cause endless book-keeping worries\\".Huntford 1975, pp. 355–358. His chosen method of fund-raising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers, and he had begun this process early in 1913, with little initial success. The first significant encouragement came in December 1913, when the Government offered him £10,000, provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources. The Royal Geographical Society, from which he had expected nothing, gave him £1,000—according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum.Huntford 1975, p. 369. Lord Rosebery, who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions, gave £50. In February 1914, The New York Times reported that playwright J. M. Barrie—a close friend of Captain Scott—had confidentially donated $50,000 (about £10,000). With time running out, contributions were eventually secured during the first half of 1914. Dudley Docker of the Birmingham Small Arms Company gave £10,000, wealthy tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave a \\"generous\\" sum (the amount was not revealed),Huntford 1975, pp. 375–377. and, in June, Scottish industrialist Sir James Key Caird donated £24,000 (current value £). Shackleton informed the Morning Post that \\"this magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety\\". Shackleton now had the money to proceed. He acquired, for £14,000 (current value £),Fisher 1957, p. 306.Shackleton 1919, p. xv. a 300-ton barquentine called Polaris, which had been built for the Belgian explorer Adrien de Gerlache for an expedition to Spitsbergen. This scheme had collapsed and the ship became available.Huntford 1975, p. 370. Shackleton changed her name to , reflecting his family motto \\"By endurance we conquer\\". For a further £3,200 (current value £), he acquired Douglas Mawson's expedition ship , which was lying in Hobart, Tasmania. This would act as the Ross Sea party's vessel. How much money Shackleton raised to meet the total costs of the expedition (later estimated by the Daily Mail to be around £80,000)Fisher 1957, p. 306. is uncertain, since the size of the Stancomb- Wills donation is not known. Money was a constant problem for Shackleton, who as an economy measure halved the funding allocated to the Ross Sea party, a fact which the party's commander Aeneas Mackintosh only discovered when he arrived in Australia to take up his duties.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 34–35. Mackintosh was forced to haggle and plead for money and supplies to make his part of the expedition viable.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 41–48. Shackleton had, however, realised the revenue-earning potential of the expedition. He sold the exclusive newspaper rights to the Daily Chronicle, and formed the Imperial Trans Antarctic Film Syndicate to take advantage of the film rights.Alexander 1998, p. 10.  Personnel  Ernest Shackleton, leader of the Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition According to legend, Shackleton posted an advertisement in a London paper, stating: \\"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.\\" Searches for the original advertisement have proved unsuccessful, and the story is generally regarded as apocryphal.Smith 2015, p. 256. Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications for places on the expedition, including a letter from \\"three sporty girls\\" who suggested that if their feminine garb was inconvenient they would \\"just love to don masculine attire.\\"Fisher 1957, p. 308. Eventually the crews for the two arms of the expedition were trimmed down to 28 apiece, including William Bakewell, who joined the ship in Buenos Aires, his friend Perce Blackborow who stowed away when his application was turned down,Huntford 1975, pp. 383–384. and several last-minute appointments made to the Ross Sea party in Australia.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 50–53. A temporary crewman was Sir Daniel Gooch, grandson of the renowned railway pioneer Daniel Gooch, who stepped in to help Shackleton as a dog handler at the last moment and signed up for an able seaman's pay.Smith 2015, p. 266. Gooch agreed to sail with Endurance as far as South Georgia.Fisher 1957, p. 315. As his second-in-command, Shackleton chose Frank Wild, who had been with him on both the Discovery and Nimrod expeditions, and was one of the Farthest South party in 1909.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 21–22. Wild had just returned from Mawson's Australian Antarctic Expedition. To captain Endurance Shackleton had wanted John King Davis, who had commanded Aurora during the Australian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \\"foredoomed\\", so the appointment went to Frank Worsley, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream.Huntford 1975, pp. 364–365. Royal Navy Chief Petty Officer Tom Crean, who had been awarded the Albert Medal for saving the life of Lieutenant Edward Evans on the Terra Nova Expedition, took leave from the navy to sign on as Endurances second officer; another experienced Antarctic hand, Alfred Cheetham, became third officer.Fisher 1957, p. 310. Two Nimrod veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh who commanded it, and Ernest Joyce. Shackleton had hoped that the Aurora would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men, but was turned down.Huntford 1975, pp. 370–371. After pressing his case, Shackleton was given one officer from the Royal Marines, Captain Thomas Orde-Lees, who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot.Huntford 1975, p. 372. The scientific staff of six accompanying Endurance comprised the two surgeons, Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy; a geologist, James Wordie; a biologist, Robert Clark; a physicist Reginald W. James; and Leonard Hussey, a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton's expedition account South. The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston.Fisher 1957, pp. 311–314. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 48–53. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and had gone home early.  Expedition  = Weddell Sea party =  Voyage through the ice  Crew members working to free the ship from the ice Endurance, without Shackleton (who was detained in England by expedition business), left Plymouth on 8 August 1914, heading first for Buenos Aires. Here Shackleton, who had travelled on a faster ship, rejoined the expedition. Hurley also came on board, together with Bakewell and the stowaway, Blackborow, while several others left the ship or were discharged.Alexander 1998 pp. 15–18. On 26 October, the ship sailed for the South Atlantic, arriving in South Georgia on 5 November. Shackleton's original intention was that the crossing would take place in the first season, 1914–1915. Although he soon recognised the impracticality of this, he neglected to inform Mackintosh and the Ross Sea party of his change of plan. According to the Daily Chronicles correspondent Ernest Perris, a cable intended for Macintosh was never sent.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 214–215. After a month-long halt in the Grytviken whaling station, Endurance departed for the Antarctic on 5 December. Two days later, Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter pack ice as far north as 57° 26′S,Shackleton 1919, p. 5. forcing the ship to manoeuvre. During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which, on 14 December, was thick enough to halt the ship for 24 hours. Three days later, the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: \\"I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. What we were encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character\\".Shackleton 1919, p. 11. Endurances progress was frustratingly slow, until, on 22 December, leads opened up and the ship was able to continue steadily southward. This continued for the next two weeks, taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea.Shackleton 1919, pp. 12–16. Further delays then slowed progress after the turn of the year, before a lengthy run south during 7–10 January 1915 brought them close to the ice walls which guarded the Antarctic coastal region of Coats Land. This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904, during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.Shackleton 1919, pp. 23–24. On 15 January, Endurance came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place. However, Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing, \\"except under pressure of necessity\\"—a decision he would later regret.Shackleton 1919, pp. 26–28. On 17 January, the ship reached a latitude of 76° 27′S, where land was faintly discernible. Shackleton named it Caird Coast, after his principal backer. Bad weather forced the ship to shelter in the lee of a stranded iceberg. They were now close to Luitpold Land, discovered by Filchner in 1912, at the southern end of which lay their destination, Vahsel Bay. Next day, the ship was forced north- westward for , resuming in a generally southerly direction before being stopped altogether. The position was 76° 34′S, 31° 30′W. After ten days of inactivity, the ship's fires were banked to save fuel.Shackleton 1919, p. 31. Strenuous efforts were made to release her; on 14 February, Shackleton ordered men onto the ice with ice-chisels, prickers, saws and picks, to try and force a passage, but the labour proved futile. Shackleton did not at this stage abandon all hope of breaking free, but was now contemplating the \\"possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack\\".Shackleton 1919, pp. 34–40.  Drift of Endurance  Wild among the pressure ridges in the pack ice On 21 February 1915, Endurance, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction.Huntford 1975, p. 418. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \\"dogloos\\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals. Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring. In February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere since 19 January.Shackleton 1919, pp. 43–47. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \\"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \\"she would be crushed like an eggshell\\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area.Huntford 1975, p. 421. Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea, if that coast could be reached. \\"In the meantime\\", he wrote, \\"we must wait\\". Dogs watching Endurance in the final stages of its drift, shortly before it sank to the bottom of the Weddell Sea In the dark winter months of May, June and July, Shackleton was concerned to maintain fitness, training and morale. Although the scope for activity was limited, the dogs were exercised (and on occasion raced competitively), men were encouraged to take moonlight walks, and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals. Special occasions such as Empire Day were duly celebrated.Alexander 1998, pp. 52–54.Shackleton 1919, pp. 50–53. The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July. On 1 August, in a south- westerly gale with heavy snow, the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: \\"The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed\\".Shackleton 1919, p. 58. This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer Wasp reported seeing a coastline which he identified as \\"New South Greenland\\". There was no sign of any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.Shackleton 1919, pp. 60–61. On 30 September, the ship sustained what Shackleton described as \\"the worst squeeze we had experienced\\".Shackleton 1919, pp. 65–66. Worsley described the pressure as like being \\"thrown to and fro like a shuttlecock a dozen times\\". On 24 October, the starboard side was forced against a large floe, increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter, so that water from below the ice began to pour into the ship. When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar to the sound of \\"heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns\\".Shackleton 1919, pp. 72–73. The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the ship's hull and pump out the incoming sea, but after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below , Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was 69° 05′S, 51° 30′W.Shackleton 1919, pp. 74–77. The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550 plates, Hurley chose the best 150, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.Huntford 1975, p. 461.  Camping on the ice  Hurley and Shackleton With the loss of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. Shackleton's intention now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for Paulet Island, where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12 years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskjöld's stranded Swedish expedition.Shackleton 1919, p. 75. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld's winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, or Robertson Island.Alexander 1998, p. 95. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands they would be able to reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day Endurance was abandoned they were from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further to Wilhelmina Bay.Huntford 1975, pp. 456–457. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton over-ruled him. Before the march could begin, Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot, including the carpenter Harry McNish's cat, Mrs Chippy, and a pup which had become a pet of the surgeon Macklin.Shackleton 1919, pp. 81–82. The company set out on 30 October 1915, with two of the ship's lifeboats carried on sledges. Problems quickly arose, as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened. According to Hurley the surface became \\"a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges\\", in which barely a square yard was smooth. In three days, the party managed to travel barely , and on 1 November, Shackleton abandoned the march; they would make camp and await the break-up of the ice.Alexander 1998, p. 98. They gave the name \\"Ocean Camp\\" to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. Parties continued to revisit the Endurance wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21 November, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.Shackleton 1919, p. 98. alt=Old chart showing incomplete Antarctia coastline. The chart indicates the line of Endurance's 1915 drift, also the earlier drift of Filchner's Deutschland and the line of Path of Endurance's drift and the escape route to Elephant Island The ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable, although by late November the speed was up to a day.Shackleton 1919, p. 94. By 5 December, they had passed 68°S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north.Huntford 1975, pp. 468–469. This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island, although Paulet Island, further north, remained a possibility. It was about away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.Huntford 1975, pp. 473–476. Conditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December, carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Admiralty law had lapsed since Endurances sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton's firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten.White, pp. 305–306. Two days later, with only progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: \\"It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land\\".Shackleton 1919, p. 106. The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called \\"Patience Camp\\", which would be their home for more than three months. Supplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916, Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat.Shackleton 1919, pp. 107–109. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton's orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive. The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations.Shackleton 1919, p. 112. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but to its east. \\"It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice\\", Shackleton recorded.Shackleton 1919, p. 116. The party now had land more or less continuously in sight. The peak of Mount Haddington on James Ross Island remained in view as the party drifted slowly by.Fisher 1957, p. 366. They were too far north for Snow Hill or Paulet Island to be accessible, and Shackleton's chief hopes were now fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land. These were Clarence and Elephant Island, around due north of their position on 25 March. He then decided Deception Island might be a better target destination. This lay far to the west, toward the South Shetland Islands, but Shackleton thought it might be attainable by island-hopping. Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by whalers, and might contain provisions, whereas Clarence Island and Elephant Island were desolate and unvisited.Shackleton 1919, p. 119. To reach any of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats, once the floe upon which they were drifting finally broke up. Earlier, the lifeboats had been named after the expedition's three chief financial sponsors: James Caird, Dudley Docker and Stancomb Wills.Huntford 1975, p. 469.  Lifeboat journey to Elephant Island  Paths taken from Endurances beset to the final rescue The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure.Shackleton 1919, p. 121. He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat. At 1 p.m. on 9 April, the Dudley Docker was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the James Caird, Worsley the Dudley Docker, and navigating officer Hubert Hudson was nominally in charge of the Stancomb Wills, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.Huntford 1975, p. 506 The boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve.Huntford 1975, pp. 508–512. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April, rejected the various island options and decided on Hope Bay, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as , with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.Huntford 1975, pp. 509–513. On 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the James Caird rounded the eastern point of the island, to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from high tide markings that this beach would not serve as a long-term camp,Shackleton 1919, pp. 142–150. so the next day Wild and a crew set off in the Stancomb Wills to explore the coast for a safer site. They returned with news of a long spit of land, to the west. With minimum delay the men returned to the boats and transferred to this new location, which they later christened Cape Wild.Smith 2015, pp. 328–329.  Voyage of the James Caird  Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, and rarely visited by whalers or any other ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be necessary to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island,Fisher 1957, p. 371. because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.Shackleton 1919, pp. 156–157. Shackleton selected the boat party: himself, Worsley as navigator, Crean, McNish, Vincent and McCarthy. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the James Caird, improvising tools and materials.Shackleton 1919, pp. 158–159.Alexander 1998, pp. 134–135. Frank Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring, should Shackleton not return. Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, knowing that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.Alexander 1998, pp. 136–137. The James Caird was launched on 24 April 1916. The success of the voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations that would have to be made in the most unfavourable of conditions.Huntford 1975, p. 563. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May, a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in 26 years at sea.Fisher 1957, pp. 378–382. On 8 May, South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.Shackleton 1919, pp. 175–180.  South Georgia crossing  The interior of South Georgia photographed by Frank Hurley The arrival of the James Caird at King Haakon Bay was followed by a period of rest and recuperation, while Shackleton pondered the next move. The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast. To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island, or a land crossing through its unexplored interior. The condition of the James Caird, and the physical state of the party, particularly Vincent and McNish, meant that the crossing was the only realistic option.Shackleton 1919, p. 185.Fisher 1957, p. 383. After five days, the party took the boat a short distance eastwards, to the head of a deep bay which would be the starting point for the crossing. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean would undertake the land journey, the others remaining at what they christened \\"Peggotty Camp\\", to be picked up later after help had been obtained from the whaling stations. A storm on 18 May delayed their start, but by two o'clock the following morning the weather was clear and calm, and an hour later the crossing party set out.. Their destination was the whaling station at Stromness, which had been the last port of call of the on their outbound journey. This was roughly away, across the edge of the Allardyce Range. Another whaling station was known to be at Prince Olav Harbour, just north of Peggotty Camp over easier terrain, but as far as the party was aware, this was only inhabited during the summer months. Shackleton and his men did not know that during their two-year absence in Antarctica, the station's owners had begun year-round operations.Worsley 1933, p. 112 Without a map, the route they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to and could see the northern coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant they would need to move eastward to reach Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge.Fisher 1957, p. 384. There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning, they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, \\"the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914\\".Fisher 1957, p. 385. After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.Fisher 1957, p. 386. Shackleton wrote afterwards: \\"I have no doubt that Providence guided us ... I know that during that long and racking march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers it seemed to me often that we were four, not three\\".Shackleton 1919, p. 209. This image of a fourth traveller—echoed in the accounts of Worsley and Crean—was taken up by T. S. Eliot in his poem The Waste Land.Huntford 1975, pp. 696–697.  Rescue  The departure of the James Caird Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.Shackleton 1919, p. 208–209. It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, The Southern Sky, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some from their destination. The Southern Sky was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.Shackleton 1919, pp. 210–213. On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in Montevideo, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, Instituto de Pesca No. 1, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to Punta Arenas, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner Emma. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again.Shackleton 1919, pp. 214–218. Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the Brunt Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby ice rise was renamed the McDonald Ice Rumples. By now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him , a small steam tug that had assisted Emma during the previous attempt. They agreed; on 25 August, Yelcho—captained by Luis Pardo–set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 a.m. on 30 August, the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.Shackleton 1919, pp. 218–219.  On Elephant Island  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed.Huntford 1975, p. 533. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Mills 1999, pp. 239–240. Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist.Mills 1999, p. 241. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, the storekeeper, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.Mills 1999, pp. 242–250. As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin.Mills 1999, pp. 250–252. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.Huntford 1975, pp. 532–533. By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship, food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore. Orde-Lees wrote: \\"We shall have to eat the one who dies first [...] there's many a true word said in jest\\".Huntford 1975, p. 541. Wild's thoughts were now seriously turning to the possibility of a boat trip to Deception Island—he planned to set out on 5 October, in the hope of meeting a whaling ship—Alexander 1998, p. 182. when, on 30 August 1916, the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of Shackleton and Yelcho.Mills 1999, p. 261. = Ross Sea Party = Aeneas Mackintosh, Ross Sea party commander Aurora left Hobart on 24 December 1914, having been delayed in Australia by financial and organizational problems. The arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was later in the season than planned, but the party's commander Aeneas Mackintosh made immediate plans for a depot-laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf, since he understood that Shackleton hoped to attempt the crossing during that first season.Fisher 1957, pp. 397–400. Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatised, and the party was, as a whole, very inexperienced in ice conditions. The first journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party's 18 dogs and a frostbitten and generally demoralised shore party; a single, incomplete depot was their only achievement.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 69–105. On 7 May, Aurora, anchored at the party's Cape Evans headquarters, was wrenched from her moorings during a gale and carried with drifting ice far out to sea. Unabled to return to McMurdo Sound, she remained captive in the ice for nine months until on 12 February 1916, having travelled a distance of around , she reached open water and limped to New Zealand.Shackleton 1919, pp. 307–333. She carried with her the greater part of the shore party's fuel, food rations, clothing and equipment, although the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore. To continue with its mission the stranded shore party had to re-supply and re-equip itself from the leftovers from earlier expeditions, notably Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition which had been based at Cape Evans a few years earlier. They were thus able to begin the second season's depot-laying on schedule, in September 1915.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 128–144. In the following months, the required depots were laid, at one-degree intervals across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 145–175. On the return journey from the glacier the party was attacked by scurvy; Arnold Spencer-Smith, the expedition's chaplain and photographer, collapsed and died on the ice. The remainder of the party reached the temporary shelter of Hut Point, a relic of the Discovery Expedition at the southern end of McMurdo Sound, where they slowly recovered.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 176–192. On 8 May 1916, Mackintosh and Victor Hayward decided to walk across the unstable sea ice to Cape Evans, were caught in a blizzard, and were not seen again.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 195–197. The survivors eventually reached Cape Evans, but then had to wait for eight further months. Finally, on 10 January 1917, the repaired and refitted Aurora, whose departure from New Zealand had been delayed by lack of money, arrived to transport them back to civilization;.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp. 222–227, 234–243. Shackleton accompanied the ship as a supernumerary officer, having been denied command by the governments of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain who had jointly organised and financed the Ross Sea party's relief.Tyler-Lewis 2006, p. 231.  Return to civilization, and aftermath  The rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the Great War. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916.Huntford 1975, pp. 605–606. The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.Huntford 1975, p. 647. Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness.Huntford 1975, p. 656. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild of the Ross Sea party had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry.Shackleton 1919, pp. 339–341. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the Army rank of Major.Fisher 1957, p. 432. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition on , which left London on 17 September 1921. From the Endurance crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, Alexander Kerr, Thomas McLeod and cook Charles Green, all sailed with Quest.Smith 2015, pp. 402–407. Shackleton died of a heart attack on 5 January 1922, while Quest was anchored at South Georgia.Smith 2015, pp. 410–411. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land,Mills 1999, p. 289. was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.Mills 1999, pp. 304–305. It would be more than 40 years before the first crossing of Antarctica was achieved, by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1955–1958. This expedition set out from Vahsel Bay, following a route which avoided the Beardmore Glacier altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the Skelton Glacier. The entire journey took 98 days.Fuchs & Hillary 1958, p. 293.

The lens has an EF mount to work with the EOS line of cameras. Other than the front element, it is sealed against dust and water, and features a diaphragm which remains nearly circular from 4 to 8. It is one of the few Canon photo lenses that are parfocal. Audience The 17–40mm is the least expensive of Canon's current wide-angle zooms for full-frame bodies, with the EF 16–35mm 4L IS USM and EF 11–24mm 4L USM being more expensive, and the EF 16–35mm 2.8L USM being both faster and more expensive. Weighing 475 g and measuring 83.5 mm x 96.8 mm, it is a popular choice with many photographers because of its light and compact size. A member of the L-series, the 17–40mm is a good substitute for the 16–35mm 2.8 lens, which is heavier and costs approximately twice as much. Canon now sells an image-stabilized 16–35mm 4 lens for about $300 more than the 17–40. This lens is also a popular step up from the stock kit lens on many of Canon's EOS Digital family of cameras, the EF-S 18–55mm 3.5–5.6, for those still wanting a wide angle lens. On a cropped sensor, it has 35 mm equivalent focal length of 27–64mm. In this role, it is compared with the EF-S 17–55mm lens, with which it can unofficially share lens hoods. Companion lenses This lens is often paired with an L series telephoto lens, such as the EF 28–300mm 3.5–5.6 L USM or any of the EF 70–200mm family (4L USM, 4L IS USM, 2.8L USM, 2.8L IS USM, 2.8L IS II USM).

The main branch of the Chesapeake Public Library named the Central Library, which itself is located in Great Bridge, displays a 12-pound cannonball, labeled as having been fired at the Battle of Great Bridge. The written histories of the battle are specific in stating that there were only two cannon at the battle, both British \\"four pounders.\\" Though the battles of Lexington and Concord took place months earlier, and are historically more memorable, the Battle of Great Bridge can be seen as the first strategically important colonial victory over the British, forcing Lord Dunmore's 200 redcoats to evacuate Fort Murray and withdraw to Norfolk. The city hall as well as other major municipal buildings for Chesapeake lie within Great Bridge. Great Bridge was essentially a small town or crossroads until the late 1980s and 1990s, when it experienced significant growth. It contains large residential areas as well as many large shopping centers. Also, Great Bridge was the home of professional baseball players, Michael Cuddyer, David Wright, B.J.

It is managed by UW Medicine. Overview Front entrance of Harborview Medical Center Harborview Medical Center is the designated Disaster Control Hospital for Seattle and King County, on account of it having the only Level I adult and pediatric trauma and burn center in Washington state; it also serves the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Montana. Harborview's burn center is one of the largest in the United States, specializing in pioneering treatments including the use of artificial skin products, which have significantly reduced mortality rates for severely burned patients. Harborview's Center for Sexual Assault provides medical and counseling services for victims of sexual assault and their families. Thousands of patients are treated each year in the Neurosurgery Department for disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, such as head and spinal cord injuries, stroke, brain tumors, degenerative disc disease, and spinal disc herniations. The hospital's orthopedics service has been listed as one of the top 10 services of its kind in the country by U.S. News and World Report. As of fiscal year 2007, Harborview's operating budget was $568 million and its income from operations was $585 million. Harborview was instrumental in establishing Medic One, one of the country's first paramedic response programs. Many of Washington state's emergency medical service technicians are trained at the hospital. Harborview is also the principal clinical site for the University of Washington's center for AIDS research. The Madison Clinic, Harborview's outpatient facility, is the largest single provider of AIDS care in King County. History The hospital was founded in 1877 as King County Hospital, a six-bed welfare hospital in a two- story south Seattle building. By 1906, it had moved into a new building in Georgetown, with room for 225 patients. Another move occurred in 1931, when the center wing of the present hospital on First Hill was completed, and the hospital's name was changed to Harborview. Harborview's Center for Sexual Assault and Traumatic Stress was established in 1973. In popular media Harborview is the subject of Audrey Young's book House of Hope and Fear, and the Mark Lanegan song \\"Harborview Hospital\\". In the 2005 ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy Seattle Grace Hospital was based on Harborview Medical Center. It is also in the television show Private Practice, a Grey's Anatomy spinoff. Over the course of Grey's Anatomy, there were two other hospital names in the same hospital based on Harborview, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, and Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Harborview also appears in the two-hour special \\"Most Deadly Passage\\" of the series Emergency!, where main characters John Gage and Roy DeSoto visit Seattle to see how the paramedics of the Seattle Fire Department handle their calls compared to the ones Gage and DeSoto deal with back in Los Angeles County. Harborview serves as the inspiration for Lakehill Hospital in the 2020 video game The Last of Us Part II, which takes place largely in Seattle.

It once again featured Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield. The special was first broadcast October 26, 1984 on CBS. It has been released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD home video. This is the third of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. In this special, Garfield, Jon and Odie go camping.  Storyline  Garfield is living in a boring, black and white world, claiming that all the color has gone out of his life (which explains the subtitle at the beginning: \\"Please do not adjust your sets; all the color has temporarily gone out of Garfield's life\\"). Jon agrees that all the color has gone and suggests a vacation as a remedy. The color suddenly comes back into Garfield's life. He is excited that Jon wants to take him and Odie on vacation, where he imagines himself in places such as Acapulco, Honolulu and Venice. After realizing that each destination has its drawbacks, Garfield concludes it doesn't matter because they won't be staying home. This joy is short-lived once Jon announces that they're going camping, but Jon forces Garfield to go. After a long, exhausting journey (from Garfield's point of view), the trio arrives at the campgrounds to check in, while Garfield immediately takes a dislike to one of the camp rangers for insulting him. After a few shenanigans at their campsite, including placing a live fish in the coffee pot, Jon finally gets his new \\"super deluxe\\" tent set up, although the result doesn't really match the ad. Unlike Jon, who is very enthusiastic about it, Garfield doesn't take to the outdoors, stating that \\"it would be greater if it were inside\\". As night falls, the trio listen to the radio which is interrupted by a news bulletin about a panther that has escaped from a local zoo earlier that morning and been reported in the Lake Woebegone area. Right after this news on the radio, the announcer says: \\"We now return to our regular broadcast of fun music.\\" (It then plays \\"So Long Old Friend\\" from the first Garfield TV special.) Believing the news, Garfield is terrified and wants to leave, but Jon assures him that Lake Woebegone is miles from their location and that they're perfectly safe. Following the announcement, Jon sings an old campfire song that his mother used to sing called \\"Camping is my Life\\" (while Garfield and Odie endure his banjo playing) before the trio goes to bed. After they go into their tent, on the hilltops, the panther comes out and growls as it eyes their campsite. The next day, Odie wakes Jon up at the crack of dawn by licking his feet. This sends Jon rolling down the hill into the lake while still in his tent with Garfield in tow. At Garfield's suggestion that he \\"go and play with something poisonous\\", Odie runs into the nearby woods, passing a sign that reveals the woods to be Lake Woebegone, where the panther is lurking. The forest rangers are hunting for the panther, and attempt to warn Jon to evacuate, but after finding no one there, leave a note and move on. This proves unfortunate as a gust of wind kicks up after they leave, tossing the message into a recently extinguished campfire, where it burns up. Despite not hearing a man-eating beast growling in the night, Jon does find out that Garfield and Odie (to a lesser extent) have eaten all the food for the week, except for the dried fruit, and goes off on a tirade. Meanwhile, Garfield heads through the woods to wait for the heat to die down. While there, he starts to appreciate the beauty of nature, until he meets two forest animals named Dicky Beaver and Billy Bunny who warn Garfield about the escaped panther, claiming it has already attacked other forest animals. Odie appears, after scaring all but Garfield away by accident, and the two eavesdrop on the two rangers passing by with a tranquilizer gun, hoping to capture the panther. The first ranger wishes that he had a weapon more powerful than his tranquilizer gun to hunt the panther with, but the second ranger assures him that one of the tranquilizer darts will be enough to knock out the panther. Garfield and Odie decide that now is the time to collect Jon and leave before they are possibly attacked by the beast, and the two run all the way back to the campsite. Upon their return, Garfield tries to warn Jon of the danger, but Jon doesn't understand the warning (as Garfield can't talk), insisting that they have dried fruit and refuses to move. Garfield tries desperately to convince Odie to get into the car, warning Odie that they will be dead if they don't leave right away. However, the full moon comes into view and shines down on the camp, revealing that the panther has now entered their campsite and is approaching the trio as they look on in horror. Garfield runs up a tree while Jon and Odie hide in the tent, followed by the Jon's car as the panther tears the tent to shreds and then manages to break into the vehicle by smashing through a window. Scared but unable to watch his family being killed, Garfield leaps from the tree and takes on the panther, clawing at its head and neck, only to be shaken off. Garfield is in serious danger until the park rangers enter the campsite and subdue the beast with a tranquilizer dart. Jon congratulates Garfield for being a hero. The rangers come by and tell Jon that they were heroes too for saving Garfield from the panther, because if they hadn't made it there on time or if the dart had missed the panther, Garfield, Jon, and Odie would have been killed. Jon then announces that he feels they have had enough adventure and recommends they break camp and return to civilization, much to Garfield's joy. The rangers return the panther to the zoo, while Garfield, Jon, and Odie set off for home with Garfield bragging over how he took on the panther, as well as struggling to say, \\"When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\\"  Cast  * Lorenzo Music - Garfield * Thom Huge - Jon Arbuckle * Gregg Berger - Odie / Ranger #1 / Radio Announcer * George Wendt - Ranger #2 * Hal Smith - Dicky Beaver * Orson Bean - Billy Rabbit * Desirée Goyette - Girl Cats  Songs  * \\"Get Me Some 'R and 'R\\" performed by Lou Rawls * \\"Jarabe Tapatío\\" (instrumental) * \\"When I'm Out in the Rough\\" performed by Lorenzo Music and Thom Huge * \\"So Long Old Friend\\" performed by Desirée Goyette * \\"Camping is My Life\\" performed by Thom Huge * \\"The Music of Nature\\" performed by Desirée Goyette * \\"Run-Run I'm afraid\\" performed by Thom Huge and Desirée Goyette * \\"Panther Showdown\\" (instrumental) * \\"Get Me Some 'R and 'R\\" (instrumental)  Awards  * 1985 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program  References   External links  * * Category:Garfield television specials Category:1980s American television specials Category:1984 television specials Category:1984 in American television Category:1980s American animated films Category:American films Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:CBS original programming Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:Film Roman television specials Category:Television shows written by Jim Davis (cartoonist) Category:Emmy Award-winning programs ","title":"Garfield in the Rough"},{"id":"2183416","text":"Bellevue High School is a public secondary school located in Bellevue, Washington. Bellevue has 1632 students enrolled in grades 9 through 12. The school principal is Dr. Victor J. Anderson. The school's mascot is the wolverine. Bellevue High School generally serves students in Bellevue School District's West Zone, which includes the towns of Medina, Yarrow Point, Clyde Hill, Hunts Point and Beaux Arts, and the neighborhoods of Enatai, Woodridge, Wilburton and Downtown Bellevue. History Bellevue High School's history can be traced back to 1923, when it first became an accredited four-year high school. Classes were held in a two-room school built in 1892 at the southeast corner of 100th Avenue and Main Street. It was at this location that The Beacon (the school annual) and The Barque (the student newspaper) began publication in 1925 and 1926, respectively. From 1930 until 1949, the school was located on 102nd Avenue Northeast between Northeast 1st and 4th Streets, a site which is now part of Bellevue Downtown Park. The school was known as Overlake High School during part of this era. Bellevue's award-winning chapter of the Future Farmers of America formed an important part of student and community life until the area's rapid urbanization led to the chapter disbanding in 1950. The high school moved once again in January 1949 to its current hilltop campus on Kilmarnock Street (renamed \\"Wolverine Way\\" as the result of a campaign led by the Class of 2000). The Bellevue Memorial Athletic Field opened on September 15 of the following year, dedicated to \\"the men and women of the Overlake area, living and dead, who faithfully served their country at home and abroad during World War II.\\" The building underwent four major additions and renovations between 1952 and 1978. By the late 2000s, school officials felt that the heating and lighting systems, the Performing Arts Center, and the building in general were outdated; in June 2010, Bellevue High began a major construction project to address these concerns. Designed by NAC Architecture, the project was a phased addition and modernization to the 1949 school, building new academic classrooms, commons, administration and library before demolishing most of the existing facilities, leaving only the PE and athletic facilities to be modernized. A new performing arts center with music and drama classrooms and new parking lots were built where the existing structures were removed. In order to maintain a sense of continuity and respect for the legacy of the school, the red brick and elements of the original design are reinterpreted in the new building. Academics Newsweek magazine has ranked Bellevue High School among the best public and private high schools in the nation since it initiated its ranking of U.S. high schools in 2003 as measured by the number of AP tests taken divided by the number of seniors. The subsequent publicity resulted in the school reaching its building population limit and closing the formerly open enrollment policy. For the 2007–2008 school year, only students living within its zones may newly enroll. Bellevue High School also has a number of special vocational programs in areas such as automotive technology, as well as a class that is responsible for the KASB radio station.  Activities  The largest extracurricular organization at Bellevue is Key Club, with over 100 members. The chapter is part of Pacific Northwest Division 28, which is the largest division in the Pacific Northwest and has a record of winning the Spirit Award at district conventions. Many other clubs at the school are noteworthy, such as the DECA Team which has won Nationals three times and the school's dedicated FIRST Robotics Team which has won the district competition in 2008. Bellevue high school also has a chess team, who won the 2018 WA State High School Team Chess Championship. A campus tradition is Soup 4 Simpson, a charity event that happens every year to donate money to homeless shelters. The Bellevue High School Band program has also received national recognition. The 2016-2017 jazz band was selected as finalists for the Swing Central Jazz Festival in Savannah, Georgia, where twelve of the nation’s top bands are invited. They have also been selected for the Hot Java Cool Jazz Concert, which features live sets by award-winning jazz bands from five local high schools. Athletics Bellevue has 20 varsity teams and 45 other teams that provide a range of team and individual sports. The school has won state titles in multiple individual and team sports including boys and girls cross country, lacrosse, tennis, soccer, swimming, water polo, track, wrestling, and football,WIAA State Championship History as well as several team academic championships. Of particular note is Bellevue's Girls swim and dive team whose 2007 3A Championship represents its sixth in seven years, and seventh in nine years.Seattle Times Article on 2006 Swim and Dive Champion Bellevue's football team has gained significant attention, winning the Washington State 3A championship 11 times between 2001 and 2013 Under the coaching of Butch Goncharoff, Although there have been multiple calls to move the school to Class 4A, the school has refused.

Bellevue's 2008 state 3A football championship was the school's sixth state championship in eight years and seventh state football championship in school history. Prior to winning the 2008 state championship, the Bellevue football team was involved in a rollover bus crash several hours prior to playing the Capital Cougars (Olympia, WA) in the state semi-finals in the Tacoma Dome. The accident delayed the game for three days as the Bellevue Wolverines went on to defeat the Cougars in the state semi-finals. Bellevue holds multiple other Washington State records including the record for most consecutive championship tournament wins at 17. The 2009 team went on and had a 12–2 record and again won the WIAA 3A state title.

Her reports air regularly on NPR's newsmagazines All Things Considered, Morning Edition, and Weekend Edition. From 1992 to 2013, she was also a panelist on the syndicated TV political commentary show Inside Washington. Newsweek magazine called her \\"the creme de la creme\\" of NPR , and Vanity Fair refers to her as \\"Queen of the Leaks\\". She has won many broadcast journalism awards for both her explanatory pieces and her scoops. Among her scoops was her groundbreaking report of sexual harassment allegations made against Clarence Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill, leading the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Previously, in 1986, she broke the story that Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg had smoked marijuana, leading Ginsburg to withdraw his name. And in 1977, she reported on secret Supreme Court deliberations relating to the Watergate scandal. Personal life and family From left, Jill, Nina, and Amy Totenberg celebrate the return of their father's Stradivarius violin in 2015. Nina Totenberg was born in New York, the eldest daughter of violinist Roman Totenberg, who was born in Poland, and Melanie (Shroder) Totenberg, who was a real estate broker. She is the widow of U.S. Senator Floyd K. Haskell (D-Colorado), whom she married in 1979. She remarried in 2000 to H. David Reines, a trauma surgeon and Vice Chairman of Surgery at Inova Fairfax Hospital. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg presided over this wedding. On their honeymoon, he treated her for severe injuries after she was hit by a boat propeller while swimming. In March 2010, Totenberg's sister Amy Totenberg was nominated by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Amy Totenberg was confirmed the next year. Another sister, Jill Totenberg, is a businesswoman married to Brian Foreman. On August 6, 2015, the Ames Stradivarius, which had been stolen from their father 35 years earlier, was returned to the three sisters. Early career Totenberg enrolled in Boston University in 1962, majoring in journalism, but dropped out less than three years later because, in her own words, she \\"wasn’t doing brilliantly\\". Soon after dropping out of college, Totenberg began her journalism career at the Boston Record American, where she worked on the Women's Page and learned breaking news journalism skills by volunteering in the news department. She moved on to the Peabody Times in Massachusetts and Roll Call in Washington, D.C. At the National Observer, Totenberg began covering legal affairs. In 1971 she broke a story about a secret list of candidates President Richard Nixon was considering for the Supreme Court. All the candidates were later rejected as unqualified by the American Bar Association and none were nominated. After Totenberg wrote an Observer profile of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the latter wrote a long letter to the paper's editor demanding she be fired. Instead, the editor printed the letter in the Observer along with a rebuttal of Hoover's complaints regarding the article. She was fired from that paper for plagiarism in 1972 regarding a profile she wrote of then-soon-to-be Speaker Tip O'Neill which included, without attribution, quotes from members of Congress that had previously appeared in The Washington Post. Totenberg has said that the dismissal also related to her rebuffing of sexual overtures from an editor. Many of Totenberg's colleagues have defended her, noting that the use of previously-reported quotes was a common journalistic practice in the 1970s. In 1995, Totenberg told the Columbia Journalism Review, \\"I have a strong feeling that a young reporter is entitled to one mistake and to have the holy bejeezus scared out of her to never do it again.\\" She next worked for the New York-based news magazine New Times. At that publication, she wrote a celebrated article called \\"The Ten Dumbest Members of Congress\\", prompting the senator at the top of the list, William L. Scott, to call a press conference to deny that he was the \\"dumbest member of Congress.\\" National Public Radio In 1975, Nina Totenberg was hired by Bob Zelnick to work at National Public Radio and has been there since. =Watergate appeals= In 1977, Totenberg broke a story about the Supreme Court appeal of three men who had been convicted in the Watergate scandal: H.R. Haldeman, John N. Mitchell, and John D. Ehrlichman. Totenberg revealed the results of their secret 5–3 vote against reviewing the case and that the three dissenters were appointees of President Richard Nixon. Nixon had resigned three years earlier, in the wake of Watergate. Totenberg also revealed that Nixon-appointed Chief Justice Warren Burger delayed announcing the results of the vote, hoping to sway his fellow justices. Her reporting of private Supreme Court deliberations was a novel development in Supreme Court reporting and led to speculation about who on the Court gave her the information. =William Rehnquist's Chief Justice nomination= In 1986, Totenberg broke the story that William H. Rehnquist, who was nominated for Chief Justice of the United States by Ronald Reagan, had written a memo in 1970 opposing the Equal Rights Amendment, in which he said that the amendment would \\"hasten the dissolution of the family\\" and that would \\"virtually abolish all legal distinctions between men and women.\\" The memo was written when Rehnquist was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in the Nixon Administration. =Douglas Ginsburg's Supreme Court nomination= Totenberg broke the story that Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who had been nominated to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan, had smoked marijuana \\"on a few occasions\\" during his student days in the 1960s and while an assistant professor at Harvard Law School in the 1970s, something that did not appear in Ginsburg's FBI background check. The revelations resulted in Ginsburg's withdrawing his name from consideration. Totenberg was awarded the 1988 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton award for outstanding broadcast journalism for the story. =Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings= Totenberg in 2020 In 1991, a few days before a confirmation vote was scheduled for Republican George H. W. Bush's Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Totenberg disclosed allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill. Totenberg's report about Hill's allegations led the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings to consider Hill's charges. Totenberg was criticized by many of Thomas' supporters, including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee. The Senate appointed special counsel Peter E. Fleming Jr. to investigate the leak. Totenberg and Newsdays Timothy Phelps were subpoenaed by Fleming, but refused to answer questions about their confidential sources. Totenberg was confronted by one Thomas supporter, Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, during and after the taping of an episode of Nightline. On the show, Simpson criticized Totenberg, saying \\"What politicians get tired of is bias in reporters. Let's not pretend your reporting is objective here. That would be absurd.\\" After Totenberg defended her reporting and objectivity on the show, Simpson followed her out of the studio and continued to criticize her, even holding open the door of her limousine so she could not leave. \\"He was in a complete rage. He was out of control,\\" Totenberg said. Accounts differ on Totenberg's response, but she used what she called \\"choice epithets\\" and said: \\"I think I told him to shut the fuck up.\\" Following Totenberg's allegation to The Washington Posts Howard Kurtz that she had been sexually harassed at the National Observer, Al Hunt of The Wall Street Journal brought up the plagiarism incident in a column about media coverage of and responses to the Thomas hearings. Some observers connected Hunt's rehashing of a then nearly 20-year-old incident to the stance of the Journal, whose conservative editorial pages had \\"editorially championed\\" Thomas and had previously criticized Totenberg, but Hunt denied any ideological motivation. For the report and NPR's gavel-to-gavel coverage, Totenberg received the George Foster Peabody Award. The same year, she won the George Polk Award for excellence in journalism and the Joan S. Barone Award for excellence in Washington-based national affairs/public policy reporting (the latter also in part for her coverage of the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall). The American Library Association presented her with its James Madison Award, given to those who \\"championed, protected, and promoted public access to government information and the public’s right to know\\". She also earned the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for investigative reporting. Distinction and acclaim Totenberg in 2013 In addition to awards mentioned above, and among her other awards, Totenberg has been honored seven times by the American Bar Association for excellence in legal reporting and won the first-ever Toni House award presented by the American Judicature Society for a career body of work, and was the first radio journalist to be honored by the National Press Foundation as Broadcaster of the Year. She has written articles for the Harvard Law Review (including tributes to Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Lewis Powell when they retired); The New York Times Magazine, New York magazine; the Christian Science Monitor; and numerous other legal and general circulation publications. She also contributed to the Jewish Women's Archive's online exhibit Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution with regard to her reporting on Anita Hill's allegations against Clarence Thomas. In the 1990s Totenberg was a regular contributor to ABC's Nightline. Totenberg played the part of an election anchor in the film The Distinguished Gentleman (1992), and also appeared briefly as herself in the Kevin Kline film Dave (1993). Her image has also been used for an item produced for NPR called \\"The Nina Totin' Bag\\"—a play on her name and the stereotypical tote bag offered as a thank-you gift for donating to a public broadcasting pledge drive. Controversies and criticism Totenberg has made friends with a number of politicians and lawyers in national politics, and her personal connections to these people have occasionally generated discussion. Allegations that Totenberg obtained her scoops by untoward means were prevalent early in her career, a fact Bill Kovach, editor of The New York Times, attributed to sexism since she was one of the few women working in a predominantly male environment. Totenberg was criticized by some commentators for hugging her friend Lani Guinier during a press conference announcing Guinier's nomination by Bill Clinton to the post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Media critic Howard Kurtz reported that while Totenberg said she did not intend to give special treatment to Guinier in her reporting, she had hugged her because she had not seen her in some time. Then in 2000, some journalists expressed concern that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's officiating at Totenberg's wedding could be seen as a conflict of interest. Totenberg responded she did not consider it a conflict of interest since her friendship with the jurist was established long before Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court. She also had a friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia from when he was an assistant US attorney general. The Wall Street Journal editorialist Paul Gigot wrote in 1991 that Totenberg exhibits partisanship in her reporting.As quoted in Washington Post reporter Thomas Edsall said in 1995 that she was cited as an example of liberal bias in public broadcasting due to her reporting on two controversial Supreme Court nominations. In 1995, responding to conservative Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who characterized AIDS as a \\"disease transmitted by people deliberately engaging in unnatural acts\\" in his effort to cut government spending to combat it, Totenberg said: \\"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the good Lord's mind, because if there's retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion or one of his grandchildren will.\\"Senator Jesse Helms: Cut AIDS Funding On the same show, conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Tony Snow also criticized Helms, with Krauthammer calling Helms's remarks \\"bigoted and cruel\\" and Snow accusing him of \\"hypocrisy\\". Totenberg subsequently expressed regret for her choice of words, saying: \\"It was a stupid remark. I'll pay for it for the rest of my life.\\" Following his October 2010 firing from NPR for comments he made on FoxNews, Juan Williams said the failure of NPR to discipline her for these statements was an example of NPR's double standard, a charge echoed by Fox News and conservative pundits.

He died during a transatlantic flight trial. Early life and service Ludwik Idzikowski was born in Warsaw. He started mining studies in Liege, Belgium. At the outbreak of World War I, he was conscripted into the Russian Army. He completed aviation school in Sevastopol, and from 1916 served in air combat units as an officer pilot. After the October Revolution he managed to return to Warsaw and in November 1918 Idzikowski joined the newly-born Polish Army, in the rank of podporucznik pilot (flying 2nd Lieutenant). In 1919 he joined the Polish Air Force and during the Polish- Soviet War, initially flew with the 7th fighter escadre (\\"Kościuszko Squadron\\"), crewed mostly by American volunteers, then the 6th reconnaissance escadre. He took part, among others, in the defence of Lwów. After the war, from 1921-1923 he was an instructor, then commander of escadre training in an advanced flying school in Grudziądz. From 1924-1926 he commanded an escadre, then a squadron, in the 1st Aviation Regiment in Warsaw. Idzikowski with Kazimierz Kubala in the Amiot 123 \\"Marszałek Piłsudski\\" airplane. First transatlantic flight attempt In April 1926, Idzikowski was sent to France with a Polish military mission, where he tested aircraft bought by the Polish government. It was then that he planned to make his first transatlantic flight, but in the more difficult and as yet, unsuccessfully attempted East- West direction. A French attempt had been made in May 1927 aboard The White Bird (L'Oiseau Blanc), but the aircraft disappeared over the Atlantic. Two weeks later, the American Charles Lindbergh made the first successful nonstop flight from New York to Paris. After considerable hesitation, the Polish authorities, urged on by the press, eventually succumbed and bought a special plane for a transatlantic flight from France. A long range variant of the latest bomber Amiot 123, It was named Marszałek Piłsudski (Marshal Józef Piłsudski). On January 1, 1928, Idzikowski was promoted to Major. The second pilot and navigator chosen was Major Kazimierz Kubala. They commenced their first trials for the transatlantic flight on August 3, 1928, taking off at 4:45 a.m. from Paris Le Bourget airfield. However, after flying some 3,200 km and above the ocean, they noticed engine oil levels were falling, caused by a cracked oil tank. They decided to return to Europe, since it was more than half way to America and against the wind. After 31 hours of flight, oil depleted, Idzikowski decided to land on water by the German merchant ship Samos, about 70 km from the Spanish coast. The sailors rescued the crew and pulled the aircraft from the water. Second transatlantic flight attempt Idzikowski and Kubala repeated a trial the next year. A second Amiot 123 was bought, since the old one was too badly damaged. It was named the White Eagle (according to some sources, it was named Marszałek Piłsudski as well). They took off on July 13, 1929, at 3:45 a.m. from Le Bourget. After flying 2140 km, over the ocean, about 5 p.m., an engine started to lose RPM and emit noise. They decided to land on Faial Island in the Azores. However, because of more irregular engine work, at 9 p.m. (7 p.m. local time), Idzikowski decided to make an emergency landing on a closer rocky island Graciosa. During a landing on a field, the plane hit a low stone wall and overturned, wheels up. In the crash, Ludwik Idzikowski was killed, while Kazimierz Kubala was slightly injured. During the rescue operation, the aircraft was wrecked and Idzikowski burned. Idzikowski's body was returned to Poland by the sailing ship ORP Iskra and buried with honours on August 17, 1929. He was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari, Cross of Valour (Krzyz Walecznych) (three times), Gold Cross of Merit, and (posthumously) the Officer's Cross of the Polonia Restituta. He also held the Field Pilot Badge. Idzikowski was commemorated with a monument in Dąbrowa Górnicza-Tucznawa at the terrain of local Primary School.

Early life Hodges was born at the North Middlesex University Hospital in Edmonton on 28 December 1943 to Albert and Daisy Hodges. He was named Charles Nicholas, but called Chas as it was a common nickname for Charles in Hackney where his father was from. He was raised in north London, and moved to Kent in the summer of 1947. His father, a lorry driver, killed himself the day before Hodges' fourth birthday. Interviewed by The Daily Telegraph in 2015 he said, \\"We never discovered what caused him to shoot himself with a shotgun.\\" After his father's death, the family returned to Edmonton in North London to live with his grandparents, with his mother making a living playing piano in local pubs and clubs. He attended Eldon Road School, and later Edmonton Higher Grade School but left just before he was 15 at the end of 1958. Hodges first became interested in Rock 'n' Roll music after listening to Little Richard on Radio Luxembourg around 1956. He was then inspired by Lonnie Donegan to learn to play the guitar when he was 12, and joined a skiffle band a year later in 1957, The Horseshoe Skiffle Group. In May 1958, he attended a Jerry Lee Lewis concert and became interested in learning to play the piano. He worked for a while in a jeweller's shop after leaving school. Career Hodges became a professional musician by the age of 16, playing bass guitar with various local bands until he joined Billy Gray and the Stormers in 1960. After Billy Gray and the Stormers broke up, Hodges worked with the producer Joe Meek who put Hodges and his former band together as backing band for Mike Berry, forming the Outlaws. They were later joined by Ritchie Blackmore. They also worked as session musicians, backing Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Haley and Gene Vincent. Hodges claimed that he learnt the piano by watching Jerry Lee Lewis whilst backing him. During this time, Hodges became known as \\"Sleepy\\" after his habit of falling asleep during the recording process. The Outlaws broke up, and he was invited to join Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers as a bass player in 1965.Bloom, Jerry (2006) Black Knight: The Ritchie Blackmore Story, Omnibus Press, , p. 41 Hodges had known Dave Peacock for a number of years; they met in 1963 when a friend of Peacock gave Hodges a lift home and found they had similar taste in music. After the Rebel Rousers, Hodges joined Peacock, Harvey Hinsley and Mick Burt in Black Claw (three of the band would later be in Chas & Dave). In 1970, Albert Lee asked him to join a new band Heads Hands & Feet, who supported Blackmore's subsequent band Deep Purple on tour. He played bass with Purple for one show on 8 March 1971, at Music Hall Aberdeen, substituting for the regular bassist, Roger Glover who was ill. They attempted to form a new breakaway band The New Heads Hands & Feet, Lee however left to play for The Crickets, and they finished as a band. =Chas & Dave= Hodges toured America when he was with Heads Hands & Feet, and it was during the tour that he began to have the idea of performing in his natural accent as he thought it \\"not quite real\\" performing in an American accent to an American audience. When Heads Hands & Feet broke up in 1972, Hodges and Peacock considered forming a band together, singing in their own accent about things they knew. They began to perform as a duo Chas & Dave. Hodges was originally a bass player, but in Chas & Dave he played the piano and guitar while Peacock played bass. They also recorded as Oily Rags (cockney rhyming slang for cigarettes - \\"fags\\") with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace, and releasing a self-titled album in 1974. They also recorded an album with Oliver Nelson. In 1975 Hodges and Peacock played on Labi Siffre's album Remember My Song. Eminem would later sample a riff from the song \\"I Got The\\" (featuring Hodges on guitar and Peacock on bass) on his 1999 hit \\"My Name Is\\". Hodges and Peacock recorded their first album as Chas & Dave in 1974, and this album, One Fing'*'Anuvver, was released in 1975. According to Hodges, the title track \\"One Fing'*'Anuvver\\" was their first Rockney song. Burt joined the duo in 1976 as a drummer. They were signed by EMI in 1978, and the album Rockney was released the same year. A song from the album, \\"Strummin'\\", was their first song to reach the chart. In early 1979, a song from their first album \\"Woortcha!\\" was used for a notable television commercial for Courage Bitter, and the song was then re-recorded and released as a single, retitled \\"Gertcha\\". They opened for Led Zeppelin at the 1979 Knebworth Festival. In 1980, Chas & Dave formed their own record label Rockney with their manager Bob England. Their first release under this label \\"Rabbit\\" became a top 10 hit. They had a bigger hit song in 1982 with \\"Ain't No Pleasing You\\", written largely by Hodges. Hodges was popular amongst supporters of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club owing to singles he had released as Chas & Dave. These include \\"Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur\\", \\"Hot Shot Tottenham!\\", \\"When the Year Ends in One\\", \\"Spurs Medley\\" and \\"Ossie's Dream (Spurs Are on Their Way to Wembley)\\".

He was raised in Ponders End and the Freezywater areas of Enfield. Peacock is best known as having been one half of the English musical duo Chas & Dave between 1974 and the death of Chas Hodges in 2018. Career Earlier in his career in the 1960s, Peacock was in a group called the Rolling Stones (formed in 1960 before the more famous one), as well as The Tumbleweeds, and worked with Mick Greenwood and Jerry Donahue. He met Chas Hodges in 1963 when he and his friend gave Hodges a lift home, and became friends when they found they had similar taste in music. Later in the late 1960s they became part of a group called Black Claw together with Harvey Hinsley and Mick Burt, and recorded tracks with Albert Lee. Black Claw was short-lived, and Peacock left to join a country and western band, while Hodges joined Heads Hands & Feet in 1970. = Chas & Dave = In 1972, Peacock and Hodges decided to form a band together which would be the beginning of Chas & Dave. In their early years, they also recorded as Oily Rags (cockney rhyming slang for cigarettes - \\"fags\\") with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace, and releasing a self-titled album in 1974. They also worked as session musicians and recorded with a number of artists, and recorded an album with Oliver Nelson. Both played on Labi Siffre's album Remember My Song in 1975. Eminem would later sample a riff from the song \\"I Got The\\" (featuring Hodges on guitar and Peacock on bass) on his 1999 hit \\"My Name Is\\". One of the early songs Peacock and Hodges wrote together, \\"Gertcha\\", would become a hit in 1979 after it was used in a television advert for Courage bitter. They would have a number of hit songs together, including \\"Rabbit\\" and \\"Ain't No Pleasing You\\". They also recorded a number of songs with Tottenham Hotspur F.C., both being fans of the team; the first song they wrote for the club, \\"Ossie's Dream\\", was largely written by Peacock. In 2009, following the death of his wife Sue,(Susan Heath born 1946 in Croydon married in Greenwich in 1973) Peacock announced his retirement from performing with Chas & Dave. However, in 2010 the band announced a tour for the following year. They also played their \\"Christmas Jamboree\\" at the IndigO2 on 23 and 24 December 2011 and 8 December 2012.

Biography Wednesday was a founding member of JAB, an Australian punk rock band, in Adelaide in January 1976. The band's original lineup consisted of Bohdan X (Bodhan Kubiakowski) on guitar and vocals, Wednesday playing bass guitar, synthesizer and tapes and Johnny Crash (Janis Friedenfelds) on drums and vocals. The band took its name from the first initials of the founding members. The band relocated to Melbourne in August 1977. JAB signed to Suicide Records in January 1978, and two of their songs, \\"Blonde and Bombed\\" and \\"Let's Go\\", were included on the Lethal Weapons compilation.Honeysuckle, TJ (4 October 2007).

Retrieved on 15 December 2010. Wednesday, Crash and Pierre Voltaire then joined Sean Kelly (ex-Teenage Radio Stars) to form the first line-up of Models.McFarlane, 'Models' entry. Retrieved 6 November 2010. The initial version of the group did not stay together for long as Voltaire was soon replaced on bass guitar by Mark Ferrie (ex-Myriad), then in August 1979, Wednesday was replaced by Andrew Duffield (ex-Whirlywirld) on keyboards. In 1980 he released a solo single, \\"Love By Numbers\\" and produced four songs with vocalist Karen Marks (the manager of Models and JAB). That year he also joined experimental outfit The Metronomes with rock journalist Al Webb (guitar, synthesiser; ex-Streetlife)and Andrew Picouleau (bass, synthesiser; Secret Police, Sacred Cowboys), having previously been an invited guest with the band. The Metronomes released two singles, \\"Saturday Night\\"/\\"Sunday Morning\\" (1979), \\"A Circuit Like Me\\"/\\"Closed Circuit\\" (1980) and two albums, Multiple Choice (1981) and Regular Guys (1985) on the Cleopatra label. The band was never intended to be a live outfit and only ever came together in the studio. Around 2000 the members began work on a new project and after four years of sporadic effort released a new album, Today. This was followed by a re-release of the band's first two albums and an EP (comprising the band's two singles), as a single release, The Ballad of the Metronomes, in 2010. Concurrently Wednesday collaborated with T.E. Power (Nuv Bloc) on a project titled Thealonian Music, using the latest electronic instruments of the time. The concept being to generate music of a spontaneous nature, with the rhythmic foundation being provided by a programmable drum machine, sequence and synthesizer combination. Thealonian Music only produced one release, the 1982 tape, Project X Chromosome X. Throughout the early 1980s, he was a member of Modern Jazz, an improvisation group who performed to randomly generated techno beats. Modern Jazz featured a fluid line-up that included Lyn Gordon (synthesiser), Andrew Park (synthesiser) and Ted Thornbury (vocals). The band played 1980s techno music and issued one album, The Nude, on the Cleopatra label in 1986. In 1988 he and Lyn Gordon formed electronic / industrial band Crashland, composed of Lyn Gordon (vocal, guitar), Wednesday (sampler), Ray Moore (drums) and Phil Sutherland (bass). A year after their formation, Crashland signed a deal with Regular Records which resulted in the release of their first single, \\"Cherry Bomb\\"/\\"Elvis Working\\" in October 1989. Crashland's self-titled debut album comprised half original material and half covers, was released in April 1990, together with the band's second single, a demented electro remodelling of John Lee Hooker's \\"Boom Boom\\"/\\"On T.V.\\". Wednesday moved to Berlin in 1992, where he worked with Nina Hagen, being involved with pre-production and programming for her 1995 album, FreuD euch (\\"Bee Happy\\"). In 1997, Wednesday became a touring member of German band Einstürzende Neubauten. He completed several world tours with them and is present on their live albums, such as 09-15-2000, Brussels and numerous recordings from the Perpetuum Mobile tour (2004). Eventually departing in 2013. In 1999 he returned to Melbourne and formed The Tingler, with Crashland vocalist Lyn Gordon. The Tingler releasing a self-titled album in April 2000. The Tingler also featured on the bill during the Models 2000/2001 reunion shows. In 2013 he was to perform solo as The Ash Wednesday Effect, a spontaneously performed audio/visual experience, in which improvised soundscapes triggered entrancing visualisation, which were in turn projected onto Wednesday's physical form. The performances at Club Voltaire, North Melbourne were continuous three-hour pieces, throughout which audience members were free to come and go as they chose.

The liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped through a heat exchanger in the air-intake, simultaneously heating the liquid hydrogen and cooling the incoming air. This cooling of the incoming air is critical in achieving a reasonable efficiency. The hydrogen then continues through a second heat exchanger positioned after the combustion section, where the hot exhaust is used to further heat the hydrogen, turning it in a very high pressure gas. This gas is then passed through the tips of the fan providing driving power to the fan at subsonic speeds. After mixing with the air, the hydrogen is burned in the combustion chamber.

Chambers rose to fame during the Hollywood phase of popping, boogaloo and robot dancing, as well as the freestyle art of b-boying. Chambers, along with his Breakin' series co-star Adolfo \\"Shabba Doo\\" Quiñones and other dancers from the films, were prominently featured in the music videos for Lionel Richie's \\"All Night Long\\" (1983) and Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel for You\\" (1984). Early life and influences Born in Wilmington, California, Chambers is the youngest of four. He grew up in a small town, but a community with a diverse mix of ethnic groups and cultures. In 1978, while at junior high, Chambers would see a member of the Samoan American dance group Blue City Strutters perform. The group would heavily influence Chambers' style, performing King Tut and domino routines and bringing dance styles from San Jose and San Francisco to South Bay Los Angeles.Higa, B. & Wiggins, C. (1996) \\"Electric Kingdom\\" The history of popping and locking, from the people who made it happen. Rap Pages. Sep. 1996: 52-67. Print. Initially, he formulated his style of dance through his interest in fantasy and sci-fi television shows, including the work of Ray Harryhausen and other stop-motion experts. He credits his older brother with introducing him to the \\"moonwalk\\", a move he would later perfect and share with pop superstar Michael Jackson, as well as his signature style of animated popping. While still a teenager, Chambers' older brother would take him to the Redondo Beach, California pier where he would perform his moves for money, earning hundreds of dollars through his street performances. To solve the problem of anonymity, Chambers' sister gave him a jacket that read \\"Mike a.k.a. Boogaloo Shrimp\\", his street dancing name. Chambers' dancing would increasingly draw the attention of promoters, and particularly Adolfo \\"Shabba Doo\\" Quiñones, who was seeking to form a new dance troupe after the breakup of his previous group, The Lockers. Chambers would also meet other popping/dance legends during this time, including Bruno \\"Pop N Taco\\" Falcon and Timothy \\"Popin' Pete\\" Solomon. Falcon and Chambers would share ideas and styles, building upon their own individual foundations. Both would later be featured in videos and movies, including the Breakin' series. Career Chambers' early stints in professional dancing were through television commercials, followed by an appearance in the music video for Lionel Richie's \\"All Night Long\\". He made further appearances in the videos for Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel For You\\", Richard Marx' \\"Children of the Night\\", Stacey Q's \\"Give You All My Love\\" and Paula Abdul's \\"Opposites Attract\\", where he played the character MC Skat Kat and was assistant choreographer. In 1985, he co-starred in \\"Stop the Madness\\", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration, featuring several famous musicians, actors and athletes. He also appeared in such films as Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991)—as a dancing robot—Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult (1994) and Dudley Do-Right (1999). He also appeared as Urkel-Bot in two episodes of the television show Family Matters: \\"Robo-Nerd\\" and \\"Robo-Nerd II\\". Chambers was the announcer on the children' show Fun House from 1990 to 1991. In contrast to his style of dancing, he would dance while \\"rapping\\" the opening spiel at the start of the show. He also appeared in Sugar Ray's 1997 video for the song \\"Fly\\" and break danced in the video. Later career Chambers enjoys teaching and has been invited as a speaker several times to USC's Thorton Music School. He has also spoken at Santa Monica college, the University of Redlands and gave a surprise visit to Spelman University in Georgia. As of 2014, Chambers was in talks to do a second sequel to the Breakin’ franchise. As of 2020, Chambers has been working with independent Chill-Hop artist E-Styles and is set to release a website, as well as music and YouTube pages, featuring vintage and original footage from his career. In popular culture Boogaloo Shrimp Chambers is referenced in the 1999 single \\"Summer Girls\\", by the pop group LFO.

Cambridge University Press, > 2004 (excerpt) Historical ethnic parties The oldest prototypes of ethnic parties are the Jewish parties of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires, e.g. Bund, Folkspartei, World Agudath Israel, and the Swedish party in Finland, Svenska Folkpartiet (SFP), all of them founded in the end of the 19th century or in the first decade of the 20th.  Ethnic parties and political ideologies  Ethnic parties may take different ideological positions. For instance, the parties competing for Jewish votes in interwar Poland and Lithuania had a range of different political views. There were Zionist parties (themselves divided into Revisionist, General, Religious or Labour parties), there was Agudat Israel (an Orthodox religious party), the Bund (Marxist) and the Folkspartei (liberal). In some political systems, party politics are mostly based on ethnicity, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its federal regions, in Israel, in Suriname, in Sabah, in Sarawak or in Guyana. In Fiji, 46 seats out of 71 are elected from ethnically-closed Communal constituencies, as there was in the pre-Israel Palestine Jewish Assembly, the Asefat ha-Nivharim with separate 'curiae' for Ashkenaz, Sepharad and Oriental, and Yemeni Jews. As a consequence, it would be somewhat irrelevant to classify some parties in these systems as 'ideological' (social-democrat, liberal, christian democratic etc.) and some others as 'purely autonomist', 'purely ethnic' or 'purely minority' parties. The Swedish People's Party of Finland (SFP) is a full-fledged member of the Liberal International, as well as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, representing the Turkish minority in Bulgaria, the South Tyrol People's Party (SVP, grouping German- and Ladin-speaking inhabitants of Italy's South Tyrol province) is a member of the Christian Democratic European People's Party, whereas the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), an Irish Catholic party in Northern Ireland is a member of the Socialist International, etc. In interwar Poland, Jewish, German and Ukrainian parties never attracted all Polish Jews, Germans and Ukrainians of whom some were members of 'national' ideological Polish parties, mostly the Socialist and Communist parties, who were considered more open-minded than the conservative or nationalist parties.  Ethnic parties and elections  Common lists or electoral agreements can be organized either between ethnic parties (Flemish parties 'Kartel's for municipal elections in Brussels or Union des Francophones in Flemish Brabant, the coalition for the 2001 parliamentary elections in Bulgaria between the - mostly Turkish - Movement for Rights and Freedoms and the Roma party Euroroma) or between two parties having common ideological options beyond ethnic differences, as the Bund and the 'Polish' socialist party PPS for the municipal elections in 1939. Some ethnic parties only take part in substatal electoral competition, thus making them somewhat invisible to outside observers: the South Schleswig Voter Federation in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the German parties in Denmark (Schleswig Party) and Poland (German Minority in Silesia), the Silesian Autonomy Movement in Poland, the Romani parties in Slovakia (Roma Civic Initiative). It can occur that a single 'supra-ideological' party achieves, with varying shades of success, the representation of a whole ethnic group, as for the Swedish People's Party in Finland, the South Schleswig Voter Federation for Danes and Frisians in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the Unity for Human Rights Party for Greeks in Albania, the Slovene Union for Slovenes in north-eastern Italy, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms for Turks in Bulgaria, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. In most cases, ethnic parties compete inside electoral systems where voters aren't compelled to vote according to ethnic affiliations and may vote too for 'non ethnic', 'transethnic' or 'supraethnic' ideological parties. In most Near Eastern Arab countries, the only such parties were the Communist parties, whose founding fathers and subsequent leaders came mostly from the Jewish, Armenian, Kurdish or Shi'ia minorities. The socialist movement in Thessaloniki (present Northern Greece) during the last decade of the Ottoman Empire was divided across ethnic lines between the Sephardi Jews (who formed the majority of the population), the Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs and the Greeks, but all groups united when it came to election time.  'Intraethnic parties', or political parties inside diasporic communities  There is also a specifically diasporic type of political parties that could be labelled as 'intraethnic parties', i.e. parties that compete only inside the diasporic political sphere. The Jewish and Armenian (Dashnak, Ramgavar, or Hentchak) parties belong to this category, as well as the international sections of national parties, such as the (U.S.) Republicans Abroad and Democrats Abroad, the (French) Parti socialiste's Fédération des Français de l'étranger or the American and European branches of the Israeli Likud and of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China). There can also be specific political groupings representing members of a national community living abroad, such as the Association démocratique des Français de l'étranger - Français du Monde (left-wing) and the Union des Français de l'Etranger (right-wing), both competing for seats in the Assemblée des Français de l'étranger (fr), or the various political lists competing for the Comitati degli italiani all'estero (COMITES).

It is directed by Phil Roman and written by Garfield creator Jim Davis, and features the voices of Lorenzo Music, Thom Huge, Gregg Berger and C. Lindsay Workman. It originally aired on CBS on October 30, 1985. The special, a ghost story with a pirate theme, originally aired near Halloween and afterwards often played around the time of the holiday. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and was also the subject of an illustrated children's book adaptation. This was the fourth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.  Plot  Garfield is awakened early in the morning by the obnoxious Binky the Clown Show and learns that it is Halloween, becoming excited about trick-or-treating. He tricks Odie into thinking dogs are required to trick-or-treat with cats and give almost all of their candy to them, save one piece of candy for the dog. Odie is tempted by the minimal reward, and the two head for the attic to find costumes in an old trunk. After considering a number of options, Garfield decides he and Odie will be pirates. Jon Arbuckle gives them sacks and tells them to have a good time and not be out too late. They head out trick-or-treating amongst children in the neighborhood. When Odie expresses fear, Garfield assures him the scary characters they see are only children in costumes, only to lift some of the costumes and discover the characters are actually supernatural. At the end of the evening, they arrive on a dock and Garfield decides to cross the river on a row boat to visit more houses. When Garfield tells Odie to put out the oars, Odie misinterprets the command and throws the oars overboard, leaving the boat adrift as the current takes it down the river. Soon the boat arrives at an abandoned dock near a run-down mansion. They venture inside the home, thinking it is deserted, but are startled to find an old man sitting in an armchair. The man relates a story that exactly 100 years ago, pirates, pursued by government troops, buried their treasure in the floor of the mansion and signed a blood oath to return for the treasure at midnight 100 years later, even if it meant rising from the grave. The old man says he was the ten-year- old cabin boy whom the pirates had long ago. Garfield and Odie start to leave and Garfield asks the man if he wants to come too, but the old man has disappeared. The man steals their boat and leaves the two pets behind. The longcase clock chimes midnight and Garfield and Odie watch as a ghostly ship materializes on the river and pirate ghosts emerge from the water. Garfield and Odie hide in an empty cupboard as the ghosts reclaim their buried treasure from the floorboards of the house. As the cat and dog stay where they are, Odie sneezes and alerts the ghosts to their whereabouts. Making a run for it, Garfield and Odie jump into the river to escape, where Odie has to rescue Garfield as he cannot swim. Garfield and Odie wash ashore and find their boat with the candy still inside and untouched. They go home happy and Garfield repays Odie's rescue by reluctantly giving him his rightful share of the candy. Afterwards, Garfield turns on the TV and sees the old man wearing his pirate hat and hosting an all-night pirate movie festival. Rather than watch, Garfield turns off the TV and goes to bed.  Voice cast   Songs   Production  Phil Roman, who previously directed Garfield specials Here Comes Garfield and Garfield on the Town, founded his own company called Film Roman to continue producing the specials. Garfield in Disguise was one of the first specials he made under his own company, after Garfield in the Rough. Writer Jim Davis stated he intended the special to begin on a familiar tone, then \\"go somewhere that would at least scare 4-year-olds\\". For the part of the old man, C. Lindsay Workman was cast as the voice, having previously voiced Garfield's grandfather in Garfield on the Town. Producer Lee Mendelson chose Workman, searching for a deep voice. The animation was carried out in Indiana, with Davis saying animators sought to achieve a \\"swirly, cross-dissolve\\" effect to portray the ghosts. The animators also sought to give the ghosts a glowing affect. Workman's character was designed to emphasize his advanced age, with one staff artist urging the addition of warts and different-looking eyes. For the musical score, Ed Bogas and Desirée Goyette were employed, having previously worked on Garfield television specials.  Broadcast and release  Announced as Garfield's Halloween Adventure, Garfield in Disguise was originally aired on October 30, 1985, along with the 1966 Peanuts special It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, on CBS. In later years, it was often aired in the Halloween season along with It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. By 2015, Garfield's Halloween Adventure was not regularly broadcast. A 64-page illustrated book adaptation was published in 1985 by Random House Publishing Group, originally under the title Garfield in Disguise and later retitled Garfield's Halloween Adventure. It includes an alternate ending in which Garfield steals a ring from the pirates' treasure, resulting in the ghosts pursuing the protagonists back to the Arbuckle house, where Garfield surrenders the ring. The special was included on the DVD The Garfield Holiday Collection on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.  Reception  In 1985, Rick Sherwood of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the special \\"a charming story\\" and Garfield \\"the classic kitty\\". The Bryan Times in Ohio praised the special as \\"hilarious\\". In 1986, Garfield's Halloween Adventure won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. It was the third Garfield special to win the Emmy, with the only other nominee being another Garfield special, Garfield in Paradise. In 1988, Jon Burlingame of Hendersonville's The Times-News panned Garfield’s Halloween Adventure as \\"more up-to-date but charmless\\" in comparison to It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, and objected that the Peanuts special was aired less in favour of the Garfield cartoon. In a 2013 roundtable, The A.V. Club writers analyzed Garfield’s Halloween Adventure, with Erik Adams judging the special to be distinguished in Garfield TV canon by \\"Its abrupt left turn into abject terror,\\" and concluded it was nearly as good as It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. Molly Eichel agreed \\"the special takes a left turn into something more sinister\\". In 2015, Johnny Brayson of Bustle wrote \\"I may be in the minority, but I consider Garfield's Halloween Adventure to be on equal footing with Charlie Brown,\\" citing its humor and horror.

He is best known for his poems, some of them sonnets, written in the dialect of Rome. Biography Trilussa monument in Trastevere Trilussa grew up very poor, as his father died when he was only three years old. He was a pupil of the Collegio San Giuseppe - Istituto De Merode from 1880 to 1886, first in the original location of Palazzo Poli at fontana di Trevi and then at the current location of piazza di Spagna where the school was relocated in 1885. Trilussa made a very early poetic debut in 1887 in the Rugantino magazine edited by Alfredo Zanazzo. Later he also wrote for Don Chisciotte, Capitan Fracassa, Il Messaggero and Il Travaso delle idee. His first collection, Le stelle de Roma (\\"Rome's Stars\\"), was written in 1889. Trilussa's fame grew in the 1920s and 1930s though he was not a part of any literary circle, preferring instead to hang out in the streets and taverns which were the sources of his inspiration. His poetry features the petit bourgeoisie of Rome: the housewife, the store clerk and the servant but also contain strong satirical denunciations against governments and the vices of rich people. Some of the sonnets are Aesop-like moralistic fables. Trilussa's own sketches and drawings were featured alongside his poetry. A very popular person in his city and Italy, Trilussa was named Life Senator on December 1, 1950, by the Italian President Luigi Einaudi. He died twenty days later. In the work known as Illustrissimi, a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Trilussa is one of the recipients of the letters. Salustri was initiated to the Italian Scottish Rite Freemasonry, influencing the sonnets \\"Li framassoni de jeri\\" and \\"Li frammassoni de oggi\\".

It was first climbed in 1952 by French alpinists Lionel Terray and Guido Magnone. European Discovery The first Europeans recorded as seeing Mount Fitz Roy were the Spanish explorer Antonio de Viedma and his companions, who in 1783 reached the shores of Viedma lake. Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno saw the mountain on 2 March 1877. He named it Fitz Roy in honour of Robert FitzRoy who, as captain of , had travelled up the Santa Cruz River in 1834 and charted large parts of the Patagonian coast. Cerro is a Spanish word meaning hill, while Chaltén comes from a Tehuelche (Aonikenk) word meaning \\"smoking mountain\\", due to a cloud that usually forms around the mountain's peak. Fitz Roy, however, was only one of a number of peaks the Tehuelche called Chaltén. Setting Argentina and Chile have agreed that their international border detours eastwards to pass over the main summit, but a large part of the border to the south of the summit, as far as Cerro Murallón, remains undefined.

King Features Syndicate launched the strip on January 10, 1927, not long after it was apparent that the Chicago Tribune Syndicate had scored a huge hit with Little Orphan Annie. The name comes from the 1889 popular song of the same name, still familiar to many at the time. Although the King Features strip was an obvious knock-off with several similar parallels, the approach was quite different, and Little Annie Rooney had a successful run from January 10, 1927, to April 16, 1966.  Publication history  The strip's creators over the years included Ed Verdier (1927–29), Ben Batsford (1929-30), Sunday strips by Nicholas Afonsky (1934–43), writer Brandon Walsh (1930–54) and Darrell McClure (1930–66). McClure's assistants were Bob Dunn and Fran Matera.

The first one, Fablettes, began in the early 1930s and ended on March 10, 1935. This was replaced by Ming Foo, which ran from March 17, 1935 to March 28, 1943. Origins The name was popularized in a 19th-century song by Michael Nolan. After Nolan sang \\"Little Annie Rooney\\" in English music halls in 1890, Annie Hart (aka \\"The Bowery Girl\\") brought it to the United States. When she performed at New York's London Theatre, the song became a hit, but the absence of any international copyright laws kept Nolan from collecting royalties. A bitter Nolan retired from composing, and his song later became a favorite piano roll and calliope tune, heard at circuses and carousels. The lyrics make it clear that the Annie of the song and the Annie of the strip are two different characters: :A winning way, a pleasant smile, :Dress'd so neat but quite in style, :Merry chaff your time to wile, :Has little Annie Rooney. :Ev'ry evening, rain or shine, :I make a call twixt eight and nine, :On her who shortly will be mine, :Little Annie Rooney. :She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau; :She's my Annie, I'm her Joe, :Soon we'll marry, never to part, :Little Annie Rooney is my sweetheart! :The parlor's small, but neat and clean, :And set with taste so seldom seen, :And you can bet, the household queen, :Is little Annie Rooney. :The fire burns cheerfully and bright, :As a family circle round each night, :We form, and ev'ry one's delight :Is little Annie Rooney. :We've been engaged close on a year, :The happy time is drawing near, :I'll wed the one I love so dear, :Little Annie Rooney. :My friends declare I'm in a jest, :Until the time comes will not rest, :But one who knows its value best, :Is little Annie Rooney. There is also a Scottish saying: \\"She is having an Annie Rooney,\\" which means that someone is displaying rage and anger. Annie Rooney's pet expression was \\"Gloriosky!\\" That unique G-rated expletive and Little Orphan Annie's \\"Leapin' lizards!\\" both found their way into the Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim song, \\"Gee, Officer Krupke!\\", from West Side Story. Harvey Kurtzman had both Annies in mind when he created his satirical Little Annie Fanny for Playboy, though the ribald parody owed far more to the original Harold Gray strip. James Joyce referred to Little Annie Rooney early in the first chapter of Finnegans Wake: \\"Arrah, sure, we all love little Anny Ruiny, or, we mean to say, lovelittle Anna Rayiny, when unda her brella, mid piddle med puddle, she ninnygoes nannygoes nancing by.\\" Films Little Annie Rooney Prior to the creation of the identically titled comic strip, Mary Pickford starred as a girl of the slums in William Beaudine's 1925 silent comedy-drama Little Annie Rooney (United Artists), set in New York's Lower East Side. Audiences found nothing unusual about 32-year-old Mary Pickford portraying a 12-year-old, and this became one of her most successful films. Turner Classic Movies has aired a restored version, produced by the Mary Pickford Foundation. The Fleischer Studios did a Little Annie Rooney animated Screen Song in 1931. Fox Film Corporation purchased the rights to the comic strip and planned to turn it into a film starring child actress Jane Withers. This project became the 1935 film Ginger, Withers' first starring role. Shirley Temple did her first teenage role (receiving her second screen kiss) in Miss Annie Rooney (1942); the George Bruce screenplay is not an adaptation of the comic strip but instead dramatizes the situation of a poor girl with a wealthy boyfriend. In Gavin Lambert's 1963 novel \\"Inside Daisy Clover,\\" which is set in the 1950s, Daisy becomes a star after appearing in her first movie, a musical remake of Mary Pickford's \\"Little Annie Rooney.\\" Reprints Little Annie Rooney on the Highway to Adventure was one of several Big Little Books. After a 1935 book of reprints, Little Annie Rooney was seen in comic book reprints — David McKay Publications's Feature Book #11 (1938), King Comics, a 1948 three-issue series published by St. John Publications and the Treasury of Comics annuals (1948–1950), also from St. John.

In 2016, it had a population of 496. Like many of the older villages in the region, it was built on a hilltop for defensive purposes and to provide more farmland on the plains below. It is a small town, with only one paved road running through the middle. It contains little more than a café, a bakery, a hotel, a restaurant, a church, as well as a school. Geography Crillon-le-Brave is situated from Carpentras, from Avignon and about from Bédoin. It lies close to the Mont Ventoux, at the south foot. History Crillon-le-Brave = Prehistory and antiquity = Excavations have shown that the village was occupied since the Neolithic period. Researchers collected scrapers and piercers in the Espelettes district, and lithic tools at the Camas and Sous-les-Roques sites. Vestiges also attest that the place was inhabited in Roman times. Amphoras, potteries and dolia were exhumed from quarries as well as an altar to Jupiter and a Cippus. On the site of Auberte, potter's oven were discovered dated to the third century. In Roman times, the town went by the name Crillonium, and later Crillon, but one could say that its modern history begins in the 14th century when a leading Avignon family acquired the feudal rights to the village. A long line of dukes ruled Crillon throughout the period leading up to the French Revolution. The village takes its full name of Crillon-le-Brave from the most legendary of its dukes: Louis des Balbes de Berton de Crillon or \\"Le Brave Crillon\\" (1541–1615) was one of Henri IV's fiercest and most valiant generals during the French Wars of Religion in the late 16th century. The same Crillon family also gave its name to the famous Hôtel de Crillon in Paris. Like most of the buildings surrounding the church at the top of the village, the houses that form the core of the Hostellerie have their origins in the 16th and 17th centuries and played an important part in village life. The Maison Roche was originally the presbytère - the priest's home, and at the same time the village school. At the end of the 19th century Crillon-le-Brave was a prosperous village of 800 inhabitants served by several cafés, bars and stores. There was even a local philharmonic society. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, the village began a long slow decline. Two wars and a failing water supply left the village almost abandoned and many of its houses fell into ruins. But since the early 1970s new inhabitants have brought new life to the old stones, so that today Crillon-le-Brave has once again become a lively village.

Early life Mia Martini (left) with sister Loredana Bertè She was born Domenica Bertè in 1947 in Bagnara Calabra (Reggio Calabria), southern Italy, the second among four daughters. The youngest of them, Loredana Bertè, was born exactly three years after Martini, and also became famous as a singer.Evan C. Gutierrez. Loredana Bertè. allmusic.com Her father, Giuseppe Radames Bertè (died 2017), was a teacher of Latin and Greek, while her mother, Maria Salvina Dato (died 2003), was an elementary school teacher. \\"Mimì\\", as Domenica was known, spent her childhood in Porto Recanati (Macerata). In 1962, she convinced her mother to take her to Milan for an audition. Career Mia Martini in 1973 Mia Martini in 1973 Mia Martini in 1975 She recorded her first records as Mimì Bertè, but soon decided to change her name to Mia Martini. She represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest twice: in 1977 with \\"Libera\\" (13th out of 18), and in 1992 with \\"Rapsodia\\" (4th out of 23). That same year she recorded \\"Per amarti\\", written by Bruno Lauzi and Maurizio Fabrizio. She won the World Popular Song Festival Yamaha in Tokyo with \\"Ritratto di donna\\" who comes to the first positions in the Japanese charts. In 1982 she participated at the Sanremo Festival. In late 1983, she decided to retire. In 1989 she returned to the Sanremo Festival with \\"Almeno tu nell'universo\\", which won her the Critics Award and new success. The song remains an Italian classic (with many cover versions). In 1992, she was back in the race at the Sanremo Festival with \\"Gli uomini non cambiano\\", by Giancarlo Bigazzi and Beppe Dati. She won second place, allowing her to represent Italy at Eurovision again, which that year was held in Sweden, where she closed with in fourth place with \\"Rapsodia\\". Death She suffered from painful fibroids, for which she took prescription medication. On 14 May 1995, her body was found in the apartment in Via Liguria 38 in Cardano al Campo. According to the coroner's report, her death was by cardiac arrest (in her body traces of cocaine were found). Her body was cremated.Zero: Mia Martini non si è suicidata.

These modes save significantly on electrical consumption compared to leaving a device fully on and, upon resume, allow the user to avoid having to reissue instructions or to wait for a machine to reboot. Many devices signify this power mode with a pulsed or red colored LED power light. Computers In computers, entering a sleep state is roughly equivalent to \\"pausing\\" the state of the machine. When restored, the operation continues from the same point, having the same applications and files open. =Sleep= Sleep mode has gone by various names, including Stand By, Suspend and Suspend to RAM. Machine state is held in RAM and, when placed in sleep mode, the computer cuts power to unneeded subsystems and places the RAM into a minimum power state, just sufficient to retain its data. Because of the large power saving, most laptops automatically enter this mode when the computer is running on batteries and the lid is closed. If undesired, the behavior can be altered in the operating system settings. A computer must consume some energy while sleeping in order to power the RAM and to be able to respond to a wake- up event. A sleeping PC is a case of a machine on standby power, and this is covered by regulations in many countries, for example in the United States limiting such power under the One Watt Initiative, from 2010. In addition to a wake-up press of the power button, PCs can also respond to other wake cues, such as from keyboard, mouse, incoming telephone call on a modem, or local area network signal. =Hibernation= Hibernation, also called Suspend to Disk on Linux, saves all computer operational data on the fixed disk before turning the computer off completely. On switching the computer back on, the computer is restored to its state prior to hibernation, with all programs and files open, and unsaved data intact. In contrast with standby mode, hibernation mode saves the computer's state on the hard disk, which requires no power to maintain, whereas standby mode saves the computer's state in RAM, which requires a small amount of power to maintain. =Hybrid sleep= Sleep mode and hibernation can be combined: the contents of RAM are first copied to non-volatile storage like for regular hibernation, but then, instead of powering down, the computer enters sleep mode. This approach combines the benefits of sleep mode and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, but it can also be powered down completely (e.g. due to loss of power) without loss of data, because it is already effectively in a state of hibernation. This mode is called \\"hybrid sleep\\" in Microsoft Windows other than Windows XP. A hybrid mode is supported by some portable Apple Macintosh computers, compatible hardware running Windows Vista or newer, as well as Linux distributions running kernel 3.6 or newer. =ACPI= ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is the current standard for power management, superseding APM (Advanced Power Management) and providing the backbone for sleep and hibernation on modern computers. Sleep mode corresponds to ACPI mode S3. When a non-ACPI device is plugged in, Windows will sometimes disable stand-by functionality for the whole operating system. Without ACPI functionality, as seen on older hardware, sleep mode is usually restricted to turning off the monitor and spinning down the hard drive. Reliability When sleep mode was first introduced, not all PC hardware supported it correctly, which could cause problems with peripherals that did not detect the transition. This is rarely a problem with newer hardware and operating systems. Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows 2000 and later support sleep at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. Windows Vista's Fast Sleep and Resume feature saves the contents of volatile memory to hard disk before entering sleep mode (aka Hybrid sleep). If power to memory is lost, it will use the hard disk to wake up. The user has the option of hibernating directly if they wish. In older versions prior to Windows Vista, sleep mode was under- used in business environments as it was difficult to enable organization-wide without resorting to third-party PC power management software.Enable hibernate using group policy As a result, these earlier versions of Windows were criticized for wasting energy.EcoGeek - How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy There remains a market in third-party PC power management software for newer versions of Windows, offering features beyond those built into the operating system. Most products offer Active Directory integration and per- user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting. Vendors include 1E NightWatchman, Data Synergy PowerMAN (Software) and Verdiem SURVEYOR. macOS Sleep on Macs running macOS consist of the traditional sleep, Safe Sleep, and Power Nap. In System Preferences, Safe SleepOS X Lion: What is safe sleep? is referred to as sleep. Since Safe Sleep also allowed state to be restored in an event of a power outage, unlike other operating systems, hibernate was never offered as an option. In 2005, some Macs running Mac OS X v10.4 began to support Safe Sleep. The feature saves the contents of volatile memory to the system hard disk each time the Mac enters Sleep mode. The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost. However, if the power supply was interrupted, such as when removing batteries without an AC power connection, the Mac would wake from Safe Sleep instead, restoring memory contents from the hard drive.Apple Portables: Progress bar appears after waking from sleep Safe Sleep capability is found in Mac models starting with the October 2005 revision of the PowerBook G4 (Double-Layer SD). Mac OS X v10.4 or higher is also required. A hack enabled the feature as well on older Macs running Mac OS X v10.4.https://web.archive.org/web/20080105000720/http://andrewescobar.com/archive/2005/11/11/how- to-safe-sleep-your-mac/ In 2012, Apple introduced Power Nap with OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and select Mac models. Power Nap allows the Mac to perform tasks silently, such as iCloud syncing and Spotlight indexing. Only low energy tasks are performed when on battery power, while higher energy tasks are performed with AC power. Unicode Because of widespread use of this symbol, a campaign was launched to add a set of power characters to Unicode. In February 2015, the proposal was accepted by Unicode and the characters were included in Unicode 9.0. The characters are in the \\"Miscellaneous Technical\\" block, with code points 23FB-FE. The symbol is ⏾ (&#x23FE;)—defined as \\"Power Sleep Symbol\\".

Both participated in the Battle of Badr, and although Umayr escaped, his son was taken prisoner by the Muslims. He was also the paternal first cousin of Safwan ibn Umayya. Military campaigns during Muhammad's era Since he had persecuted Muslims earlier, he feared the well- being of his son, especially since he remembered the many Meccans killed in Badr. He then conspired with Safwan ibn Umayyah to kill Muhammad. Safwan agreed to take all of Umayr's debts in order for Umayr to go to the Muslims and kill Muhammad. When he got there, he was recognized by Umar ibn al- Khattab, who said: > This is the dog, the enemy of God, Umayr ibn Wahb. By God, he has only come > to do evil. He led the Polytheists (Arabic: Mushrikeen) against us in Mecca > and he was a spy for them against us shortly before [the Battle of] Badr. Go > to the Messenger of God, stand around him and warn him that this dirty > traitor is after him. Umayr was arrested and brought to Muhammad, who gave him a warm welcome and asked for his motives. He replied that he wanted the Badr captives to be released. Muhammad inquired about the sword that Umayr brought with him, and then retold for Umayr the exact events that led him there, including his secret conversation with Safwan ibn Umayyah. Umayr was so awe-struck that he immediately said his shahada, hence becoming a Muslim. Muhammad then said to his companions, \\"Instruct your brother in his religion. Teach him the Qur'an and set free his prisoner [Wahb ibn Umayr].\\" Later, at the Conquest of Mecca, he helped Safwan ibn Umayyah obtain amnesty, resulting in his also becoming a Muslim.

It was published to document the veracity of the depiction of slavery in Stowe's anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). First published in 1853 by Jewett, Proctor & Worthington, the book also provides insights into Stowe's own views on slavery. Origins After the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin, Southerners accused Stowe of misrepresenting slavery. In order to show that she had neither lied about slavery nor exaggerated the plight of enslaved people, she compiled A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin. The book was subtitled \\"Presenting the Original Facts and Documents upon Which the Story Is Founded, Together with Corroborative Statements Verifying the Truth of the Work\\".McFarland, Philip. Loves of Harriet Beecher Stowe. New York: Grove Press, 2007: 105. Reception The reaction of Stowe's contemporaries to A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin was very similar to the reaction to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, with both very positive and very negative reviews. The responses of abolitionists and Northerners in general were among the positive, lauding the documentation of the evils of slavery and the confirmation of the truth of Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The great interest in Uncle Tom’s Cabin in England also transferred to the Key. One English review of the 1853 publication called it a \\"marvelous book, more so if possible than Uncle Tom’s Cabin itself\\".\\"A review of Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". The Eclectic Review 4 (May 1853): 600–617. Rpt. in Nineteenth-Century Literature Criticism. Ed. Laurie Lanzen Harris. Vol. 3. This same review also commends Stowe's self-control and character. This impression of Stowe and the reception of the book is much different than the reaction to the Key in the South. The pro-slavery response to the Key paralleled the response to Uncle Tom's Cabin. Despite Stowe's use of documented examples, most Southern reviews still claimed that Stowe was misrepresenting slavery and exaggerating the cruelty of the institution. A review in the Southern Literary Messenger called the Key a \\"distortion of the facts and mutilation of the records, for the sake of giving substance to the scandalous fancy, and reduplicating the falsehood of the representation\\".Simms, William Gilmore. \\"Stowe's Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\\". The Southern Quarterly Review 8.15 (July 1853): 214–254. Rpt. in Nineteenth- Century Literature Criticism. Ed. Laurie Lanzen Harris. Vol. 3. Although these reviews claimed that Stowe was misrepresenting slavery, they did not accuse Stowe of using false documentation. Rather they claimed that the examples that Stowe provided are the most extreme instances, which she gathered to give the worst possible impression of the institution of slavery, and of the South. One critic, William Simms, accused her of using faulty argumentation by gathering facts to prove her assumption, instead of forming assumptions based on facts. Another pro-slavery response to both Uncle Tom's Cabin and A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin was attacks on Stowe's character. Many reviews made insinuations about what sort of woman Stowe must be to write about such events as were found in the Key. A review by George Holmes questioned whether \\"scenes of license and impurity, and ideas of loathsome depravity and habitual prostitution [are] to be made the cherished topics of the female pen\\"; he appealed to women, especially Southern women, not to read Stowe's works.Holmes, George Frederick. \\"A review of A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin\\".

It differs from a regular tower in that its primary use is military and from a turret in that it is usually a freestanding structure. Its main purpose is to provide a high, safe place from which a sentinel or guard may observe the surrounding area. In some cases, non-military towers, such as religious towers, may also be used as watchtowers. History =Military watchtowers= Roman Watchtower in Germany The Romans built numerous towers as part of a system of communications,Sagona, Claudia (2015), 'Melita and Gaulos during the Punic Period, in \\"The Archeology of Malta\\", Cambridge University Press, , p. 239. one example being the towers along Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Romans built many lighthouses, such as the Tower of Hercules in northern Spain, which survives to this day as a working building, and the equally famous lighthouse at Dover Castle, which survives to about half its original height as a ruin. In medieval Europe, many castles and manor houses, or similar fortified buildings, were equipped with watchtowers.Timelines TV Interactive video timeline of British history with section on medieval manors. In some of the manor houses of western France, the watchtower equipped with arrow or gun loopholes was one of the principal means of defense. A feudal lord could keep watch over his domain from the top of his tower. In southern Saudi Arabia and Yemen, small stone and mud towers called \\"qasaba\\" were constructed as either watchtowers or keeps in the Asir mountains.The New Encyclopædia Britannica. 1998. \\"Asir.\\" 15th edition. Volume 1, \\"Micropedia\\". p. 635. Furthermore, in Najd, a watchtower, called \\"Margab\\", was used to watch for approaching enemies far in distance and shout calling warnings from atop.

Għallis Tower, one of the 13 de Redin towers in Malta Mediterranean countries, and Italy in particular, saw the construction of numerous coastal watchtowers since the early Middle Ages, connected to the menace of Saracen attacks from the various Muslim states existing at the time (such as the Balearic Islands, Ifriqiya or Sicily). Later (starting from the 16th century) many were restored or built against the Barbary pirates.* Salvatore Mazzarella, Renato Zanca, Il libro delle Torri, le torri costiere di Sicilia nei secoli XVI-XX , Palermo: Sellerio, 1985. Han dynasty watchtower near Dunhuang, Gansu, China Some notable examples of military Mediterranean watchtowers include the towers that the Knights of Malta had constructed on the coasts of Malta. These towers ranged in size from small watchtowers to large structures armed with numerous cannons.

Accessed 27 March 2013 The most recent descendants of the Martello Towers are the flak towers that the various combatants erected in World War II as mounts for anti-aircraft artillery. =Modern warfare= In modern warfare the relevance of watchtowers has decreased due to the availability of alternative forms of military intelligence, such as reconnaissance by spy satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. However watch towers have been used in counter-insurgency wars to maintain a military presence in conflict areas in case such as by the French Army in French Indochina, by the British Army and the RUC in Northern Ireland and the IDF in Gaza and West Bank. =Non-military watchtowers= Non-military watchtower, used as a lamp post to illuminate during the night, at Banashankari temple, Karnataka, India An example of the nonmilitary watchtower in history is one of Jerusalem. Though the Hebrews used it to keep a watch for approaching armies, the religious authorities forbade the taking of weapons up into the tower as this would require bringing weapons through the temple. Rebuilt by King Herod, that Watchtower was renamed after Mark Antony, his friend who battled against Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus (later Augustus) and lost.

He was born in Córdoba when the area was under the control of the Moors (the Umayyad Caliphate). Perfecto was a monk and ordained priest. He served at the basilica of St. Acisclus in Córdoba. Christians were tolerated in the area, but not uniformly. According to his legend, in 850, Perfecto was challenged by two Muslim men to say who was the greater prophet: Jesus or Mohammed. At first he refrained from responding, so as not to provoke them; but they insisted that he give them an answer, promising to protect him from reprisals. He then told them in Arabic that Muhammed was a false prophet and that he was an immoral man for supposedly seducing his adopted son's wife. The Muslims kept their promise and let him go, but several days later some of them changed their mind and had him arrested. They had friends seize Perfecto (so as to not be forsworn) and tried. Perfecto was found guilty of blasphemy by the Islamic court and was executed. The legend says that Perfecto's final words were to bless Christ and condemn Muhammad and his Qur'an. He was beheaded on April 18, 850. His martyrdom was one of the first in a period of Muslim persecution of the Christians in Al-Andalus, which began in 850 under Abd ar-Rahman II, continued under his successor Muhammad I, and went on intermittently until 960 . His Catholic feast day is April 18.

Though the son of a nobleman, as a young man he withdrew to a rock cave in order to meditate. After the death of his parents, he gave away all of his possessions and established himself in the Val di Non () in Trentino. Romedius is often depicted alongside or astride a bear. According to his hagiography he wanted to visit the friend of his youth, St. Vigilius, Bishop of Trento (who died in 405), but his horse was torn to pieces by a wild bear. Romedius, however, had the bear bridled by his disciple David (Davide). The bear became docile and carried Romedius on its back to Trento.A similar tale is told of Saint Psalmodius. The tamed bear is a motif also of Saint Corbinian, bishop of Freising. Veneration Sanctuary of San Romedio, Sanzeno, Italy Upon Romedius' death, his body was laid to rest in a small tomb above his cave in the mountains, a site that was soon visited by pilgrims. The Sanctuary of San Romedio grew from the little church that was built to venerate him to the popular pilgrimage shrine, the Santuario di San Romedio is across the lake from Cles at the head of the Val di Non, above the village of Sanzeno. The sanctuary where Romedio lived with his bear companion is a complex of several churches, from the Romanesque period to the 20th century beyond a gateway in the forested slopes. Votive offerings of crutches line the walls of the narrow stone stairwell up to the highest chapel, said to mark the site of the saint's retreat. His local cult, which consolidated itself in the course of the 11th century, was officially recognized in the twelfth by the Bishop of Trento. In 1795, permission was given to read masses in his name in the diocese of Brixen, which at that time included the Northern Tyrol. His cult remains popular in Trentino, Bavaria, and the Tyrol. Romedius' Bear In remembrance of this legend, in 1958 Italian Senator G. G. Gallarati Scotti, honorary member of the committee for the foundation of the World Wildlife Fund in Italy, purchased Charlie, a bear intended to be killed, and donated it to the Sanctuary of San Romedio, in the Valle di Non. Today, the Province of Trentino protects the last brown bears of the Alps in the Adamello-Brenta National Park, and, near the Sanctuary, takes care of young bears born in captivity in Trentino . In the work known as Illustrissimi, a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Romedius' bear is one of the \\"recipients\\" of the letters.

It was founded in 1914, and ceased to exist on 1 January 2002 as a result of municipal reorganization in Quebec. The town was located along the Rivière des Prairies. At the time of the merger with Montreal, its population was 6,000. Geography The area north of the train tracks was subject to many floods. =Roxboro Island= In 1974 the town of Roxboro decided to purchase the island (Lot 311) at the North end of 5th Avenue North and paid $46,130.36 to the former owner in a court expropriation decision .The North Shore News, Page 3 , August 22, 1974. \\"Roxboro buys island\\" estimated $55,000.00 cost\\"Roxboro wins island expropriation case\\" North Shore News.

Municipal reorganisation and disestablishment The city of Montreal had been trying for many years to merge Roxboro and other municipalities. On January 1, 2002, the formerly independent town was forcibly merged with Dollard-des-Ormeaux to become a borough in the new city of Montreal. A referendum was held on 20 June 2004 on demerging from Montreal. Residents of the former town voted to do so by 67%, with 1,497 Yes votes and 732 No votes from a total electorate of 4,487.http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/tables/result- referendum-2004.php However, because the province required 35% turnout for the result to be valid, the referendum did not carry and the town was merged. Residents of the former city of Pierrefonds, which adjoined the former town of Roxboro, voted to stay in the new city and joined with Roxboro to form the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro. The new borough was formally created on January 1, 2006. Roxboro's former borough partner, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, voted against the reorganization and de-merged at that time.

From 2003 until 2006, he played for English Premier League club Middlesbrough, winning the 2004 League Cup and finishing as runner-up in the 2005–06 UEFA Cup. He retired due to a misdiagnosed heart condition while playing for Brazilian club América-SP in 2007. Doriva played for the Brazil national football team between 1995 and 1998, making a brief substitute appearance in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in which Brazil finished as runners-up. Club career =Brazil= Doriva began his career at the youth of São Paulo, and after spending 1992 at Goiás teams Anapolina and Goiânia, was promoted to the main team under coach Telê Santana in 1993. That same year he won both the Libertadores da América and the Intercontinental Cup. In 1995, he was transferred to XV de Piracicaba after having his rights purchased by then- owner Rolim Amaro, founder of TAM Airlines. Doriva came to Atlético Mineiro in 1995, as the team had just gotten a sponsorship deal with TAM. There Doriva had what he considered crucial years in his formation as a player, leading to a $4 million sale to FC Porto. =Porto, Sampdoria and Celta Vigo= Doriva's career in Porto had three Primeira Liga titles before he opted to transfer to Italy's U.C. Sampdoria, in an $8 million four-year contract. In 2000, he went to Spain, playing for Celta Vigo. =Middlesbrough= Doriva was signed by Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren in January 2003, on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 5 April 2003 in a 3–0 home win over West Bromwich Albion. After five appearances for the club, Doriva was given a one- year contract with Middlesbrough on 21 July 2003. In his first full season at the club, Doriva was first choice in midfield alongside George Boateng. He found his chances limited after this, however, due to the emergence of Stewart Downing and the conversion of Boudewijn Zenden to central midfield. On 11 February 2004, in a 3–2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, Doriva was pushed by Paul Scholes, who in April was given a three-match ban for the incident. On 29 February he started as Middlesbrough won their first major trophy, the 2004 Football League Cup Final, with a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. His only goal for Middlesbrough came in a 2–1 victory at Notts County in the third round of the FA Cup on 8 January 2005. In 2005, he earned a one-year contract extension, which Middlesbrough allowed to expire in July 2006. =América-SP= Following his release from Middlesbrough, he then signed for América-SP in Brazil, where he had a heart problem detected. Doriva's father and grandfather both died from heart conditions, and therefore he decided to retire from playing. Subsequent tests showed that the diagnosis was inaccurate and he could have continued playing, although he remained retired. Managerial career After retiring in 2009, Doriva was hired by Ituano's president and former teammate Juninho Paulista; initially a manager of the youth categories, he subsequently became an assistant manager and, in 2014, was appointed as coach. He led Ituano to a Cinderella run in the Campeonato Paulista, winning the title on penalty kicks over Santos. Doriva was appointed Atlético Paranaense manager on 16 June 2014, but failed to impress, being sacked only two months later. On 14 December 2014, Doriva was appointed as manager of Vasco. The following 4 August, after another state league title, he was named at the helm of Ponte Preta; on 7 October, however, he rescinded with the latter and moved to São Paulo. He lasted only a month with the team from the state capital, winning two and losing two league games, and being eliminated 3–1 on aggregate from the Copa do Brasil by rivals Santos. Bahia signed Doriva for the year 2016. Despite a 69% winning rate with the Série B club, he was dismissed on 19 June after a first defeat of the season against Londrina. He then had two months in charge of Santa Cruz in the same season, resigning on 20 October as their relegation looked imminent. In 2017, Doriva had ten games in charge of Atlético Goianiense before losing his job on 21 July; he recorded only one win and two draws. He was then appointed as Novorizontino's manager for the 2018 Campeonato Paulista. His team reached the quarter-finals before an 8–0 aggregate loss to Palmeiras. In June 2018, Doriva was appointed coach of CRB. He left the club in September, to be replaced by Roberto Fernandes. Doriva was hired by Criciúma of the Campeonato Catarinense at the start of 2019, and was fired on 5 March when the team were in 6th place. Two weeks later, he was appointed at São Bento, who were preparing for a season in the national second division. He was dismissed on 29 August, having won 5 of 19 games in the first half of the campaign. International career Doriva's first cap for the Brazil national football team was in 1995. He was part of the Brazil squad which reached the final of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He wore the number 17 shirt and made one appearance, in the second match of the group. He came on against Morocco in Nantes as a 68th-minute substitute for César Sampaio. He played a total of 12 games for the Brazilian squad.

Most remarkable, perhaps, are the interviews he has filmed. Rees is one of the few people – perhaps the only one - who has met and interviewed at length not only hundreds of people who suffered from the barbarities of World War II right across the globe but also, crucially, many of the perpetrators.

Cover art by Bob Eggleton. This art does not depict the rukhs, but rather a related species. Saturn Rukh is a hard science fiction novel written by the United States physicist Robert L. Forward. It was first published in hardcover in March 1997 (and later in paperback in 1998) by Tor Books. Saturn Rukh is themed around human contact with alien organisms on the gaseous planet Saturn. Like many of Forward's books, the novel is a speculation of the nature of intelligent life in a non-Terran ecosystem, in this case the atmosphere of a gas giant planet. Plot summary In an unspecified time in the future, a multi-national consortium sends a team of six astronauts (each with the chance of earning a billion dollars if they complete their mission properly) to Saturn to establish a factory that mines helium for the production of precious \\"meta\\" (stabilized metastable helium), a powerful rocket fuel, in the planet's upper atmosphere. With only enough \\"meta\\" fuel to get them to Saturn, failure will cost them their lives. And all too soon the crew of astronauts crash- lands on a surface, which is actually the back of an enormous alien life-form they dub the Rukh, a 4-kilometer-long, bizarre sting-ray-shaped creature that \\"swims\\" through Saturn's gaseous upper atmosphere and has two brains, both male and female. When part of their apparatus is swallowed by one of these giant birdlike beings, the crew needs to find a way to communicate and to be able to cooperate with the Rukhs so that they may survive.

Punch, and David L. Pulver. The first edition GURPS Basic Set was published in 1986. Contents =First and second editions= GURPS stands for Generic Universal Role-Playing System – that is essentially a very flexible descendant of The Fantasy Trip. Basic combat is simple, but advance combat is very position-oriented, almost a complicated boardgame. The level of complexity used is completely up to the players. The character improvement system is skill-based. The many additional supplements to the Basic Set enable GURPS characters to move easily from one gaming genre to another. The Basic Set includes a \\"Characters\\" book (72 pages, covers character creation and development, skills, and basic equipment), \\"Adventuring\\" (80 pages, covers success rolls, combat, damage, running the game, game and campaign backgrounds, and animals), a 24-page book of charts and tables, and a 32-page book of two introductory scenarios, one a solo. The original GURPS Basic Set included the combat rules from the previously published Man to Man. Magic rules were omitted, but were released in GURPS Fantasy (1986). GURPS Characters cover =Third edition= The third edition GURPS Basic Set combines all the books from the previous sets into one volume. The third edition revised GURPS Basic Set replaced the adventure with an appendix covering new generic rules that should have been in the core book was printed in 1994. It was stated that \\"If you have an old Third Edition, and the new Compendium, you’ll have it all.\\"GURPS Third Edition Revised pg 232 Reviewers of the time called it \\"GURPS 3.5 edition\\" while Steve Jackson Game calls all their own non 4th edition GURPS material still in print \\"GURPS Classic\\". =Fourth edition= The GURPS Basic Set for the fourth edition of GURPS was published in 2004 by Steve Jackson Games and contains the core rules for the fourth edition of GURPS. The first volume, Characters (), addresses what players need to know to create a GURPS character and play the game. Eight sample characters are included. The second volume is titled Campaigns () and addresses the information a GM needs to build a world. All the basic information needed to run a GURPS campaign is here with genre or world- specific information in other books. The previous edition of the GURPS rules consisted of a Basic Set as the core rule book, with GURPS Compendium I and GURPS Compendium II released later to collate alternative and advanced rules in a logical place. Many source books published after the release of the compendiums required them for play. The fourth edition basic set shifts the majority of that material into the core rule books. In a move from previous editions, the books are hardbound and in color, a trend which has been followed in successive GURPS 4e books, with mixed reactions from players. To facilitate the transition from third edition to fourth, a free PDF update was released. It includes a quick but comprehensive guide to change characters or source book information to the new rules. Publication history The first edition GURPS Basic Set was written by Steve Jackson with Creede Lambard and Sharleen Lambard, with a cover by Denis Loubet, and was published by Steve Jackson Games in 1986 as a boxed set containing four books (80, 72, 32, and 24 pages), sample character record sheets, and cardstock miniatures. The boxed GURPS Basic Set appeared at Origins in 1986. Steve Jackson Games began regularly supporting the game with supplements following the publication of the first GURPS Basic Set. The second edition revised GURPS Basic Set was published in 1987. The third edition GURPS Basic Set featured a cover by Michael Presley, and was published in 1988 as a 256-page book with a 16-page adventure (Caravan from Ein Arris). In 1994 the Basic Set third edition Revised was printed with an appendix replacing the adventure with various new rules.GURPS Basic Set third edition Revised pg 232 Reception The first edition of the GURPS Basic Set was reviewed by Marcus L. Rowland in issue 83 of White Dwarf magazine (November 1986). Rowland comments: \\"While I can applaud the idea behind the system, I can't really recommend GURPS at its present stage of development. In the long run, GURPS and all its supplements may cover more ground than other systems, possibly at less expense, but in the short term there isn't enough support material to run a fully rounded game of any type, apart from gladitorial combat and medieval adventures.\\" Michael DeWolfe reviewed GURPS Basic Set in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 79. DeWolfe commented that \\"GURPS is a good roleplaying system. It combines old ideas with new and surpasses its contemporaries. Playability is paramount, though reality is sacrificed. Its ambitious goal of covering all game worlds looks to be accomblishable.\\" Different Worlds #47 Aventurer #6 Second edition Basic Set reviewed in White Wolf #13 Michael DeWolfe reviewed the third edition of the GURPS Basic Set in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer #85. DeWolfe comments in his summary: \\"This game has looked at its peers and built on all of them; avoiding their mistakes and following their successes. If you're looking for a good point generation system, get GURPS. If you're looking for a truly generic system, get GURPS. If you're looking for a painstakingly coherent system, get GURPS. If you want a fine RPG, get this game. It is worth it.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed the third edition of the GURPS Basic Set for Dragon magazine #149 (September 1989). Bambra comments: \\"Now in its third incarnation, the GURPS Basic Set is better than ever. [...] It's a game designed to be used with an unlimited variety of backgrounds and settings; to its credit, the GURPS game does so admirably.\\" Games Review #5 GURPS Basic Set, 3rd edition was awarded the Origins Award for \\"Best Roleplaying Rules of 1988\\". The third edition GURPS Basic Set was an ORIGINS and Gamers' Choice award-winner. =Awards and nominations= *In 2004 GURPS 4e Basic set won the \\"Pen & Paper Fan Award\\" as Best RPG and was an inductee in its RPG Hall of Fame. *It was a nominee at the 2005 Origins Award for Best Role-playing Game.

Their descendants, the Houma people or organization \\"The United Houma Nation\\", have been recognized by the state as a tribe since 1972 and not yet by the federal government. According to the tribe, they have about 17,000 enrolled tribal citizens residing within a six- parish area that encompasses 4,750 square miles. The six parishes are the following: St. Mary, Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemines, and St. Bernard parishes.https://unitedhoumanation.org/about/ The city of Houma (meaning \\"red\\"), and the Red River were both named after this people. Oklahoma shares a similar etymology, as the root humma means \\"red\\" in Choctaw and related Western Muskogean languages, including Houma. Language The Indigenous Houma language is thought to have fallen out of use by the late 19th century due to European-American encroachment. As a result of a language shift which began during the French colonial period and trading in Louisiana, a majority of Houma people today speak Louisiana French. American English is also widely spoken by the community. Additionally, in light of their distinct society and isolated geography, as many as 3,000 mostly elderly people living on Houma tribal lands in the Lafourche Basin are believed to be monolingual speakers of French.Brasseaux, Carl, ed. French, Cajun, Creole, Houma; A Primer on Francophone Louisiana. Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 2005. In 1907, Swanton interviewed an elderly Houma woman to collect vocabulary from her Houma language. More recently, efforts have been made to collect vocabulary and grammar from elders in order to revitalize the language. As Houma has been identified as being very similar to standard Choctaw, some linguists have concluded that the Houma spoke a Western Muskogean language (akin to Choctaw or Chickasaw). Other scholars have suggested that the data in Swanton's vocabulary is Mobilian Jargon. Some unidentified words may be from other languages spoken on the Mississippi. The Tunica referred to the Mobilian Jargon as húma ʼúlu (meaning \\"Houma's language\\"). Today, efforts continue to bring the Houma language back to its people through a group of dedicated Houma persons and linguists, the Houma Language Project.Houma Language Project https://www.houmalanguageproject.org Ethnobotany The Houma people take a decoction of dried Gamochaeta purpurea for colds and influenza.Speck, Frank G., 1941, \\"A List of Plant Curatives Obtained From the Houma Indians of Louisiana\\", Primitive Man 14:49-75, page 64 They make an infusion of the leaves and root of Cirsium horridulum in whiskey, and use it as an astringent, as well as drink it to clear phlegm from lungs and throat. They also eat the tender, white hearts of the plant raw. History =Origins= The Houma tribe, thought to be Muskogean-speaking like other Choctaw tribes, was recorded by the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in 1682 as living along the Red River on the east side of Mississippi River.Swanton, John R. Indians of the Southeastern United States (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1946) p. 139 Because their war emblem is the saktce-ho'ma, or Red Crawfish, the anthropologist John R. Swanton speculated that the Houma are an offshoot of the Yazoo River region's Chakchiuma tribe, whose name derives from saktce- ho'ma.Pritzker, Barry M. Native American: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture and Peoples, Vol. 2, p. 550 Individuals in the tribe maintained contact with other Choctaw communities after settling in present-day lower Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes.http://www.dickshovel.com/hou.html They used the waterways to harvest fish and crawfish, as well as to supply their water needs and for traveling. It is not certain how the Houma came to settle near the mouth of the Red River (formerly called the River of the Houma). By the time of French exploration, the Houma were settled at the site of present-day Angola, Louisiana. = French era = In 1682 the French explorer Brinson noted in his journal that he had passed near the village of the Oumas. This brief mention marks the entry of the Houma into written recorded history. Later explorers, such as Henri de Tonti and Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, give a fuller description of the early Houma. Iberville reported the Houma village to be some six to eight miles inland from the east bank of the Mississippi near the mouth of the Red River. When the Europeans arrived in greater number in the area, they struggled with the language differences among the Native Americans. They thought each Native American settlement represented a different tribe and made errors in their designations of the peoples as a result. The Bayogoula people were, like the Houma, related to and descendants of the Choctaw. In historic times, several bands of Choctaw migrated into the Louisiana area. Descendants today are known as the Jena, Clifton, and Lacombe bands while some, such as the Houma, Bayougoula, and Acolapissa people, were documented as separate tribes. By 1700, the Houma were in a border conflict with the Bayougoula over hunting grounds. Mediation by Iberville's brother, Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, settled the conflict in March of that year. The tribes placed a tall red pole marked by sacred animal carcasses and feathers in the ground on the bank of a bayou, at a place now known as Scott's Bluff, establishing a new border between their peoples. Called Istrouma or Iti Homma by the natives and Baton Rouge by the French, this marker was at a site some five miles above Bayou Manchac on the east bank of the Mississippi. The area developed as a trading post and the modern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1706, the Houma migrated south from the Red River region to other areas. One account said they wanted to move closer to their new French allies, concentrated in the New Orleans area, and away from the English-allied tribes to the north. From the 1730s to the French-Indian war (1754–1763) (also known as the Seven Years' War), European wars were played out in North America. Numerous Native American bands formed protective alliances with the Europeans to deal with the conflicts. As early as 1739, the French reported that the Houma, Bayougoula, and Acolapissa were merging into one tribe. Though the tribe remained predominantly Houma, the last remnants of many tribal nations joined them for refuge. Because of increasing conflicts among the English, French, and Spanish colonists, the Houma migrated south by the beginning of the 19th century to their current locations in Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes. Oral history and modern scholars agree that they made a settlement called Chukunamous (meaning roughly Red House). The modern city of Houma, Louisiana was later developed at this site. The tribe moved further south. = Early United States era = Having lost Saint-Domingue with the success of the slave revolt establishing Haiti, Napoleon ended his North American ambitions and agreed to sell the Louisiana colony to the United States. This doubled the land area of the new republic. On April 30, 1803, the two nations signed a treaty confirming the Louisiana Purchase. With respect to native inhabitants, article six of the Louisiana Purchase Treaty states > The United States promise to execute such treaties and articles as may have > been agreed between Spain and the tribes and nations of Indians, until, by > mutual consent of the United States and the said tribes of nations, other > suitable articles shall have been agreed upon. Although the United States signed the treaty, they failed to uphold the policy. Dr. John Sibley was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as US Indian agent for the region. He acknowledged 60 Houma people in the Opelousa areahttp://www.dickshovel.com/hou.html. Due to their dispersion and lack of organization, many Houma people living in other regions were not counted, and thus the people were considered extinct by the United States.http://www.dickshovel.com/hou.html In 1885, the Houma lost a great leader, Rosalie Courteau.http://sites.rootsweb.com/~laterreb/houmaindians.htm She had helped them survive through the aftermath of the American Civil War. She continues to be highly respected. = Modern era = By the end of the 19th century, the Houma had developed a creole language based on the French language of the former colony. The Houma-French language which the Houma people speak today is a mix between the French spoken by early explorers and Houma words, such as shaui (\\"raccoon\\"). Yet, Houma-French language is still a French language, because it can be understood by French speakers from Canada, France, Rwanda or Louisiana. There are some differences in vocabulary, for example, chevrette to say crevette (shrimp). The accent of the Houma Nation French-speaker is comparable to the difference between an English-speaker from the United States and an English-speaker from England; every linguistic group develops many different accents. As southern Louisiana became more urban and industrialized, the Houma remained relatively isolated in their bayou settlements. The population of the Houma at this time was divided among six other Native American settlements. Travel between settlements was made by pirogues and the waterways; the state did not build roads connecting the settlements until the 1940s. Like the other Native American populations, the Houma were often subjected to discrimination and isolation. In 1907, John R. Swanton, an anthropologist from the Smithsonian Institution, visited the Houma. The Houma continue to have a hunter-gatherer type economy, which he documented, depending on the bayous and swamps for fish and game. They also cultivate small subsistence gardens. Houma members R.J. Molinere, Jr. and his son Jay Paul Molinere are featured hunting alligators on the television program, Swamp People. After white Democrats regained power in Louisiana following the Reconstruction era, they passed laws establishing racial segregation. They had previously classified the Houma and other Native Americans as free people of color and required them to send their children to schools established for the children of freedmen, when available. The state was slow to construct any public schools in Houma settlements. It was not until 1964 after the Civil Rights Act was passed and ended segregation that Houma children were allowed to attend public schools. Before this time, Houma children attended only missionary schools established by religious groups. Government The Houma established a government that includes a role for tribal elders, who operate like a senate. In addition, they have an elected council of representatives and elect a president. That position is held by Principal Chief August \\"Cocoa\\" Creppel.https://unitedhoumanation.org/about/government/  Federal recognition  The Houma were granted land by the 1790s on Bayou Terrebonne under the Spanish colonial administration, which had prohibited Indian slavery in 1764. They were never removed to a reservation and, as a small tribe, were overlooked by the federal government during the Indian Removal period of the 1830s. As a people without recognized communal land, in the 20th century, they were considered to have lost their tribal status. In addition, since 1808, following United States purchase of Louisiana, state policy required classification of all residents according to a binary system of white and non- white: all Indians in Louisiana were to be classified as free people of color in state records.\\"Summary of Evidence\\", HISTORICAL REPORT ON THE UNITED HOUMA NATION, INC. This was related to the approach of United States slavery states to classify all children born to slave mothers as slaves (and therefore black) regardless of paternity and proportion of other ancestry. During the French colonial period in Louisiana, the term free people of color had applied primarily to people of African-European descent. After US annexation of the territory, its administrators applied this term to all non-whites, including those who identified as Indian. In the early 20th century, the state adopted a \\"one-drop rule\\" that was even more stringent, classifying anyone with any known African ancestry as black. Many Houma people may have mixed ancestry but identify culturally and ethnically as Houma rather than African American. Records of these people are among regular civil parish and church records, and reflect differing jurisdictional designations, rather than lack of stability as a people in this area. Since the mid-20th century, the people identifying as Houma have organized politically, created a government, and have sought federal recognition as a tribe. In 1979 the Houma tribe filed its letter of intent to petition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Their petition for recognition was rejected in 1994, on the basis that the tribe had lived in disparate settlements. The tribe submitted a response in 1996.\\"Federal Recognition\\", United Houma Nation. 5 Oct 2008 (retrieved 19 Jun 2014) The Houma tribe waits for their application to be reviewed again for final determination. The Houma have been highly decentralized, with communities scattered over a wide area. The Pointe-Au-Chien Indian Tribe in southern Louisiana and the Biloxi-Chitimacha Confederation of Muskogee have organized and left the United Houma Nation because of feeling too separated from other peoples. They have each achieved state recognition and are independently seeking federal recognition as tribes but have not succeeded as of 2014.State of Louisiana \\"List of state and federally recognized tribes\\" Facing continued criticism of its tribal recognition process as being too stringent in view of US historical issues, in 2013 the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs offered proposed rule changes. Tribes would be required to demonstrate historical continuity since 1934, when Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, granting tribes more power as sovereign nations. Earlier they had been required to demonstrate political continuity as a community from the colonial or settlement period of European contact.Jordan Blum, \\"La. tribes look to change in federal recognition rules\\", The Advocate, 1 September 2013 Numerous tribes seeking federal recognition had protested that disruption by European-American colonists and settlers were the very factors that caused losses of historic lands and continuity, but that their people could demonstrate continued identification as tribal peoples. In 2014, the Houma were informed by the BIA that their review was in active status under these new guidelines.Dan Frosch, \\"Tribes Seek Speedier Federal Recognition Proposed Changes May Benefit Native Groups Denied Health, Other Benefits\\", Wall Street Journal, 10 July 2014, accessed 19 October 2014 The state of Louisiana officially recognized the United Houma Tribe in 1972.  Coastal erosion  As many of tribal communities are in coastal areas and depend on the swamps and bayous as a source of food and economic resource, they have been severely and adversely affected by the continuing coastal erosion and loss of wetlands. Different factors associated with industrialization have contributed to such losses, including dredging of navigation canals by shipping and oil companies, which increased water movement and erosion, increasing salt water intrusion and causing loss of wetlands plants. In addition, oil companies have buried piping under the ground but not covered it sufficiently. The community of Isle de Jean Charles has suffered severe erosion; scientists estimate that the island will be lost by 2030 if no restoration takes place. The Houma tribe is looking for land in the area to buy in order to resettle all of the community together. Coastal erosion has adversely affected the quality of fishing. The tribe has suffered from a decrease in fish, as saltwater intrusion has destroyed many of the old fishing holes. Family names The Houma people, like many other Native American Tribes within the state and surrounding states, spent many years migrating and shifting. This has left a scattering of ethnic Houma people among many other Native American populations and considerable intermarriage. Over time, the Houma were encouraged to adopt European-style names; in addition, there was considerable marriage by European men and native women. Today most Houma have surnames of European origin, such as Billiot, Verdin, Dardar, Naquin, Gregoire, Parfait, Chaisson, Courteau, Hotard, Solet, Verret, Fitch, Creppel, etc. In the beginning days of the organization of the Tribe as it is known today, many Native people of other ethnicities thought they had to enroll with the Houma in order to be classified by the state as Indian. Houma means red in Choctaw, Choctaw being the language from which Mobile Trade Jargon derived. The research necessary for Federal Recognition has helped many find their ancestral tribal identity. The process of documentation of ancestors has given honor to those Houma and other Native Americans who faced much discrimination in the generations before. Today the Louisiana constitution guarantees all residents the right to learn, teach, speak, read and write in English, French and Houma. In the 1980s, the tribe led a language revival effort; they have done considerable research to reconstruct their lost language. Some of these Houma students have gone to college and become linguists, scientists, musicians, Linux programmers, animators, sociologists, and nurses.

It is located on the riverside of Rio de las Vueltas, within the Los Glaciares National Park (section Reserva Nacional Zona Viedma) near the base of Cerro Torre and Cerro Fitz Roy spires, both popular for climbing. It is 220 km north of El Calafate. It is also a popular base for hiking numerous trails, such as those to the base of surrounding peaks and glacial lakes, such as Laguna Torre and Laguna de los Tres (near the base of Fitz Roy). For those reasons, El Chaltén was named Argentina's Trekking Capital or Capital Nacional del Trekking. Today the sole reason for its existence is tourism. In 1985, Argentina and Chile had a border dispute to gain and claim rights over El Chalten. There was no war in the end, and El Chalten was awarded to Argentina. Homes, government buildings, and flags of Argentina went up to mark the city settlement. The town is located at the edge of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field and about 350 inhabitants live there throughout all the seasons of the year. Snow and ice mostly fence the town, and the homes are low structured with roads mostly made of rocks and dirt. In October 2014, El Chalten took second place in a ranking of \\"Best cities in the world to know\\" of the travel guide Lonely Planet publishing in 2015, being the first city of Argentina.  Etymology  \\"Chaltén\\" is a Tehuelche word meaning smoking mountain, as they believe it was a volcano for its peak is most of the time covered by clouds. Other visited tracks and sights are Torre Glacier, Laguna Capri, Piedras Blancas Glacier, Chorrillo del Salto, and Laguna de los Tres. In 1877, Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno named mount Chaltén as mount Fitz Roy, in honour of Robert FitzRoy, captain during the Second voyage of HMS Beagle in the 1830s. Mount Chaltén/Fitz Roy makes the town worth visiting because one can seek the impressive peaks from any area. The whole village finds a gorgeous view that keeps expanding due to the tourism and beautiful location.  Tourism  El Chaltén The village provides national park information for visitors, as well as commercial camping (with showers) and a very limited number of beds, catering mostly for backpackers. The most popular hostel in town is La Comarca, located in front of the bus terminal. On the treks outside of the village free campsites are provided and reservations for campsites are not necessary. Some may train for expedition hikes, visit the glaciers, or raft along the rivers. There is currently one automated teller machine, and there is a bank. ( Banco de la Nacion Argentina ) The number of tourists seems to double each year. Most are people from another country who enjoy climbing mountains, seeing the magnificent Glacier National Park, and most importantly hiking. El Chalten has enormous amounts of trails to explore and take adventures, which makes it the national capital for hiking. South of the Tumbado Mountain, there are hiking trails up to Viento and Lagoon Toro. However, about 100-altitude meters overhead of El Chalten, there are also cliffs with large curves that look out on Condores. There are also high winds that occur often which makes it very dangerous for tourist to hike trails or climb mountains. Hiking trails leading north from El Chaltén provide stunning views across the Las Vueltas River. The tourist trade has spawned a few restaurants, bars, supermarkets and shops in town, with a large variety of outdoor equipment for sale, while some of the accommodations provide internet and phone access and show regular movies. Other than that, the town is fairly far removed from the normal flow of news and communication, even during high season (November–February). The town is nearly deserted during the off-season (the southern hemisphere winter).  Climate  El Chaltén has an unpredictable subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc) with subantarctic continental (Dfc) influences, with precipitation distributed on a large number of days despite not being nearly as heavy as in Chilean Patagonia; bad weather is exceedingly common. Summers experience long daylight hours, very windy weather, and cool temperatures, mostly below during the day and below during the night. Frost can and does occur in the summer too. Winters bring snow in moderate quantities, and average temperatures around during the day and during the night; however, the coldest nights are much colder than this. Spring and fall are variable, but generally cold as well.

Other nearby communities are Green Bay and Petite Riviere. The beach is known for its sandy dunes and windsurfing. The sand beach is separated from the tidal flats and salt marsh of Dublin Bay by sand dunes which rise in height from 2 m in the west to 6.8 m near the east end. A large wooden fence has existed between the beach and dunes since the 1930s. The Crescent Beach sand bar connects some of the LaHave Islands to the mainland. Prior to the construction of the paved road behind the dunes running the length of the backshore, the beach was primarily used as a path to and from George Island which is part of the LaHave Islands.

In legends he is attributed with the transmission of the Buddha relic called Daoxuan's tooth, one of the four tooth relics enshrined in the capital of Chang'an during the Tang dynasty. He is said to have received the relic during a night visit from a divinity associated with Indra. Daoxuan wrote five commentaries on the Vinaya known as the Five Great Works of Mount Zhongnan. He also was part of the translation team that assisted Xuanzang in translating sutras from Sanskrit into Chinese.Wong 2018 Daoxuan was also a noted and influential bibliographer.Tokuno: 1990. His catalogue of Buddhist scriptures 《大唐內典錄》 Catalogue of the Inner Canon of the Great Tang aka Nèidiǎn Catalog (T2149) in 10 scrolls (卷) was commissioned by the Emperor Gaozong and completed in 664. The Nèidiǎn Catalog helped to define the shape of the Chinese Buddhist Canon in future years. Influenced by the apocalyptic Mo-fa or theory of the end of the Dharma, Daoxuan was particularly concerned to expose and denounce suspicious (疑偽) or fake (偽) sutras. He witnessed wholesale burning of texts suspected of being fake.Tokuno 1990: 48–50. The Nèidiǎn Catalog is also notable for being the first bibliographical work to attribute the Heart Sutra to Xuánzàng who died the same year as the catalogue was completed. Daoxuan is also noted for his admonishments to the Emperor Tang Gaozong for issuing an edict requiring monastics to bow before the emperor. His admonishments succeeded in the cancellation of that edict.Jülch 2016 References Bibliography * * Chen Jinhua (2002).

He was killed during the Expedition of Al Raji. Background to death In 625 some men requested that Muhammad(sa.) send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Sufyan bin Khaled by Muhammad's(sa.) followers and they killed the Muslims. (online) After killing Asim ibn Thabit, Hudhayl wanted to sell his head. According to William Montgomery Watt, the most common version of the event states that the motives of the Banu Lahyan for attacking Muslims, was that the Banu Lahyan wanted to get revenge for the assassination of their chief at Muhammad's(sa.) instigation. So they bribed the two tribes of Khuzaymah to say they wanted to convert to Islam. Watt also said that the seven men Muhammad(sa.) sent may have been spies for Muhammad(sa.) and instructors for Arab tribes. He also said that the it is difficult to verify the exact date the assassination of their chief took place. According to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, the Quraysh ordered Khubayb bin Adi to be crucified by Uqba bin al-Harith because he had killed Uqba bin al-Harith's father. Muhammad(sa.) ordered The Mission of Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri to assassinate Abu Sufyan to avenge Khubyab bin Adi. Death Khubaib ibn Adiy was taken captive and escorted in a procession of thousands which was led by men like Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, and Safwan ibn Umayah, and which included Said ibn Amir. The women and children pushed him to the place set for his death. Khubaib's death was to be in revenge for Quraysh losses in the battle of Badr. When the assembled throng arrived at the appointed place with him, the prisoner, Khubaib said in a firm but quiet voice amid the shouting of women and children: :\\"If you would, leave me to pray two rakaats before my death.\\" This the Quraysh allowed. Khubaib faced the Ka'bah and prayed two rakaats. Then Khubaib faced the Quraysh leaders. :\\"By God, if you thought that I asked to pray out of fear of death, I would think the prayer not worth the trouble,\\" he said. Then the Meccans set about dismembering Khubayb's body while he was yet alive and taunting him in the process. :\\"Would you like Muhammad to be in your place while you go free?\\" With his blood flowing, he replied, \\"By God, I would not want to be safe and secure among my family while even a thorn hurts Muhammad.\\" People shook their fists in the air and the shouting increased. :\\"Kill him. Kill him!\\" Khubaib lifted his eyes to the heavens above the wooden cross. :\\"O Allah, send my salam to my prophet Muhammad\\" Thereafter it could not be counted the number of swords and spears which cut through Khubaib's body.

Despite being a part of a group of many gay Harlem artists, Nugent was among only a few who were publicly out. Recognized initially for the few short stories and paintings that were published, Nugent had a long productive career bringing to light the creative process of gay and black culture. Biography = Early life = Richard Bruce Nugent was born in Washington, DC, on July 2, 1906 to Richard H. Nugent, Jr. and Pauline Minerva Bruce. He completed his schooling at Dunbar High School in 1920, and moved to New York following his father's death. After revealing to his mother that he decided to devote his life to only making art she worried about his lack of interest in getting a stable job, so she sent him to Washington, DC, to live with his grandmother. To earn enough money to sustain the family, Nugent would pass as white to earn higher wages. While there, he also experimented with passing, and went by the name Ricardo Nugen di Dosocta, even going as far as giving an address located in the Spanish legation in Washington. In an interview, he claimed he did this for its \\"convenience\\" as it allowed him to avoid \\"bearing the stigma\\" of being African American. At that time, he met famous writers like Langston Hughes and Georgia Douglas Johnson. They became friends, influenced each other's works, and collaborated on works together. = Career = In 1925 his first works as a writer were published. These included his poem \\"Shadow\\" and his short story \\"Sahdji\\". The majority of his life and career took place in Harlem in New York City, and he died of congestive heart failure on May 27, 1987 in Hoboken, New Jersey. During his career in Harlem, Nugent lived with writer Wallace Thurman from 1926 to 1928, which led to the publishing of \\"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\\" in Thurman's publication Fire!!. The short story was written in a modernist stream-of-consciousness style. Its subject matter was bisexuality and more specifically interracial male desire. Before committing his life to his art, Bruce Nugent worked several ordinary jobs, including hat seller, delivery boy, and bellhop. During his time as a bellhop he fell deeply in love with a hotel kitchen employee. It is believed that the character of Beauty from \\"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\\" is based on this man. Many of Nugent's illustrations were featured in publications such as Fire!!, along with his short story. Four of his paintings were included in the Harmon Foundation's exhibition of Negro artists, one of the few venues available for black artists in 1931. His only stand-alone publication, Beyond Where the Stars Stood Still, was issued in a limited edition by Warren Marr II in 1945. He married Marr's sister, Grace, on December 5, 1952. In the late 1930s Nugent worked with other iconic Harlem Renaissance writers, Claude Mckay and Ralph Ellison, on the Federal Writers Project. In this project he was employed to write biographical sketches. = Marriage = His marriage to Grace Marr lasted from 1952 until her suicide in 1969. Due to Nugent's clearly-stated open attraction to other men, his intentions with his marriage to Grace were never clear, as they were not romantic. Thomas Wirth, contemporary and personal friend of Richard Nugent, claimed that Grace loved Richard and was determined to change his sexuality. = Harlem Cultural Council = Nugent attended the Community Planning Conference at Columbia University in 1964 as an invited speaker. The conference was held under the auspices of the Borough President of Manhattan/Community Planning Board 10 and Columbia University. The idea of forming an organization to promote the arts in Harlem emerged from the conference's Cultural Planning workshop and led to the formation of the Harlem Cultural Council. During the 1960s, Nugent and other coworkers founded the Harlem Cultural Council, which sought municipal and federal funds for the arts and mainly worked on construction for the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Nugent also worked as an artist, performer, and commentator. He took an active role in this effort and attended numerous subsequent meetings. He was elected co-chair (a position equivalent to vice president) of this council. He also served as chair of the Program Committee until March 1967. = Dance = While he was more well known for his writing and illustrations, Nugent also spent many of his years touring as a dancer. He appeared in shows like Run, Little Chillun (1933) and even toured for two years in a production of Porgy in 1929. In the 1940s he became a member of the William's Negro Ballet Company. He was also a part of other dance companies, including Hemsley Winfield and Asadata Dafora, even dancing in drag with the New Negro Art Theatre Dance Troupe. Legacy Nugent's aggressive and honest approach to homoerotic and interracial desire was not necessarily in the favor of his more discreet homosexual contemporaries. Alain Locke chastised the publication Fire!!! for its radicalism and specifically Nugent's \\"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\\" for promoting the effeminacy and decadence associated with homosexual writers. Nugent's friends, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Aaron Douglas, Gwendolyn Bennett, and John P. Davis, all frequented \\"Niggerati Manor,\\" where they socialized with each other and where the origination of \\"Fire!!!\\" was based. As well as his friends, Nugent was also influenced by Aaron Douglas and Georgia Douglas Johnson. Their aesthetics were seen in his work. They also helped get his work into various magazines. Nugent's work resurfaced in anthologies such as Michael J. Smith's Black Men/White Men: A Gay Anthology (1983), and Joseph Beam's interview with Nugent in In The Life: A Black Gay Anthology (1986). His work, after its resurfacing, brought to light the lifestyle of black gay artists during the Harlem Renaissance. His use of codes made much of his work pass unseen by straight contemporaries, under the disguise of biblical imagery, for example. Nugent bridged the gap between the Harlem Renaissance and the black gay movement of the 1980s, and was a great inspiration to many of his contemporaries.  Major works and themes  Alain LeRoy Locke, an African American philosopher, educator and writer, asked Richard Bruce Nugent to contribute to his anthology The New Negro. Nugent drew a picture of \\"a washing drawing of an African girl standing in a hut. The doorway of a hut, apparently jangling her bracelets\\". Locke liked his picture and suggested that he create a story about it. Therefore, Nugent called the girl \\"Sahdji.\\" His short story takes place in East Africa and is centered around a small tribe in the area of Warpuri. Sahdji is the beautiful wife of Konombju, the chief of the tribe. However, Sahdji's stepson, Mrabo, is in love with her. Therefore, he hopes his father's death will enable him to take his bride. A devoted supporter of Mrabo named, Numbo, becomes aware of Mrabo's desire for Sahdji. As a gesture of Numbo's respect for Mrabo, Numbo kills Konombju during a hunt. The murder appears to be a hunting accident and the tribe mourns the loss through a funeral ceremony. Mrabo triumphantly awaits his new bride, Sahdji; however, the broken-hearted Sahdji mourns her husband's death and throws her body into his funeral pyre while Mrabo watches. This story was initially interpreted as a gay prose text. However, it is now regarded as an African morality tale which condemns murder, not homosexual love. Locke encouraged him to write the story again, and he created Sahdji: An African Ballet. It premiered at Howard University in the late 1920s and was also produced at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, in the summer of 1932. His works received honorable mentions.

He was interviewed in the 1984 gay documentary Before Stonewall, and his work was featured in Isaac Julien's 1989 film, Looking for Langston. *Brother to Brother is a film written and directed by Rodney Evans and released in 2004. It debuted at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival before playing the gay and lesbian film festival circuit, with a limited theatrical release in late 2004. The film concerns an art student named Perry (Anthony Mackie) who befriends an elderly homeless man named Bruce Nugent (Roger Robinson), who turns out to have been an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Through recalling his friendships with other important Harlem Renaissance figures such as Langston Hughes, Aaron Douglas, Wallace Thurman and Zora Neale Hurston, Bruce chronicles some of the challenges he faced as a young, black, gay writer in the 1920s. Perry discovers that the challenges of homophobia and racism he faces in the early 21st century closely parallel Bruce's. =Theater= Smoke Lilies & Jade is a Bildungsroman (coming-of-age) play by writer Carl Hancock Rux. It is loosely based on Nugent's 1926 short story, \\"Smoke, Lilies and Jade\\" (as well as elements of Nugent's own life). The play concerns the psychological and moral growth of its protagonist Alex as he reflects on his love for a man named Beauty (a composite character of all the men the protagonist has loved intimately throughout his life) and a woman named Melva (a character loosely based on Nugent's wife, Grace Elizabeth Marr) as well as the relationships, racial injustices and personal tragedies that befell many of his Jazz Age Harlem compatriots. The play was initially commissioned by the Joseph Papp Public Theater and was later produced by the CalArts Center for New Performance. References * External links * The Fire!! Press * Thomas H.

It was used primarily on Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics (SGI) and IBM RISC workstations, as well as some displays from Apple Computer, NeXT Computer and Intergraph Corporation. The 13W3 connector is no longer used with modern displays; it was superseded for use with analog displays by the VGA connector, and as the display market has moved to digital flat panel displays that has in turn been replaced almost entirely by digital connections (DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort). The connector contains 10 standard signal pins and 3 larger positions that can be fitted with either special pins with two concentric contacts for coaxial cable or with special high-current pins. When used for video signals on the computer side, the pins are female but the coaxial connectors in the large positions are male. The coaxial connectors carry the video signal split into red, green/gray, and blue; the standard signal pins carry four grounds, three \\"sense\\" pins used to communicate with the monitor, vertical sync, horizontal sync, and a composite sync signal. The 13W3 connector can be converted into a standard VGA connector using commonly available cables and adapters. This allows multisync monitors, which became prevalent in personal computing in the late 1980s, to be used with these workstations as long as they are sync-on-green compatible. Likewise, later- generation Sun monitors, which began supporting multisync in 1998, can be connected via similar cables to personal computers. Even though 13W3 is a standard connector, the sync signals are maintained on different pins based on the display and system. Sun, Intergraph, IBM and SGI each use different pin configurations for the monitor sense ID and sync signals. Sun and SGI each even have two different pin configurations: with and without Display Data Channel support. The Sun DDC connector was used at least on the UPA graphics adapters (Creator 3D, Expert 3D) and for their corresponding monitors (GD5410, GD5510). This can make matching the correct cable to the monitor virtually impossible. Many monitors with 13W3 connectors do not support separate sync as supplied on most PC systems. Other converters exist to allow connecting newer monitors with VGA connectors to the older systems and workstations. The most popular of these is a cable with a series of DIP switches built in that can be used to set the sync signals.  Non-video use A variant of the DB13W3 connector, with high-current pins instead of the high-frequency pins used for video applications, is also used by some 3Com SuperStack Ethernet switches to carry DC power.

Apart from minor external details M1867 rifles made in Norway were identical to those made in Sweden.12.17×44mmR, rimmed centerfire cartridgeDimensional drawing of 12.17×44mm RF, Norwegian rimfire military cartridgeThe 12.17×42mm RF rimfire round was developed by a joint Swedish-Norwegian arms commission, and was adopted by the armed forces of both Sweden and Norway in 1867. It was used in the M1867 Remington rolling-block rifles adopted as new standard rifles by the armed forces of Sweden and Norway the same year. Large numbers of older rifles, both Swedish muzzle-loading Model 1860 and breech-loading Model 1864 and Norwegian breech-loading Kammerlader rifles of various models were also converted to rolling block rifles, chambered for the new standard round. A lengthened version of the round, the 12.17×44mm RF, was adopted by the Norwegian armed forces in 1871. But the two cartridges were interchangeable, and could thus be fired from the same weapons. The round, nominally known as 4 Linjers (actual bore diameter 4.1 Swedish decimal lines or 3.88 Norwegian decimal lines, that is 0.41 Swedish or 0.388 Norwegian inches), had a lead bullet 12.615mm (0.497 in) in diameter, with the diameter of the bore, measured between the lands, being 12.17mm (0.479 inches). It used a copper case. In Swedish service the standard cartridge used a lead projectile (shaped like a Minié ball) weighing 24 g (370 gr). The muzzle velocity fired through a 955mm (37.6 in) rifle barrel was 386 m/s (1,266 ft/s), with a muzzle energy of 1,788 J (1,319 ft/lbf).http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/gevar-m-1867-74/S-AM/AM.025775?pos=194 Fired through a 460mm (18.11 in) carbine barrel the muzzle velocity was 340 m/s (1,115 ft/s), with a muzzle energy of 1,387 J (1,023 ft/lbf).http://www.digitaltmuseum.se/things/karbin-m-1870/S-AM/AM.026111?pos=10 In Norwegian service early rounds had a cast lead projectile weighting 5.85 kvintin (22.8 g/352 gr) and 1 kvintin (3.89 g/60 gr) of gunpowder. Later rounds had a pressed lead projectile weighting 6 kvintin (23.4 g/361 gr) and the gunpowder load was increased to 1.05 kvintin (4.09 g/63 gr). There was also a blank round - an ordinary cartridge case loaded with 54 gr (3.50 g) of gunpowder and closed with a cardboard or cork disc. 12.17×44mmR centerfire A civilian/paramilitary centerfire version of the cartridge, the 12.17×44mmR using a brass cartridge case with the same dimensions as the 12.17×44mm RF, was introduced during the 1870s in both Sweden and Norway.http://municion.org/12/12x44rRemSwedish.htm The centerfire cartridge could be fired from both Swedish and Norwegian M1867 military Remington rolling-block firearms with only a minor modification, converting the weapon from rimfire to centerfire and vice versa, which could be done by the shooter in the field provided he or she carried the replacement parts. The advantage of the centerfire cartridge was that spent cases could be reloaded, making centerfire ammunition significantly cheaper to use than rimfire ammunition, so the 12.17×44mmR also saw extensive use in Swedish paramilitary service, being used by Frivilliga Skarpskytterörelsen (\\"The Volunteer Sharpshooter Movement\\"), a voluntary paramilitary organization patterned on the British Volunteer Force and training civilians in the use of arms, with the units raised intended as local defense units (the first such volunteer \\"sharpshooter\\" units were raised in Stockholm in 1860, with the total number of active members throughout Sweden reaching 40,000 in 1865;http://runeberg.org/nfae/0217.html volunteer \\"sharpshooter\\" units were armed with military M1867 rifles modified to use the 12.17×44mmR centerfire cartridge, and wore military-style uniforms).

Many of these guns still exist and are still used by black-powder enthusiasts both for competition and hunting. Centerfire 12.17×44mmR cases are available, but a more cost-effective way to acquire cases is to cut .50 Alaskan cases down to 44mm total lenght. Flatnes, Oyvind.

It typically occurs in newborns that are either premature or otherwise unwell. Symptoms may include poor feeding, bloating, decreased activity, blood in the stool, or vomiting of bile. The exact cause is unclear. Risk factors include congenital heart disease, birth asphyxia, exchange transfusion, and premature rupture of membranes. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a combination of poor blood flow and infection of the intestines. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed with medical imaging. Prevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. Treatment includes bowel rest, orogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and intravenous antibiotics. Surgery is required in those who have free air in the abdomen. A number of other supportive measures may also be required. Complications may include short-gut syndrome, intestinal strictures, or developmental delay. About 7% of those that are born premature develop necrotizing enterocolitis. Onset is typically in the first four weeks of life. Among those affected, about 25% die. The sexes are affected equally frequently. The condition was first described between 1888 and 1891. Signs and symptoms The condition is typically seen in premature infants, and the timing of its onset is generally inversely proportional to the gestational age of the baby at birth (i.e., the earlier a baby is born, the later signs of NEC are typically seen). Initial symptoms include feeding intolerance and failure to thrive, increased gastric residuals, abdominal distension and bloody stools. Symptoms may progress rapidly to abdominal discoloration with intestinal perforation and peritonitis and systemic hypotension requiring intensive medical support. Cause The exact cause is unclear. Risk factors include congenital heart disease, birth asphyxia, exchange transfusion, and premature rupture of membranes. Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually suspected clinically but often requires the aid of diagnostic imaging modalities, most commonly radiography. Specific radiographic signs of NEC are associated with specific Bell's stages of the disease:Lin PW, Stoll BJ. Necrotising enterocolitis. Lancet. 2006 Oct 7;368(9543):1271–83. * Bell's stage 1 (suspected disease): ** Mild systemic disease (apnea, lethargy,Schanler, R.J. (2016). \\"Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns\\". UpToDate. slowed heart rate, temperature instability) ** Mild intestinal signs (abdominal distention, increased gastric residuals, bloody stools) ** Non-specific or normal radiological signs * Bell's stage 2 (definite disease): ** Mild to moderate systemic signs ** Additional intestinal signs (absent bowel sounds, abdominal tenderness) ** Specific radiologic signs (pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas ** Laboratory changes (metabolic acidosis, too few platelets in the bloodstream) * Bell's stage 3 (advanced disease): ** Severe systemic illness (low blood pressure) ** Additional intestinal signs (striking abdominal distention, peritonitis) ** Severe radiologic signs (pneumoperitoneum) ** Additional laboratory changes (metabolic and respiratory acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation) Ultrasonography has proven to be useful as it may detect signs and complications of NEC before they are evident on radiographs, specifically in cases that involve a paucity of bowel gas, a gasless abdomen, or a sentinel loop.Muchantef K, Epelman M, Darge K, Kirpalani H, Laje P, Anupindi SA. Sonographic and radiographic imaging features of the neonate with necrotizing enterocolitis: correlating findings with outcomes. Pediatr Radiol. 2013 Jun 15.

Autopsy of infant showing abdominal distension, intestinal necrosis and hemorrhage, and peritonitis due to perforation. Prevention Prevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \\"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of two or more. Small amounts of oral feeds of human milk starting as soon as possible, while the infant is being primarily fed intravenously, primes the immature gut to mature and become ready to receive greater intake by mouth. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable. The gut mucosal cells do not get enough nourishment from arterial blood supply to stay healthy, especially in very premature infants, where the blood supply is limited due to immature development of the capillaries, so nutrients from the lumen of the gut are needed. Towards understanding intervention with human milk, experts have noted cow and human milk differ in their immunoglobular and glycan compositions. Due to their relative ease of production, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are a subject of particular interest in supplementation and intervention. A Cochrane review in 2014 found that supplementation of probiotics enterally \\"prevents severe NEC as well as all-cause mortality in preterm infants.\\" Advancing enteral feed volumes at lower rates does not appear to reduce the risk of NEC or death in very preterm infants. Not beginning feeding an infant by mouth for more than 4 days does not appear to have protective benefits. Treatment Treatment consists primarily of supportive care including providing bowel rest by stopping enteral feeds, gastric decompression with intermittent suction, fluid repletion to correct electrolyte abnormalities and third-space losses, support for blood pressure, parenteral nutrition, and prompt antibiotic therapy. Monitoring is clinical, although serial supine and left lateral decubitus abdominal X-rays should be performed every six hours. As an infant recovers from NEC, feeds are gradually introduced. \\"Trophic feeds\\" or low- volume feeds (<20 ml/kg/day) are usually initiated first. How and what to feed are determined by the extent of bowel involved, the need for surgical intervention and the infant's clinical appearance. Where the disease is not halted through medical treatment alone, or when the bowel perforates, immediate emergency surgery to resect the dead bowel is generally required, although abdominal drains may be placed in very unstable infants as a temporizing measure. Surgery may require a colostomy, which may be able to be reversed at a later time. Some children may suffer from short bowel syndrome if extensive portions of the bowel had to be removed. In the case of an infant whose bowel is left in discontinuity, the surgical creation of a mucous fistula or connection to the distal bowel may be helpful as this allows for re-feeding of ostomy output to the distal bowel. This re-feeding process is believed to improve bowel adaptation and aid in advancement of feeds. Prognosis Typical recovery from NEC if medical, non-surgical treatment succeeds, includes 10–14 days or more without oral intake, and then demonstrated ability to resume feedings and gain weight. Recovery from NEC alone may be compromised by co-morbid conditions that frequently accompany prematurity. Long-term complications of medical NEC include bowel obstruction and anemia. In the United States of America it caused 355 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013, down from 484 per 100,000 live births in 2009. Rates of death were almost three times higher for the black populations than for the white populations. Overall, about 70-80% of infants who develop NEC survive.Schanler, R.J. (2017). \\"Management of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns\\". UpToDate. Medical management of NEC shows an increased chance of survival compared to surgical management. Despite a significant mortality risk, long-term prognosis for infants undergoing NEC surgery is improving, with survival rates of 70–80%. \\"Surgical NEC\\" survivors are at risk for complications including short bowel syndrome and neurodevelopmental disability.

Estimates of the number of families in Canada and the United States descended from Marin Boucher run as high as 350,000, although most of them do not bear the name Boucher today because Marin's line produced more daughters than sons. Biography Marin Boucher was born in Mortagne, Perche province, France about 1587 and died on 25 March 1671 in Château-Richer, Canada, New France.See University of Caen, Programme de Recherche sur l'Émigration des Français en Nouvelle-France See University of Montreal, Research Program in Historical Demography He married twice: (1) to Julienne Baril ( 1574 - 1627) in 1611 and (2) to Perrine Maillet (1604-1687) before 1630. Marin and Julienne had seven children, one of whom traveled to Canada; Marin and Perrine had seven more children, five of whom were born in Canada. The Bouchers were stonemasons and carpenters, skills which were valuable in the early colony. Because of some work done for Samuel de Champlain, the Founder of the colony, Marin Boucher was deeded Champlain's clothes in his will when he died. He was also a witness in a dispute over stolen property in which his relation Gaspard Boucher was the plaintiff. Family History Marin Boucher's sister, Jeanne Boucher, married Thomas Hayot (spellings vary: Hayot; Ayot; Ayotte, etc.) who was also an early settler and founder of a distinguished Québec family. Gaspard Boucher was another close relation who emigrated to New France, believed by some researchers to have been Marin's brother, though more likely his cousin. Gaspard Boucher was father of Pierre Boucher Seigneur of Boucherville, and founder of the parish and township of Boucherville, across the Saint-Laurent River from Montreal. Pierre Boucher became Governor of Trois-Rivières and a Royal Judge, was ennobled, and settled on his seigneurie, where he founded a model seigneurie, village and Parish which is now a suburban satellite of Montreal. The Bouchers arrived as part of the Percheron immigration movement, consisting of a mix of families and single individual from the region of Perche, at the time part of Maine province, brought over to New France in 1634 to colonize Beauport, a seigneurie granted to Robert Giffard, physician to the colony. Marin Boucher and his son François migrated aboard the ship St-Jehan under the command of Captain Pierre Nesle, which arrived in Quebec on June 4, 1634. His wife and younger children arrived the following year. The colonists were temporarily housed in the Habitation (Fort St-Louis), the fort and residence built by Samuel de Champlain at Quebec in 1608, before moving to their land concessions at Beauport, a short distance down river from Quebec. Gaspard Boucher may have arrived with his family separately in 1635 according to the memoires of his son, Sieur Pierre Boucher de Boucherville. Marin Boucher and his family subsequently moved to the South Shore where they were pioneers of the town of Rivière-Ouelle. The town was attacked during King William's War by a party led by Sir William Phips in October 1690, and Marin's son, Jean-Galleran was among the 39 \\"Heroes of Rivière-Ouelle\\" who defended the town. Phips, whose troops had been pillaging along the coast of the St- Laurent on their way to lay siege to Québec City, was repulsed by the ambush, and later was unsuccessful in his attack on Québec. Genealogy Genealogical information on the Bouchers can be found in the works of Abbé Cyprien Tanguay; Abbé Archange Godbout; René Jetté; and other standard reference works on French Canadian genealogy. Two early settlers of Acadia are believed to be descended from Marin Boucher of New France, including a Jaques Boucher who shows up in a 1700 census of Port Royale (in present-day Nova Scotia), and a Pierre Boucher who went to Grand Pré and married Anne Hebert on or around 1714. There are several other lines of Bouchers, including that of Jean Boucher (born on or around 1650 in St-Etienne du Bourg de Chaix, France), in Quebec. There are descendants of Marin Boucher in Massachusetts, California, Florida, etc. There are also Bouchers descended from Marin Boucher in Louisiana, either of Acadian (Cadien or Cajun) descent or more directly descended from the Canadian (Quebec) lines. Monuments With the other early pioneers, Marin Boucher and his wife are commemorated by a plaque in Quebec City. Marin's nephew (or cousin, depending upon the source), Pierre Boucher, is commemorated by a statue on the Assemblée Nationale, the Provincial Legislature Building in Quebec City, and in a stained glass window in a church in Mortagne, Perche. A number of places and streets are named after various members of the Boucher family.

It is found throughout the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indo- Pacific region, from India to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The giant freshwater prawn has also been introduced to parts of Africa, Thailand, China, Japan, New Zealand, the Americas and the Caribbean. It is one of the biggest freshwater prawns in the world and is widely cultivated in several countries for food. While M. rosenbergii is considered a freshwater species, the larval stage of the animal depends on brackish water. Once the individual shrimp has grown beyond the planktonic stage and becomes a juvenile, it will live entirely in freshwater. It is also known as the Malaysian prawn, freshwater scampi (India), or cherabin (Australia). Locally, it is known as Golda Chingri in Bangladesh, udang galah in Indonesia and Malaysia, uwang or ulang in the Philippines, and in Thailand. Description Grilled giant river prawns in Thai cuisine; each (whole) prawn weighing around 500 g M. rosenbergii can grow to a length over . They are predominantly brownish in colour but can vary. Smaller individuals may be greenish in colour and display faint vertical stripes. The rostrum is very prominent and contains 11 to 14 dorsal teeth and 8 to 11 ventral teeth. The first pair of walking legs (pereiopods) are elongated and very thin, ending in delicate claws (chelipeds) which are used as feeding appendages. The second pair of walking legs are much larger and powerful, especially in males. The movable claws of the second pair of walking legs are distinctively covered in dense bristles (setae) that give it a velvety appearance. The color of the claws in males varies according to their social dominance. Females can be distinguished from males by their wider abdomens and smaller second pereiopods. The genital openings are found on the body segments containing the fifth pereiopods and the third pereiopods in males and females, respectively. =Morphotypes= Three different morphotypes of males exist. The first stage is called \\"small male\\" (SM); this smallest stage has short, nearly translucent claws. If conditions allow, small males grow and metamorphose into \\"orange claws\\" (OC), which have large orange claws on their second chelipeds, which may have a length of 0.8 to 1.4 times their body size. OC males later may transform into the third and final stage, the \\"blue claw\\" (BC) males. These have blue claws, and their second chelipeds may become twice as long as their bodies. Males of M. rosenbergii have a strict hierarchy: the territorial BC males dominate the OCs, which in turn dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will keep growing until it is larger than the largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming. All three male stages are sexually active, and females that have undergone their premating moult will co-operate with any male to reproduce. BC males protect the female until their shells have hardened; OCs and SMs show no such behaviour. Lifecycle In mating, the male deposits spermatophores on the underside of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the spermatophores. The female carries the fertilised eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. Females lay 10,000–50,000 eggs up to five times per year. From these eggs hatch zoeae, the first larval stage of crustaceans. They go through several larval stages before metamorphosing into postlarvae, at which stage they are long and resemble adults. This metamorphosis usually takes place about 32 to 35 days after hatching. These postlarvae then migrate back into fresh water.

The term connotes scarcity or exclusivity. The higher the quantity printed the less likely the book will become scarce and thus increase in value. Limited editions were introduced by publishers in the late 19th century. The term also implies that no further additional printings of the book with the same design treatment will take place, unlike open-ended trade editions wherein further copies may be released in more print runs as the first and subsequent printings sell out.Carter, John (1998).

PAP is used for communicating with the Push Proxy Gateway, which is usually part of a WAP Gateway. PAP is intended for use in delivering content from Push Initiators to Push Proxy Gateways for subsequent delivery to narrow band devices, including mobile phones and pagers. Example messages include news, stock quotes, weather, traffic reports, and notification of events such as email arrival. With Push functionality, users are able to receive information without having to request it. In many cases it is important for the user to get the information as soon as it is available. The Push Access Protocol is not intended for use over the air. PAP is designed to be independent of the underlying transport protocol. PAP specifies the following possible operations between the Push Initiator and the Push Proxy Gateway: * Submit a Push * Cancel a Push * Query for status of a Push * Query for wireless device capabilities * Result notification The interaction between the Push Initiators and the Push Proxy Gateways is in the form of XML messages. Operations = Push Submission = The purpose of the Push Submission is to deliver a Push message from a Push Initiator to a PPG, which should then deliver the message to a user agent in a device on the wireless network. The Push message contains a control entity and a content entity, and MAY contain a capabilities entity. The control entity is an XML document that contains control information (push- message) for the PPG to use in processing the message for delivery. The content entity represents content to be sent to the wireless device. The capabilities entity contains client capabilities assumed by the Push Initiator and is in the RDF [RDF] format as defined in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The PPG MAY use the capabilities information to validate that the message is appropriate for the client. The response to the push request is an XML document (push-response, section 9.3) that indicates initial acceptance or failure. At minimum the PPG MUST validate against the DTD [XML] the control entity in the message and report the result in the response. The PPG MAY indicate, using progress-note (if requested by the Push initiator in the progress-notes-requested attribute), that other validations have been completed. The contents and number of progress-notes are implementation specific. A typical response message may contain progress notes for each stage of internal processing. The processing stages used are implementation specific. There are provisions in the Push message to specify multiple recipients. The response message corresponds to the submit message, so there is one response message for one push message, regardless of the number of addresses specified. If the Push Initiator desires information related to the final outcome of the delivery, then it MUST request a result notification information in the push submission and provide a return address (e.g. URL). Result Notification This operation is used by the PPG to inform the initiator of the final outcome of a push submission, if requested by the Push Initiator. This notification (arrow 5, below) tells the Push Initiator that the message was sent (transmitted, as in arrow 3), delivered (confirmation received from wireless device, as in arrow 4), it expired, was cancelled, or there was an error. If there was a processing error, the notification SHOULD be sent immediately upon detection of the error to the Push Initiator and the message should not be sent to the client. Otherwise, the notification MUST be sent after the message delivery process has been completed. The delivery process is considered completed when the message is no longer a candidate for delivery, e.g. the message has expired. If the push submission is indicated as rejected in step two in figure 3, then no result notification will be sent. The Push Initiator MUST have provided a return address (e.g. URL) during the push operation for this notification to be possible. =Push Cancellation= The purpose of the Push Cancellation is to allow the Push Initiator to attempt to cancel a previously submitted push message. The Push Initiator initiates this operation. The PPG responds with an indication of whether the request was successful or not. =Status Query= The status query operation allows the Push Initiator to request the current status of a message that has been previously submitted. If status is requested for a message which is addressed to multiple recipients, the PPG MUST send back a single response containing status query results for each of the recipients. =Client Capabilities Query= This operation allows the Push Initiator to query the PPG for the capabilities of a specific device. The response is a multipart/related document containing the ccq-response (section 9.11) element in an XML document and, in the second entity, the actual client capabilities information in RDF [RDF] as defined in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The PPG MAY add to the capabilities reported if the PPG is willing to perform transformations to the formats supported by the client. For example, if a client has JPG support but not GIF and a PPG is willing to convert GIF files to JPG, then the PPG may report that the client can support JPG and GIF files. The capabilities reported may be the combined PPG and client capabilities and they may have been derived from session capabilities or retrieved from a CC/PP server. Capabilities may also be derived using implementation dependent means. Addressing There are three addresses to be considered by the Push Initiator: the push proxy gateway address, the wireless device address, and the result notification address. The push proxy gateway address must be known by the Push Initiator. This address is needed at the layer below the push access protocol. The push proxy gateway is addressed using a unique address that depends on the underlying protocol. For example, when the underlying protocol is HTTP, a URL [RFC1738] is used. The device addressing information is included as part of the message content (XML tagged content). Any character allowed in an RFC822 address may appear in the device address field. In addition, a “notify-requested-to” address may be provided by the Push Initiator when required so that the push proxy gateway can later respond to the Push Initiator with result notification. =Multiple Recipient Addressing= There are scenarios in which a Push Initiator may want to send identical messages to multiple recipients. Rather than submitting multiple identical push messages, one to each recipient, the Push Initiator may submit a single push message addressed to multiple recipients. This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations on multiple recipients. When the PPG returns the push-response message, after a push submission to multiple recipients, the response corresponds to the message, regardless of the number of recipients specified in the push submission (there is one response for each push submission). When a Push Initiator requests status (section 9.8) with multiple addresses specified, the PPG MUST reply with a single statusquery-response (section 9.9) containing the individual statuses. The same is true when only a push-id is specified (no address specified) in the query for status of a multiple recipient message. Result notifications (section 9.6) MUST be sent by the PPG for each individual recipient, if result notification is requested by the Push Initiator during the submission of a message to multiple recipients. In cases where a message is sent to multiple recipients and later a cancel is requested by the initiator, the PPG MAY send back individual responses related to each of the multiple recipients or it MAY send responses related to many or all of the recipients. Support of multiple addresses is OPTIONAL in a PPG. =Multicast/Broadcast Addresses= There are scenarios in which a single address submitted by a PI may be expanded by a PPG into multiple addresses for delivery. In addition, a single address transmitted on a wireless network may be received by multiple devices (e.g. broadcast). This type of service is expected for the distribution of information of interest to a broad population (e.g. news, weather, and traffic). This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations involving multicast and broadcast addresses. Since the address expansion is done in the PPG or in the wireless network, the behaviour between the PI and the PPG is identical to behaviour as if the address were not expanded. The response contains the individual address as submitted by the PI. Message Format The push access protocol is independent of the transport used. PAP messages carry control information, and in the case of a push submission, also content and optionally client capabilities information. Control information includes command/response messages between the PPG and the Push Initiator, and parameters passed to the PPG for use in sending content to the wireless device. Examples of this type of information include the wireless device address, the delivery priority of the message, etc. This information is not normally delivered to the wireless device. Content is information that is intended for the wireless device. This information might be intelligible only to the wireless device (e.g. may be encrypted by the Push Initiator or may be application data for an application unknown to the PPG) or it may be recognisable by the PPG (e.g. HTML or WML). The PPG may be configured to perform some transformation on recognisable content (e.g. HTML to WML) for certain wireless devices. The other category of information is client capability information as specified in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. When more than control is carried in a message, the format of the message is a MIME multipart/related [RFC2387] compound object. When only control information (e.g. for message responses) is carried in a message, the format of the message is a simple application/xml entity. All information is transported within a single message body. In the multipart messages, the first entity contains all push related control information in an XML document, the second entity contains the content for the wireless device, the third entity, if present, contains UAPROF client capabilities. The format of the content entity is specified in [PushMsg]. =Control Entity Format= The control entity is a MIME body part which holds an XML document containing one pap element as defined in section 9.1. The control entity MUST be included in every PAP request and response. The control entity MUST be the first entity in the MIME multipart/related message. =Content Entity Format= The content entity is a MIME body part containing the content to be sent to the wireless device. The content type is not defined by the PAP, but can be any type as long as it is described by MIME. The content entity is included only in the push submission and is not included in any other operation request or response. The content entity MUST be the second entity in the MIME multipart/related message. =Capabilities Entity Format= The capabilities entity is a MIME body part containing the Push Initiator's assumed subset of the capabilities of the wireless device/user agent. The capabilities format is specified in the User Agent Profile [UAPROF]. The capabilities entity, if present, MUST be the third entity in the Push Submission MIME multipart/related message and MUST be the second entity in a Client Capabilities Query response.

The term Craft production refers to a manufacturing technique applied in the hobbies of handicraft but was also the common method of manufacture in the pre-industrialized world, such as in the production of pottery.  Craft economy  In the craft manufacturing process, the final product is unique. While the product may be of extremely high quality, the uniqueness can be detrimental as seen in the case of early automobiles. Womack, Jones and Roos in the book The Machine That Changed the World detailed that early automobiles were craft produced. Because each vehicle was unique, replacement parts had to be manufactured from scratch or at least customized to fit a specific vehicle. The advent of Mass production and the standardized, interchangeable parts guaranteed a parts' compatibility with a variety of vehicle models. Mass production has many drawbacks to craft production, including that production quality can be lower than a craft-produced item. For example, in some mass- production automobile manufacturing facilities, craftsmen rework flawed, mass- produced vehicles to give the appearance of a quality product. Lean manufacturing aims to bring back or exceed the quality of craft production and remedy the inefficiency of mass production through the elimination of waste. = Craft production at the community scale = Craft production is a part of the informal economy in many cities, such as Istanbul, Turkey where the informal craft economy is a vital source of income for the Turkish craftspeople. Craft markets are highly dependent on social interactions, and verbal training which results in variations in the goods produced. Often, the craft economy consists of craft neighbourhoods, by which a community is structured on the craft activity present in the area. Often used in the household, many craft goods such as historic Mumun Pottery in Korea, originated from the need for economic alternatives to meet household needs. Changes in the craft economies have often coincided with changes in household organization, and social transformations, as in Korea in the Early to Middle Mumun Period. Given that craft production requires an intimate knowledge of methods of production from an experienced individual of that craft, the connection between trades people is highly evident in craft communities. The production of many crafts have a high technical demand, and therefore require full-time specialization of the skill-set in the form of workshops, or verbal, hands-on training. The verbal interaction between teacher and student encourages strong social bonds, which ultimately leads to cohesive communities, typical of modern day craft communities. = Craft economies and location = Craft economies are highly related to place. Craft-specialization explores how portable goods are integral to the social relations of a community, and links groups of people together through the creation of tangible items. Places where craft economic activity is taking place indicate strong linkages between sociopolitical organization and societal complexity. These communities are often tight-knit, with strong linkages to materials produced and sold, as well as mutual respect for fellow tradesmen in the market place.

He served as bishop of the Diocese of Davenport from 1927–1944 and as coadjutor archbishop and archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque from 1944–1954. Early life and ministry Rohlman was born in Appelhuelsen, Westphalia (present day Germany), to Bernard and Bernadine (Hussman) Rohlman. When he was two years old his family immigrated to the United States and settled in Carroll County, Iowa. They moved to Arkansas where both of his parents died. Henry was moved to Nebraska where he finished elementary school and worked on a farm. Through the generosity of people from Carroll County he studied in the high school department at St. Lawrence Seminary, Mount Calvary, Wisconsin, and graduated from Columbia College, now Loras College, in Dubuque. He studied for the priesthood at the Grand séminaire de Montréal and was ordained a priest by Archbishop Paul Bruchesi in Montreal for the Archdiocese of Dubuque on December 21, 1901. Rohlman engaged in pastoral work in Dubuque before attending The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., with a view to becoming a missionary. When he returned to Dubuque he was assigned to the Apostolate, which preached parish missions in the archdiocese as well as in the other dioceses in Iowa. He became pastor at St. Mary's Church in Waterloo before serving as business manager at Columbia College. In the early 1920s, Rohlman was asked to form Nativity parish in Dubuque. Bishop of Davenport On May 20, 1927, Pope Pius XI named Rohlman the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Davenport. Rohlman was consecrated by Archbishop James Keane of Dubuque in St. Raphael's Cathedral on July 25, 1927. He was installed the next day as Bishop of Davenport in Sacred Heart Cathedral. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Edmond Heelan of Sioux City and Thomas Drumm of Des Moines.Archbishop Henry Patrick Rohlman www.catholic-hierarchy.org In 1928 Bishop Rohlman commissioned a study to assess the social problems in the diocese. The result of this study was the establishment of Catholic Charities in 1929. He named the Rev. Martin Cone as its first director. Its immediate focus was the welfare of the children at St. Vincent's Home in Davenport. Marycrest College was founded in Davenport when Rohlman was the diocesan bishop. Two colleges for women were started in the diocese during Bishop Rohlman's episcopate. The Sisters of St. Francis in Clinton established Mt. St. Clare College (later Ashford University) in 1928. It was an extension of their academy, which had been established in the 1890s. St. Ambrose College started a woman's division in 1934 and continued to support it as it searched for a religious order of women to take it over. In 1937 property was secured for a woman's college in Davenport on the west side of the city. The Congregation of the Humility of Mary at Rohlman's urging established Marycrest College in 1939 from the woman's division of St. Ambrose. The diocese celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 1931. The next year Bishop Rohlman convoked the diocese's third synod. The synod was called to bring the diocese's regulations in line with the Code of Canon Law which had been promulgated in 1917. It also set the salary for pastors at $1,000 per year, plus household expenses, and associate pastors and chaplain's salaries were set at $500. Catholic Charities had set up their offices in the Kahl Building. They were joined in 1932 with the chancery and the newly established superintendent of schools. All of these offices and the bishop's office moved into a property on Church Square behind St. Anthony's Church downtown. It was renamed the Cosgrove Building after Davenport's second bishop, Henry Cosgrove. Rohlman had the difficult task of leading the diocese through the Great Depression and World War II. The Catholic Messenger, an independent Catholic newspaper published in Davenport, was experiencing financial problems during the Depression and was purchased by the diocese for use as a diocesan newspaper in 1937. A national edition to the paper was still published in addition to a diocesan edition for a couple decades after its purchase. The Messenger moved its offices into the Cosgrove Building, until they moved across the street into the Democrat Building. Until Bishop Rohlman came to the diocese only five priests had been recognized for their contributions to the church by being given a papal honor, all of them from Bishop Davis. Rohlman named monsignors every two years. By the time he returned to Dubuque, twenty-four priests had been honored and five were recognized twice. Bishop Rohlman served as Bishop of Davenport for 17 years until September 8, 1944, when he was named to Dubuque. Archbishop of Dubuque During the early 1940s, Archbishop Francis Beckman of Dubuque had involved the archdiocese in a dubious financial scheme. Beckman had been talked into investing borrowed money in gold mines with the idea that the profits could be used to further an art collection he had established at Columbia College. However, the scheme was soon revealed to be a fraud, and the man behind the scheme was arrested. Because Beckman had signed loans in the archdiocese's name, it led to financial difficulties for the archdiocese when the holders of the notes began demanding repayment. Because of the financial problems surrounding Beckman, Bishop Rohlman was transferred to Dubuque by Pope Pius XII and named Titular Archbishop of Macra and Coadjutor Archbishop of Dubuque. It was made clear to Beckman that while he retained the title \\"Archbishop of Dubuque\\", Rohlman was now the leader of the archdiocese. On November 11, 1946, Archbishop Beckman retired from office and left Dubuque. Rohlman automatically became the seventh bishop and fifth archbishop of Dubuque. While Rohlman was archbishop, Christ the King Chapel was constructed at Loras College, St. Mary's Home for Children was built in Dubuque, and the number of priests in the archdiocese rose from 290 to 345. Rohlman, along with the other bishops in Iowa, re-established Mt. St Bernard's Seminary for the education of new priests in the province. A new $2.5 million building was constructed to house the seminary in Dubuque. On August 10, 1945, the Diocese of Omaha was elevated to an archdiocese. At that time the Province of Dubuque was reduced in size to the four dioceses in the state of Iowa. On August 3, 1946, Pope Pius XII appointed a Dubuque priest, Edward Fitzgerald, as the first auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese. He assisted Rohlman until he was appointed Bishop of Winona on October 20, 1949.Bishop Edward Aloysius Fitzgerald www.catholic-hierarchy.org Later life and death In 1949, Rohlman requested a coadjutor archbishop. Bishop Leo Binz of Winona was transferred to Dubuque, and Rohlman continued to serve as archbishop until his resignation was accepted by Pope Pius XII on December 2, 1954. He was named the Titular Archbishop of Cotrada and Archbishop Emeritus. Rohlman is buried in the mortuary chapel at St. Raphael's Cathedral. Legacy There are two residence halls named Rohlman Hall after the Archbishop, one at Loras College in Dubuque and one at St. Ambrose University in Davenport. The former Marycrest College in Davenport also named a building in his honor.

She often goes by the nickname Yaiko. Her musical style is often called \\"heart rock\\" by her fans. Yaida is an established musical artist in Japan and has also had minor club hits in the United Kingdom. Career = 2000 = Yaida first became well known when her first single (\\"Howling\\" which included the track \\"How?\\") was released in 2000 on Aozora records, an independent label pre-dominantly distributing to the Kansai area of Osaka only, and reportedly sold in excess of 10,000 copies. Widespread airplay on Osaka's local radio stations and word-of-mouth resulted in both Yaida and Aozora records becoming the focus of a bidding war between the larger record companies for both recording and distribution contracts, the final Japanese distributing rights being sold to Toshiba-EMI with Aozora retaining artist control and independent label status. \\"B'coz I Love You\\" was the first single released under contract, entering the Japanese charts at number 16 in July. Through the association with Toshiba-EMI, live appearances in the UK (both London and Manchester) followed in September. This initial British exposure culminated in the release of the UK Single \\"I Like 2\\" under her nickname Yaiko on F2Records, which created the impetus for a UK fan-base to grow. Her second Toshiba-EMI single, \\"My Sweet Darlin'\\", released in October entered the charts at number 9 quickly followed by her first album (daiya-monde) which went straight to Number 1 in the Oricon album charts. During this time she was still attending Kansai University, reading French language and literature. Yaida took a short sabbatical from her musical career to prepare her thesis for submission in the latter part of the year. = 2001 = The second UK Single, \\"Darling Darling\\", was released on January 1, 2000, at a special live appearance in London. Building on the success of \\"I Like 2\\", this release again featured remixes of her Japanese tracks with English lyrics to appeal to the UK club market. Between the period January 15 – February 20 she was hospitalised because of exhaustion. During which, \\"I'm Here Saying Nothing\\" was released in Japan (entering at number 4) and \\"Darling Darling\\" reached number 1 in the UK club chart. She graduated from Kansai University with a degree in French language and literature on March 19, starting her first official Japanese tour on the 21st (the seven date 'I'm Here...' tour) followed immediately by live appearances in Liverpool, Manchester, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London.

Credit card companies included universal default language in their cardholder agreements at that time, due to increasing deregulation of the industry. Today, approximately half of the banks that issue credit cards have universal default language. However, since the inception of these provisions, most credit card companies have not enforced them regularly or systematically. Every year since at least 2003, Congress has considered several bills to curb abusive credit card practices, including universal default provisions. In the meantime, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a stern advisory letter to the credit card industry regarding several of the most egregious practices. Most credit card companies have not responded to the letter. In 2007, Citibank became the first bank to voluntarily eliminate its universal default provision. In 2009, most forms of the practice were outlawed in the United States. Background Under the theory and practice of risk- based pricing, the interest rate of the loan should reflect the risk of the borrower to avoid subsidizing those who default at the expense of those who always pay on time (or alternatively, to allow loans to be given to a broader range of customers, with a broad range of credit history). Usually, if an interest rate is to be risk-based, the risk premium (or amount charged extra for the risk) is set at the time of an account opening. However, this does not take into consideration that the risk of a borrower defaulting may change later (and in fact the risk might be less). Thus, while lenders have increased credit limits and lowered rates to borrowers in good standing, reflecting the decreased perception of risk, recently lenders have begun to raise rates to those it later has found have defaulted with other lenders. This practice generally only happens on credit cards, which are one of the only forms of consumer credit to have an adjustable interest rate not simply based on an interest rate index but on the perceived risk of the customer (both positive and negative). Instead of a specific increase in the risk premium charge, credit cards often change their interest rate to what is known as the default rate. This rate is usually the highest rate charged by the card, an average of 27.8%. In addition this is charged in a first in, last out FILO basis. Normally the default rate is charged when a customer fails to make a payment on a particular lender's credit card, but with universal default, the lender will charge the rate if the customer defaults elsewhere. Criticisms The concept of universal default is criticized for many reasons. #Those who disagree with the entire concept of risk-based pricing disagree necessarily with an application of that concept. #The concept of one lender charging a higher price when their customer defaults with another lender has been compared to having a cartel, or price fixing structure. #It is thought that when a customer in dire financial straits defaults with one lender, the concept of universal default, and the subsequent interest rate increases, can create a vicious cycle which can cause the customer to default everywhere. #There is the possibility that the credit product which was shown as being in default in the first place was in default due to fraud or institutional error. If this is the case, while the customer has full legal rights to have the error corrected on his credit report, any lender who instituted the universal default rate is under no obligation to return to the normal rate. #The increased rate is seen by some to be too high even reflecting the risk. #Nature of the rate structure means that the customer usually must fully pay off their credit card before receiving the normal rate again. Support Supporters of the concept argue that lenders should use all available information at all times in order to avoid adverse selection. These supporters argue that the continuing practice of charging higher prices reflective of risk will allow lenders to charge lower prices reflective of non-risk, or, to extend credit to those previously thought to be too risky in the past, giving benefits to those potential borrowers. These supporters argue that the increased rates reflect the risk and are not price gouging, as proven by the steady or diminishing profit margins of the credit card business. Still others, while admitting that the increased default rate more than compensates for the risk, argue that competitive pressure makes that so (i.e. because lenders who do charge the default rate can possibly offer lower normal rates, while lenders who do not would seemingly have to try and advertise that the lack of a default rate is a competitive advantage (opening them up to adverse selection), or adopt the practice themselves. Ban on forms of universal default The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 prohibited the practice of retroactively raising any annual percentage rate, fees, or finance charges for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with their account. One of the intentions of this law was to shield customers from arbitrary rate increases if they have been on time with their account. However, this law did not prohibit all forms of universal default. Credit card companies have begun the practice of canceling altogether the accounts of customers who are delinquent or in default with other credit agencies even if the customer is still in good standing with the credit card company.The Ban on Universal Default Creditslips.org.

It was founded as the Academy of Advertising Art by Richard S. Stephens in 1929. It has 283 full-time teachers and 1154 part-time teaching staff, and about 11,000 students; it claims to be the largest privately owned art and design school in the United States. The school has open admissions and an admission acceptance rate of 100%. In 2016, its accreditor expressed concern over low graduation rates; approximately 7% of students then completed a four-year degree within the allotted time.Academy of Art University. US News and World Report. Archived 28 August 2016. As of 2015, the school had not published job placement rates since 2006, and was disagreeing with the US Department of Education over whether it is required to do so. The school is one of the largest property owners in San Francisco, with the main campus located on New Montgomery Street in the South of Market district.  History  It was founded in 1929 as a school for advertising art. The founder, Richard S. Stephens, a painter and magazine editor, led it until 1951 when his son Richard A. Stephens took over, who 1992 was replaced by his daughter Elisa Stephens. Under her presidency, student numbers increased from around 2000 to 18,000 by 2011, but have since fallen to under 12,000. Forbes estimated the Stephens' family wealth at $800 million in 2015. The school has been participating in the NY Fashion Week event bi-annually since 2005. The university owns and operates the Academy of Art University Automobile Museum with 200 vintage cars, a collection that started in the 1990s. = Lawsuits =  Housing  Starting in 2007, the San Francisco city planning commission held more than twenty hearings relating to possible violations of city land-use laws, including the unauthorized conversion of rent-controlled housing to academic use; in May 2016, the city brought a lawsuit against the school. In December 2016, an agreement was reached whereby the Academy agreed to pay the city $20 million in fees, $7 million of which were to go to purchasing low-income housing. The school was also to provide additional low-income housing for seniors as part of the deal. The University failed to meet the terms of the 2016 agreement and in January 2020 the agreement was amended, requiring the Academy of Art University to pay $37.6 million to the city to build affordable housing.https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID;=7986178&GUID;=CE545264-55F8-4A18-9D34-050E60838398 The Academy of Art and the City of San Francisco settled a $60 million case due to the Academy of Art and various related Stephens' family LLC's acquisition and use of real estate in San Francisco. The Academy of Art converted 33 of its 40 buildings from residential use to private use which in San Francisco must be approved to avoid furthering the housing crisis in the region.  Student enrollment fraud  In 2009, four former admission officers alleged that the Academy of Art had compensated them based on how many students they could enroll. The Department of Education bans such incentives, and during the Obama Administration a memo was issued to recoup funds from schools that used these illegal recruitment techniques. The Academy of Art requires no portfolio and has a 100% acceptance rate for admissions. With low recruiting thresholds, the school took in over $1.5 billion dollars in Federal aid to be repaid by students since 2006. The former employees eventually became whistleblowers in a Federal Case, suing the school in U.S. District Court in Oakland in 2009. As of January 2018, it was fighting a 2009 lawsuit alleging that it defrauded the federal government of student aid through illegal recruitment practices.  Accreditation and teaching  The school offers associate, bachelor'sAcademy of Art University. Peterson's. Accessed January 2014. and master's degreesHome: Graduate Schools: Academy of Art University. Peterson's. Accessed January 2014. in about twenty-five subjects. Some courses are offered online. Academy of Art University received regional accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in 2007. The WASC does not require schools to disclose job placement figures. The school is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. In interior architecture and design, the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (taught or online) and Master of Fine Arts degree are accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation. The Master of Architecture degree has, since January 1, 2006, been accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board while the Bachelor of Architecture program was granted as of January 1, 2015. In 2016, approximately 7% of students completed a four-year degree within the allotted time. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 31% of students complete a four-year degree within 150% of that time (the \\"6-year graduation rate\\"). For online-only students, the 6-year graduation rate is much lower, at 6%; in mid-2015, about 35% of all students were online-only. For part-time students the 6-year graduation rate is 3%. About 58% of students are female. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics in 2019, the school's graduation rate for \\"full-time, first-time\\" students was 45%. Athletics The school sports teams, the Urban Knights, compete as members of the Pacific West Conference in 14 sports in NCAA Division II. In the 2014-2015 season, the men's cross country team had a second-place finish and the women's team had a record fourth-place finish, earned at the Pacific West Conference Championships. Valentin Pepiot, their third NCAA Nationals individual qualifier, was one of the top finishers from the PacWest in the postseason finale. Academy of Art earned a record 10 PacWest postseason honors. For the 2015, indoor and outdoor track and field seasons, they had seven All-Americans honors and one NCAA individual champion in Jordan Edwards.

He is a Hewlett-Packard Senior Fellow (Emeritus).Hewlett-Packard Senior Fellow Biography. Biography Fisher holds a BA (1968) in mathematics (with honors) from New York University and obtained a Master's and PhD degree (1979) in Computer Science from The Courant Institute of Mathematics of New York University. Fisher joined the Yale University Department of Computer Science in 1979 as an assistant professor, and was promoted to associate professor in 1983. In 1984 Fisher left Yale to found Multiflow Computer with Yale colleagues John O'Donnell and John Ruttenberg. Fisher joined HP Labs upon the closing of Multiflow in 1990. He directed HP Labs in Cambridge, MA USA from its founding in 1994, and became an HP Fellow (2000) and then Senior Fellow (2002) upon the inception of those titles at Hewlett-Packard. Fisher retired from HP Labs in 2006. Fisher is married (1967) to Elizabeth Fisher; they have a son, David Fisher, and a daughter, Dora Fisher.http://www.MultiflowTheBook.com Multiflow Computer: A Startup Odyssey. He holds Spanish citizenship due to his Sephardic heritage.  Work  =Trace Scheduling= In his Ph.D. dissertation, Fisher created the Trace Scheduling compiler algorithm and coined the term Instruction-level parallelism to characterize VLIW, superscalar, dataflow and other architecture styles that involve fine-grained parallelism among simple machine-level instructions. Trace scheduling was the first practical algorithm to find large amounts of parallelism between instructions that occupied different basic blocks. This greatly increased the potential speed-up for instruction-level parallel architectures. =The VLIW architecture style= Because of the difficulty of applying trace scheduling to idiosyncratic systems (such as 1970s-era DSPs) that in theory should have been suitable targets for a trace scheduling compiler, Fisher put forward the VLIW architectural style. VLIWs are normal computers, designed to run compiled code and used like ordinary computers, but offering large amounts of instruction-level parallelism scheduled by a trace scheduling or similar compiler. VLIWs are now used extensively, especially in embedded systems. The most popular VLIW cores have sold in quantities of several billion processors. The Hexagon VLIW The Hexagon is a 4-issue VLIW.

The ST231. The ST231 is rumored to have been sold in quantities upwards of 1 billion cores, used mostly in digital video. =Multiflow Computer= Multiflow was founded to commercialize trace scheduling and VLIW architectures, then widely thought to be impractical. Multiflow's technical success and the dissemination of its technology and people had a great effect on the future of computer science and the computer industry.

It is situated at the Eider River, c. 10 km southwest of Kiel. The meaning of the name is controversial, but one possibility is the combination of flint(stone) with the word bek (beck, brook). Flintbek is the seat of the Amt (\\"collective municipality\\") Flintbek. Possible early evidence of wheeled transport has been found in conserved track trails in Flintbek dated ca. 3,600 BC. Places of interest The Lutheran Church dates back to at least 1223, when Earl Albrecht of Orlamünde, Governor of the Danish King, gave permission to the Monastery of St. Augustine to build a church in Flintbek. The present building is late gothic with an impressive wooden tower and steeple. The interior has a carved wooden \\"Schnitzaltar\\". In the church cemetery is a 1952 sculpture by Friedrich Wilhelm Klose, Mutter des Ostens (Mother of the East). She represents the suffering and misfortunes of those driven from their homes due to war. The inscription reads: „Ich will euch trösten, wie einen seine Mutter tröstet. Jes. 66,13.

He ruled under Trujillo during the end of the Third Republic, and later served the Duvalier dynasty in Haiti. Rise to power Abbes was born in 1924 in Santo Domingo, the son of a German American accountant and a Dominican woman. As a young man he was interested in sports, and one of his first jobs was as a sports reporter. In the mid-fifties, he moved to Mexico, where he worked as an official in the Dominican embassy. He started to gather information on anti-Trujillo dissidents and relayed this information to the island. Abbes also studied the technical aspects of spying and intelligence gathering. In 1956 he returned to the Dominican Republic and, after Trujillo's half-brother Nene introduced him to the dictator, quickly rose to power. Head of SIM In 1958 he became the head of the newly created Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM) and the chief planner of assassinations of the regime's adversaries abroad. SIM employed thousands of people and was involved in immigration, passports, censorship, supervision of aliens, and undercover work, including foreign operations. Thus he was instrumental in the two attempts to kill Venezuela's then-president Rómulo Betancourt; first there was an attack on Betancourt in the streets of Havana to inject him with poison, later a car bomb blew up his Cadillac in Caracas, killing the driver and a bystander, while Betancourt survived. After Trujillo After Trujillo's assassination in May 1961, Abbes moved quickly to hunt down the assassins. Trujillo's son, Ramfis Trujillo, returned from Paris, supposedly with the help of Abbes, and attempted to step into the place of his father, but his attempt ultimately failed, and he left the country, together with most members of the Trujillo family, later that year. Following the Trujillos' departure, President Joaquín Balaguer appointed Abbes consul to Japan, but Abbes soon left the post and spent several years in Europe. He returned to the Caribbean in 1966, moving to Haiti, where he worked for then-President François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier as a security advisor. Abbes disappeared in June 1967. According to journalist Bernard Diedrich, Abbes and his wife had come under suspicion for plotting against Duvalier, but the reasons for his disappearance, and those responsible, remain unknown. Mario Vargas Llosa's historical novels The Feast of the Goat, about Trujillo's Dominican Republican, and Fierce Times, about Arbenz's Guatemala, devote much space to Abbes.

Villa WinterGustav Winter worked since 1915 for Spain and was active in different projects in Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria. The villa is built in a remote part of the island with only a dust track leading to it. The history of the villa is the subject of several conspiracy theories, often involving Nazis. The main conspiracy theories surround the fact that the villa had a tower turret with an electric lantern installed, similar to a lighthouse and that they were using the villa's makeshift lighthouse to signal German U-boats. Villa Winter is featured on an episode of Secret Nazi Bases, a TV documentary on UK channel Yesterday where tunnels and rooms under the house built with walls as thick as those of a bunker are explored.

His style of comedy is often political and involves issues of race, culture, criminal justice, and social class. He is best known as the host of the Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia which produced four seasons before being cancelled in 2008. Around this time, Mencia received several accusations of plagiarism and joke-stealing in his stand-up routines. Early life Mencía was born in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, the seventeenth of eighteen children. His mother, Magdelena Mencía, was Mexican, and his father, Roberto Holness, was Honduran. At the time of his birth, Mencía's mother was engaged in a domestic dispute with his father, and declined to give her son his biological father's last name. The name appearing on his birth certificate is \\"Ned Arnel Mencía,\\" although Mencia has said that out of respect for his biological father, he went by the Holness name anyway, and was known as \\"Ned Holness\\" until he was eighteen years old. Mencia was raised Roman Catholic in East Los Angeles, California, by his aunt Consuelo and uncle Pablo Mencia. By his own admission, staying out of trouble was difficult while growing up, but with the help of his family, he excelled in school and stayed out of gangs. He attended Garfield High School in Los Angeles County.Rivera, Carla. \\"East L.A.'s loss is personal.\\" Los Angeles Times. May 22, 2007. p. 1. Retrieved on March 29, 2014. \\"Its alumni include an array of politicians, actors, comedians, musicians, artists and sports figures, including comic Carlos Mencia and boxer Oscar De La Hoya.\\" Mencia dealt drugs when he was 19 years old and burglarized a house. He majored in electrical engineering at California State University, Los Angeles, but left early to pursue a career in comedy after a successful performance at an open mic night at The Laugh Factory. He has an older brother named Joseph Mencia who often appeared on Mind of Mencia. Career Mencia prior to a live concert at a U.S. Army camp in the Persian Gulf Region. In 1988, Mitzi Shore, owner of The Comedy Store, suggested that Mencia change his first name from \\"Ned\\" to \\"Carlos\\" in order to appeal to the Mexican audiences. Mencia performed at venerated LA stand-up venues such as The Comedy Store and The L.A. Cabaret. His success in these venues led to appearances on The Arsenio Hall Show and Buscando Estrellas, where he attained the title \\"International Comedy Grand Champion.\\" Then, in 1994, Mencia was chosen to host HBO's latino comedy showcase Loco Slam. Mencia followed up Loco Slam by hosting Funny is Funny! on Galavision in 1998. He would continue to do stand-up, including a very successful tour in 2001 with Freddy Soto and Pablo Francisco, \\"The Three Amigos.\\" Mencia also did two half- hour specials on HBO, the second of which won him a CableACE Award for Best Stand-Up Comedy Special. After the release of his first comedy album by Warner Records, Take A Joke America, Mencia performed his break-out performance on Comedy Central Presents in 2002. By the time his career began to take off in the early 2000s, Mencia was also working as an actor doing guest appearances in the television shows Moesha and The Shield, and starring in the film Outta Time and the animated show The Proud Family. In 2002, he performed on \\"Comedy Central Presents.\\" In March 2005, Comedy Central announced Mencia's own half- hour comedy show, Mind of Mencia. The show mixed Mencia's stand up comedy with sketch comedy, much like Dave Chappelle's Chappelle's Show. The show achieved moderate success in its first season and was brought back for a second season in the spring of 2006, becoming Comedy Central's second highest-rated program behind South Park. It was brought back for a third season that summer before being cancelled in 2008. Mind of Mencia was produced by Nedlos, a portmanteau of Mencia's birth name and the name he took prior to naturalizing in the US. Mencia was sometimes a guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio. He took part in the first Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour in 2006. Mencia starred in a Super Bowl XLI commercial for Bud Light. In November 2009, Mencia began appearing in commercials for a weight-loss product called Belly Burner, which he has claimed to have used personally. Mencia went on a 2011 stand-up comedy tour, including dates at the Improv in Schaumburg, Illinois, on June 24 and 25, and ending in Las Vegas at Treasure Island on Friday, September 16, 2011.

On February 10, 2007, Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard and accused him of plagiarism. Rogan posted a video of the altercation, along with audio and video clips from other comedians including George Lopez, Bob Levy, Bobby Lee, and Ari Shaffir, among others. Rogan has also posted audio and video clips of Mencia's interviews and joke routines comparing Mencia's routines to those of other comedians on his blog. Comedian George Lopez also accused Mencia of plagiarizing his material. In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Lopez accused Mencia of plagiarizing 13 minutes of his material in Mencia's HBO special. He also claimed he had a physical altercation with Mencia over the alleged plagiarism. The only joke that Lopez has publicly specified was stolen and used on Mencia's HBO special was a Taco Bell joke. Comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim, stating that the joke he performed on radio in 1988 was later taken and used without permission by Lopez, the radio station's resident comic. Sarnowski claims to have given Mencia permission to use the joke. Mencia has also been accused of stealing a routine from Bill Cosby. In his special, No Strings Attached, Mencia performs a bit about a father who spends years training his son for a career as a football player, only to see the son say \\"I love you, Mom!\\" at his moment of televised victory. Cosby performed a similar bit in his concert film Bill Cosby: Himself and wrote briefly on the subject in his book Fatherhood. Mencia told the Los Angeles Times that he had never seen the film but regretted the similarities between his and Cosby's jokes. Mencia addressed the issue of plagiarism in two hour- long interviews with comic Marc Maron on his podcast, WTF with Marc Maron, in May 2010. In 2011, Mencia stated in an interview that he had been in therapy due to accusations of plagiarism. =Hurricane Katrina remarks= In February 2009, Mencia was dropped from the Krewe of Orpheus' celebrity lineup for New Orleans Mardi Gras, citing inappropriate comments he made in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Mencia remarked during his stand up: \\"I'm glad Hurricane Katrina happened. It taught us an important lesson: black people can't swim.\\" Personal life Mencia lives with his wife, Amy, whom he married in 2003, in Los Angeles, California.

After the war, graduated in law, he changed his life and studied sculpture with Antoine Bourdelle and architecture with Auguste Perret. In 1927, his pacific monument of Ouveillan (a Monumental Modern church in the South of France) was well received. During his first solo exhibition, at the art dealer Léopold Zborowski in 1931, two sculptures were acquired by the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris (now in the Centre Georges Pompidou) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.*Robert Maillard, Dictionary of Modern Sculpture, 1962.

Iché's work is close to surrealism and like the sculptors Alberto Giacometti and Germaine Richier inherits an aesthetic born from the workshop of Antoine Bourdelle. Film Jean-Pierre Melville's film Army of Shadows (L'Armée des ombres, 1969) is based, like the novel of Joseph Kessel, on the Resistance network to which Iché belonged, Cohors-Asturies. The character of Luc Jardie (Paul Meurisse) is inspired by Iché. See also *Art manifesto References *Bibliographic Guide to Art and Architecture, 1978. G.K. Hall.

This white solid is the principal precursor for the manufacture of beryllium metal. Its structure resembles that of quartz, but BeF2 is highly soluble in water. Properties Beryllium fluoride has unique optical properties. In the form of fluoroberyllate glass it has the lowest refractive index for a solid at room temperature of 1.275. It dispersive power is the lowest for a solid at 0.0093, and the non linear coefficient is also the lowest at 2 × 10−14. Structure and bonding Structure of gaseous BeF2. The structure of solid BeF2 resembles that of cristobalite. Be2+ centers are four coordinate and tetrahedral and the fluoride centers are two-coordinate.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications The Be-F bond lengths are about 1.54 Å.Pallavi Ghalsasi, Prasanna S. Ghalsasi, \\"Single Crystal X-Ray Structure of BeF2: α-Quartz\\" Inorg. Chem., 2011, 50 (1), pp 86–89. Analogous to SiO2, BeF2 can also adopt a number of related structures. An analogy also exists between BeF2 and AlF3: both adopt extended structures at mild temperature. =Gas and liquid BeF2= Gaseous beryllium fluoride adopts a linear structure, with a Be-F distance of 143 pm. BeF2 reaches a vapor pressure of 10 Pa at 686 °C, 100 Pa at 767 °C, 1 kPa at 869 °C, 10 kPa at 999 °C, and 100 kPa at 1172 °C.Vapor pressure, physics.nyu.edu, p. 6-63, from Ohe, S. (1976) Computer Aided Data Book of Vapor Pressure, Data Book Publishing Co., Tokyo. 'Molecules' of liquid beryllium fluoride have a fluctuating tetrahedral structure. Additionally, the density of liquid BeF2 decreases near its freezing point, as Be2+ and F− ions begin to coordinate more strongly with one another, leading to the expansion of voids between formula units. Production The processing of beryllium ores generates impure Be(OH)2. This material reacts with ammonium bifluoride to give ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate: :Be(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 (NH4)HF2 → (NH4)2BeF4 \\\\+ 2 H2O Tetrafluoroberyllate is a robust ion, which allows its purification by precipitation of various impurities as their hydroxides. Heating purified (NH4)2BeF4 gives the desired product: :(NH4)2BeF4 → 2 NH3 \\\\+ 2 HF + BeF2 In general the reactivity of BeF2 ions with fluoride are quite analogous to the reactions of SiO2 with oxides. Applications Reduction of BeF2 at 1300 °C with magnesium in a graphite crucible provides the most practical route to metallic beryllium:Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . :BeF2 \\\\+ Mg -> Be + MgF2 The chloride is not a useful precursor because of its volatility. =Niche uses= Beryllium fluoride is used in biochemistry, particularly protein crystallography as a mimic of phosphate. Thus, ADP and beryllium fluoride together tend to bind to ATP sites and inhibit protein action, making it possible to crystallise proteins in the bound state. Beryllium fluoride forms a basic constituent of the preferred fluoride salt mixture used in liquid-fluoride nuclear reactors. Typically beryllium fluoride is mixed with lithium fluoride to form a base solvent (FLiBe), into which fluorides of uranium and thorium are introduced. Beryllium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF/BeF2 mixtures (FLiBe) have low melting points (360 °C - 459 °C) and the best neutronic properties of fluoride salt combinations appropriate for reactor use. MSRE used two different mixtures in the two cooling circuits. Safety Beryllium compounds are highly toxic. The increased toxicity of beryllium in the presence of fluoride has been noted as early as 1949. The in mice is about 100 mg/kg by ingestion and 1.8 mg/kg by intravenous injection.

The centre is the main commercial centre for the inner northern suburbs, after Civic, and is a significant site of employment. A range of businesses, services and community facilities are located there as well as a high school: Daramalan College.  Location  Dickson Centre is located 3 km north of Civic along Northbourne Avenue at the northern end of the suburb of Dickson. It lies on the southern side of Antill Street and is bounded on the eastern side by Cowper Street.  Description  The \\"Chinatown\\" restaurant area of the Dickson Centre. Statue of Confucius in Woolley St Dickson Centre is the largest group centre in Canberra, Australia. It is structured as an outdoor pedestrian area with a ‘village square’ feel, without a mall or arcades. There are a broad range of community facilities, restaurants, shops and offices. The central area around Woolley Street is often referred to as Canberra's Chinatown, though, it has diversified to include Indian, Ethiopian, Italian, Japanese and South-East Asian restaurants as well as Chinese restaurants and grocers. Community facilities are primarily at the eastern end, and include: the post office, swimming pool, playing fields, community health clinic, gymnasium, church and an ACT Ambulance Service station, which serves the inner northern suburbs. The western side, approaching Northbourne Avenue, has large offices, which include: Telstra’s regional headquarters; TransACT; ACT Motor Registry; CanberraConnect; and the ACT Planning and Land Authority. Other services include: a large newsagency, a health food shop, Jhay's shoe repairs, optometrist, a number of automotive repairers and small offices such as real estate agents and accountants. As well as representation from many of the major national and international brands and franchises, such as: Woolworths, McDonald's, Shell, Westpac, Ali Baba, KFC, Blockbuster Video, TurkOz and Domino's Pizza. Night venues include: Sub-Urban, a pub; Trinity, a cocktail bar; and The Tradies (The Dickson Tradesman's Union Club.) Front of the Dickson Tradies.

Daytime meeting places and cafes include: Deli Marco, Sfoglia, Hudson's, Deek's, the Rainbow Hippie Place, Jumping Bean, Dickson Cakes, Elaine's Pies, TurkOz, Granny's Bakery and Dickson Library  Changes  Zoning changes adopted as a result of the development of the Dickson Centre Master Plan, permit new buildings up to 12 metres (three storeys) high on the parking areas in Section 30 around the shopping centre, except for an area next to Antill street where 24 metre high buildings are permitted. In the area to its west and south (north of Sullivans Creek and east of Challis Street, including the Woolley St area), 21 metre (six storey) high buildings are permitted. It is planned to build new Coles and Aldi supermarkets, 150 apartments and a 500-space parking garage on the parking area north of the current shops.  Transport  Dickson Centre is primarily accessed by car. It is located at the corner of two major roads - Antill Street and Northbourne Avenue. These streets also intersect with Mouat Street, a major route to suburbs in northern Belconnen. The centre is well served by buses running to surrounding suburbs and also further afield to Civic and Belconnen. Dickson Interchange south of Antill Street on Canberra's light rail line opened in April 2019 on Northbourne Avenue.

Schenck and Michal Todorovic. Intended to be the first in a series of games, The Labyrinth of Time was less successful than similar graphic adventures released around the same time, such as The 7th Guest and Myst. It is the sole game produced by Terra Nova Development. In the years after its release, The Labyrinth of Time was published on more recent platforms by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. in collaboration with the original developers.  Plot  The story of The Labyrinth of Time is loosely based on Greek mythology. The game begins during player's commute home from work. While aboard the subway, the player and their train car are suddenly sucked into an alternate dimension. An illusion in the form of the mythological character Daedalus explains that King Minos has forced him to oversee the construction of a labyrinth that spans the space- time continuum. Upon its construction, King Minos will invade and conquer all times and places with his supernatural powers. Daedalus pleads for the player to find a way to destroy the labyrinth before Minos can complete his conquest. In-game terminals and journal entries reveal the extent of Minos's power. As explained by the lone archivist on a lunar library, a figure identifying himself as the king appeared simultaneously to all world governments in all time periods, seizing control of their militaries and erasing all written history. Minos's new abilities seem to extend beyond time travel; the scene of the king's tomb strongly implies that he rose from the grave. Screenshot of the Maze Center The labyrinth that the player explores spans many time periods and locations. Despite their incongruity, each area is thematically connected by the story of Martin Garret, a professor intrigued with discovering the tomb of the unnamed Sorcerer-King at a far-off ziggurat near Uxmal. Desperado Mad Dog Maddigan, the one man who knew the location of the Sorcerer-King's treasure chamber, was buried in the Western town of Revolver Springs, California, along with a map to the ziggurat's chamber. Revolver Springs, however, was destroyed in a fire on May 1, 1882, leaving the location of his grave a mystery. Garret was about to begin his second expedition to the ziggurat, but suffered from anxiety after losing his lucky shirt in a previous dig. When the player finds the ziggurat, they can retrieve the shirt. They are also able to go back in time to Revolver Springs and pick up a newspaper explaining that the local graves were relocated to make way for a railroad extension project. The player leaves both for Garret to receive, changing history. With the encouragement and new information, Garret locates Mad Dog Maddigan and completes his expedition. Among the treasures brought back from the Sorcerer-King's tomb, Garret discovers a talisman that was reputedly used to destroy buildings. The player must operate three levers in the ziggurat to reach the center of the labyrinth and take, among other items, the talisman to destroy its keystone. After dispelling an illusory Minotaur guarding the Maze Center, the player breaks the maze's keystone. This causes the labyrinth to unfurl at the seams. Daedalus appears in person to offer thanks for his freedom, then leaves to ensure King Minos can do no more harm. He leaves the player floating in an area that does not exist in time or space. The game ends with a teaser for a sequel, The Labyrinth II: Lost in the Land of Dreams. The sequel was never produced.  Re-release  On December 7, 2004, The Labyrinth of Time was re-released by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. for the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, AmigaOS, and Linux. The new versions of the game restored some audio quality and added a breadcrumbs feature for navigating mazes, as well as porting the original code to Simple DirectMedia Layer. The Amiga version was released as freeware and can be downloaded from Aminet and its mirrors or as an .iso from the official site. The game was later ported to Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch on November 14, 2009. It is at present available for purchase or download on the online game stores Steam and GOG.com. Reception Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai in December 1993 admitted that expecting The Labyrinth of Time to not have a maze was unrealistic. He stated, however, that although \\"pretend[ing] to be a piece of interactive fiction\\", it was \\"almost nothing but mazes, linked end to end in a complex, irritating chain\\". Ardai criticized the \\"relentless stylish visuals\\" as \\"eye- candy and boring eye-candy at that\\", with no way to distinguish between the few objects necessary for gameplay and the many non-interactive ones. He advised Electronic Arts to \\"dismantle The Labyrinth of Time and sell it cut- rate for clip art\\". In April 1994 the magazine said that \\"Though mythology and time travel interbreed seamlessly, its depressingly empty world and staid adventure game mechanics create a game that is less than timeless\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Labyrinth of Time the 43rd-worst computer game ever released. In January 1994, PC Gamer UK awarded the game its \\"Recommended\\" seal, with reviewer Phil South giving it a 91% rating. South defined the game as quick, hot and deep: \\"Quick because it takes no time at all to get into [...]. Hot because its state-of-the-art presentation because it makes it both look good and sound like a million bucks [...]. Deep because, once you get over the initial novelty and start to want something to occupy you for a while, the game has enough bite to keep you enthralled for as long as you're prepared to put the effort in, with puzzles and problems to tax experienced and neophyte adventurers alike\\". In February 1994, PC Zone also recommended the game, giving it a score of 89 out of 100. Reviewer Paul Presley criticized the game's \\"less than user-friendly interface\\", stating that there's \\"far too many mouse clicks to do far too few things\\", while highly praised the visuals and sound, which \\"produce an atmosphere unrivalled in an adventure game since The 7th Guest\\". The One gave the Amiga version of The Labyrinth of Time an overall score of 81%, referring to the music as \\"nothing short of brilliant\\", and praising the graphics, stating that \\"Labyrinth Of Time's obvious selling point is its graphics ... Unfortunately, the adventure itself doesn't quite come across as being as impressive as the graphics.\\" The One expressed that the \\"packaging itself gives no indication of the down-beat nature of the game ... [the intro outlining backstory events] come as an unpleasant surprise\\" and criticized the mazes, stating that the auto-map negates their purpose, making them \\"nothing more than tedious\\", and were frustrated by the \\"dated\\" and \\"limiting\\" UI.

It is very uncomfortable, as the eyelashes continuously rub against the cornea causing irritation. Entropion is usually caused by genetic factors. This is different from when an extra fold of skin on the lower eyelid causes lashes to turn in towards the eye (epiblepharon). In epiblepharons, the eyelid margin itself is in the correct position, but the extra fold of skin causes the lashes to be misdirected. Entropion can also create secondary pain of the eye (leading to self trauma, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage). The upper or lower eyelid can be involved, and one or both eyes may be affected. When entropion occurs in both eyes, this is known as \\"bilateral entropion\\". Repeated cases of trachoma infection may cause scarring of the inner eyelid, which may cause entropion. In human cases, this condition is most common to people over 60 years of age.Tony Smith, ed. (1992). The British Medical Association Family Doctor Home Adviser. Chart 80: \\"Painful or irritated eye\\". p. 184 Symptoms Symptoms of entropion include: * Redness and pain around the eye * Sensitivity to light and wind * Sagging skin around the eye * watering * Decreased vision, especially if the cornea is damaged Causes *Congenital *Aging creating loose skin and stretched and loose ligaments and muscles (senile entropion). *Scarring (mechanical entropion) *Spasm *An eye infection called trachoma is still common in North Africa and South Asia and this can cause scarring of the inner eyelid, which may cause friction and entropion. Treatment Treatment is a relatively simple surgery in which excess skin of the outer lids is removed or tendons and muscles are shortened with one or two stitches. General anesthesia is sometimes used before local anesthetics are injected into the muscles around the eye. Prognosis is excellent if surgery is performed before the cornea is damaged. Entropion in other species Canine entropion Entropion has been documented in most dog breeds, although there are some breeds (particularly purebreds) that are more commonly affected than others. These include the Akita, Pug, Chow Chow, Shar Pei, St. Bernard, Cocker Spaniel, Boxer, English Springer Spaniel, Welsh Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Neapolitan Mastiff, Bull Mastiff, Great Dane, Irish Setter, Shiba Inu, Rottweiler, Poodle and particularly Bloodhound. The condition is usually present by six months of age. If left untreated, the condition can cause such trauma to the eye that it will require removal. Feline Entropion Entropion has also been seen in cat breeds. Typically it is secondary to trauma, or infection leading to chronic eyelid changes. It is also seen secondary to enophthalmos. Congenital cases are also seen with the brachicephalic breeds being over represented. Upper lid entropion involves the eyelashes rubbing on the eye, but the lower lid usually has no eyelashes, so little or no hair rubs on the eye. Surgical correction is used in more severe cases. A number of techniques for surgical correction exist. The Hotz-Celsus technique involves the removal of strip of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle parallel to the affected portion of the lid and then the skin is sutured.

Having finished one version of his text, Sidney later significantly expanded and revised his work. Scholars today often refer to these two major versions as the Old Arcadia and the New Arcadia. The Arcadia is Sidney's most ambitious literary work by far, and as significant in its own way as his sonnets. Composition and publication Sidney's Arcadia has a history that is unusually complex even for its time. =The Old Arcadia= Sidney may have begun an early draft in the late 1570s, when he was in his twenties. His own comments indicate that his purpose was humble; he asserts that he intended only to entertain his sister, Mary Herbert, the Countess of Pembroke. This version is narrated in chronological order, with sets of poems separating the books from each other. It seems likely that Sidney finished this version while staying at Herbert's estate during a temporary eclipse at court in 1580. In 1588, Fulke Greville appears to have appealed to Francis Walsingham to prevent an unauthorized publication of parts of the original, as we learn from a letter that also serves as evidence for the circulation of Arcadia in manuscript form: > Sir this day one Ponsonby a bookbinder in Paul's Churchyard, came to me, and > told me that there was one in hand to print, Sir Philip Sidney's old Arcadia > asking me if it were done with your honour's con[sent] or any other of his > friends/I told him to my knowledge no, then he advised me to give warning of > it, either to the Archbishop or Doctor Cosen, who have as he says a copy of > it to peruse to that end/Sir I am loath to renew his memory unto you, but > yet in this I must presume, for I have sent my Lady your daughter at her > request, a correction of that old one done 4 or 5 years since which he left > in trust with me whereof there is no more copies, and fitter to be printed > than that first which is so common, notwithstanding even that to be amended > by a direction set down under his own hand how and why, so as in many > respects especially the care of printing it is to be done with more > deliberation,G. A. Wilkes, \\"'Left ... to Play the Ill Poet in My Own Part': > The Literary Relationship of Sidney and Fulke Greville,\\" The Review of > English Studies 57 (2006), no. 230, pp. 291-309. Sidney's original version was all but forgotten until 1908, when antiquarian Bertram Dobell discovered that a manuscript of the Arcadia he had purchased differed from published editions. Dobell subsequently acquired two other manuscripts of the old Arcadia: one from the library of the Earl of Ashburnham and one that had belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps. This version of the Arcadia was first published in 1926, in Albert Feuillerat's edition of Sidney's collected works. =The New Arcadia= The version of the Arcadia known to the Renaissance and later periods is substantially longer than the Old Arcadia. In the 1580s, Sidney took the frame of the original story, reorganized it, and added episodes, most significantly the story of the just rebel Amphialus. The additions more than double the original story; however, Sidney had not finished the revision at the time of his death in 1586. The New Arcadia is a romance that combines pastoral elements with a mood derived from the Hellenistic model of Heliodorus. A highly idealized version of the shepherd's life adjoins, on the other hand and not always naturally (in its literary sense), stories of jousts, political treachery, kidnappings, battles, and rapes. As published, the narrative follows the Greek model: stories are nested within each other, and different storylines are intertwined. After Sidney's death, his revised Arcadia was prepared for the press and published in two differing editions. Fulke Greville, in collaboration with Matthew Gwinne and John Florio, edited and oversaw the publication of the 1590 edition, which ends in mid-scene and mid-sentence. In 1593 Mary Herbert herself published an edition in which the original version supplements and concludes the part that Sidney revised. Later additions filled in gaps in the story, most notably the fifth edition of 1621, which included Sir William Alexander's attempt to work over the gap between Sidney's two versions of the story. Other continuations and developments of Sidney's story were published separately. The hybrid editions did not efface the difference between the highly artificial, hellenized revised portion and the straightforward conclusion Sidney wrote originally. Nevertheless, it was in this form that Sidney's work entered history and reached a wide readership. Synopsis of the Old Arcadia Although Old Arcadia has never been greatly popular, it has entertained a small set of readers for over 400 years with its sensational treatment of sex, politics, violence, soporifics, mobs, and cross-dressing. Narrated in sprawling Renaissance prose, the romance comprises five \\"books or acts,\\" organized according to the five-part structure of classical dramaturgy: exposition, action, complication, reversal, catastrophe. This hybrid structure—part prose romance and part classical drama—allows Sidney to contain the diverseness of romance within the cohesiveness of the dramatic arc. The work is often called \\"tragicomic\\" for its combination of a \\"serious\\" high plot centering on the princes and Duke Basilius's household and a \\"comic\\" low plot that centers on the steward Dametas's family. The standard modern edition of Old Arcadia, on which this synopsis is based, is edited by Jean Robertson (Clarendon: Oxford, 1973). =Book I= In Book I, the Duke of Arcadia, Basilius, journeys to the oracle at Delphos and receives a bleak prediction: his daughters will be stolen by undesirable suitors, he will be cuckolded by his wife, and his throne will be usurped by a foreign state. Hoping to preempt this fate, Basilius entrusts the Arcadian government to his loyal subject, Philanax, and retires to a pastoral lodge with his wife, Gynecia, their attractive daughters, Pamela and Philoclea, his boorish servant, Dametas, and the latter's repulsive wife and daughter, Miso and Mopsa. In a nearby city, Pyrocles and Musidorus pass the night; they are cousins, princes, and best friends, and are famous throughout Greece for their heroic exploits. Pyrocles, upon seeing a picture of Philoclea at a gallery, is overwhelmed by a passionate desire to see her in person. To that end, Pyrocles disguises himself as Cleophila, an \\"[Amazonian lady] going about the world to practice feats of chivalry,\\" and heads for Basilius's pastoral lodge, accompanied by the skeptical but loyal Musidorus. Deceived by Cleophila's feminine disguise, Basilius falls in love with her, and invites her to stay with the family. While Musidorus covertly observes this meeting, he is overwhelmed by a passionate love for the elder daughter, Pamela, and decides to disguise himself as a shepherd, Dorus, in order to gain access to her. When everyone congregates in an arbor to hear the shepherds sing, a lion and bear attack the party. Cleophila kills the lion, saving Philoclea; Dorus kills the bear, saving Pamela. Cleophila's manly puissance leads Gynecia to suspect her secret male sex, while Philoclea forms an intense \\"sisterly\\" affection for Cleophila. =Book II= In Book II, the action rises as the romantic relationships become increasingly complicated, and as Basilius's retirement foments political unrest. Cleophila struggles to woo Philoclea while simultaneously placating the jealous Basilius and Gynecia. Meanwhile, Dorus, who has ingratiated himself to Dametas and entered his household as a shepherd- servant, struggles to woo Pamela, who is always accompanied by Dametas's vain and ugly daughter, Mopsa. To avoid raising suspicions that he loves Pamela, Dorus addresses all of his significant looks, sighing, singing, poetry, etc. to Mopsa, who laps it up and fails to notice the heavy-handed hints that Pamela, not Mopsa, is the object of his passion. In an extremely complicated piece of hoodwinking, Dorus reveals his identity to Pamela, proposes elopement, and is elated by the princess's willingness to flee Arcadia with him. Meanwhile, Cleophila manages to reveal his identity to Philoclea, and they declare their mutual love. Their idyll is interrupted by a mob of drunken Arcadian rabble who are angry at Basilius for neglecting his sovereign obligations. Cleophila, Basilius, Dorus and friendly shepherds slaughter much of the mob before finally subduing it. Book II ends with the establishment of the unusual love \\"square\\" in which father, mother and daughter are all violently in love with the cross-dressed Pyrocles/Cleophila, and the love triangle comprising Mopsa, Pamela and Dorus. It also begins the political theme, expanded in the fourth and fifth books, concerning the implications of negligent government. =Book III= In Book III, Musidorus tells Pyrocles of his intentions to elope with Pamela. Pyrocles despairs of his own success with Philoclea because he is under the constant surveillance of the jealous and enamored Basilius and Gynecia. Dorus's elopement strategy begins by distracting Pamela's guardians: he tricks Dametas into wasting a day on a bogus treasure hunt; he dispatches Miso by telling her Dametas is cheating on her with a woman in an adjacent village, and he leaves Mopsa up in a tree waiting for a sign from Jove. The coast cleared, Dorus and Pamela head for the nearest seaport. While resting, Dorus is overcome by her beauty and is about to rape her when they are suddenly attacked by another mob. Meanwhile, Gynecia's passion has become desperate and she threatens to expose Cleophila's identity if he does not requite her love. To distract Gynecia, Cleophila pretends to requite her love, which aggravates Basilius and Philoclea. In an ill-fated bed-trick, Cleophila promises a nocturnal assignation to both Gynecia and Basilius in a nearby cave, intending to trick the husband and wife into sleeping with each other (hoping they won't notice that the other is not Cleophila) and to enjoy a night alone with Philoclea. Book III ends with a double \\"climax\\": the attempted rape of Pamela by Dorus, and the consummated union of Pyrocles and Philoclea. =Book IV= In Book IV, Dorus and Cleophila suffer a major reversal of fortune. Dametas, Miso and Mopsa return to the lodge to find Pamela missing, and Dametas, fearing punishment for neglecting his royal ward, begins a frantic search for Pamela. Supposing her to be with her sister, Philoclea, Dametas barges into Philoclea's bed chamber and finds, of course, not Pamela, but \\"Cleophila,\\" who is naked and in bed with Philoclea, and who is evidently not a woman. Dametas bolts the lovers inside and sounds the alarum. In the cave, Gynecia and Basilius, each thinking the other is Cleophila, have sex, but recognize each other in the morning. Basilius accidentally drinks a potion that Gynecia had intended for Cleophila, and dies. Gynecia becomes hysterical and self-incriminating, and offers herself up to justice as the murderer of her husband and the sovereign. Philanax, Basilius's loyal friend, arrives to investigate the duke's death and Pamela's flight, and becomes a zealous advocate for executing everyone associated with the death of Basilius. Meanwhile, Musidorus and Pamela fall captive to the attacking mob, but not before Musidorus kills and gruesomely maims several of them. Hoping for a reward for finding the fugitives, the mob heads for Basilius, but is intercepted and slaughtered by Philanax and his men, who take the captive Dorus and Pamela, who are now primary suspects in the duke's murder. Thus, Dorus (now \\"Palladius\\") joins Cleophila (now \\"Timopyrus\\") in prison. Pamela demands to be recognized as the new sovereign, but Philanax demands an interim period of investigation and burial before the succession is established. Meanwhile, the body politic erupts into a confused and \\"dangerous tumult\\" about political succession. =Book V= Book V brings the action to its catastrophe. Philanax struggles to maintain order in Arcadia, which is dangerously divided: some factions support various political climbers, others clamor for democratic government, and some call for the election of the two princes, whose good looks and military prowess had made them very popular. Philanax needs a leader capable of commanding the allegiance of the Arcadians and of bringing justice to Basilius's murderers. Luckily, the sovereign most renowned for his wise and just government, Euarchus of Thessalia, has traveled to Arcadia to visit his good friend Basilius. Euarchus is also the father of Pyrocles and uncle of Musidorus, but has no idea what they have been up to. Philanax persuades the reluctant Eurarchus to aid Arcadia by assuming authority for the present and becoming the state's \\"protector.\\" The book concludes with a lengthy trial scene. Gynecia, \\"Palladius\\" and \\"Timopyrus\\" are brought forth to stand before Euarchus, who presides as judge, and Philanax, who argues on behalf of the apparently murdered Basilius. Gynecia's trial goes quickly because she, overcome by grief, wants to die as quickly as possible, and gives a false confession of intentionally poisoning her husband and sovereign. Euarchus sentences her to death by being entombed alive with Basilius. \\"Timopyrus\\" is tried next, and Philanax delivers a vituperative oratory condemning him for cross-dressing, for raping Philoclea, and for conspiring with Gynecia to murder Basilius; \\"Timopyrus\\" is acquitted of the murder charges, but is sentenced to death for raping Philoclea. \\"Palladius\\" is likewise condemned to death for attempted theft of the royal daughter, Pamela. As the convicts are escorted to their executions, a friendly compatriot of Musidorus suddenly arrives with important information. He has heard about the trial, guessed the princes' true identities, and feels Euarchus should know that he has condemned his own son and nephew to death (for various reasons, the identities of Euarchus and the princes has been hitherto obscured). At this moment of recognition, or anagnorisis, Euarchus is devastated, but decides that justice trumps kinship, and with a heavy heart confirms their death sentence. Suddenly, groans are heard from Basilius's corpse and, to the surprise and delight of all, Basilius emerges from a deep coma. All are forgiven, the princes marry the princesses, and the book thus ends with a comic reversal, or peripeteia, from justice and death to reconciliation and marriage. Reputation and influence Sidney's manuscripts of the Old Arcadia were not published until the 20th century. The New Arcadia, however, was published in two different editions during the 16th century, and enjoyed great popularity for more than a hundred years afterwards. William Shakespeare borrowed from it for the Gloucester subplot of King Lear;Bullough, Vol. 7, pp. 284-6, 398-9. traces of the work's influence may also be found in HamletBullough, Vol. 7, pp. 47-8. and The Winter's Tale.Bullough, Vol. 8, pp. 125-6. Other dramatizations also occurred: Samuel Daniel's The Queen's Arcadia, John Day's The Isle of Gulls, Beaumont and Fletcher's Cupid's Revenge, the anonymous Mucedorus, a play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha, and, most overtly, in James Shirley's The Arcadia. Sidney's book also inspired a number of partial imitators, such as his niece Lady Mary Wroth's Urania, and continuations, the most famous perhaps being that by Anna Weamys. These works, however, are as close to the \\"precious\\" style of 17th-century French romance as to the Greek and chivalric models that shape Sidney's work. The Arcadia also made a small appearance at a crucial moment in history. According to a widely told story, Charles I quoted lines from the book, an excerpt termed \\"Pamela's Prayer\\", from a prayer of the heroine Pamela, as he mounted the scaffold to be executed. In Eikonoklastes, John Milton complains of the dead king's choice of a profane text for his final prayer; at the same time, he praised the book as among the best of its kind. In the eighteenth century, Samuel Richardson named the heroine of his first novel after Sidney's Pamela. Despite this mark of continued respect, however, the rise of the novel was making works like the Arcadia obsolete. By the beginning of the Romantic era, its grand, artificial, sometimes obstinately unwieldy style (of Sidney's Areopagus school of poetry but sometimes wrongly held to be euphuisticEdmund Gosse in the EB1911 writes, \\"This severe censure of Euphuism may serve to remind us that hasty critics have committed an error in supposing the Arcadia of Sidney to be composed in the fashionable jargon. That was certainly not the intention of the author, and in fact the publication of the Arcadia, eleven years after that of Euphues, marks the beginning of the downfall of the popularity of the latter.\\") had made it thoroughly alien to more modern tastes. However, in the 20th century, the Latin American poet Giannina Braschi spins her own rendition of Arcadia in the trilogy \\"Empire of Dreams\\", which features the book \\"Pastoral; or the Inquisition of Memories\\". While the original is still widely read, it was already becoming a text of primary interest to historians and literary specialists. The Arcadia contains the earliest known use of the feminine personal name Pamela. Most scholars believe that Sidney simply invented the name. In 2013, the Old Arcadia was adapted for the stage by The University of East Anglia's Drama Department, and performed alongside Shakespeare's As You Like It as part of \\"The Arcadian Project\\".

It was directed by Lau Kar-Leung and written by Ni Kuang. The film is the second in a loosely connected trilogy, following The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin (1978) and preceding Disciples Of The 36th Chamber (1985). In the first and third films in the series, Liu portrays the Shaolin monk San Te, but in Return, he portrays an imposter monk.  Plot  The story opens at a fabric dyeing mill. The quality of the dyes has noticeably worsened, and the factory owner, Wang, and his subordinate chief, Boss Wa, decide to hire some Manchu overseers to improve the work. Wang decides to cut the workers' salary to pay the mercenaries, and when the workers protest they are viciously thrashed. When sitting in a tea house discussing their problems, the workers are joined by Chu Jen-chieh, a good- hearted small-time con man and the foreman's younger brother who is posing as a monk. He offers to help, but since he cannot actually do kung fu, he and the foreman's assistant, Ah Chao, devise a plan to trick the Manchu into reinstating the full salary pay, with Jen-chieh posing as the Shaolin's head abbot of 36th Chamber, San Te. At first the scheme works, but Wang quickly works out that this man is an impostor, and has him driven away and his Manchu hirelings retaliate against the workers. Feeling guilty about what has happened, Jen-chieh leaves and heads for the Shaolin temple to learn the real fighting arts. His first attempts to enter by stealth are thwarted by the vigilant monks and his own bumbling, but eventually he manages to sneak his way in, just to run into the real San Te. He, too, realizes that Jen-chieh is not what he claims to be, but he announces that he wants to give him a chance: Jen-chieh is to build a set of scaffolds all around the temple and renovate the entire complex. Somewhat reluctantly, Jen-chieh goes to work, but he is constantly distracted by the monks practicing martial arts in the 36th Chamber, which he can overlook from his high vantage point. Eventually, he begins to train himself in kung fu by using the conditions of his assignment to improvise training facilities. However, this causes him to lag behind in his work, and it takes him more than a year to finish the gantry. As soon as Jen-chieh announces that he is finished, San Te wants him to dismantle the structure and leave the monastery. Rebelling against this decision, Jen-chieh lands himself inside the chamber, and while trying to evade the abbot chasing him, he inadvertently manages to pass all hazards set in the chamber with ease. San Te finally corners him and forces him to leave, with a strange smile on his lips. Jen-chieh returns to town to find that the conditions of the workers have worsened: Their salary has been cut by nearly half, and any who have protested had been laid off to eke out a meager existence. Elated by his return, some of the ex-workers begin to pester Jen-chieh with their high expectations, which leads to Jen-chieh instinctively and to his own surprise fighting them off with his newly acquired kung fu skills. The next morning, Jen-chieh appears at the dye mill and thrashes the overseers, using bamboo fibers (like the ones he used when building the scaffolds) to tie them up and incapacitate them, introducing his style as \\"scaffolding kung fu\\". Once the overseers are dealt with, Wang and his bodyguards appear at the scene. Jen- chieh lures them out of the city to a mansion under construction, where he uses the building equipment and the tight quarters to his advantage. Finally overpowering Wang, he forces him to pay his workers their full wages again. Wang admits defeat, and Jen-chieh continues his training on the half-finished grounds.

An Australian international representative, he retired as Queensland's most capped State of Origin forward. Price captained Sydney club, the Bulldogs (with whom he won the 1995 and 2004 premierships) as well as Auckland club, the Warriors. Background Born in Dalby, Queensland, Price grew up in Toowoomba, where he attended Harristown State High School. Price was spotted playing rugby league for the Newtown Lions club in Toowoomba and was signed to the New South Wales Rugby League premiership club, Sydney's Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.  Playing career  = Bulldogs = Price playing for the Bulldogs in 2004 During the 1994 NSWRL season Price made his first grade debut for the Bulldogs at Belmore Sports Ground on 3 July against the Balmain Tigers. It was a great rookie year for Price as his side finished the regular season as minor premiers on top of the ladder and eventually going on to reach the 1994 Grand Final which they lost to Mal Meninga's Canberra Raiders. The disappointment of losing the Grand Final did not last long for Price, as the following year in the 1995 season the Bulldogs reached their second consecutive Grand Final to come up against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. Price was named on the starting line-up and as a headgear-wearing second-rower scored the first try of the game which the Bulldogs eventually won 17–4, giving Price his first taste of premiership victory. The experience of finals football so early in his career was a positive for Price as he established a reputation as an effective front rower/prop and second rower with a high work rate. During the 1998 season Price made his debut for Queensland in game one of the 1998 State of Origin series. He would retain his spot for the following two matches of series in which Queensland were victorious two games to one. His performance at representative level was then awarded with the highest honour for an Australian player as he was announced in the 1998 Kangaroos squad. In the same year Steve Price and the Bulldogs made a terrific finals run where, after finishing the season in 9th position, they won four must-win matches to make it all the way through to the 1998 NRL Grand Final against the Brisbane Broncos which they lost 38–12. When Bulldog captain Darren Britt left the club at the end of 2001, coach Steve Folkes opted for Price to captain the side for 2002. He proved to be a great captain and Bulldogs finished the 2002 season with 20 wins, 1 draw and only 3 losses, although they would not play in the finals due to the salary cap breach. 2003 was another strong year for Price as he was awarded Player of the Year by magazine Rugby League Week; he also captained the sides to 18 regular season wins and a semi-final berth which they lost to the Sydney Roosters. In 2004 Price had a stellar performance playing for Queensland and was awarded the Ron McAuliffe Medal for Queensland player of the series. During the transfer period in 2004 it was announced that it would be his last year with the Bulldogs after 10 years of service, as he was signing with the New Zealand Warriors for 2005. Price could not have gone out in better style as the Bulldogs finished second on the ladder, missing out on the minor premiership by points difference. Price's fairytale ending was then shattered when he tore his medial ligament the week before the Grand Final. His side played well without their inspirational captain and went on to win 16–13 to send Price out with another Grand Final success, even though he did not compete in the final game. = Warriors = Price while playing for Australia in 2008 When Price left the Bulldogs, who had appeared in the finals consistently and performed very well, he went to join the Warriors who had experienced their worst ever season in 2004, finishing 14th of 15 teams and winning only 6 games all year. Price was straight-away appointed captain of the squad and he clearly made some sort of impact as the team remained competitive for all of their matches. In the opening match of the 2005 State of Origin series Price was named man of the match. The Warriors had a good chance to make the finals; however, a four-match losing streak late in the season removed those chances and they finished the 2005 season 11th, a slight improvement from the previous year. In 2006 Price again experienced more salary cap drama. The Warriors were found to have committed major breaches of the salary cap due to poor administration decisions. The NRL announced the club would be deducted four competition points and the club would also be assessed a A$430,000 fine. Those four points would cost the team a place in the finals. Even at the age of 33 and after 13 years playing professional football, the 2007 season proved to be one of his career bests. In Round 14 Steve Price broke his own record of 'metres gained by a forward' playing against the Cronulla Sharks. Price's previous record was 272 metres; he eclipsed this by gaining 306 metres from 33 hit-ups. Seven weeks later in round 21 Price broke his own record again, this time against the Sydney Roosters where he ran for a total of 323 m. The Warriors finished the regular season strongly, sitting at the top end of the ladder on 4th position, although they struggled to perform come finals time and dropped out of the competition in the second week of the finals losing to the North Queensland Cowboys. However, Price's own personal performance throughout the year was duly recognised as he was awarded the Captain of the Year & Prop of the Year titles at the 2007 Dally M Awards. He ran 4,515 metres with the ball in 2007, more than any other forward in history. Price playing against New Zealand in 2008 In August 2008, Price was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad. He did not, however, play in the World Cup Final due to tearing his calf in the final training session before the Final which Australia lost to the Kiwis. Price was eligible for England and New Zealand; however, he has stated he will not switch his allegiance from Australia. In April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. On Sunday 3 May 2009 Price confirmed he would extend his NRL career to a 17th season after signing a one-year contract with the New Zealand Warriors. Already the NRL's oldest player in 2009, Price was 36 at the start of the 2010 season. He was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009. Price was replaced as the Warriors club captain for the 2010 season by Simon Mannering, in a move described by the club as building for the future.Simon Mannering to lead Vodafone Warriors in 2010 warriors.co.nz, 4 November 2009Steve Price dropped as Warriors captain 3News, 4 November 2009 On 6 April 2010, Price announced his retirement from rugby league at the conclusion of the 2010 NRL season. On 29 June 2010, Price announced his immediate retirement. This was due to a heel injury that he picked up during the off-season. This injury did not heal correctly and resulted in three operations, meaning that he would be unable to take to the field at all during the 2010 NRL season. This meant that although 2010 would be his final season as a professional rugby league player, he would not play a single game. = Playing awards = Individual playing awards *2002: Dally M Captain of the Year *2004: Ron McAuliffe Medal – Queensland State of Origin player of the series *2004: Dally M Captain of the Year *2006: NZ Warriors Lion Red Player of Year *2007: Dally M Captain of the Year *2007: Dally M Prop of the Year *2007: NZ Warriors Lion Red Player of Year *NRL Records: Most meters gained by a forward (323m vs. Sydney Roosters.

It was released by Lorimar Productions and was first telecast on ABC on Wednesday October 10, 1973 during the ABC Movie of the Week. It has since been shown many times in syndication and was distributed on home video and now on DVD. It is known as Nightmare in certain countries in Europe. The story centers around a young housewife who unknowingly unleashes a trio of hideous goblin-like creatures from within a sealed fireplace in the Victorian mansion, inherited from her late grandmother, that she and her husband are restoring. Now free, the creatures begin terrorizing her and later reveal their sinister plans to her: whoever frees them must become one of them. It has since become a cult film, and a theatrical remake of the same name was released in August 2010. Plot Sally Farnum and her husband Alex inherit an old mansion from Sally's recently deceased grandmother. Shortly after moving in, she discovers a bricked-up fireplace in the basement den. The estate's handyman, Mr. Harris, tells her that Sally's grandmother had him seal it up after her grandfather died and that it is better to leave it the way it is. After he leaves for the day, she uses some of Harris' tools to try to remove the bricks herself. She fails, but is able to pry open a small side door used for removing fireplace ashes. Inside is not a fireplace at all but a large, dark, deep sub-basement. As Sally leaves the den, several whispering voices call her name from behind the fireplace, proclaiming that \\"She set us free.\\" Sally begins to feel unsettled in the house. One night she is awakened by voices whispering her name, and an ashtray mysteriously falls off her bedside cabinet. Alex dismisses her concerns and believes she is suffering from nervous tension. The next evening, something grabs her dress as she is walking down the stairs and she hears voices whispering \\"We want you.\\" Freeing herself, she sees something scuttling away behind a curtain, which she believes is a small animal of some kind. Later, she hears the same whispering coming from behind the fireplace in the basement den. Alex remains unconvinced of her story, but makes sure the ash door is bolted securely shut. The following night, Sally throws a dinner party for Alex's colleagues at his law firm. During the party, Sally sees a small, hideous goblin-like creature near her leg under the dinner table. She screams, but nobody believes what she saw and the creature quickly vanishes. Alex grows impatient with her and thinks she is becoming delusional. While Sally is in the shower, three of the goblin creatures turn out the lights so that they can attack her with a razor. As Sally turns the light back on, the creatures shriek and retreat from the brightness into the bathroom cupboards where they disappear. She tells Alex they should sell the house. The following day, Alex goes away on business and Sally arranges to go and stay with her friend Joan. Before she goes, the creatures attempt to trip Sally down a flight of stairs, but they accidentally cause the death of her interior decorator instead. Sally tries to confront the creatures and asks them what they want, and they reply they want her spirit. Whoever frees them (as Sally did by opening the fireplace) must become one of them. Sally's doctor prescribes sedatives and her friend Joan stays with her. Joan begins to believe Sally's story. Alex remains unconvinced. He leaves to meet their handyman regarding the history of the house and the fireplace. Sally tries to stay awake but the creatures put sedatives into her coffee and cut the electricity. They lock Joan outside when she checks the circuit breaker. Sally manages to walk downstairs, but the creatures trip her in the dark. While she is semi-conscious, they drag her into the basement den and into the unsealed fireplace. Sally, now one of the creatures, patiently waits for their next victim to move into the house.

It was released on DVD on August 18, 2009, by Warner Archive burn-on-demand service. This release went out of print the following year, but was remastered and re-released again on August 24, 2011. This newly restored release of the film was timed to release with the theatrical release of the remake two days later. In 2019 it was given a 4K remaster and released on Blu-ray by Warner Archive. Critical reception Critical response for Don't Be Afraid of the Dark has been mostly positive upon its initial release. Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide rated the film three out of a possible five stars, calling the film \\"[an] above-average, made-for-TV chiller\\" also writing, \\"Overall the film may be a little slow and obvious by today's standards, but these stand-out moments insure it a place in the memories of children of the '70s\\". Donald Guarisco from AllMovie gave the film a positive review, calling the film \\"a potent little fright-fest\\", complimenting the film's script, acting, characterizations, steadily built tension, and Newland's tense direction. Ian Jane from DVD Talk wrote, \\"While Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark may not be a deep film nor will it win any awards for originality, it's a fun seventies horror picture with some memorable moments, great camerawork and a genuinely surprising finale.\\" The film was not without its detractors, with some contemporary reviews of the film noting that the film had become dated. On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the film's familiar storyline, Demarest's clichéd character, and overuse of the whispering voices of the creatures. However, Sindelar called it \\"one of the better made-for-TV horror movies out there\\" and stated that the film did have its moments. Bloody Disgusting felt that the film had become dated, and criticized what it called Darby's overacting, creature design, and forced perspective shots of the creatures. The review did, however, commend the film for its \\"campy surrealism\\" which they felt was the film's strongest attribute. Legacy Director Guillermo del Toro (who produced and co-wrote the film's remake) was heavily influenced by it when he saw it on television as a child. He and his brothers would reportedly follow each other around the house saying \\"Sally, Sally\\", mimicking the creatures in the 1973 film. \\"It was something close to my heart for a very long time ... We thought the movie was the most terrifying on Earth\\", said del Toro. =Remake= Miramax Films produced a remake of the film as a theatrical feature, released on August 26, 2011. The remake stars, Bailee Madison, Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce, and was produced and co-written by Guillermo del Toro. The remake marks the directorial debut of comic book artist-writer Troy Nixey. The remake is noted noted for its Freudian themes as well as the proto-feminist undertones and the \\"fears and anxieties about the changing roles of women and the ways they are so often victimized or go unheard.\\" See also * List of American films of 1973 * ABC Movie of the Week References External links  * Category:1973 films Category:1973 television films Category:1973 horror films Category:American films Category:American monster movies Category:Horror television films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:ABC Movie of the Week Category:1970s monster movies ","title":"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 film)"},{"id":"2184227","text":"Monstrosity is an American death metal band originating from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the death metal scene of the early 1990s.  History  Vocalist George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher and drummer Lee Harrison and bass player Mark Van Erp were the founders of Monstrosity. Harrison had just left the band Malevolent Creation and George Fisher gave up a band in his hometown of Maryland and came to Florida in 1990. Jon Rubin who had played guitar in Malevolent Creation also joined to form Monstrosity. Mark Van Erp played bass in the band Cynic and he left Cynic to join Monstrosity. The four members of Monstrosity signed with Nuclear Blast (Germany). Jason Gobel who was a member of Cynic helped Monstrosity record Imperial Doom when they entered the recording studio. He was never a member of Monstrosity. The album was released in 1992 by Nuclear Blast. Monstrosity toured Europe in support of the band Pestilence for this album. After a number of problems with the label, Lee Harrison formed his own music label, Conquest Music, in 1996. Now signed to Conquest Music, the band entered the studio again to record Millennium. Guitarist Jon Rubin was replaced by Jason Morgan and bassist Mark Van Erp, by Kelly Conlon. George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher performed vocals and Lee Harrison was on drums. The album was licensed to Nuclear Blast Germany in 1996 for Europe and later re-released in 2002 by Hammerheart Records (Netherlands) for Europe. After completing the recording of the album Millennium, Fisher joined Cannibal Corpse. Jason Avery (Eulogy) replaced Fisher on vocals. In 1999, Monstrosity went back in the studio and this time they recorded In Dark Purity. The album was produced by Monstrosity and recorded at Morrisound Studios, Tampa, Florida. Conquest Music licensed the album to Olympic/Slip Disc/Century Media for better distribution in the US and licensed the album to Metal Age and then Hammerheart Records in Europe. Jason Avery was the vocalist, Lee Harrison, the drummer, Tony Norman, the guitarist and Kelly Conlon, the bassist. In 2001, Conquest Music released a two-CD Monstrosity package. One CD was a live album Monstrosity recorded while on tour in the US. Included in the CD was Monstrosity's infamous Horror Infinity demo and their Slaves and Masters demo. CD two features slightly different re-recordings of songs from their first album. The double CD was licensed to Hammerheart Records in Europe. By 2004, Monstrosity was in the process of recording Rise to Power with members Jason Avery (vocalist), Lee Harrison (drums), Tony Norman (guitar), Sam Molina (guitar) and Mike Poggione (bass). The album was recorded at Audio Hammer Studio, Sanford, Florida. It was produced by Lee Harrison and Monstrosity and engineered by Jason Suecof. Conquest Music licensed the album to Metal Blade Records in Europe. Monstrosity toured the US in support of the album and they were invited by the Bogotá, Colombia government to headline a musical festival in Bogotá. 85,000 people were in attendance. Avery was replaced in December 2005 by Brian Werner (Infernaeon). Werner performed vocal duties on the band's 2006 European tour, and subsequent U.S. shows. In December 2006, Werner was replaced by Mike Hrubovcak (Divine Rapture, Imperial Crystalline Entombment, Vile) and Mark English (guitar) joined Monstrosity. Monstrosity is now Mike Hrubovcak (vocals), Lee Harrison (drums), Mark English (guitar) and Mike Poggione (bass). They returned to Morrisound Studios. This time to record Spiritual Apocalypse. Conquest Music licensed the album to Metal Blade in Europe and it was released in 2007. Additional solos on Spiritual Apocalypse were done by Matt LaPorte (Jon Oliva's Pain).

The album was released in the US in 2008. In the summer of 2009, Monstrosity spent six weeks touring Peru and Chile and then flew to Europe to do the Brutal Assault festival in Czech Republic and Party San festival in Germany. On November 22, 2011, the band announced in their Facebook that they were to release a live DVD, Live Apocalypse, in early 2012.

Diablo is an enemy of the Fantastic Four. He is depicted as an evil alchemist. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four vol. 1 #30 (September 1964). Publication history Diablo was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and first appeared in Fantastic Four vol. 1 #30 (September 1964). In a 2013 interview with Chris Hardwick of Nerdist, creator Lee said that Diablo was his greatest regret because he cannot remember the character, who he is, and why he did what he did, saying, \\"When you create a character you should feel you know him\\". Fictional character biography Esteban Corazón de Ablo was a powerful alchemist in 9th century Saragossa, who sold his soul to the demon Mephisto to lengthen his life far beyond a human span.Fantastic Force #18 Years later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania where he made a pact with the Vampires.Fantastic Four Vol. 3 #36 The villagers had enough of him where they formed an angry mob and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation, when a local named Baron Hugo told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to The Thing to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human. In exchange for Ben's services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change. When the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived, they found Ben working for Diablo. They fought with him and tried to convince him to leave his service, but Ben refused, and the three were forced to leave him behind. Diablo soon made his appearance known to the world, and sold his alchemic chemicals internationally, making him the richest man on the planet. Shortly before the rest of the world, Mister Fantastic discovered that Diablo's chemicals worked, but only for a short while, before failing. The world turned on Diablo, but he had already built up an army of loyal followers and was prepared to use his alchemic powers to conquer the planet. But once Diablo had revealed his true intentions, the Fantastic Four were free to attack him. At the same time, the Thing had also discovered that the potion he was given wore off, and he turned on Diablo, but Diablo used one of his chemical pellets to knock him out and seal him in an unbreakable, glass capsule. The remaining three members of the Fantastic Four soon attacked Diablo's fortress, but after a struggle, Diablo managed to capture them with his chemical pellets. Diablo sealed up the last of the Fantastic Four in the same capsules, but Ben quickly escaped when his broke down. Angered, he chased Diablo through his own castle, until he crushed a suit of armor into a giant ball, and threw it after him. Diablo ran from it, hiding within the crypt that the villagers had sealed him in. The Thing followed behind him and reinserted the giant, stone plug, and then smashed it with both fists, causing the entire castle to come crumbling down upon the crypt. The Fantastic Four were later freed, and the Human Torch melted the stone into slag to harden Diablo's prison.Fantastic Four #30 But Diablo eventually used his potions to destroy his melted stone prison, and escape to get revenge on the Fantastic Four. His next move was to travel to North America and New York's State University, where he helped Professor Gilbert to animate his android creation, Dragon Man. He turned the Dragon Man against the Fantastic Four, but it eventually turned on him and drove both of them underneath a frozen lake, where he was lost for a time.Fantastic Four #35 Diablo later reactivated the Dragon Man, creating a whole army of Dragon Men. He was defeated by the Avengers, however.Avengers #41-42 Diablo later clashed with Doctor Doom.Marvel Super-Heroes #20 He next took the Inhuman, Crystal, captive. He took control of Terra Verde, but was ultimately defeated by the Human Torch.Fantastic Four #117-118 Diablo later recruited Darkoth as a pawn to battle Doctor Doom, but was betrayed by Darkoth.Fantastic Four #193-194 Diablo later sent elementals to battle the Fantastic Four,Fantastic Four #232 and battled Iron Man after that.Iron Man #159 It was later revealed that Diablo had a romantic relationship with the woman who became the criminal Gilded Lily.Alpha Flight #21 Diablo was freed from prison by Gilded Lily, though he turned against her and was defeated by Alpha Flight.Alpha Flight Annual #1 Diablo later attacked the Fantastic Four, again using elementals against them.Fantastic Four #306-307 Diablo conquered the country of Tierra del Maiz, and in another clash with Alpha Flight, he was apparently killed.Alpha Flight #102-103 However, Diablo survived and reappeared again later. He was later responsible for the destruction of the Fantastic Four's headquarters, Pier 4. He aided the Fantastic Four in driving the chaos demon Shuma-Gorath back to its home dimension. Diablo has also fought Spider-Man. After escaping Spider-Man, he is approached by Ana Kravinoff who states that her mother would like to speak with him.Amazing Spider-Man #607 Some time later, he has become a subject of the new Night Thrasher's interest.New Warriors vol. 4 #10 He was later seen in Vieques, an island-municipality of Puerto Rico, where he helped Spider-Man and the Human Torch defeat a giant radioactive sea monster that was devouring the residents and tourists.Spider- Man & the Human Torch in... Bahia de los Muertos During The Gauntlet storyline, Diablo is present with Electro, Ana Kravinoff, Sasha Kravinoff, and Alyosha Kravinoff when Mattie Franklin is sacrificed as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a humanoid lion creature.Amazing Spider-Man #634 During the Origin of the Species storyline, Diablo is invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where he promises them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.Amazing Spider-Man #642 Ever since Lily Hollister's baby was stolen by the Chameleon, Spider-Man had been going on a rampage against any villains involved.

He was educated by tutors in 9th-century Spain, and is self-taught in alchemy and modern sciences. Diablo has extended his youth and life through a longevity serum, and can affect his own body by changing his appearance to look like a different person, or become \\"nerveless protoplasm\\", which makes him immune to certain forms of harm. He employs a huge arsenal of alchemical potions that he discovered or invented, and conceals within hidden pouches and pockets in his costume. His alchemy can transmute elements through means unknown to modern science. Although the range of his power is wide, the effects are temporary unless Diablo provides a second dose, with the exception being the elixir he used on Dragon Man. His mixtures include nerve gas pellets, sleeping potions, a potion that renders a person inert by lowering their body temperature, pellets that make people susceptible to Diablo's hypnotic orders, and other potions and pellets that enable him to transmute inorganic matter (stones to feathers, water to ice, etc.), unleash explosive blasts, model surface features, give life to inanimate objects, and create beings formed from the elements of earth, fire, wind, and water called \\"elementals\\". He also has alchemical potions which grant him teleportation for quick escapes.

A review in Rediff said about his performance: \\"Balakrishna has put in a restrained performance. Though his character is supposed to roar at times, he seems subdued most of the time. But he's given plenty to be pleased about as it is his show all the way.\\" In 2011, he acted in the mythological film Sri Rama Rajyam, based on the epic Ramayana. He played a triple role in the 2012 action drama Adhinayakudu as grandfather, father and grandson. Balakrishna was the chief guest for the 43rd International Film Festival of India, 2012. In 2014, he acted in Boyapati Srinu's film Legend, alongside Sonal Chauhan and Jagapati Babu. He played the title role in the biographical and historical film Gautamiputra Satakarni, his 100th film. The film is directed by Krish and is based on the life of the 2nd century ruler of the Satavahana Empire, Gautamiputra Satakarni. In 2018, he acted in Jai Simha, which was directed by K. S. Ravikumar and started shooting for the N.T.R. biopic in which he reprised the role of NTR. The film was made in two parts, and the first part was released on 9 January 2019, with the second on 22 February 2019. =Politics= Since the founding of the Telugu Desam Party, Balakrishna campaigned for it in every election, but didn't enter the electoral battle until 2014. During a vacation to his father-in-law's house, he went on a political campaign for TDP all over East Godavari district. He ran in the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections on behalf of TDP and won the Hindupur Assembly Constituency seat with a reasonable majority. Hindupur, in Anantapur district, has been a TDP stronghold since 1983. It was once represented by NTR himself and later for a term by his elder son Nandamuri Harikrishna and Balakrishna will be the third from the family to represent it in the State Assembly. =International Film Festival of India (IFFI)= . In 2012 the Governor of Goa, B.V. Wanchoo, the Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar and Balakrishna were seen along with award winners and other dignitaries at the closing ceremony of the 43rd edition of the IFFI. Balakrishna, in his speech, said that although the Telugu film industry finds no place in the film festival by way of representation its films, 80 percent of the movies that are produced in India are in regional languages, out of which 50 percent are from South India. \\"Today, film industry is facing competition from radio, and television as also from piracy,\\" he stated. He also maintained that the film festivals have enlarged his vision towards his career. Controversy Balakrishna was involved in a shooting controversy which took place on 3 June 2004 around 8:50 PM at Balakrishna's residence in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. He allegedly fired shots at producer B. Suresh and his associate, Satyanarayana Chowdhary. Later, both the wounded were admitted into Apollo hospital. The circumstances under which the case was handled led to controversy as purported by the Human Right Forum (HRF). The HRF questioned the authenticity of people who handled the case, and the circumstances under which Balakrishna was shielded from police by being given refuge in Care Hospital without any justifiable cause. The two victims gave statements before the magistrate, alleging that Balakrishna fired shots at them, but later retracted their earlier statements. Balakrishna was later arrested on 6 June and produced before Fifth Metropolitan Magistrate. A show cause notice was also served on Balakrishna's wife Vasundhara Devi as the weapon used was licensed under her name, and she could not give sufficient protection to her weapon. Later, Balakrishna was granted bail on conditions that he should not leave Hyderabad without Court's permission and to surrender his passport.

The Cultus Crescent was sold as such in Japan until May 1998, when it was renamed Suzuki Cultus due to the sales discontinuation of the previous Cultus in the Japanese market. The Cultus Crescent was also marketed as the Suzuki Esteem in North America, and as the Suzuki Baleno throughout Asia, Australasia, Europe, South America, and Puerto Rico. In India where it was manufactured by Maruti Suzuki, the Cultus Crescent was sold as the Maruti Suzuki Baleno. In the Philippines, the facelift model was marketed as the Chevrolet Cassia.  History  1995–1998 Suzuki Baleno hatchback (Germany) The Cultus Crescent was introduced in Japan in January 1995 and then to the global market in the first half of 1995. It was Suzuki's first attempt in the competitive compact segment. As a North American replacement for the Suzuki Cultus (Swift) sedan (the three-door hatchback remained after it was redesigned in 1995), it was built on a slightly stretched Cultus platform for improved cabin room, but otherwise sharing most of internal components with the smaller model—and marketed as a distinct model. The Cultus Crescent was initially available as a three-door hatchback and four-door sedan, with the SOHC 16-valve G-family engine, in 1.3- and 1.5-liter form, with power ranging from . The 1.3-liter was only offered in the hatch while a 1.6-liter with was only fitted to the sedan. Eventually, 4WD was offered with the 1.6-liter variant, basically the same engine as found in the Suzuki Escudo, with power raised to . A sports variant, dubbed GT, used Mazda's 1,840 cc BP engine, with . It was introduced in the spring of 1996, at the same time that the lineup was extended with the Baleno/Esteem Wagon (Maruti Baleno Altura in India). This was Suzuki's first station wagon (excluding kei cars), also with the same 1.6-liter, which also received the optional four-wheel drive in the wagon. The Suzuki Esteem was introduced in the Philippines in 1996 and was sold until 2000, and was initially only available as a wagon. Suzuki then dropped the \\"Esteem\\" name in favor of Chevrolet, who had just been returning in the Philippine-market to have at least one sedan model to compete with other popular Japanese-made sedans. = 1998 facelift = Suzuki Baleno interior (facelift; Pakistan) 1999 Suzuki Baleno wagon Suzuki restyled the Cultus Crescent and renamed it Cultus (for the Japanese market only) in mid-1998. In North America, the changeover took place with the 1999 model year. The car was given a new front end, with a rounder grille and new headlights, and the engine lineup was expanded to include Suzuki's J18A chain-driven DOHC engine that was fitted to the sedan and wagon. In North America, the Esteem 1.8-liter wagon completely replaced the Esteem 1.6, but in most markets the 1.8 sedan became the sports model. In some European markets, the 1.8-liter was installed in the hatchback and sold as the limited edition Baleno GSR. The Suzuki 1.8 had exactly the same displacement as the earlier Mazda BP engine, but was less powerful with only in European specifications.Automobil Revue 2002, p. 551 Europe also gained a diesel version, with a XUD9 engine supplied by Peugeot. The Cultus was replaced in most markets by the new Aerio/Liana, which was launched in 2001. In Japan, the sedan was discontinued in November 2001, although the wagon remained until August 2002. The entire range was pulled from the market in Europe and North America in 2002, after one year of overlapping with the Aerio/Liana. The car remained available in many developing countries, including India and Southeast Asia, where it was sold until 2007, when production stopped at the Maruti factory, with the assembly line giving way to the SX4 sedan. In the Philippines, the facelift model was introduced in 2000 as the Chevrolet Cassia. Suzuki chose to drop the Esteem in the market in favor of Chevrolet Philippines, who have been re-introduced at that time to have an entry-level sedan competing against other Japanese-made sedans. Chevrolet's first sedan to be offered in the country for a new decade was not a market success. The 1.6 SOHC 16V 4-cylinder which made 96 horsepower was the only Engine choice offered and had fewer features than the rest of its rivals. Its main competitors were the Ford Lynx, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, and the Mitsubishi Lancer. Due to poor sales, production ended in 2002, just 2 years after it was introduced. After it's discontinuation, the car was replaced by the Chevrolet Optra. In popular culture A yellow Suzuki Esteem (with one red door) is used as Jimmy McGill's car in the AMC TV show Better Call Saul.

In 1999 it was acquired by International Paper. Company creation Union Camp came about through the merger of the Union Bag and Paper Company and the Camp Manufacturing Company. Each of these family-owned companies had unique histories that led to the ultimate success of Union Camp until it was acquired by International paper. =Union Bag and Paper Company= Union Camp plant in Savannah The Union Bag and Paper Company's history dates back to 1881 where it began as the Union Paper Bag Machine Company in Bethlehem Pennsylvania under the Calder family.(Rouse 5) In the late 1920s, partially due to concerns about the labor union movement in the north, the company built a major mill (the largest in the world at the time and for many years) in Savannah, GA. This mill, and local politics, were the subject of Ralph Nader's book, The Water Lords. The company had a major impact on Savannah politics, but was highly respected in the area as having kept Savannah from many of the severe effects of the Great Depression. The Savannah mill has a public golf course, named after Mary Calder, wife of the founder. =Camp Manufacturing Company= The Camp Manufacturing Company was founded in 1887 by 3 local Camp brothers from Franklin, Virginia. Paul Douglas Camp (President), James Leonidas Camp (Vice- president) and Robert Judson Camp (secretary-treasurer) purchased a small sawmill on the outskirts of Franklin. Paul Douglas Camp built The Elms, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The sawmill was purchased from Dr. Jimmy Jordan of Como, North Carolina. Under Dr. Jim Jordan, Camp Manufacturing Company of Franklin prospered and steadily increased in volume. By 1949 it utilized four log trucks, each with several times the load capacity of the first one. The business was grossing about $90 thousand a year. With their new sawmill, they began expanding it and over the next 20 years experienced rapid growth. After a bout with near bankruptcy in 1907, the brothers borrowed the money necessary to continue operations. With the onset of World War I, the increased demand for lumber brought the company back to financial success. By 1918, the success of the company was obvious through the observations of the local community Franklin. With the stimulated economy, \\"Franklin has become a booming wartime village...\\"(Rouse 2) In 1925, with the passing of the final first generation Camps, the company was passed on to the second generation. This new generation brought the company into the paper production industry, starting with brown packaging paper in 1938 and eventually producing specialty bleached paper in the 1950s. By the mid 1950s, the industry competition was growing fierce with onset of extensive mergers within the industry and the Camp family needed resources to expand their capital intensive paper production. Until this time, the Camp family was in possession of 74% of slightly over a million shares of their company.(Rouse 3) Reluctant to forfeit this control by becoming a publicly traded company, the Camp family looked for other avenues. After meeting with several potential buyers, many who were disgusted at Hugh Camps high asking price, a buyer was found.(Rouse 4) =The merger= In May 1956, the merger between the 2 companies came together. With Union Bag company having sales of $123,031,000 and owning over a million acres (4,000 km²) of timber, it was surprising that the Camps negotiated as equals with the Calders, when the Camps had a fraction of the sales and property with $27,675,225 in sales and 240,000 acres (970 km²) of timber. After months of negotiations, and a final offering to the Camp shareholders of 1.75 shares for every share owned, a deal was struck. On 13 July 1956 the merger was completed and the Union Bag-Camp Paper company was born.(Rouse 6) In the late 1950s, a product made from kraft paper was created for applications such as a core in doors, aircraft construction, marine applications, etc., wherever strength with light weight and buoyancy were critical. The product was called \\"Honeycomb\\" and it was unique in that it resembled a beehive, with the edges of the cells giving overall greater strength wherever it was used. The size of the cells could be changed and the thickness of the sheets could be varied to suite the application. It could also be impregnated with resins to make it stronger and waterproof. The manufacturing plant for this product was at Glens Falls, New York and a technical staff was maintained there for architects and engineers. Also, at this site in Glens Falls, Union Camp maintained a cave-like storage facility where microfilms of all the company's important documents, such as contracts and legal papers, were sent after filming. The necessity or inspiration for such an operation was the Cold War. Honeycomb Department Executive Assistant to the Director from 1955 to 1961.

At the time it was referred to as a \\"merger,\\" but was actually a takeover. Union Camp's CEO at that time, W. Craig McClelland had actually sold another paper company to International Paper in the mid-1980s, when he was also in charge of that company.

It was founded at least before 1844, when Holy Rosary Church was founded. The cornerstone for the present church was laid November 2, 1844. Holy Rosary, a mission church, is a brick building on Hardin's Creek close to the Beech Fork River. Rev. Victor Francis O'Daniel O.P.M. mentions in his book \\"A Light Of The Church In Kentucky\\" (copyright 1932) on page 140 that a station \\"... was possibly that of Wilfred Fields, where now stands Holy Rosary Church, Manton (or Blincoe)\\". This village was once known as Blincoe as is identified as such in the 1896 Kentucky Gazetteer. Richard Blincoe was a resident at that time. It was known as Blincoe until (at least) the mid-1900s, as it appears on as such on the 1949 official Kentucky highway map for Washington County. (map as .tiff file) Derivation of the name of this town has been attributed to the surnames of William Frederick Mandt and his wife, Mary Ann Harrington; however, the Kentucky town and U.S.Post Office named in their honor was Manton, Floyd County, Kentucky, ZIP Code (now inactive) 41648. The Mandt Family of Manton, Floyd County, were generous supporters of Catholic religious and educational interests in the region of Nelson and Washington Counties in the early-to-mid-Twentieth Century, and it has been suggested that Blincoe was redesignated as \\"Manton\\" in recognition of their support. However, Mr. and Mrs. Mandt were married in 1894, and any appearance of the name \\"Manton\\" prior to that time is not attributable to their family.

Geography Manton is located at (37.714722, -85.35827). The elevation is above sea level. The community is located along Route 605, near where the Cisselville road intersects. It is a few miles north of Loretto where Maker's Mark whiskey is distilled. History There was a station house on the Beech Fork, a small river, where farmers would store their cattle and produce. In the springtime these waters would flood, providing a waterway which lead first to the Salt River, then to the Ohio River and thence by flatboat the boatsmen could make their way to New Orleans. Some companies of men from the Tenth Kentucky Infantry were mustered into Union service having come from the village of Manton. Most of the men from the Manton area were in Company G. John Hunt Morgan, the Confederate raider, passed through this area on some of his raids into Kentucky. The town is also mentioned in the biography \\"Three Years in the Saddle – the Life and Confession of Henry C. Magruder\\" - \\"The original 'Sue Munday'\\" - \\"The Scourge of Kentucky\\".

Discovery Unlike the histamine receptors discovered earlier, H4 was found in 2000 through a search of the human genomic DNA data base. Tissue distribution H4 is highly expressed in bone marrow and white blood cells and regulates neutrophil release from bone marrow and subsequent infiltration in the zymosan-induced pleurisy mouse model. It was also found that H4R exhibits a uniform expression pattern in the human oral epithelium. Salem A, Rozov S, Al-Samadi A, et al. Histamine metabolism and transport are deranged in human keratinocytes in oral lichen planus. Br J Dermatol. 2016. Available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.14995. Function The Histamine H4 receptor has been shown to be involved in mediating eosinophil shape change and mast cell chemotaxis. This occurs via the βγ subunit acting at phospholipase C to cause actin polymerisation and eventually chemotaxis. Structure The 3D structure of the H4 receptor has not been solved yet due to the difficulties of GPCR crystallization. Some attempts have been made to develop structural models of the H4 receptor for different purposes. The first H4 receptor model was built by homology modelling based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin. This model was used for the interpretation of site-directed mutagenesis data, which revealed the crucial importance of Asp94 (3.32) and Glu182 (5.46) residues in ligand binding and receptor activation. A second rhodopsin based structural model of the H4 receptor was successfully used for the identification of novel H4 ligands. Recent advancements in GPCR crystallization, in particular the determination of the human histamine H1 receptor in complex with doxepin will likely increase the quality of novel structural H4 receptor models.

He currently resides in Heidelberg in his native Germany. After working as a backing vocalist for the Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt and 3P label mates Sabrina Setlur and Illmat!c, Naidoo released his first German-language album Nicht von dieser Welt in 1998, for which he won an ECHO Award and an MTV Europe Music Award. Selling more than one million copies in total, it produced six singles, including \\"Seine Straßen\\" and \\"Sie sieht mich nicht\\", the latter of which served as the theme song for Astérix & Obélix Take on Caesar (1999). After his highly publicized departure from 3P, his third studio album Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn was released in 2002. It spawned the top five hit singles \\"Wo willst du hin?\\" and \\"Abschied nehmen\\" and led to a collaboration with Wu-Tang Clan member and producer RZA, with whom he released his first number-one single \\"Ich kenne nichts (das so schön ist wie du)\\" in 2003.

Claudia Roth, a vice-president of the Bundestag for the German Green Party, also criticised the decision, citing the poor timing, with right wing political causes gaining popularity in the wake of the migrant crisis. On 21 November, German broadcaster NDR revealed that Germany had withdrawn the singer's participation. Political views Xavier Naidoo has blamed the Rothschild family for Germany's 20th century history and has spoken at a meeting of the Reichsbürgerbewegung, the right-wing movement that seeks to restore Germany's pre-1918 borders, denies the legal existence of the Federal Republic of Germany and claims Germany is a country occupied by enemy, foreign forces. During the event he also denied the official account of the September 11 attacks, stating that \\"simply put, whoever believes what was reported about this event is not seeing clearly\\".https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/xavier-naidoo-pop-saenger- richtet-sich-an-verschwoerer-klientel-a-995909.html Naidoo gave similar opinions in a live interview on ARD-Morgenmagazin, public service breakfast television in 2015. In March 2020 two video clips of Naidoo were released on social media, showing him singing one of his songs in the aftermath of the anti-migrant 2018 Chemnitz protests with altered lyrics. In these he stated about the migrants who recently arrived in Germany: \\"Your daughters, your children shall suffer; Shall have to undress next to wolves in the gym; While you stand around placidly doing nothing\\" and \\"Far and wide, not a man in sight, who can save this country yet\\".Aufregung um Xavier Naidoo, ntv.de vom 11. März 2020; abgerufen am 11. März 2020Zweites Xavier-Naidoo-Video aufgetaucht, ntv.de vom vom 11. März 2020 Naidoo was subsequently fired by the TV-station RTL where he worked as a judge on the casting show Deutschland sucht den Superstar.RTL schmeißt Xavier Naidoo raus; ntv.de vom 11. März 2020; abgerufen am 11. März 2020 Naidoo also propagates climate change denial. He claims the Fridays for Future movement is orchestrated by the Antichrist. According to Naidoo the proof is to be found in the name of the movement, which abbreviates to \\"FFF\\", the letter \\"F\\" being the sixth in the alphabet, therefore symbolizing the number of the beast.https://www.n-tv.de/leute/Naidoo-verteufelt-Fridays-for-Future- article21641712.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm;_medium=twitter&utm;_campaign=ntvde Naidoo also denies the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a strong opponent of the obligation to wear facemasks in certain public places, that was introduced by the German government. He voiced these opinions in a video he published via Telegram in July 2020. In this same video, Naidoo announced his intention to sue the German government over its alleged faking of the pandemic. Musical themes =Ethos= Naidoo's music has been claimed to feature a utopian, pan-theistic ideology through which he expressed his own political anxieties and stances. Although he explores Christian, Muslim, and Rastafarian modes of living, his work has been asserted to be strongly grounded in Old Testament narratives and apocalyptic sentiments. Applying these to situations faced specifically in a \\"Black German\\" context, Naidoo has called for solutions not from the state, but from cross-cultural spiritual collectives. For example, in the lyrics and video for \\"Seine Strassen\\", the power of the state in terms of protection and surveillance is said to pale in comparison to higher spiritual powers. However his lyrics have also featured anti-semitic slurs\\"Antisemitische Liedzeilen: Xavier Naidoo verbreitet judenfeindliche Klischees\\" in Huffington Post, accessed 23 November 2015) and homophobic sentiments. His 2012 song \\"Wo sind\\" implied that homosexuals were pedophiles.\\"Germany withdraws Eurovision contender after uproar on anti- Semitic, homophobic lyrics\\", Jerusalem Post, accessed 23 November 2015. =Mixed German and Asian identity= Although Naidoo does not engage directly with his own mixed German and Asian identity in his music, he was integral to the formation of an Afro-German presence in German popular culture. Specifically, his work with Glashaus can be said to have originated a distinctly Afro-German form of R&B;, one which addressed the issues faced by Black Germans without invoking Black Germans specifically. Not only did Naidoo experiment with sounds from around the Black Diaspora, notably working with RZA, but was also a member of Brothers Keepers, an explicitly Afro-German and explicitly political collective. As lead singer on \\"Adriano\\", one of Brothers Keepers' most well-known songs, he has been seen to stand with the Afro-German collective and setting the tone for their message.

In the spring of 1413, John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy, managed to raise the people of Paris and impose a reform called the Cabochien ordinance. However, after several months, Parisians desiring a return to order supported return of the Armagnacs. On 23 November 1407, Louis, Duke of Orléans, brother of king Charles VI (known as \\"Charles the Beloved\\" and \\"Charles the Mad\\"), was murdered by masked assassins in the service of John the Fearless. Afterwards, John acquired considerable popularity among the population of Paris. He aligned himself with a popular faction of butchers, the écorcheurs (flayers), named “Cabochiens”, after their commander, a butcher named Simon Lecoustellier, known as Simon Caboche. This group had its origins among butchers of the Grande Boucherie de Paris, a relatively wealthy class of tradespeople not integrated within Parisian high & aristocratic class. In April 1413, in a bid to gain power, John the Fearless encouraged the Cabochiens to revolt. Riotous mobs, sporting distinctive white caps, assaulted Armagnac noblemen and followers, and their properties throughout the city. On April 27, they seized the Bastille Saint-Antoine and took prisoner its defender, Pierre des Essarts, Provost of Paris. (Pierre des Essarts was beheaded the following 13 July.) They also forced their way into the Hôtel Saint-Pol, the royal residence, arrested several of the king's men, and incarcerated them in the various prisons of Paris. They controlled Paris for four months, until the last days of July and beginning of August, when the revolt was put down. Academics took this opportunity to propose administrative reforms known as the “Ordonnance cabochienne\\", which limited the power of the monarch, giving, for example, greater fiscal control to the Estates General. Although the ordinance carried the name of Caboche, because it was published on 26–27 May 1413 during the Cabochian revolt, it had been prepared in January–February 1413 by the États généraux de Langue d'Oïl.Coville, Alfred, L'Ordonnance cabochienne (20-27 mai 1413), Editeur Alphonse Picard, Paris, 1891, p. 1 It was actually the work of advisors of John of Burgundy who imposed the ordinance on Charles VI, who signed it on 22 May 1413. However, the exactions of the Cabochiens and of the Burgundians were causing increasing dissatisfaction among the population who began to rise against the Cabochiens. On 2–3 August, the Cabochiens revolt was over. The Cabochiens who were unable to flee were executed and the ordinance was overturned on 5 September 1413. Simon Caboche was able to escape with the Duke of Burgundy. Charles d’Orléans, son of the murdered duke of Orléans, had married Bonne d’Armagnac, daughter of the count Bernard VII of Armagnac. The count was a brutal and powerful lord who commanded a number of troops from the Adour and Garonne. Putting himself at the disposal of his son-in-law, he took control of Paris. In recognition of his help, Bernard VII d'Armagnac was made Constable of France on 30 December 1415 in a letter signed by Charles VI.

In the first season, the show features a same-sex couple that plans to marry; the arrangements for the wedding are prepared, on two weeks' notice, by a team of wedding planners who are both heterosexual and homosexual. As with typical, Western heterosexual weddings, the general idea is to create a unique experience that reflects the personality of the people to be wed, while adding a special gay sensibility. The spirit of the program is one of fun. In the second season, with new host Elvira Kurt, the stories concentrate more on the couples than the wedding planning process. The team of wedding planners has been reduced to one: Fern Cohen. This season debuted on Logo in February 2007.

He is an artificial dragon- like humanoid android who was animated via alchemy. Publication history Dragon Man first appeared in Fantastic Four #35 (February 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Dragon Man is an android built by Professor Gregson Gilbert of Empire State University as an experiment. Gregson hoped to find a way to bring it to life. He could not find a way to do this until the alchemist Diablo arrived and brought it to life under his partial control using his supernatural powers. However, Dragon Man broke his control and attempted to kill Diablo. Although Dragon Man is slow-minded to the point that he is incapable of speech, he understands orders given by Diablo and is a determined foe of the Fantastic Four (although the creature has always displayed a King Kong-like affection towards Sue Richards). Dragon Man is not especially malicious, although he is easily manipulated and provoked to violence. After his first activation, Dragon Man was later revived. He encountered Medusa and Gorgon, and fought the Thing and Human Torch.Fantastic Four #44-47 Dragon Man was later studied by Hank Pym at his laboratory. He was restored to life again by Diablo and was defeated by Pym as Goliath and escaped.Avengers #41 Dragon Man battled Hercules and the Avengers destroyed Diablo's army of Dragon Men.Avengers #42 Dragon Man was once found by the original X-Men and was considered an unofficial mascot of sorts.

However, Komodo was able to use Dragon Man's attraction to her to convince him to switch sides.Avengers: The Initiative #27 Following this, he seemingly reforms, as he, Artie and Leech were seen at Franklin Richards' birthday party.Fantastic Four #574 He has since been upgraded by Valeria Richards and joined Reed Richards' Future Foundation. Valeria used her talents to upgrade Dragon Man to have super-intellect and have the power of human speech. Dragon Man would become an adopted member of the Future Foundation and guardian of the gifted children in that program.Fantastic Four #579 As part of the Marvel NOW! event, Dragon Man created the Thing Rings for Darla Deering to wear which enables her to become Miss Thing upon some particles enabling her to transform into her Thing Exoskeleton (which was also modified by Dragon Man).Marvel NOW! Point One #1 Powers and abilities Dragon Man gains its powers from its robotic materials, design, and construction, as well as unknown alchemical potions used by Diablo. Dragon Man is superhumanly strong and durable. He is able to stand toe to toe with the likes of Hercules and the Hulk in combat situations. He can use the wings on his back to fly. He can also exhale methane gas (produced by his digestive system) which can be ignited by striking together his specialized teeth, producing flame hot enough to melt iron. The Dragon Man originally could military press sixty tons. Since it was a machine imbued with magic the artificial creature never grows tired. It can recharge itself by eating organic materials, and its wings did not allow it to fly. It uses two anti gravity generators located in its body to propel itself. Its large wings give it great mobility in the air. Dragon Man was initially non-sentient, but had the capacity for limited self-motivated activity. Dragon Man has been reprogrammed by Valeria Richards and now has super-intellect and the capability of human speech. Dragon Man is vulnerable to intense cold and certain ultrasonic frequencies.

Hammond is primarily known for his work with NBC Sports from 1984 to the present. Hammond is one of the network's staple on-air presenters, along with Bob Costas and Dan Hicks. Hammond is best known for his coverage of Thoroughbred Racing on NBC, coverage of Notre Dame Football on NBC from 1992 to 2012 and his coverage of the NFL on NBC from 1985 to 2011. Hammond also served as the play-by-play announcer for NBC's coverage of track and field at each Summer Olympics from 1992 to 2016. He also announced the speed skating events during the 2018 Winter Olympics. Early career Hammond earned a B.S. in animal science in 1967 from the University of Kentucky, specializing in equine genetics and following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Thomas Poe Cooper, a former dean of the UK College of Agriculture and a former Acting President of UK. He began his career with WVLK Radio, where he was news and sports director. In 1970 and for the next 10 years, he was sports director for WLEX- TV. In 1980, he was named a play-by-play announcer for Southeastern Conference basketball games. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he served as a sales announcer at the Keeneland Thoroughbred Sales and at thoroughbred horse sales in 16 other states. He is recognized as a specialist and national expert on thoroughbred pedigrees. Hammond was the lead play-by-play commentator for Southeastern Conference men's basketball broadcasts by TVS (1980–1983), SPI/Lorimar (1984–1986) and Raycom Sports (formerly Lincoln Financial Sports and Jefferson Pilot Sports) from 1987 until 2009. Hammond had known his color commentator on the Lincoln Financial broadcasts, Larry Conley, since junior high school. NBC Sports Hammond's tenure at NBC began in 1984, when he was named as a co-host of the inaugural Breeders' Cup alongside Dick Enberg. It was supposed to be a one-shot deal for Hammond, but network execs were so impressed, he ended up getting a long-term contract. He was the main host of the network's thoroughbred racing coverage until Mike Tirico took over in 2017. Hammond's duties at NBC expanded to covering many other sports. He was the network's play-by-play voice for its coverage of Notre Dame football alongside analyst Mike Mayock. He was also the lead play-by-play man for The AFL on NBC. Hammond also has been very much involved in NBC's Olympic Games coverage. At the Summer Olympics, Hammond served as the chief commentator for track and field, a position for which he debuted at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where his broadcast partner that year was O.J. Simpson. Hammond has since said that, prior to the O.J. Simpson murder case, he and Simpson were great friends and got along well. Hammond also commentates on other track and field events shown on NBC. At the Winter Olympics, Hammond is the main commentator for figure skating and ice dancing. Hammond is sort of unique in that, unlike most of his NBC Sports colleagues, he does not live in or around the New York City area, opting to stay in his hometown of Lexington, a decision he made during his early days at NBC. Hammond isn't alone in this choice; despite being a New York native himself, Costas lives in St. Louis, Missouri. Hammond was considered the leading play-by-play candidate when NBC won the bidding for Sunday night NFL coverage beginning with the 2006 season, but ended up losing out to former ABC announcer Al Michaels after the latter signed with NBC. Hammond teamed with Cris Collinsworth to call the secondary Saturday Wild Card playoff game for NBC each year, including Chiefs-Colts in January 2007, Redskins-Seahawks in 2008, and Falcons-Cardinals in 2009, but teamed with Joe Gibbs and Joe Theismann for the Jets-Bengals Wild Card playoff game in January 2010, as Cris Collinsworth partnered with Al Michaels in the 2009 season due to the retirement of John Madden after the 2008 season. Hammond also filled in for Bryant Gumbel as play-by-play announcer on the NFL Network's December 13, 2007 game featuring the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans on Thursday Night Football, once more teaming with Collinsworth. Hammond and Collingsworth also serve as the announcing team on the Madden NFL video game in 2009 and 2010. and Madden NFL 10. The game is notable for how he mispronounced the name of then-Oakland Raiders cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha. Hammond's work at NBC also included play-by-play commentary for The NBA on NBC and The NFL on NBC. He called gymnastics, figure skating, the WNBA, the Orange Bowl and college basketball. Health issues Over the past few years, Hammond's health has somewhat deteriorated. On March 24, 2001, under two months before NBC was supposed to broadcast the Kentucky Derby for the very first time, he underwent an operation for diverticulitis, a disease that affects the colon. During the surgery, a portion of Hammond's colon was removed. However, even with the short amount of time between the Derby and his operation, Hammond managed to get healthy enough to make his dream of broadcasting his home state's most famous sporting event become a reality on May 5, 2001. Hammond wasn't so lucky in October 2002, when he underwent open- heart surgery. He ended up missing the Breeders' Cup that year. Bob Costas took Hammond's place at the hosting desk. It was the only Breeders' Cup Hammond was not a part of until 2006, when ESPN had their first year of coverage. Personal life Hammond and his wife, Sheilagh, have three grown children, sons David and Christopher and daughter Ashley. David has followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a radio commentator for Syracuse University's basketball and football teams and working as a play-by-play announcer for The AFL on NBC. Honors and awards Hammond has been awarded horse race broadcasting's top honor, the Eclipse Award (Media category), in 1984 and 1996. He was awarded an Emmy Award for coverage of the 1992 Breeder's Cup. He also won Emmys for sports broadcasting in 1988 (men's and women's basketball), 1992 (Olympics coverage of track and field and diving), and 1996 (Olympics Track and Field). He was the first recipient of the annual Outstanding Kentuckian Award given by the A.B. Chandler Foundation, is a charter member of the Lafayette High School Hall of Fame and has been inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame, University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame. Inducted into the KY Pro Football HOF in 2006.

The screenplay by James Clavell and Edward Anhalt was loosely based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Alistair MacLean, written under the pseudonym Ian Stuart. The film score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The film featured the first use of a stabilized camera mount, invented by Nelson Tyler, placed on a helicopter.P. 49 Montandon, Mac Jetpack Dreams Da Capo Press 2008https://www.provideocoalition.com/cameras-in-the-sky/ Plot Lee Barrett, a private investigator and former intelligence agent discharged for his outspoken views, is approached by a man with a tempting offer to join a political organization opposing bioweapons. His refusal proves the correct response, as the man is an impersonator sent by his former boss, Eric Cavanaugh, to test his loyalty. Barrett is asked by Cavanaugh to investigate the murder of the security chief of Station Three, a top-secret bioweapons laboratory in the desert of southern California—and the disappearance of its director and head scientist, Dr. Baxter. After they arrive at the station and wait for a time lock on the sealed laboratory to open, they are advised by another scientist, Dr. Gregor Hoffman, to seal the laboratory using concrete. Hoffman informs them that there are two lethal bioweapons in the laboratory, a strain of botulinus that oxidizes eight hours after its release, and a recently developed virus that he calls the \\"Satan Bug\\", which could kill all life on Earth in a matter of months. Determined to discover what happened in the room and taking extreme precautions, Barrett enters to find Dr. Baxter dead, with the vials containing the \\"Satan Bug\\" and 1200 grams of botulinus missing. A mysterious telegram leads Barrett to a nearby hotel where he has a surprise reunion with his old flame, Ann, the daughter of his superior, General Williams, who has flown in from Washington to supervise the investigation. Ann reveals that she sent the telegram, and that she has been assigned to Barrett as his partner, an arrangement neither minds. At her father's home, Barrett's speculation that a lunatic with a messiah complex is behind the theft is confirmed by a telegram, threatening to release the viruses unless Station Three is destroyed. Barrett and Ann discover another scientist from the station (not heard from since the theft) is lying dead in his swimming pool. A phone call to the scientist's home reveals the name Charles Reynolds Ainsley, a reclusive millionaire crackpot and pharmaceutical tycoon who fits Barrett's profile and quickly becomes the focus of the investigation. After a demonstration incident in Florida proves the thieves' willingness to use the botulinus, General Williams receives a phone call threatening to release more of the toxin in Los Angeles County unless Station Three is closed. The caller hangs up before he can be traced, but not before confirming that he is Charles Reynolds Ainsley. A police tip brings Barrett and Ann to the location of where a car broke down and was left abandoned during the evening of the theft. Deducing that the driver was involved, Barrett with Ann's help locates an airtight steel box containing the missing vials in a nearby stream, only to be confronted by two armed men, the thieves. They are taken with the box to the home of Dr. Hoffman, the other conspirator in the theft, who decides to take them hostage, unaware that they are being followed. It transpires that Veritti and Donald, the two men working with Hoffman, have hidden some vials with a time activating device in Los Angeles. At some point, the flask containing the \\"Satan Bug\\" is separated from the others by Hoffman, leaving the rest with Veritti and Donald, along with the hostages, despite an attempt by Barrett and Ann to overpower them. Soon the henchmen realize that they are being shadowed by two security agents in a car. After a confrontation at an abandoned gas station, Veritti and Donald decide to lock the two agents along with Barrett and Ann in the garage. Realizing that the thugs intend to kill them, Barrett persuades them to keep Ann as a hostage, and as they leave they shatter one of the vials. Though both agents are killed, Barrett survives by forcing an exit and setting the garage afire. After an unsuccessful attempt to radio for help, he stops a passing car being driven by Hoffman, who has pulled a double cross on his own men. Barrett makes a deal to learn the location of the flasks in Los Angeles in return for the closure of Station Three, aware by now that Hoffman is actually Ainsley. After they hear an announcement on the car radio reporting the closure of Station Three (which Barrett knows is false, having arranged it earlier), they are intercepted by two men revealing themselves as security agents. Arresting Ainsley, they take him and Barrett in their car towards Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Veritti and Donald are killed at a roadblock in trying to escape, the flasks they are carrying are safely retrieved, and Anne is reunited with her father, who assures her Barrett may still be alive, his body not having been found at the gas station. Barrett has realized that the \\"agents\\" driving him and Ainsley are more of Ainsley's security guards on their way to rendezvous with a helicopter flying above them. After single-handedly taking them down, he again confronts Ainsley, who threatens to break the flask containing the \\"Satan Bug\\", telling Barrett that he waited to steal the virus until the vaccine could be isolated, which is why Baxter and the other scientist were murdered. Now that the vaccine is in his blood, Ainsley is immune. He declares his willingness to destroy the world and then live on in it alone rather than give up the power he holds. The helicopter lands, piloted by another of Ainsley's men. Another uneasy deal is made between Barrett and Ainsley, and they fly off, eventually finding themselves above Los Angeles as it is being evacuated. In the meantime, a cryptic doodle left by Veritti leads Ann and the authorities to surmise that the other vials are hidden at the Los Angeles baseball stadium, and during an intense search, they are located in the ice of a concession stand, attached to a bomb. Above in the helicopter, Barrett notes it is flying past Los Angeles, meaning Ainsley is pulling another double-cross. Barrett fights with the pilot who tries to throw him out of the helicopter, only to be thrown out instead. Barrett is in danger of falling out after him, but manages to pull himself back to safety. During the fight, Ainsley drops the flask containing the \\"Satan Bug\\", and as it is about to tumble out, Barrett grabs it at the last second. Having served as an army rescue helicopter pilot, Barrett successfully takes over the controls, then covers Ainsley with a gun, pointing out he has nothing now. Ainsley throws himself out of the helicopter rather than reveal the location of the missing vials, unaware that they are now safely disarmed. After contacting Ann and his superiors, Barrett prepares to land, commenting things are back to where they started.

Early life Shanker was born on Manhattan’s Lower East Side (New York City) to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. As a toddler, his family moved to Long Island City, in Queens. His parents, Mamie and Morris Shanker, were emigrants from Poland. Both were union members; his father was a union newspaper deliveryman, and his mother, who operated a sewing-machine in a knitting factory, was a member of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. The Shanker family's deeply held political views were staunchly pro-union, following the socialism of Norman Thomas and including ardent support of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. The experience of watching his mother work 70-hour weeks made Shanker aware from an early age that there was a need for societal changes. Shanker read several newspapers daily as a young boy, with an interest in philosophy. His idols were Franklin D. Roosevelt, Clarence Darrow, civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin, and American philosopher Sydney Hook. In 1946, Shanker graduated from Stuyvesant High School, where he was the head of the debate team, and went to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He joined the Congress of Racial Equality. Shanker picketed segregated movie theaters and restaurants and was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and chairperson of the Socialist Study Club. In 1949, he graduated with honors and enrolled in Columbia University. In order to earn money while writing his dissertation, Shanker became a substitute teacher at Public School 179 on Manhattan's upper West Side. Founding the United Federation of Teachers Shanker took a year off after graduating from college and taught mathematics at an East Harlem school from 1952 to 1959. He began his tenure as a union organizer in 1959 to help organize the Teacher's Guild, a New York City affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers that was founded by John Dewey in 1917. Eventually, the Teacher's Guild merged with New York City's High School Teacher's Association to form the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) in 1960. During the 1960s, Shanker received national attention and considerable criticism for his aggressive union leadership and skillful negotiation of salary increases for New York City teachers. He left his teaching job to become a full-time union organizer. He felt that a teachers' union would be more effective if it were united with a common set of goals. In 1964, Shanker succeeded Charles Cogen as the UFT president, a position he held until 1985. In 1967 and again in 1968, he served jail sentences for leading illegal teachers' strikes. The New York City teacher's strike of 1968 closed down almost all New York City schools for 36 days. Perhaps Shanker is best known for opposing community-control leaders in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district of New York City, which led to the 1968 strike after white teachers were dismissed from the school district by the recently appointed black administrator. For more than a decade, Shanker wrote more than 1,300 columns in The New York Times and essays in other publications. Accompanied by a small photograph of Shanker, the Times columns, titled \\"Where We Stand,\\" sought to clarify the union's position on matters of public interest. Activist legacy Despite Shanker's organizing efforts and the 15 days that he spent in jail due to his organization activities, he was branded a racist by critics. Yet he persisted in building the United Federation of Teachers and was elected president of the American Federation of Teachers in 1974. He was re-elected every two years until his death. In 1975, the UFT authorized a five-day strike, leading to allegedly saving New York City from bankruptcy after Shanker asked the Teachers' Retirement System to invest $150 million in municipal bonds. On September 21, 1981, Shanker had dinner with Leon B. Applewhaite, a personal friend and one of the three members of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). Applewhaite was involved in deciding whether to uphold the decertification of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization for the strike they had called in August of that year. During the dinner, Shanker urged Applewhaite not to decertify the union, an action which plainly violated the prohibition on the ex parte contact contained in the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Although the contact was not ultimately found to have legal consequences, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized Shanker's behavior in their review of the FLRA's decision. (See 685 F.2d 547.) In 1988, Shanker was the first to propose charter schools in the U.S. He was inspired by a visit to a public school in Cologne, Germany, in which teams of teachers had considerable control over how the school was run, and about what and how to teach. They stayed with each class of students for six years. The schools were integrated by ethnic and economic origins, and were originally intended to focus on the neediest students, drop-outs and those most likely to drop out soon. In 1993, Shanker turned against the charter school idea when he realized that for-profit organizations saw it as a business opportunity and were advancing an agenda of school privatization. Indeed, the charter schools that were finally established in the U.S. were different from Shanker's vision. \\"On average, charter schools are even more racially and economically segregated than traditional public schools,\\" according to an opinion piece in the New York Times explaining Shanker's views.The Original Charter School Vision, By RICHARD D. KAHLENBERG and HALLEY POTTER, New York Times, AUG. 30, 2014 Opponents of the Vietnam war have criticized Shanker and other AFL-CIO leaders for supporting the war in Vietnam and other anti-Communist aspects of U.S. foreign policy. Later years Shanker was a visiting professor at Hunter College and Harvard University during the 1980s. He continued to work toward organizing teachers throughout his life and attempted to bridge the AFT with the National Education Association, which he never saw happen. In 1991, U.S. President George H. W. Bush appointed him as a member of the original Competitiveness Policy Council.

The body is pushed over the shoulders to enable straight vertical arms, stretching the shoulders and upper body The bridge (also called gymnastic bridgehttp://people.com/celebrity/5-year-old-girl-paralyzed-after-backbend- begins-road-to-recovery/) is an exercise. Many variations of this exercise are employed throughout the world, most commonly the balancing of the body on the hands and the feet. It is intended to improve lower back and gluteus strength. Examples of bridging in sportive or self-defense applications are seen in Kung Fu, Judo, Brazilian jiu jitsu, Capoeira, mixed martial arts, and wrestling. In yoga, this particular pose is called Chakrasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana, or Wheel, while the Westernized nickname \\"Bridge pose\\" refers to a less rigorous supine backbend called Setu Bandha Sarvangasana, in which the body is fairly straight from knees to shoulders, and most of the bend is in the knees. Muscles worked The bridge is frequently compared to the deadlift in terms of which muscles the exercises work, and as such the bridge could be considered the bodyweight exercise equivalent to the weight training deadlift. Just like its weight training counterpart, the bridge primarily works muscles which are part of the posterior chain, but also many important muscles of the anterior chain. A major difference between these two exercises is that the bridge tends to emphasise the upper, superior portion of the posterior chain, while the deadlift in turn heavily empasises the lower, inferior portion of the posterior chain. The following list of muscles only includes the largest and most significant muscles worked in the movement, and is not exhaustive. =Spinal erectors= The erector spinae muscles are the ones primarily worked during bridging. These muscles stretch all the way down the spine and work to extend the spinal column when they contract. The spinal erectors are also considered to be the posterior core muscles, and counteract the contraction of the rectus abdominis in order to stabilise the core region during bridging. =Rectus abdominis= The rectus abdominis, colloquially the abdominals or \\"abs\\", works to counteract the contraction of the spinal erectors in order to stabilise the core region. =Deltoids= An effect which is almost unique to the bridge is that it works the posterior head of the deltoideus muscle, being the only common compound exercise to do so with the exception of the weight training row. =Gluteal muscles= Similar to the deadlift, the bridge also works the gluteal muscles which work to extend the spine as well as the femur. =Hamstrings= The second large muscle group primarily worked by the bridge, although with less emphasis than the deadlift, are the hamstring muscles. They extend from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis to the heads of tibia and fibula, and work to flex the knee joint. =Quadriceps= Just like with the core muscles, the quadriceps muscles work to counteract the contraction of the hamstring muscles in order to stabilise the femural region. Variations The bridging exercise is not a singular movement, but includes a wide range of variations and progressions. There is no single agreed upon \\"standard\\" variation of the bridge like with other common bodyweight exercises. =Bridge hold= The bridge hold is a static variation of the bridge exercise that involves getting into the full bridge as shown at the top of the article and holding the position, either for time or until exhaustion. This variation is possibly the most frequent variation of the bridge around the world, but is most commonly used in Calisthenics circles to build strength in order to progress to some of the more difficult bridge variations. =Bridge push-up= The bridge push-up involves lying on the ground on the back with the feet pulled up to the buttocks and palms of the hands against the ground on either side of the head, followed by \\"pushing\\" the entire body upwards with both arms and feet. The practitioner then pulls the body back to the original position and repeats the whole movement for a set amount of repetitions, or until exhaustion. This is also one of the ways to get into the bridge hold position, along with the closing bridge below. =One-armed bridge push-up= A great amount of further difficulty can be introduced to the regular bridge push-up by executing the movement only supported by one arm. This also introduces unilaterality to the movement, primarily working only one side of the spinal erectors, and especially only one of the deltoids. =One-legged bridge push- up= Just like above, the bridge push-up can also be executed with one leg extended. When this is done, not only is unilaterality introduced, but the hamstrings and glutes (as well as other muscles of the lower extremities worked by the bridge) are worked far more. =Wall walking= Wall walking is another popular bridge variation that involves standing with one's back to a wall at a varying distance, followed by leaning backwards until one can press one's palms into the wall from behind. The practitioner then proceeds to \\"walk\\" with their hands along the wall all the way down to the floor. To make the exercise more difficult, one can also finish the movement by proceeding to \\"walk\\" all the way back up again, then pushing off the wall with the arms back into the original standing position. This can be done for several repetitions. =Closing bridge= The closing bridge involves standing straight up with varying foot distance, then slowly leaning further and further backwards with the arms reaching back, until one comes all the way down into a standing bridge. This is the typical way that gymnasts go into the bridge hold position above, but is also an excellent strength exercise in itself when done for multiple repetitions. =Stand-to-stand bridge= This variation is considered by some to be the most advanced variation of the bridge, and is by far the one that requires the most strength. It involves performing a full closing bridge as above, followed by \\"opening\\" the bridge again by either pushing off the floor with the arms or coming back into standing position relying solely on the muscles in the torso and legs. Furthermore, unilaterality can be introduced to this variation by performing the whole movement with only one arm.

High Desert State Prison contains 12 housing units designed to house 336 inmates each. Each of units 1-8 are separated into four (4) sections called \\"pods\\". Each set of two \\"pods\\" shares a common control center and staff office. Each set of two pods also shares a sally port and an activity room. There is also a 26,000-square foot (2,400 m2) infirmary at the institution. All of the facility is located at site which is kept secure by a lethal electrified fence and seven armed towers, as well as a roving perimeter patrol officer. Construction completed in 2009 added 1,344 beds to the original 2671, for a total capacity of 4,176. The Tonopah Conservation Camp is associated with the prison. The Clark County School District provides the education program on site using 8 classrooms and 2 libraries. History The institution opened on 1 September 2000 and became the reception unit for southern Nevada. This facility was designed to be the first of several prisons to be built at this location. The facility presented many design challenges, such as electrical backup and water supply, and there have been difficulties in staff retention due to the remote location. The closest populated area to the prison is Indian Springs, north of the prison. To date, there have been two expansions. The first expansion, completed in 2004, added a prison industries building and a gymnasium. The second expansion added four more housing units.

The company was incorporated in 1936 to organize the ownership of a large tract of land that was consolidated from four Mexican land grants acquired in the 1850s and 1860s by ranch founder General Edward Fitzgerald Beale. The company now owns over 270,000 acres (1,093 km2) in the southern San Joaquin Valley, Tehachapi Mountains, and Antelope Valley. It is the largest contiguous piece of private property in the state. Tejon Ranch’s agricultural operation primarily grows almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes, along with some alfalfa and the occasional row crop.

History In 1843, the Mexican government made grants for the land that became three ranches: the Rancho Los Alamos y Agua Caliente; the Rancho El Tejon; and the Rancho Castac. A fourth tract, the Rancho La Liebre, was granted in 1846. At the urging of Edward Beale, Superintendent of Indian Affairs in California, the Sebastian Indian Reservation was established in 1853 on Rancho El Tejon, and Fort Tejon was established by the U.S. Army in 1854 on Rancho Castac. These were federal projects, consisting of major developments and improvements, on what was the Mexican grantees' private land. In 1855, Edward Beale purchased Rancho La Liebre. The Army abandoned Fort Tejon in 1864. Beale bought Rancho El Tejon and Rancho de los Alamos y Agua Caliente in 1865, and Rancho Castac in 1866. With the purchase of these four Mexican land grants, Beale created the present day Tejon Ranch.Gerald Thompson, Edward F. Beale and the American West, University of New Mexico Press, 1983.

The ZX-6 series motorcycle was Kawasaki's flagship 600 cc model in 1990 to 1994. It was then replaced in 1995 with the ZX-6R as the brand's 600 cc race replica. In Europe the model designation differed, and was introduced in 1990 as the ZZR600. The same 599 cc engine powered the bike from 1990 to 2004, then from 2005 to 2008 it used the engine from the 2004 ZX-6R. 1990–2002 The first generation ZZR600 (ZX-6 Ninja in different continents/markets) was updated in 1993 with lighter and bigger valves and intake-exhaust ducts, more permanence in the cams timing, lighter pistons, ram air. The two parts chassis (aluminium frame and steel sub-frame) changed to a one piece full aluminium chassis, and aesthetic changes. Analogue instrumentation included standard speedometer on the left that rose in single MPH increments up to 170. Unlike the Suzuki competitor, the Katana, signal lights on the Kawasaki's cluster were amber instead of green. Owners could also rely on a fuel gauge on the left (missing on D series) and a temperature gauge on the right which many motorcycles in the same class did not have at the time. Storage was minimal, but better than most sport bikes. There was room beneath the seat for the manual and registration, but not much else. An additional compartment could be found on the left side of the fairing and the ignition key was needed to open it. 2007 ZZR600 2003–2004 ZZR600 in North America, marketed during model years 2003 and 2004 (as well as 2005 in Canada), was based upon a previous generation sportbike (Ninja ZX-6). This indicates the motorcycle is mechanically identical to the earlier motorcycle, and differs only in paint schemes. 2005–2008 In North America, the updated 2005 ZZR600 was a reissue of the 2001 (ZX-6R) model and remains unchanged save for a new, less invasive fairing stay. It is powered by the same 599 cc, liquid cooled, DOHC, inline four cylinder engine. Notably, the ZZR600 uses a carbureted engine, even in its later model years, as it retains its similarity to the 2001 ZX-6R model. As such, the ZZR600's choke control sits near the left handle grip. Most modern Japanese sportbikes employ fuel injection.

Squirt boats are designed to use both surface and underwater currents to manoeuvre within the water. These manoeuvres can be used to effect navigational control or to perform tricks. Overview Physically, a typical squirt boat is similar to a whitewater kayak or covered canoe (C–1) but is distinct in the following ways: * The side profile of a squirt boat is very flat when compared to a whitewater kayak or C–1. * The volume of a squirt boat is generally less than half of the volume of a normal kayak of the same length. This often ranges from 24–35 gallons (90–130 liters) for a squirt boat, but 50–70 gallons (190–260 liters) for a typical kayak. * Squirt boats often have foot bumps that enable the boat to maintain an ultra-low volume while still providing room for the feet. * When in the water, 70–80% of the boat will be underwater. * Squirt boats are designed to do tricks. Each model has its specialty. For example, the Bigfoot and Shred squirt boats are great at doing Mystery Moves, while squirt boats like the Skunk and Hellbender are great at doing cartwheels. * The most popular squirt boats are probably the Bigfoot, Shred or Hellbender. It really depends on what you want to get out of a Squirt boat. The Bigfoot and Shred are great at Mystery Moves however not very good when it comes to their screw performances. On the other hand, the Hellbender has a fantastic screwability performance whereas it won't sink apart from in very powered up spots. At the same time all three boats are probably the safest squirt boats there are. The Bigfoot and Shred are safe because they have the highest volume. Yet the Hellbender is safe since it doesn't have a backrest and also you can just straighten your legs and slip straight out of it, no matter what the cut is on the paddler. * The Bigfoot, is really designed for larger paddlers. It isn't bad at downriver however it could be better. The Shred, is basically a Bigfoot for a Medium sized paddler, its rating is exactly the same as the Bigfoot the only difference is that the Bigfoot is 20 cm longer end to end. If you want a Squirt boat with the same performances of the Bigfoot and Shred but for a smaller paddler the Maestro is the kayak of choice. The Hellbender, is very different from the other two boats. It is good at white water paddling and is the best boat there is for flat water paddling. It is also very good on the surf as well. It is the best boat to get in to Squirt Boating with and also it isn't at all different from a playboat in how it maneuvers. So it also wouldn't be bad as a first boat either. History Squirt boating originally evolved from slalom kayaks. Racers found that if they let the upstream hip drop into the current and slide the stern of the boat under water, they could decrease the amount of time required to make large degree turns (90+ degrees). West Virginia kayaker Phil Coleman dubbed it squirt because of the way the boats squirted forward with extra speed thanks to the trapped buoyancy of the stern and the shape of the hull and deck. It is analogous to squeezing a pumpkin seed in between your fingers and having it shoot out away from you. After this original maneuver was developed, a number of paddlers noticed that squirting was a lot of fun and introduced a new method of playing on the river. Squirts allowed the boats to get vertical even in flat water. The problem was that the predominant kayak designs of the 1980s were not conducive to doing squirts. Most kayaks at the time were more than 10 feet long and had a volume greater than 70 gallons (260 liters). Jess Whittemore, a kayak designer, designed the first chopped boats based on race boat designs that were intended to squirt. Then, one fairly well known paddler, boat designer, and paddle maker by the name of Jim Snyder decided to try and create a shorter boat that was designed to squirt that could also be used for running and playing on the river. The result, after many years of trial and error, was a radically low volume boat. Squirt boating is slowly becoming more and more popular. Because it has the best of both worlds, since certain ones are very good at doing tricks in (Underdawg, Hellbender) and others are very good at doing Mystery moves in (Shred, Kor) and some are just as good as doing both (Funk, Angst.) Also most squirt boats are very good at surfing. Manoeuvres * Squirts - 'Squirting,' moves the boat from flat to vertical. The feeling of the boat doing a squirt is similar to the feeling of your hand at an angle, out the window of a fast moving vehicle, rising or falling and turning against the flow of air. There are several hydraulic river features that facilitate this manoeuvre. * Screw- Around/Screw-Up – This is a vertical or past vertical manoeuvre where the kayak is pivoted around its long axis. It is usually performed after a squirt. * Blasts - \\"Blasting,\\" is typically done in a vertical pour over, although it can be accomplished in a less vertical hydraulic (or hole), the effect is less fantastic. The effect of the move is to have either the bow or stern of the kayak sandwiched between the upstream flow of the river and the reversal flow of the hydraulic. In vertical features, the kayak is balanced vertically. * Mystery Moves – This is the Holy Grail of squirt boat manoeuvres. In a mystery move, the kayak and paddler submerge entirely into the flow of the river via total immersion into downward flow. * Cartwheels – The kayak transitions from vertical to vertical, sideways, using the \\"smash\\" technique of rotating your hips and boat against the paddle-torso configuration. * Double Enders - Similar to a cartwheel, but older in origin. The transition in a double ender is performed with squirt, rather than smash, principles. * Zero to Hero – When surfacing from a mystery move upside down, the paddler executes a \\"screw around,\\"/\\"screw-up,\\" and effectively surfaces vertically. * Clean Wheel - A variation of the cartwheel, executed without the usual paddle strokes. * Clue – The boat and boater sit partially submerged in a hydraulic. * Loop – Different from the loop in rodeo/play boating, a loop in squirt boating refers to a roll around the long axis of the boat while submerged in a mystery move. There are three variations of the loop, described below: ** The Loop – Essentially an Eskimo roll performed underwater. ** The Retarded Loop – Performed the same as a loop but the second half of the roll (from upside down to right side up) starts as the hull breaks the surface of water. ** The Light Loop – A high energy loop where the boat is thrust partially out of the water as it breaks through the surface. It has the appearance of the boat exploding out of the water to an upright position from underwater by way of a 180 degree rotation. Terms * Squirt – A manoeuvre that uses the inverse of Bernoulli's principle to turn a kayak, covered canoe, or squirt boat by using all three dimensions. * Hull – The bottom-most surface of a boat. * Deck - The top-most surface of a boat. / Slang for Spraydeck. * CHARC – \\"Charging Arc\\" * Stick – Slang term for paddle. * Chine – The portion of the boat where the hull and deck meet. A soft chine refers to the angle that the deck and hull make when they meet, maximally 180 degrees. A hard chine refers to a more acute angle, approaching and angle of zero degrees.

She was known as the Queen of Yodeling, and was the first woman inducted into the Country Music DJ Hall of Fame. Early life Rosalie Allen was born in Old Forge, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania (some sources give her given birth name as Julia, or Juliana rather than Julie) Allen grew up the daughter of a Polish immigrant miner in a family of 12 children in Pennsylvania. During the Great Depression, at age nine, she worked as a dishwasher to help with the family's finances. Inspired by the singing cowboys of the 1930s, Allen taught herself to sing and play her brother's guitar. In 1939, she earned the title \\"Queen of Yodeling\\" after winning a yodeling contest, and continued to use this moniker throughout her career. The contest's prize was to sing on WBRE in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a performance which was her radio debut. Career Following her first appearance on WBRE, Allen went to WORK in York, Pennsylvania, and was a vocalist on Shorty Fincher's radio show Prairie Pals. In 1943 she moved to New York City and performed on Denver Darling's Swing Billies pseudo- western radio show. In 1944 she became a regular on Zebe Carver's Hill Country Jamboree show, which led to an offer of her own show the same year. The half- hour program, Prairie Stars on WOV in New York, aired six nights a week and was so popular that Country Music magazine named her the most famous country music personality in Manhattan. She also performed nightly live shows at the Village Barn and hosted an Armed Forces Radio Network show from 1949 to 1956. She stayed with the WOV show until 1956, when the rising popularity of rock music contributed to a downturn in that of country music. In the 1940s, she also ran a country western record shop called Rosalie Allen's Hillbilly Music Center on West 54th Street in New York City, one of the first record stores in the United States to exclusively sell country music. In 1945, Allen signed a five-year contract with Spin Records. Her first hit came in 1946 with RCA Victor with a yodeling update of Patsy Montana's \\"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\\". followed by the successful release of \\"Guitar Polka\\". Allen later paired up with yodeler Elton Britt; their first single, \\"Beyond the Sunset,\\" hit number seven in 1950. They also recorded \\"The Yodel Blues\\" and \\"Quicksilver\\" and in 1958 released a joint album Elton Britt & Rosalie Allen. In 1949, she appeared in the New York City-based music program series Village Barn. From 1949 to 1953 she also hosted her own television show, the first country music show in New York City. During the late 1940s and 1950s she was a regular contributor to country music publications National Jamboree, Country Sound Roundup and Hoedown. She released a number of albums including Rodeo in 1959. Her final album was The Queen Of The Yodelers, released in 1983. Personal life and death Allen retired to Alabama to start a family in the 1950s. She gave birth to one daughter. In her later life, she suffered from diabetes and other ailments. After a brief illness with congestive heart failure, Allen died on September 23, 2003 in Van Nuys, California. Legacy In 1999, Allen's work in radio was recognized and she was the first woman inducted into the Country Music D J Hall of Fame.

Following the failure of the heavy and uncompetitive Aston Martin DB3 designed by Eberan Eberhorst; William Watson, employed as Eberhorst's assistant, presented an alternative design to John Wyer, Aston Martin's competitions manager, whose assistance was needed as Eberhorst could well oppose being up- staged. In total 31 cars were made, with 11 works cars and 20 cars being sold for customer use. The DB3S was introduced in 1953 and it proved significantly more successful than the Aston Martin DB3. Although the DB3S failed at Le Mans they went on to score a 1-2 at the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod in the 6th round of the inaugural World Sports Car Championship to help Astons to 3rd in the championship. As well there was a win in the non championship Goodwood 9 Hours. 1954 was a less successful season with a third place in the Buenos Aires 1000 km being the high point. However the cars failed at the Sebring 12 hours, the Mille Miglia, Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy. 1955 saw a return to form. Astons missed the opening two rounds at Buenos Aires and Sebring and the sole DB3S failed to finish at the Mille Miglia but Collins/Frere finished 2nd at Le Mans and Walker/Poore scored a 4th at the Tourist Trophy behind the dominant 1, 2, 3 of the Mercedes 300SLR to finish 5th in the championship. There was also time for another win in the non championship Goodwood 9 Hours. By 1956 the design was starting to show its age and Astons were putting their resources into the development of the new DBR1 but the DB3S still finished 4th at Sebring and 5th at the Nurburging 1000Km to finish 4th in the championship together with another second at Le Mans in the hands of Moss/Collins although due to the change of regulations following the 1955 disaster this latter event was a non championship race. The DBR1 now took over as Astons main sports racer but there was one last swan song for the DB3S in the hands of the Whitehead brothers at Le Mans in 1958 with a second place after all the works DBR1s failed to finish. The car won the 2013 Gran Turismo Trophy at Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.http://www.gtplanet.net/aston-martin- db3s-wins-2013-gran-turismo-trophy/ Chassis numbers The 11 works cars had chassis numbers from DB3S/1 to DB3S/11, with the 11th works car never being raced by Aston Martin. The 20 customer cars had three digit chassis numbers, from DB3S/101 to DB3S/120. In 1994 a recreation car was assembled from original spare parts at Aston Service Dorset. This car carries the continuation chassis number DB3S/121. Coupés Originally two works Aston Martin DB3S fixed head coupés were made. The change was to make them more aerodynamic than the open top bodied cars. However, they were unstable at high speeds and both crashed at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans.

It was formed in April 2015, with the merger of the Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6) and the Palace of Westminster Division (SO17). Due to its responsibilities, PaDP is an armed command, with most of its officers being Authorised Firearms Officers. Role PaDP is responsible for: * Protection of government owned buildings and embassies. * Residential protection for high-profile ministers, visiting heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers. * Counter- reconnaissance at events identified as high risk, diplomatic functions or key sites. * Searching and access control of visitors and vehicles to New Scotland Yard and Downing Street * Assisting with protection at buildings such as the Palace of Westminster * Counter-terrorism activities with other police units, both armed and unarmed The primary responsibility of PaDP is the safety and security of London's diplomatic/governmental communities and parliamentary estate. The unit provides protection for foreign missions in London, such as embassies, high commissions, consular sections and official residencies in accordance with Article 22 of the Vienna Convention. PaDP also provide protection and keep order on the Parliamentary Estate to ensure both the House of Commons and House of Lords can conduct their business without disruption. PaDP protect the diplomatic community in London, providing residential protection for Her Majesty's Government, former prime ministers, government ministers, visiting foreign government ministers and heads of state and anyone else deemed to be high risk. They also provide protection at high-profile buildings such as New Scotland Yard and where necessary PaDP will provide armed protection at hospitals for patients at threat as well as hospital staff. PaDP also provide the physical security of the Palace of Westminster working closely with the House Authorities, particularly the Serjeant-at-Arms (House of Commons) and Black Rod (House of Lords) to provide around the clock security every day of the year. Officers patrol the building and its grounds and control access of people and vehicles onto the Estate. There is a dedicated search wing, trained to conduct counter-terrorism searches. History PaDP was created in April 2015, via the merger of the Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG, SO6) and the Palace of Westminster Division (SO17). When the Diplomatic Protection Group was formed in November 1974, it was a branch of A division which policed Westminster, due to most diplomatic premises being within the area. DPG officers have provided armed security for The Queen Mother, as well as security for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. In addition, DPG residential protection officers have provided armed protection to many world leaders during visits to London. The Palace of Westminster Division (SO17) was a branch of the Specialist Operations Directorate within London's Metropolitan Police Service. SO17 was responsible for security at the Palace of Westminster, as well as for the rest of the Parliamentary Estate. Officers of SO17 were unarmed, with armed security being provided by the Diplomatic Protection Group (SO6). =Notable incidents= Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer During the Iranian Embassy siege, Police Constable (PC) Trevor Lock was on protection duty. He was taken hostage along with the embassy staff and managed to conceal his firearm until the assault by the British Army's Special Air Service, when he then restrained the terrorist leader. Other incidents where DPG officers have used firearms include when PC Peter Slimon GM visited the National Westminster Bank on Kensington High Street on 27 December 1972 to draw money out while on his lunch break: he found that a bank robbery was in progress, fatally wounded one of the robbers, and injured two other robbers. In the same incident, PS Stephen Peet responded, and shot the third robber. PC Gordon McKinnon was authorised to free a hostage in Trafalgar Square, and did so. Another notable incident was the September 2012 Plebgate scandal, involving officers guarding Downing Street. On 22 March 2017, during the 2017 Westminster attack, PC Keith Palmer, 48, of the PaDP was stabbed to death in New Palace Yard whilst guarding the Palace of Westminster. A Foreign Office minister, Tobias Ellwood, tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate PC Palmer, who later succumbed to his injuries. On 3 June 2017 PaDP officers responded to the Borough Market and London Bridge terror attacks. Off duty PaDP officers PC Liam Jones and PC Stewart Henderson rendered first aid to seriously injured members of the public before protecting 150+ people and evacuating them by the Metropolitan marine support unit (MSU) and RNLI Boats to the north shore of the Thames. Equipment Firearms routinely carried by DPG officers include the Glock 17 and Heckler & Koch MP5. Officers are also equipped with bulletproof vests and the less-lethal Taser X2. Like every other British police officer, they carry a telescopic baton, speedcuffs, CS spray, soon to be replaced with PAVA spray, and a Motorola radio, soon to be replaced with a SEPURA radio. The Vauxhall Vivaro is used to transport large numbers of officers. The Vauxhall Zafira is used by supervisors, however these are being phased out and replaced by the newer Ford C-Max.

It lives in a variety of habitats and eats a variety of leaves of both native and introduced plants, as well as flowers, fruits and sap. This possum also consumes a special type of faeces that is produced during the daytime when it is resting in a nest. This behaviour is called caecotrophy and is similar to that seen in rabbits. Taxonomy The common ringtail possum is currently classified as the only living species in the genus Pseudocheirus; the species of Pseudochirulus and other ringtail genera were formerly also classified in Pseudocheirus. Several subspecies have been described, such as the Western Australian Pseudocheirus peregrinus occidentalis, but the entire population may be a species complex. The arrangement as the only extant species of Pseudocheirus is: *Pseudocheirus peregrinus pereginus, the type subspecies based on a collection made at Endeavour River *Pseudocheirus peregrinus convolutor, *Pseudocheirus peregrinus pulcher, *Pseudocheirus peregrinus occidentalis, called the western ring tail possum, found in the south west of the country. Taxonomic opinion favours regarding this as a separate species, Pseudocheirus occidentalis, though the currently contradictory evidence would not allow this recommendation to be formalised. Description The common ringtail possum weighs between 550 and 1100 g and is approximately 30–35 cm long when grown (excluding the tail, which is roughly the same length again). It has grey or black fur with white patches behind the eyes and usually a cream coloured belly. It has a long prehensile tail which normally displays a distinctive white tip over 25% of its length. The back feet are syndactyly which helps it to climb. The ringtail possum's molars have sharp and pointed cusps. Distribution and habitat The common ringtail possum ranges on the east coast of Australia, as well as Tasmania and a part of southwestern Australia.Pseudocheirus peregrinus Animal diversity They generally live in temperate and tropical environments and are rare in drier environments. Ringtail possums prefer forests of dense brush, particularly eucalyptus forests. The common ringtail possum and its relatives occupy a range of niches similar to those of lemurs, monkeys, squirrels, and bushbabies in similar forests on other continents.Barnett, J.L, A., R. R.A. How. 1984. \\"The Population Biology of Pseudocheirus peregrinus\\". pp. 261–268 in Possums and Gliders Andrew Smith, Ian D. Hume (Eds.) New South Wales: Surrey Beatty & Sons Pty Limited. It is less prolific and less widespread than the common brushtail possum. A common ringtail possum carrying young. Behaviour The common ringtail possum is nocturnal and well adapted to arboreal life. It relies on its prehensile tail and rarely descends to the ground. They communicate with soft, high-pitched, and twittering calls.Lee, Anthony, A. 1984. \\"The Evolution of Strategies for Survival and Reproduction in Possums and Gliders\\". pp. 17–19 in Possums and Gliders Andrew Smith, Ian D. Hume (Eds.). New South Wales: Surrey Beatty & Sons Pty Limited. Asleep in daytime roost. Common ringtails usually build nests. This one prefers the open air. =Diet and foraging= The common ringtail possum feeds on a wide variety of plants in the family Myrtaceae including the foliage, flowers and fruits from shrubs and lower canopy. Some populations are also known to feed on the leaves of cypress pine (Callitris), wattles (Acacia spp.) and plant gum or resins. When foraging, ringtail possums prefer young leaves over old ones. One study found the emergence of young possums from their pouches corresponds to the flowering and fruiting of the tea-tree, Leptospermum and the peak of fresh plant growth. Young eucalypt leaves are richer in nitrogen and have less dense cell walls than older leaves, however the protein gained from them is less available due to higher amounts of tannins.Cork SJ, Pahl. (1984) \\"The possible influence of nutritional factors on diet and habitat selection by the ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus)\\". In: Possums and gliders Andrew Smith, Ian D. Hume (Eds.) pp. 269–76. Australian Mammal Society. When feeding, the possum's molars slice through the leaves, slitting them into pieces. The possum's caecum separates the fine particles from the coarse ones. These particles stay in the caecum for up to 70 hours where the cell walls and tanned cytoplasts are partially digested. What distinguishes the digestive system of the common ringtail possum from that of the koala and the greater glider is the caecal content transfers directly back to the stomach. Because of this, the ringtail possum is able to gain more protein. This is also done by lagomorphs like rabbits and pikas. Hard faeces are produced during the night while feeding and are not eaten, while soft faeces are produced during the day during rests and are eaten. =Metabolism= Common ringtail possum in Brisbane, Queensland. The re-ingestion of caecal content also serves to maintain the ringtail possum's energy balance. Ringtail possums gain much of their gross energy from reingestion. The common ringtail possum has a daily maintenance nitrogen requirement (MNR) of 290 mg N/kg0.75. Common ringtail possums gain much of their MNR from consuming their nitrogen-rich caecal pellets. They would have to gain 620 mg N/kg0.75 otherwise. The ringtail possum recycles 96% of its liver's urea, which is then transferred into the caecum and made into bacterial protein. Only re-ingestion makes this effective and the bacterial protein must be digested in the stomach and the amino acids subsequently absorbed in the small intestine. This recycling also allows the possum to conserve water and urinate less. Reingestion allows the possum to live on low nitrogen eucalyptus leaves which is particularly important during late lactation. =Nesting= Common ringtail possums live a gregarious lifestyle which centres on their communal nests, also called dreys.https://www.wires.org.au/wildlife-info/wildlife-factsheets/making-a- ringtail-possum-home Ringtail possums build nests from tree branches and occasionally use tree hollows. A communal nest is made up of an adult female and an adult male, their dependant offspring and immature offspring of the previous year. A group of ringtail possums may build several dreys at different sites. Ringtail possums are territorial and will drive away any strange conspecifics from their nests. A group has a strong attachment to their site. In one experiment, in which a group was removed from their territory, it remained uncolonised for the following two years. Ringtail possum nests tend to be more common in low scrub and less common in heavily timbered areas with little under-story. Dreys contribute to the survival of the young when they are no longer carried on their mother's back. =Reproduction and growth= As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. Depending on the area, the mating season can take place anywhere between April and December. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The oestrous cycle of ringtail possum lasts 28 days. It is both polyoestrous and polyovular. If a female prematurely loses her litter, she can return to oestrous and produce a second litter in October as a replacement if conditions are right. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets. Common ringtail possum young tend to grow relatively slowly due to dilute milk with low lipid levels that is provided to the young. As with other marsupials, the common ringtail possum's milk changes through lactation. During the second phase of lactation, more solid foods are eaten, especially when the young first emerges from the pouch. During this time, the concentration of carbohydrates fall, while those of proteins and lipids reach their highest. The long lactation of the ringtail possums may give the young more time to learn skills in the communal nest as well as to climb and forage in the trees. The young are first able to vocalise and open their eyes between 90 and 106 days of age. They leave their mother's pouch at 120–130 days. However, lactation usually continues until 180–220 days after birth but sometimes ends by 145 days. Both sexes become sexually mature in the first mating season after their birth. Status Common ringtail possum populations severely declined during the 1950s. However, populations seem to have recovered in recent times. Because they are largely arboreal, common ringtail possums are particularly affected by deforestation in Australia. They are also heavily predated upon by the introduced European Fox. They are also hit by cars, or killed by cats and dogs in suburban areas.

Its founder, Kelsang Gyatso, has sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to twenty-first century living. He also wanted to ensure that people did not simply study Tibetan Buddhism from an academic point of view, but learned how to extend this knowledge through meditation and practical Buddhist experience. The NKT-IKBU is described as being \\"very successful at disseminating its teachings\\" and Geshe Kelsang's books have been called \\"very popular\\". The NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition in Britain. It has been described as a \\"controversial organization\\" and a \\"controversial\\" new religious movement,Clarke, Peter Bernard.

Kay: Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation, London and New York, pages 55, 56 The same year Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche visited Kelsang Gyatso in India and invited him over to teach at the Manjushri Institute, which was a part of their FPMT network. According to David N. Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was invited in 1976 by Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa, who sought the advice of the 14th Dalai Lama when choosing Kelsang Gyatso. Whereas according to a NKT brochure, \\"Lama Yeshe requested Trijang Rinpoche to ask Kelsang Gyatso to become Resident Teacher of Manjushri Institute. Kelsang Gyatso later recounted that Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche asked him to go to England, teach Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Chandrakirti's Guide to the Middle Way and Lamrim, and then check whether there was any meaning in his continuing to stay.\\"Modern Day Kadampas – published by the NKT Kelsang Gyatso was requested by Lama Yeshe to lead the \\"General Program\\" of Buddhist study. In 1979 Lama Yeshe asked a Geshe at Manjushri Institute, Geshe Jampa Tekchok, to teach a parallel twelve-year Geshe Studies Programme, recognised and validated by the Dalai Lama and modelled on the program of studies for the traditional geshe degree.Kay, see note on page 232 From 1982 to 1990 this program was led by Geshe Konchog Tsewang.Kay page 53 and 77 According to a disciple of Lama Yeshe from this time, Lama Yeshe intended the institute \\"to become the central monastery of the FPMT... one of the early jewels of the FPMT crown\\" and \\"the pioneer among the western centres\\". In the late 1970s, Kelsang Gyatso, without consulting Thubten Yeshe, opened up a Buddhist Centre in York under his own spiritual direction. Kay sees this as the beginning of a conflict between Thubten Yeshe and Kelsang Gyatso.Kay pages 61,62,63,64 However, according to Kelsang Gyatso, \\"the opening of the Centre in York caused not one moment of confusion or disharmony\\".\\"Eradicating wrong views\\" a letter, dated 27 October 1983, written as a response to the FPMT report \\"A report on recent events at Manjushri Institute (dated October 1, 1983) Kelsang Gyatso was asked to resign so that another Geshe, described by Kay as \\"more devoted to FPMT objectives\\", could take over as a resident teacher of Manjushri Institute. Many students of Kelsang Gyatso petitioned him to stay and teach them, and on this basis he decided to remain. In the following years prior 1990 Kelsang Gyatso established 15 centres under his own direction in Great Britain and Spain.Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in \\"Buddhism in the Modern World\\", , page 230 Both Kay and Cozort describe the management committee of Manjushri Institute from 1981 onwards as made up principally of Kelsang Gyatso's closest students, also known as \\"the Priory group\\".Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in \\"Buddhism in the Modern World\\", , page 226 According to Kay, \\"The Priory Group became dissatisfied with the FPMT's increasingly centralized organisation.\\" Cozort states that different disagreements \\"led to a rift between Lama Yeshe and his students and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso and his, and eventually the Manjushri Board of directors ( Geshe Gyatso's students) severed the connection of the between institute and FPMT.\\" According to Kay, Lama Yeshe tried at different times to reassert his authority over the Institute, but his attempts were unsuccessful.Kay, page 63 Kay goes on to describe an open conflict of authority which developed between the Priory Group and the FPMT administration in 1983. In February 1984 the conflict was mediated by the Office of the Dalai Lama in London. Kay states that after the death of Thubten Yeshe in March 1984, the FPMT lost interest because they saw it as a fruitless case. Since that time, Kay states, the Manjushri Institute has developed mainly under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso without further reference to the FPMT, but legally remained part of the FPMT until late 1990.Kay page 78 According to Kay, of the two Geshes at Manjushri Institute, it was Kelsang Gyatso who had always taken the greater interest in the running and direction of the Institute, and most of the students there were closer to him.Kay 2004 : 66 The courses offered by both Geshes complemented each other, but as Kay remarked, they \\"differed in one important respect: only Geshe Kelsang's General Programme included courses on Tantric Buddhism, and attendance upon these required the reception of a Tantric empowerment.\\"Kay 2004 : 56 Further, Kay argues that \\"Lama Yeshe's and Geshe Kelsang's different ideological perspectives provided the conditions for the organisational dispute between the Institute and the FPMT to escalate. Kelsang Gyatso was already predisposed to support his students in their struggle with the FPMT administration because the organisation was inspired by a vision that he did not totally agree with.\\"Kay 2004 : 65 Kay writes that, \\"the determination of Geshe Kelsang and the Priory Group to separate from the parent organisation was uncompromising, and this was a position that only hardened during the following years.\\" He goes on to describe the split from the Gelug school and FPMT as follows: Kelsang Gyatso made a three-year retreat from 1987 to 1990 in Dumfries, Scotland and asked Geshe Losang Pende from Ganden Shartse monastery to lead the General Program in his absence, whilst Geshe Konchog Tsewang continued to teach the Geshe Studies Programme at Conishead Priory (Manjushri Institute).Kay page 73 Different Lamas, including Thubten Zopa, were still invited. Especially the visit of Thubten Zopa in 1988 \\"is significant, indicating the ongoing devotion of the students to this lama and their desire to leave the negativity of the schism with the FPMT in the past.\\" In 1988 and 1990 the uncle of Kelsang Gyatso, Choyang Duldzin Kuten Lama – the oracle of Dorje Shugden – also visited Manjushri Institute. Before that time Song Rinpoche, Geshe Lhundup Sopa, Geshe Rabten, as well as other Buddhist teachers such as Ajahn Sumedho and Thích Nhất Hạnh have taught at Manjushri Institute.Kay page 68 During Kelsang Gyatso's period of retreat he wrote some of his books and worked out the foundations of the NKT. Kay states: \\"The first major development that took place during Geshe Kelsang's retreat was the introduction of the 'Teacher Training Programme' (TTP) at the Manjushri Institute.\\"Kay 2004 : 74 Kay comments the developments at that time: \\"By giving his study programmes a textual basis, Geshe Kelsang not only provided accessible materials to enhance the focus and commitment of his students, but also laid down structures through which spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\\"Kay 2004 : 75 According to Kay, According to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was gravely concerned that the purity of Tsongkhapa's tradition was being undermined by the lingering inclusivism of his Western students, something he had been outspoken for some years, \\"but he now acted more forcefully in his opposition to it by discouraging his students both from receiving guidance from teachers of other traditions and from reading their books.\\"Kay page 77 Kay states that another result of these \\"radically exclusive policies\\" was that after the foundation of the NKT the Manjushri Institute Library, with over 3000 books,Kay page 67 was removed.Kay page 76 Kay goes on to state that, \\"this began with non-Gelug books being removed, but as Geshe Kelsang's vision crystallised, even books by Gelug teachers became unacceptable to him and the library disappeared altogether. He thus became convinced that the Tibetan Gelug tradition as a whole no longer embodied Tsongkhapa's pure teachings and that he and his disciples must therefore separate from it. From this point onwards, Tibetan Gelug lamas would no longer be invited to teach within his network. This perceived degeneration extended to include its highest-level lamas, and so even veneration for the Dalai Lama was now actively discouraged.\\" The pictures of the Dalai Lama were removed from the gompas and shrines of Kelsang Gyatso's centres. In 1990 Kelsang Gyatso became also outspoken against the Geshe Studies Programme, and \\"made the pursuit of his new programmes compulsory.\\" According to Kay \\"As it was no longer possible for students to follow the programmes of both Geshes, the basis of Geshe Konchog's teaching programme at the Institute was undermined, and in 1991 he retired to Gyuto Monastery in Assam, India.\\" =The foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition= According to David Kay, \\"in 1991, through the successful exploitation of a legal loophole, the assets of Manjushri Institute finally fell under the sole control of the Priory Group\\" (the close disciples of Kelsang Gyatso). In the Spring of that same year, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the 'New Kadampa Tradition', an event which was celebrated in the NKT-Magazine Full Moon as \\"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\\" In 1992, the Manjushri Institute developed a new constitution,The New Kadampa Tradition, charity registration number: 2758093, October 1992 designed to study and experience Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism (see page 233 of Kay's research) which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT. The Manjushri Institute was renamed the Manjushri Mahayana Buddhist Centre, and later the Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. Since then, it has remained Kelsang Gyatso's home and the NKT's flagship centre.Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in \\"Buddhism in the Modern World\\", , page 234 With the foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) by Kelsang Gyatso, he established a new and independent religious movementKay page 89 aiming to \\"principally follow the teachings and example of Je Tsongkhapa\\". This also gave a new identity to his followers. The many NKT centres which were built up rapidly by his followers could gather under the common auspices of the NKT and their spiritual guide, distinguishing and disassociating themselves from other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, especially the Gelug school from which Kelsang Gyatso originated. Kay argued that with these changes, Kelsang Gyatso provided a basis for the NKT to become a Western tradition whose \\"spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\\"Kay page 74 Cozort describes this as unusual in the Tibetan tradition.Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in \\"Buddhism in the Modern World\\", , page 240 The NKT described themselves as being \\"an entirely independent Buddhist tradition with no political affiliations...NKT brochures before June 2006 and NKT-internet-sites (see , ) that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world\\". David N. Kay comments: =The identity of the NKT= The views of NKT about NKT In 1998 Kelsang Gyatso stated in an interview: According to an NKT brochure, written by James Belither while secretary of the NKT: Nowadays the New Kadampa Tradition describes Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism to the West as Kadampa Buddhism with the following statement: Moreover, the NKT presents itself as being the continuation of the ancient Kadampa tradition by naming its school Kadampa Buddhism and equating this Kadampa Buddhism with the historical Kadampa School of Atisha: Followers of the NKT refer to themselves as Kadampa Buddhists, the temples of the New Kadampa Tradition are referred to as Kadampa Buddhist Temples, and more recently, NKT teachers are named Kadampa teachers. Additionally, the Dharma centres of the New Kadampa Tradition are called Kadampa Buddhist Centres.Official Kadampa Website at , James Belither, the former secretary of the NKT, described the NKT as \\"a Mahayana Buddhist tradition with historical connections with Tibet\\", rather than a Tibetan tradition, and explained that Kelsang Gyatso wishes his followers always \\"to present Dharma in a way appropriate to their own culture and society without the need to adopt Tibetan culture and customs\\".Belither, 1997:7—8, see also Bluck Other views about the NKT Whereas the NKT celebrate Kelsang Gyatso as the one who \\"is primarily responsible for the worldwide revival of Kadampa Buddhism in our time\\",Official NKT website \\"critics have described The New Kadampa Tradition as a breakaway sect or cult and argue it is not part of the ancient Kadampa Tradition but a split from the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.\\"BBC (bbc.co.uk), ; The New Kadampa Tradition Tibetologist Thierry Dodin has described the NKT as a cult, \\"... on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder. The organisation's extreme fanaticism and aggressive missionary drive are typical cult features too.\\"The Dorje Shugden conflict: Interview with Thierry Dodin Bluck remarks that there remains an apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasises its unbroken 'lineage', it has no Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.Bluck, Robert (2006). British Buddhism Teachings, Practice and Development. RoutledgeCurzon, Activities =Teachings and books= Bluck lists the specific traditional teachings that are seen as important in the NKT-IKBU: \\"the nature of the mind, karma and reincarnation, the preciousness of human life, the role of meditation, death, and the commitments of going for refuge\\", as well as \\"understanding the Four Noble Truths, developing renunciation, and the training of moral discipline, concentration and wisdom\\", followed by \\"becoming a compassionate bodhisattva (by developing bodhicitta and the six perfections), understanding the ultimate truth of emptiness and finally attaining Buddhahood.\\"Bluck, Robert (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. pp. 136–137. The NKT-IKBU's teachings are based exclusively on the teachings and published works of Kelsang Gyatso,Kay, D. N. (2004). Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 86. which in turn are commentaries on Gelug works, especially those of its founder Je Tsongkhapa's texts.Cozort, Daniel (2003). The Making of the Western Lama. Quoted in Heine, S., & Prebish, C. S. (2003). Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 230 and p. 232 According to Helen Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso follows the Tibetan Buddhist custom of studying texts through the teacher's commentaries. With respect to the contents of the teachings she states that \\"NKT doctrine is not different from that of mainline Gelugpa\\", with a Prasangika Madhyamaka philosophical orientation, and emphasising the teachings on dependent arising and emptiness.Waterhouse, Helen (1997). Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. pp. 150–151. The main practice in the NKT-IKBU is Lamrim (the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment), Lojong (Training the Mind), and Vajrayana Mahamudra (the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra). The books studied in the NKT are published by the Buddhist publishing house Tharpa Publications. =Study programs= NKT-IKBU offers three study programs:Cozort, Daniel (2003). The Making of the Western Lama. Quoted in Heine, S., & Prebish, C. S. (2003). Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 232. \\"the open and introductory General Programme, the Foundation Programme for more committed practitioners, and the demanding Teacher Training Programme.\\"Waterhouse, Helen. \\"New Kadampa Tradition\\" entry in Melton, J. Gordon, and Martin Baumann. 2002. Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO. p. 940 The study programs of the NKT-IKBU are what distinguishes it from all other Buddhist traditions.Bluck, Robert (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 139. Giving an overview of the purpose of the programs, the NKT-IKBU says: \\"Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has designed three special Study Programs for the systematic study and practice of Kadampa Buddhism that are especially suited to the modern world.\\"Kadampa Education Program. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008. It is believed by NKT-IKBU followers that the teachings transmit the pure lineage of Je Tsongkhapa in its entirety.Bluck, R. (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 130. The three spiritual programs are: # The General Program (GP), which provides an introduction to basic Buddhist ideas and meditation. Cozort explains that GP classes are \\"simply the ongoing general instructure for all comers at NKT Centers or wherever NKT teachers find a venue for teaching.\\"Cozort, Daniel (2003). The Making of the Western Lama. Quoted in Heine, S., & Prebish, C. S. (2003). Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 232. # The Foundation Program (FP), which includes the study of six commentaries written by Kelsang Gyatso on the following classical texts. Cozort remarks that the format of study resembles that of a British or American University, \\"with textbooks, lectures, small and large group discussion, and examinations.\\" #* Joyful Path of Good Fortune – based on Atisha's teachings on Lamrim or The Stages of the Path to Enlightenment #* Universal Compassion – a commentary on Bodhisattva Geshe Chekhawa's Training the Mind in Seven Points #* Eight Steps to Happiness – a commentary on Bodhisattva Langri Tangpa's Eight Verses of Training the Mind #* The New Heart of Wisdom – a commentary on the Heart Sutra #* Meaningful to Behold – a commentary on Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life #* Understanding the Mind – a commentary and detailed explanation of the mind based on the works of the Buddhist scholars Dharmakirti and Dignaga # The Teacher Training Program (TTP) is, according to Cozort, the \\"NKT's most ambitious undertaking,\\"Cozort, Daniel (2003).

All Resident Teachers of NKT-IKBU Centers follow this program of study and practice. The program involves the study of 14 texts of Kelsang Gyatso, including all of those in the Foundation Program, and the additional 8 listed below. This program also includes commitments concerning one's lifestyle, based on the 5 lay vows of the Pratimoksha, and the completion of specific meditation retreats \\"on each of the preliminary practices (sngon 'gro).\\"Cozort, Daniel (2003).

While the Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden practices are recited daily, NKT-IKBU practitioners also regularly perform a number of other ritual practices, including Avalokiteshvara, Heruka, Vajrayogini, Tara, Manjushri, Amitayus and the Medicine Buddha. Bluck notes that \\"All these sādhanas have either been 'compiled from traditional sources' by Geshe Kelsang or translated under his supervision.\\"Bluck, Robert (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 135. =Religious observances= From its inception, NKT-IKBU Dharma centres followed a common calendar for religious observances, including some of the traditional Buddhist religious days. These include the following: Monthly observances of Buddha Tara, Je Tsongkhapa, Eight Mahayana Precepts, and Dorje Shugden practices: * Tara Day (8th of each month) * Tsog Day (10th and 25th of each month) * Precepts Day (15th of each month) * Protector Day (29th of each month) Annual holidays common to other Buddhist traditions:Chryssides, George (1999). Exploring New Religions. London: Cassell. p. 237. * Buddha's Enlightenment Day (15 April) * Turning the Wheel of Dharma Day (4 June [49 days after Buddha's Enlightenment Day, and also Kelsang Gyatso's birthday]) * Buddha's Return from Heaven Day (22 September) * Je Tsongkhapa Day (25 October) Annual holidays unique to the NKT-IKBU: * NKT Day (the first Saturday in April) * International Temples Day (the first Saturday in November) In 2004, the dates of lunar month observances were changed to the respective days in the common calendar.

These are taught by the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition, currently Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong,Modern Kadampa Teachers: Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong.

They are attended by between 2000 and 6000 people from around the world. =Ordination= Within the NKT-IKBU community there are over 700 monks and nuns.A Global Spiritual Community. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008. Ordination ceremonies are usually held twice a year in the main NKT Temple at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in Cumbria (UK), Ulverston. To ordain, one must ask Kelsang Gyatso's permission, and also the permission of his or her parents.Waterhouse, Helen (1997). Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 138. Buddha established both lay and ordained Pratimoksha vows, and established several levels of ordination vows.Waterhouse, Helen (1997). Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 175. Traditionally, the different levels of ordination are distinguished by the specific number of vows taken, and by the ceremony in which they were received. In the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified tradition of ordination with ten vows that summarise the entire Vinaya,Bluck, R. (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 144. and a single ordination ceremony. The 10 vows in New Kadampa Tradition ordination are identical for both nuns and monks:Waterhouse, Helen (1997). Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 174. # abandon killing # abandon stealing # abandon sexual activity # abandon lying and cheating # abandon taking intoxicants # practice contentment # reduce one's desire for worldly pleasures # abandon engaging in meaningless activities # maintain the commitments of refuge # practise the three trainings of pure moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom In The Ordination Handbook, Kelsang Gyatso describes these vows as being easier to integrate into today's society, saying: He also says: The ordination tradition of the NKT-IKBU differs from that of other Buddhist groups in that it is based on the Mahayana Perfection of Wisdom SutrasGyatso, Kelsang. (1999). The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition. p. 16. instead of the Hinayana Vinaya Sutras. According to Kelsang Gyatso, \\"The Perfection of Wisdom Sutras are our Vinaya and Lamrim is its commentary.\\" Robert Bluck observed that in the NKT- IKBU a Vinaya Sutras-based \\"full ordination is not available, and those who do ordain remain as novices, though again this is common in Tibet.\\"Bluck, R. (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 146. Kelsang Gyatso explains that when a person is first ordained they receive a Rabjung (preliminary) ordination; when their renunciation improves and deepens, their ordination naturally transforms into a Getsul (sramanera) ordination; and when their renunciation becomes \\"a spontaneous wish to attain nirvana\\", their ordination naturally transforms into a Gelong (bhikkhu) ordination.Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition. p.16. For this reason, Kelsang Gyatso does not require a separate ritual ordination ceremony.Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition. p. 20. Monks and nuns in the NKT-IKBU abandon the physical signs of a lay person by shaving their head and wearing the maroon and yellow robes of an ordained person. They are given a new name which starts with \\"Kelsang\\", since it is traditional for ordinees to receive part of the ordaining master's name (in this case, Kelsang Gyatso). They also engage in a Sojong ceremony twice a month to purify and restore their vows. Monastics who break their ordination vows must leave their Centre for a year, with the exception of attending various bigger courses, Celebrations and Festivals. After that year, \\"with some conditions\\" they can return but cannot teach or participate in the Teacher Training Program. Practitioners who wish to ordain approach their Buddhist teacher when they feel ready, and request formal permission once they have their teacher's consent. They may decide to live in one of the NKT-IKBU's many Buddhist centres, but this is not a requirement. They are, in general, not financially provided for by the NKT-IKBU. And, if they live in an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, they still have to pay rent for their accommodation and pay for meals and the spiritual programs. To finance this, some have part-time or full-time work.Bluck, R. (2006). British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. . p. 146. According to Belither, \\"a few people are sponsored because of their NKT work but others are on 'extended working visits' or work locally, and some are legitimately on employment benefit.\\"Bluck, R.

During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU. Since that time, the NKT-IKBU has grown to comprise over 1,100 Centres and groups throughout 40 countries.Kadampa Centers. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008. After completing his retreat in the spring of 1991, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the NKT-IKBU, an event which was celebrated by his students in the NKT-IKBU magazine Full Moon as \\"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\\"Kay, D. N. (2004). Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 78. In 1992, the NKT-IKBU was legally incorporated under English law,Kay, D. N. (2004). Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 233. n26. which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT-IKBU. The many Dharma Centres that were following Kelsang Gyatso's spiritual direction were gathered under the common auspices of the NKT-IKBU, with him as their General Spiritual Director (GSD). He remained GSD until August 2009 when he retired and was replaced by his successor, Gen-la Kelsang Khyenrab. Each of the individual Centers is legally and financially independent.Bluck, R. (2006).

Sect disrobes British monk. The Guardian. 15 August 1996. Retrieved 2008-12-08. and Kelsang Gyatso provisionally appointed 4 'Gen-las', i.e. Losang Kelsang, Kelsang Jangsem, Kelsang Dekyong and Samden Gyatso. After about a year, the former two resigned as Gen-las and were re-appointed as Resident Teachers. Samden Gyatso became the Deputy Spiritual Director and successor to Kelsang Gyatso while Kelsang Dekyong was appointed as the US National Spiritual Director. From this time onwards, the Deputy Spiritual Director also held the appointment of Resident Teacher at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. In February 2007 Samden Gyatso resigned as Deputy Spiritual Director. Kelsang Khyenrab was appointed as Deputy Spiritual Director and became the General Spiritual Director when Kelsang Gyatso retired in Summer 2009. In August 2001, Kelsang Gyato established a system of democratic succession for the General Spiritual Director of the NKT- IKBU. The Internal Rules state: In 2008, Gen-la Khyenrab became Acting General Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of General Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four- year term.

Her position as Deputy Spiritual Director was taken by Gen-la Kunsang. =Other teachers= Alongside Kelsang Gyatso, who as founder and former spiritual director was the main teacher of the NKT-IKBU and his successors, all teachings (i.e. the three study programs) are held by Western students; lay persons and ordained alike. Qualification as an NKT-IKBU Dharma teacher is generally achieved by attending the NKT-IKBU's own Teacher Training Program,Cozort, Daniel (2003). The Making of the Western Lama. Quoted in Heine, S., & Prebish, C. S. (2003). Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition.

Kelsang Gyatso explained the importance of Western Dharma teachers to the flourishing of Dharma in the world, saying that one fully qualified teacher is worth a thousand enlightened students.Waterhouse, Helen (2001). Representing Western Buddhism: A United Kingdom Focus. Quoted in Beckerlegge, G. (2001). From Sacred Text to Internet. Religion today, v. 1. Aldershot, Hants, England: Ashgate. p. 142. He expounded on the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers in 1990: Regarding the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers, Kay observed that \\"Whilst personal experience of the teachings is considered important, the dominant view within the NKT is that the main qualification of a teacher is their purity of faith and discipleship.\\"Kay, D. N. (2004). Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 95. According to Robert Bluck, \\"Most teachers are appointed to centres by Kelsang Gyatso before they have completed the Teaching Training Programme and continue studying by correspondence, with an intensive study programme at Manjushri each summer.\\" Daniel Cozort explained that this is \\"rather like graduate students who teach undergraduate courses while pursuing their own Ph.D.'s.\\"Cozort, Daniel (2003).

Great treasury of merit: How to rely upon a spiritual guide. Ulverston, U.K.: Tharpa Publications. p. 1. All NKT-IKBU teachers, lay and ordained, study on the same study and retreat programmes. The Internal Rules specify the criteria for completing the programme: In addition to the TTP commitment, all Resident Teachers have to attend International Teacher Training Program each year, taught in repeated rotation according to a sixteen-year study scheme. Ordained and lay Resident Teachers who have taught successfully for four years are given the titles 'Gen' and 'Kadam', respectively.Bluck, Robert (2006).

In 2008 he was disrobed and effectively excommunicated by Kelsang Gyatso following a sexual scandal, whereby Kelsang Samden was accused of attempting to establish his own sexual lineage in the New Kadampa Tradition by engaging in sexual relations with ordained and lay female NKT members, under the guise of such activities being part of Highest Yoga Tantra spiritual practice. It was alleged that his activities had caused great harm to the women concerned, with at least one of the women involved falling pregnant and attempting suicide. Kelsang Samden denied any wrongdoing but disappeared from the organisation into obscurity under a cloud of disgrace.http://www.nktworld.org/NKTinfo.html Kelsang Khyenrab Kelsang Khyenrab who studied and practised Buddhism since 1980 under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso, was formerly General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT).

Besides having a program of courses for the local community, KMCs host major gatherings such as Dharma Celebrations, National Festivals, and International Festivals. They are also home to the International Kadampa Temples. KMCs are non-profit organisations and all their annual profits are donated to the International Temples Project. There are currently 18 KMCs around the world, with several in the US. =Temples for World Peace, World Peace Cafés, and Hotel Kadampas= The NKT- IKBU has established a Kadampa Buddhist Temple in the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada, the United States, and Spain; recently opened a Temple in Brazil, with plans to build one in Germany too.Religion and Ethics, BBC Website The NKT-IKBU states in its publicity that: {{quoteThe International Temples Project was established by Venerable Geshe Kelsang in the early nineties.

The invasion began with the bombing of Belgrade and the crossing of the border by the Germans on 6 April. The Third Army faced the Yugoslavian First Army. By the time the Hungarians crossed the border and finally attacked, the Germans had been attacking Yugoslavia for over a week. As a result, the Yugoslavs put up little resistance to the Hungarians. Units of the Hungarian Third Army advanced into a triangular shaped area known as the Baranya-triangle between the Danube River and the Drava River.

The Hungarian VII Army Corps was to become part of the Hungarian Third Army in August. On 30 August, the Hungarian Third Army was mobilized to defend Hungary against the relentless advances of the Soviet 2nd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts. The Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Armed Forces, Colonel-General János Vörös, ordered this army of nine weak, undermanned, and underequipped reserve divisions to attack west of the Hungarian Second Army (which was mobilized at the same time). The Third Army was to then cross Arad and the Maros Valley and occupy the mountain passes of Transylvania. This attack failed. On 6 October, in the opening stages of the Battle of Debrecen, the Hungarian Third Army was badly mauled near Arad. Very quickly, the army was scattered near the town of Kecskemét. Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front attempted a pincer maneuver to encircle Army Group Fretter-Pico. The 2nd Ukrainian Front's southern pincer sliced easily through the Hungarian Third Army. This southern pincer was spearheaded by Soviet General Issa Pliyev's Mobile Group Pliyev. Later, in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev was encircled and badly mauled by Army Group Fretter-Pico (Armeegruppe Fretter- Pico). The northern pincer was stalled and turned back by veteran German panzer forces. The Hungarian Second Army was an integral part of the victorious German-Hungarian Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico.

Fall of Budapest and the end  From 29 December 1944, the Hungarian capital city, Budapest was under siege. In the Battle of Budapest every available Hungarian unit was employed in the defense of the capital. After great loss, the city was unconditionally surrendered on 13 February 1945. Between 16 March and 25 March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about forty kilometers to the west of Budapest. The army was destroyed by the Soviet 46th Army as it advanced towards Vienna.Page 199, The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Hans Dollinger, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number 67-27047 But, even after this, the Hungarian Third Army did not totally cease to exist. Some remnants remained and they fought on. Fighting as they went, they moved progressively westward to southern Austria. The army was not officially disbanded until 8 May 1945, the end of the war.

The hospital has strong ties to the University of New South Wales. History The Prince of Wales Hospital had its origins in 1852 with the formation of the Society for Destitute Children which established the Asylum for Destitute Children with the first building opened on 21 March 1858 in Paddington. After an appeal for funds in 1870, the Catherine Hayes Hospital opened, reputedly with plans approved by Florence Nightingale. In 1915, during the First World War the hospital was converted by the NSW Government into a military hospital and then a repatriation hospital, and renamed the Fourth Australian Repatriation Hospital. In 1927 an association between the Coast Hospital and the Fourth Australian Repatriation Hospital at Randwick began. With the opening of the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in 1953, the hospital was renamed the Prince of Wales Hospital, and operated as an annexe of Sydney Hospital. Restructuring and hospital redevelopment has continued to occur to enhance the medical and patient facilities of the hospital, including amalgamation with the Prince Henry Hospital, Royal South Sydney Hospital and the Eastern Suburbs Hospital. =Prince Henry Hospital= Originally known as the Coast Hospital, Prince Henry had its origins managing patients with infectious diseases such as smallpox (outbreak in 1881), diphtheria, tuberculosis and scarlet fever. In 1900 there was an outbreak of the bubonic plague, with 303 cases reported and 103 deaths, and a further outbreak in 1921. In 1919 the 1918 flu pandemic reached Sydney, requiring the full resources of the hospital. Within its grounds was a lazar house for the treatment/quarantining of those with leprosy. During both world wars soldiers with venereal disease were admitted to the hospital. In 1934 the Coast Hospital was renamed the Prince Henry Hospital of Sydney on the occasion of the visit of the Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and major building works commenced to increase the capacity to 1000 beds. With the passing of the Prince Henry Hospital Act 1936, it became a postgraduate teaching hospital. The Institute of Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine was established in 1946 and was instrumental in investigating the incidence of the Coxsackie virus (aseptic meningitis), poliomyelitis virus and was the first to isolate REO virus. In 1970 the management of three hospitals - Prince Henry, Prince of Wales and Eastern Suburbs - was brought under one board. In 2001 Prince Henry's services were relocated to Randwick, where they were absorbed by Prince of Wales. The Prince Henry site has since been sold for a housing redevelopment. According to the developer, Landcom, 19 NSW Heritage Registered buildings and features have been preserved. These include the RAF Memorial Clock tower, the wishing well, the water tower and original gates, as well as artisans' cottages and the Pine Cottage and Flowers wards. Many of those who died at the hospital were buried at the Coast cemetery at Cape Banks.

At a public meeting at Redfern Town Hall in 1908, Smith was elected provisional president of a future public hospital on the site, which was adjacent to Victoria Park racecourse, which he established and owned. A furious fundraising drive then began. The hospital foundation stone was laid on 21 October 1909, with the hospital opening in August 1913. The royal title was conferred in December 1917. The hospital was entirely used to treat influenza patients in the pandemic of 1919. In September 1991 the hospital became part of the Prince Henry, Prince of Wales and Prince of Wales Children's Hospitals Group. =Eastern Suburbs Hospital= The Eastern Suburbs Hospital opened in February 1935 on a site near Queen's Park, after agitation from the community from 1924. During the second World War the hospital was used by the U.S. Navy Authority as a Naval Hospital from 1943 to 1944. In 1968 the hospital board was disbanded and administration of the hospital was taken over by the joint Boards of Directors of The Prince Henry and The Prince of Wales hospitals. The Eastern Suburbs hospital officially closed on 30 June 1980. The former Eastern Suburbs Hospital buildings now form part of Moriah College.

When Upper and Lower Canada were established in 1791, Colonel John Graves Simcoe was appointed the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Simcoe named the township of Markham, north of the town of York (now Toronto), after his friend William Markham, the Archbishop of York. Markham Township was originally surveyed in 1793–94, but not until 1801 was the township divided into 10 concession roads (now named as Street, Avenue, Road or Line) running north and south, with six sideroads running east/west (now numbered avenues or named Drive or Road). Many of these concession and sideroads in Markham still exist today. Eventually, the boundaries of Markham occupied the area, as follows: * NORTH: Whitchurch Town Line (Between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Side Road) * SOUTH: Scarborough Town Line (Steeles Avenue) * EAST: Pickering Town Line * WEST: Vaughan Town Line (Yonge Street) In 1794, William Berczy led 75 German families from New York State to Markham Township, an area known as German Mills today. Each family was granted 200 acres (0.8 km²). Because of hardships, many returned to York and Niagara and the area became a ghost town. In 1797, because of the revolution in France in 1789, many nobility fled the country and set off for Canada to take advantage of free land grants in Upper Canada. They were totally unprepared for survival under such crude conditions and most of them returned to their homeland. 19th century Built in 1871 by Toronto and Nipissing Railway, Unionville Station brought renewed prosperity and rapid development to the area. From 1803 to 1812, the largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Germans, most of whom were Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers had the best chance for survival because they had already survived harsh conditions in Pennsylvania. Prior to 1825 the community is referred to as Reesorville.Markham Village - A Brief History 1800-1919 , Markham Public Library (website). In 1805 the details of the Toronto Purchase were clarified. From 1830 on, many Irish, Scottish and English emigrated to Upper Canada to escape the famine and overpopulation of their homeland. Markham's early years blended the rigours of homesteading with the development of agriculture-based industries. The many rivers and streams in the Township soon supported water-powered saw and grist mills and, later, woollen mills. With improved transportation routes, such as Yonge Street and the growing population, urbanization increased. In 1850 the Township of Markham is create and by 1857 most of the Township had been cleared of timber and was under cultivation. Villages like Thornhill, Unionville and Markham greatly expanded and new, specialized industries such as wagon works, tanneries, farm implement and furniture factories sprang up. In 1871, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway Company, with stations in Unionville and Markham, officially opened its line from Scarborough to Uxbridge. Initially, the railway brought renewed prosperity and rapid development. Farmers and millers had a more convenient means of transporting their products to Toronto. Other merchants had easier access to supplies and business boomed. The first form of structured municipal government occurred in 1850 when the Township of Markham was created. On November 20, 1872, the Warden of York County signed the By-law of Incorporation, which provided for the election of a Council for the Village of Markham. The Village of Markham grew to a population of 1100 by 1891. 20th century The increased communication with Toronto brought on by the railway and further enhanced by the development of the telegraph, the telephone and the automobile, ultimately led to the demise of the villages in the Township after the turn of the century. Local industries were simply unable to compete with the larger manufacturers and suppliers of Toronto, and Markham soon reverted to a quiet, rural community. =Post-World War II development= Toshiba Canada headquarters, north of Highway 7 and west of Highway 404. Highway 404 north of Highway 7 was named the new western boundary for Markham in 1971. Following World War II, the face of Markham began to change rapidly. It was no longer a community whose inhabitants worked mainly within the area. It evolved into a fast-growing suburb, where the majority of its residents commuted into Toronto. As a result, rural Markham disappeared in the face of tremendous urban growth. By 1969, the Township of Markham consisted of several villages, including Markham, Unionville, and parts of Thornhill. In 1971, the Regional Municipality of York was established by the Government of Ontario. Northern portions of Markham Township were annexed to the municipalities of Richmond Hill and Whitchurch-Stouffville (four farm lots south of Main Street Stouffvillehttp://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=2871820&qryID=c702bd07-e9f9-47a6-a690-c90bf1358b13 Whitchurch Township), while the balance of Markham Township was incorporated in the Town of Markham and the present town boundaries set. The boundaries of Markham were altered following the reorganization of York County into York Region. Its present boundaries include begins at the southeastern corner, the boundary stretches northward along the York-Durham Line until approximately one half concession between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Side Road. The boundary continues westward until it reaches highway 404, where it runs in a southerly direction until intersecting Regional Road Seven, (formerly King's Highway 7.) From this point it stretches westward following Langstaff Road until Yonge Street, and travels south until Steeles Avenue East. The Southern border straddles the centre line of Steeles Avenue East until it reaches the city's southeastern corner at the York-Durham Line. All boundaries and concessions are straight lines at slightly more than a right angle to each other, forming a geographical area roughly in the shape of two connected parallelograms. In 1976, Markham's population was approximately 56,000. Since that time, the population has more than quadrupled. Explosive growth in new subdivisions has led to a jump in population since the 1980s. Much of Markham's farm land has disappeared, now found well north of 16th Avenue. Concerns from environmentalist and concerns with the future of the Oak Ridges Moraine will impact the extent of growth of the northern portion of Markham. At present Markham comprises several distinct communities: Markham Village, Cornell, Unionville, Wismer Commons, Milliken and Thornhill. Since the 1980s the town has been recognized as a suburb of Toronto, though it has an independent economy. Many high-tech industries have located in Markham for the relative abundance of land, low tax rates and good transportation routes. Advanced Micro Devices Canada, IBM Canada, Motorola Canada and many other well-known companies have chosen Markham as their home in Canada. Hence, the town branding itself as Canada's \\"High-Tech Capital\\". Although with further and more diverse growth, the Town of Markham has become the City of Markham and is now branding itself the \\"Diversity Capital of Canada\\". 21st century In 2012, Markham Town Council voted to change its status from town to city.

The offensive was conducted by the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. It was opposed by General Maximilian Fretter- Pico's German Sixth Army (II formation) and the allied Hungarian VII Army Corps of Army Group South Ukraine The Axis units were forced to retreat some 160 kilometers, while opposing the 2nd Ukrainian Front which had Debrecen in Hungary as its strategic objective. Background On 23 August 1944, Germany's former ally, Romania had declared war on Germany and its ally Hungary. The subsequent drive of Soviet General Fedor Tolbukhin's 3rd Ukrainian Front into Romania destroyed any semblance of an organised defensive line. On 8 September, Bulgaria, another former German ally, declared war on Germany. By this time, Tolbukhin, aided by the 2nd Ukrainian Front under Malinovsky had destroyed thirteen Axis divisions, taking over 100,000 prisoners. Both Malinovsky and Tolbukhin were promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union for this on 10 and 12 September, respectively. These developments had opened up a 650 kilometer gap in Friessner's Army Group. On 24 September 1944, Friessner's Army Group South Ukraine was redesignated Army Group South. General Fretter-Pico's Sixth Army formed the nucleus of Friessner's force, along with the Hungarian Second Army. The German-Hungarian force was designated Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico. Meanwhile, the Soviet forces were worn down by the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive and the Belgrade Offensive, and also had to contend with logistical difficulties caused by the different railway gauge used in Romania.Stalingrad to Berlin, p. 362 Prelude Fearing encirclement, commander of Army Group South Ukraine Generaloberst Johannes Friessner requested Hitler's permission to withdraw. Hitler refused to authorize it but promised additional forces for Friessner's army group. Hitler ordered Friessner to start a new offensive with the goal of a destruction of two of Malinovsky's Armies, the 27th Army and the 6th Guards Tank Army. In addition, he was ordered to retake two vital passes in the Southern Carpathians. On 14 September 1944, Malinovsky, in conjunction with the 3rd Ukrainian Front, launched the Belgrade Offensive. Friessner had been concentrating troops for his own planned offensive, and Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front ran into heavy resistance. After a week of fruitless attacks, Malinovsky called off his offensive and ordered the exhausted 6th Guards Tank Army, along with Cavalry Mechanized Group commanded by Issa Pliyev (7th Mechanized Corps), 4th Guards Cavalry Corps, and 6th Guards Cavalry Corps, with 389 tanks and assault guns, and Cavalry mechanized Group General Major Sergey Gorshkov's 5th Guards Cavalry Corps with the 23rd Tank Corps attached (146 tanks and assault guns), to the area near Oradea. By the end of September 1944, both Malinovsky and Friessner had received new orders. Malinovsky was now ordered to attack towards Budapest from the salient to the south around Arad. He was to use the 46th Soviet Army and the 1st Romanian Army, with the Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev as the exploitation force in case of a successful breakthrough. The remainder of Malinovsky's forces, including the 6th Guards Tank Army, 53rd Army, and Cavalry mechanized Group Gorshkov, were to attack from the north, near Oradea, towards Debrecen. The plan was for the two spearheads to link up and encircle the German forces. Meanwhile, Friessner's orders included an attack from Oradea with Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico. Operation begins The 2nd Ukrainian Front operation began on 6 October 1944, with Malinovsky's southern pincer attacking near Arad, and slicing through the Hungarian Third Army. The spearhead of the southern 2nd Ukrainian Front pincer, followed by the Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev, had advanced almost sixty kilometres within the first 24 hours. The attack by the northern 2nd Ukrainian Front pincer ran into difficulty quickly, colliding with the 1st Panzer Division and 23rd Panzer Divisions of the German III Panzer Corps. By the end of the day, the northern pincer had advanced only ten kilometres. Reacting quickly, Fretter-Pico ordered the 76th Infantry Division into the forward line near Oradea. This freed up the 23rd Panzer Division to move south to counter the breakthrough near Arad. The German Panzer Division Feldherrnhalle 1, refitting at Mezőkövesd, was moved into action to guard potential crossing points on the Tisza River against the advancing 2nd Ukrainian Front units. By the evening of 7 October 1944, the 2nd Ukrainian Front southern pincer had advanced further towards the Tisza River. Meanwhile, the northern pincer was still stalled near Oradea. In this area the German-Hungarian forces had managed to halt several flanking attempts by the 6th Guards Tank Army. Across the Tisza By 10 October, Malinovsky's troops occupied several bridgeheads on the western bank of the Tisza River, and elements of the 46th Army and the 18th Tank Corps were driving on Kecskemét, only 70 kilometres from Budapest. Malinovsky, however, had to redistribute some of these forces to support the advance of Pliyev's group on the other side of the Tisza. The remaining 2nd Ukrainian Front troops of this spearhead were attacked by the Hungarian cavalry and German anti- aircraft troops and forced to retreat to the Tisza on 11 October. The same day, Hungarian (1st Armored and 23rd Infantry Divisions) counter-attacks against the 2nd Ukrainian Front's 243rd Rifle Division at the Mindszent bridgehead became so dire that the Romanian VII Corps was rushed to Mindszent to reinforce the bridgehead's defense.Third Axis Fourth Ally, p. 201 Subsequently, the Romanian 2nd and 4th Infantry Divisions took over 2nd Ukrainian Front bridgeheads on the Tisza below Szolnok. The bridgehead of the 4th Division was attacked on 19 October by the Hungarian 1st Cavalry and 1st Infantry Divisions, which the 4th Division held back until hit on the right flank by the German 24th Panzer Division, 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division, and the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion. The right flank of the Romanian 4th Division caved in and the German armor drove behind the division, cutting it off from the Tisza River and eventually forcing its surrender by 20 October. On 25 October, three Hungarian divisions (1st Cavalry, 1st Infantry and 20th Infantry) attacked the Romanian 2nd Division in its bridgehead. The Romanian 2nd Division panicked and pulled back across the Tisza River.Third Axis Fourth Ally, p. 202 This Hungarian success, however, was not repeated when a third assault was made during 26–29 October against the Romanian 19th Infantry Division's bridgehead at Alpar. On 8 October 1944, Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev shifted its attack northeastward. Pliyev's group advanced quickly along the major highway between Szolnok to Debrecen. At Hajdúszoboszló, the group's lead units, the 9th Guards Mechanized and the 6th Guards Cavalry Corps, ran into elements of 23rd Panzer Division moving south to halt the southern pincer. On 9 October 1944, with support from the 5th Air Army, Pliyev's group took the town. The Germans fell back to Debrecen, and began entrenching to the southeast of the city. Continued battle On 11 October 1944, elements of Pliyev's 4th Guards Cavalry Corps reached the outskirts of Debrecen. Although this corps was cut off from the main Soviet force, Pliyev had managed to avoid encirclement. Under the 6th Guards Tank Army's attacks, the front line near Oradea was steadily pushed back, in what historian Earl F. Ziemke described as \\"one of the wildest tank battles of the war\\". By 12 October, Pliyev's group had already lost some 200 armored fighting vehicles. By 14 October 1944, the line had fallen back 14 kilometers, with Oradea occupied by Malinovsky's forces. Further to the north, a new crisis threatened Fretter-Pico. The 4th Ukrainian Front had finally attacked, falling on Otto Wöhler's German Eighth Army. Malinovsky now linked up with Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev. Forcing their way through the Axis resistance, during 19–20 October three Romanian divisions (2nd and 3rd Mountain, plus the Tudor Vladimirescu Division) assaulted and seized Debrecen as part of Soviet 27th Army's assault on the right flank of the 6th Guards Tank Army.Third Axis Fourth Ally, pp. 200-201 On 22 October 1944, Pliyev's group captured Nyíregyháza. The line of communications of Wöhler's Eighth Army was severed. German Colonel-General Friessner had ordered Wöhler to disengage and fall back northwest of Nyíregyháza and attempt to form a defensive line. This move was already in progress when Cavalry Mechanized Group Pliyev cut Wöhler's lines of communications. To address the developing threat, the German 23rd and 1st Panzer Divisions, led by the Tiger IIs of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion attacked to the east. Paul Klatt's 3rd Mountain Division, the 15th Infantry Division, and the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer formed the forces attacking to the west. On 24 October 1944, forces of the 23rd Panzer Division reached Nagykálló, which was already occupied by the German 3rd Mountain Division. On 26 October, the 23rd Panzer Division recaptured Nyíregyháza. Wöhler began moving his Eighth Army out through the escape route created through Nyíregyháza. By the 28th, Wöhler's army had escaped encirclement. By this time, Pliyev's forces destroyed most of their vehicles and heavy weapons and marched south to reach the Soviet lines.Glantz, When Titans Clashed, p. 223 Despite the attempted destruction by German forces, Pliyev's Cavalry- Mechanized Group was back in action by 10 November during the Soviet drive to Szeged. Aftermath Battle of Debrecen memorial Three corps of Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front had sustained significant losses in the fighting and the intended rapid 2nd Ukrainian Front assault on Budapest had been delayed. The Nyíregyháza counter-attack was the last time that German forces were to defeat a full-strength Red Army force on even terms. By pinching off the breakthrough exploitation group of the 2nd Ukrainian Front offensive, the Germans were able to re-establish a stable front line position, and thus, prevent the 2nd Ukrainian Front's advance from becoming a catastrophe for Wöhler. The German success, was however short-lived as Nyíregyháza was captured by the Red Army on 30 October, and another powerful Red Army offensive opened to the south with Budapest again being its objective, with the Soviets reaching the area of the Hungarian capital on 7 November 1944. The city of Debrecen fell on 20 October after two Romanian divisions, the first Romanian infantry division and the \`\`Tudor Vladimirescu\`\` division captured the city despite numerous German and Hungarian counter-attacks to stop their advance. As a result of their victory, the Romanian \`\`Tudor Vladimirescu\`\` division was renamed on Stalin\`s request the \`\`Tudor Vladimirescu - Debrecen\`\` division.The Road to Berlin, p. 397 The Debrecen operation saw the forces of the 2nd Ukrainian Front advance anywhere from 60 to 120 miles further west into Hungary, leaving the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts in position to renew the offensive towards Budapest. The tank battle at Debrecen itself had drawn the German Panzer units away from defending the approaches to Budapest. Finally, the Red Army thrust occupied the eastern third of Hungary, clearing the obstacle of the Transylvanian Alps and denying their use as a winter defense position for the Axis forces.

Headquartered today in Amman, Jordan, it serves clients in more than 600 branches spanning five continents. Arab Bank is a publicly held shareholding company listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. The bank is a major economic engine in Jordan and throughout the Middle East and North Africa region, providing banking services and capital, and facilitating development and trade throughout the region. According to its website, the bank is the highest-ranked by market capitalization, and represents approximately 25% of the Amman Stock Exchange. U.S. appellate courts have ruled in the bank’s favor in several lawsuits filed in the 2000s alleging its involvement in facilitating the funding of terrorist organizations. History =Establishment 1940-1970s= In the 1940s and 1950s, the bank grew to 43 branches and had JOD 5.5 million capital. During the 1960s, the bank focused on investments and became a catalyst for Arab economic developments when most other financial institutions avoided the risk. During the nationalization wave of the 1960s, Arab Bank lost a total of 25 branches. Following the Six-Day War in 1967, the bank closed its West Bank and Gaza branches. Although it closed branches in the Middle East, the bank continued to expand in other parts of the world. In 1961, the bank opened its first international location, becoming the first Arab financial institution to establish a presence in Switzerland. By 1964 Arab Bank Switzerland had locations in both Zürich and Geneva. In 1974, after his father's death, Abd Al-Majeed Shoman was named Chairman and General Manager of Arab Bank. Under his leadership, the bank expanded its scope of products and services into new areas of business. Though it previously emphasized trade and small-scale construction finance, the bank undertook a leading role in large-scale project finance, both directly and through participation in syndicated loans. By the 1990s, the bank added investment banking to its services. In the mid-1990s, the bank was given permission by the Central Bank of Jordan and the Israeli Central Bank to reopen in the West Bank/Gaza under the supervision of both the CBJ and the Palestinian Monetary Authority. =Expansion 2000–2010= In May 2000, Abd Al Majeed's son Abdel Hamid became CEO. Under his leadership, Arab Bank reopened operations in Syria in 2005, and took steps to commence its activities in Iraq, circumstances permitting. In January 2007, Arab Bank established Europe Arab Bank (EAB), a London-based, fully owned subsidiary. It also acquired 50% of MNG Bank in Turkey (now known as Turkland Bank) and 50% of Al Nisr Al Arabi Insurance company in Jordan, thus introducing bancassurance to its product variety. Also, the group established Arab Bank- Syria. In 2008, Arab Bank partnered with Vasco, now OneSpan, to work on the bank's authentication technology. Over the next few years, the bank opened branches in Frankfurt, London, Australia, New York and Singapore. Following the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestine, at the invitation of Israel, Arab Bank opened branches in several Palestinian towns with broad governmental support. =2011-present= Arab Bank headquarters in Amman, Jordan. Today, Arab Bank provides consumer banking services, as well as corporate and institutional banking services to individuals, corporations, government agencies and other international financial institutions. After years of being ranked A− from Fitch, A− from Standard & Poor, and A3 from Moody’s, the bank's rankings were dropped twice in 2011. Moody's first downgraded its Local Currency Deposit Rating to Baa1, and then downgraded the bank's Financial Strength Rating to a C− from a C. In both instances, Moody's noted the decision was based on an analysis of political instability in the region. In April 2012, Moody's announced a possible downgrade of the Bank's current Financial Strength Rating as well as its local currency long- and short-term deposit ratings. In November 2011, Standard & Poor's lowered its long-term counterparty credit ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+', noting the ratings are constrained by the local currency ratings on the sovereign. As of 25 January 2012, Fitch still had Arab Bank ranked at an A-. the bank reported net income after tax of $820.5 million as compared to $533 million in 2017 with net income before tax reaching $1.1 billion. The Group’s equity grew to reach $8.7 billion while the return on equity increased to reach 9.5%. The Group’s net operating income grew by 8% driven by growth in net interest and commission income. Credit facilities increased by 3% to reach $25.8 billon while customer deposits increased to reach $34.3 billion. As the only Jordanian organization ranked among the top 10 organizations in the Arab world, Arab Bank has shown great progress in its ESG performance throughout the years. During 2014, the Bank was ranked at the fifth level and was able to move up to the fourth level during 2015, with a total weight of 2.78%. =Compliance= In 2006, the bank participated at the International Anti- Money Laundering/Combating Financing Terrorism Conference hosted by the Union of Arab Banks and supported by the United States Department of the Treasury. The conference sought to unite the public and private sector in strengthening defenses against terrorist financing and money laundering in the MENA region. Since 2006, the bank has held a regulatory compliance summit with speakers from across the international banking community to discuss and learn more about the compliance environment. In 2008, at the request of the Association of Banks, Arab Bank hosted a compliance workshop attended by compliance professionals from banks throughout the country including the Central Bank of Jordan.

It is one of the only foundations created by a private sector company in Jordan. The Foundation organizes the Abd Al Hameed Shoman Cultural Forum which brings together leading scientists, educators and innovators of thoughtful discussion on today’s cultural issues. In 2011, Arab Bank committed approximately 87% of its annual budget for community investment through the foundation. In 2011, the Bank donated over 8 million Jordanian dinars to its Abd Al-Hameed Shoman Foundation to support scientific research and studies in the humanities in Jordan and the Middle East. In late 2009, Arab Bank launched 'Together', a corporate social responsibility program that links four non-profits dedicated to poverty alleviation, education, health and environmental protection. In 2011, Arab Bank donated more than 177,000 Jordanian dinars to the Together Program. In March 2011, Arab Bank Chairman Abdel Hamid Shoman announced the Bank would be partnering with the private sector and allocating one million Jordanian Dinars for development projects to help fight against poverty and unemployment in Jordan. Past lawsuits Several civil lawsuits were filed against the Bank in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn under the Anti-Terrorism Act and Alien Tort Statute in 2004, all of which resulted in decisions in favor of the bank. In these cases, U.S. and non-U.S. plaintiffs alleged they or their family members were harmed by acts of terrorism that occurred in Israel or the West Bank/Gaza from 1995 to 2005. They alleged that the bank held accounts for individuals and organizations that, in turn, supported terrorist activities. Similar cases were brought against UBS, Credit Lyonnais, Bank of China, American Express Bank, National Westminster Bank and Commerzbank. On 9 February 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a liability verdict in the case of Linde v. Arab Bank Plc in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The verdict overturned from 22 September 2014 after 30 days of trial and two days of jury deliberation, found the bank liable for knowingly supporting terrorism relating to 24 different terrorist acts. The Second Circuit found that the District Court erred in failing to provide the jury with adequate instructions during the court proceedings. In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York dismissed Jesner v. Arab Bank, a case filed by 6,000 foreign citizens injured in Israel during the Second Intifada under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), ruling that corporations are not proper defendants in ATS suits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously affirmed this dismissal in December 2015. In April 2017, the Supreme Court of the United States granted the plaintiffs' petition to hear the case. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held in October 2017, and on 24 April 2018, the Court affirmed the dismissal of all claims against the bank, finding that foreign corporations are not proper defendants in cases brought under the ATS. On 6 November 2012, a U.S. judge dismissed a civil litigation action brought by Israeli resident Mati Gill under the Anti- Terrorism Act for injuries he sustained in an alleged terrorist attack in Israel in 2008. In 2005, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed a $24 million penalty against the New York Branch of Arab Bank for failing to implement an adequate anti-money laundering program to manage the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, and violating the suspicious activity reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. On 1 October 2018, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated this consent order. On 26 February 2004 the Israel Defense Forces confiscated funds from Arab Bank's and Cairo- Amman Bank's Ramallah branch in connection with an investigation into whether certain account holders were supporting terrorism. In September 2009, the IDF issued a letter to Arab Bank stating that it had no evidence that the Bank or any of its directors or employees were involved in or funded terrorist activities.

Characteristics The Cape hare is a typical hare, with well-developed legs for leaping and running, and large eyes and ears to look for threats from its environment. Usually, a white ring surrounds the eye. It has a fine, soft coat which varies in colour from light brown to reddish to sandy grey. Unusually among mammals, the female is larger than the male, an example of sexual dimorphism. Habitat It inhabits macchia-type vegetation, grassland, bushveld, the Sahara Desert and semi- desert areas. It is also common in parts of the Ethiopian highlands, such as Degua Tembien. Ecology A Cape hare caught by an Asiatic cheetah in Miandasht Wildlife Refuge, Iran. The Cape hare is a nocturnal herbivore, feeding on grass and various shrubs. Coprophagy, the consumption of an organism's own fecal material to double the amount of time food spends in the digestive tract, is a common behaviour amongst rabbits and hares. This habit allows the animal to extract the maximum nourishment from its diet, and microbes present in the pellets also provide nutrients. Like other hares, they run fast. The only predator which is capable of outrunning them is the cheetah. All other predators are ambush and/or opportunistic hunters; examples of these are leopards, caracals, and black-backed jackals. After a 42-day-long pregnancy, the female gives birth to from one to three young, termed leverets, per litter and may have as many as 4 litters per year. A characteristic of hares which differentiates them from rabbits is that the young are born precocial; that is, the young are born with eyes open and are able to move about shortly after birth. The Cape hare is no exception in this regard.

Transylvanian Plateau 8\\\\. Serbian Carpathians Divisions of the Carpathians are categorization of the Carpathian mountains system. Below is a detailed overview of the major subdivisions and ranges of the Carpathian Mountains. The Carpathians are a \\"subsystem\\" of a bigger Alps-Himalaya System that stretches from the western Europe all the way to southern Asia, and are further divided into \\"provinces\\" and \\"subprovinces\\". The last level of the division, i.e. the actual mountain ranges and basins, is usually classified as \\"units\\". The main divisions are shown in the map on the right. To generalize, there are three major provinces (regions): Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians, and Southern Carpathians.  Naming Conventions  The division is largely (with many exceptions) undisputed at the lowest level (except for the Ukrainian part), but various divisions are given for the higher levels, especially for the penultimate level. A geomorphological division has been used as much as the data was available; other new physiogeographic divisions were used in other cases. Where the classification of a higher level \\"title\\" is known/sure, it is added at the end of the name in brackets, e.g. \\"(subprovince)\\". ;Taxonomy The names are also given in the language of the corresponding country and marked by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes: *AT=Austria *CZ=Czech Republic *HU=Hungary *PL=Poland *RO=Romania * RS=Serbia *SK=Slovakia *UA=Ukraine The most confusing and diverse is the classification of the Beskids, including the Western Beskids, the Central Beskids and the Eastern Beskids. Their geologic features are fairly distinct, but multiple traditions, languages and nationalities have developed overlapping variants for the divisions and names of these ranges. In Romania, it is usual to divide the Eastern Carpathians in Romanian territory into three formal groups (northern, central, southern), instead in Outer and Inner sections of Eastern Carpathians. The Romanian approach is shown by adding the following abbreviations to the names of units within Romania: *MMB = Maramureș-Bukovinian Carpathians (Munții Carpați ai Maramureșului și Bucovinei) *MMT = Moldavian-Transylvanian Carpathians (Munții Carpați Moldo- Transilvani) *MC = Curvature Carpathians (Munții Carpați de Curbură) Similar standard (grouping of outer and inner sections) is traditionally applied within broader use of the term \\"Wooded Carpathians\\", that encompasses all mountain ranges within central section of Outer Eastern Carpathians, including Eastern Beskids with Polonynian Mountains, and also all mountains within northern section of Inner Eastern Carpathians, including Vihorlat-Gutin Area and Maramureș-Rodna Area. The Transylvanian Plateau is encircled by, and geologically a part of, the Carpathians. But it is not a mountainous region and its inclusion is disputed in some sources. Its features are included below. The Serbian Carpathians are sometimes considered part of the Southern Carpathians (together with the Banat Mountains), sometimes not considered part of the Carpathians at all. They're included below. The Outer Carpathian Depressions lay outside the broad arc of the entire formation and are usually listed as part of the individual divisions of the Carpathian Mountains, i.e. of Western Carpathians, Eastern Carpathians etc. With the difficulty of finding their exact subdivisions, they are given only as a list of the final units (mountains\\" etc.) from the west to the east and south, in a separate listing at the end.

Originally airing on October 11, 1977, with a rebroadcast on June 5, 1978 (which saw CBS move the show to Mondays at 9 p.m.), it was written and directed by Alan Alda. Overview Hawkeye and B.J. are surprised to find Sidney Freedman among the latest batch of incoming casualties. He had gone to the front lines to check up on Tom, a soldier who had previously been sent to the 4077th after being wounded. Sidney had counseled him and returned him to duty, but both of them were hit in an artillery barrage during his visit. The whole camp is on edge due to a series of petty squabbles, so Colonel Potter offers to discreetly send some of the personnel to meet with Sidney and talk out their frustrations. Sidney is able to get them to reflect on the causes of their anxieties, and their moods begin to improve. Hawkeye and B.J. are surprised to see Tom in good spirits so soon after his first visit, which Sidney explains as a result of getting soldiers back on the front lines as quickly as possible, However, when face to face, Tom angrily berates Sidney for sending him back into battle so that he could be wounded again and vows never to forgive him. Afterward, Sidney and Father Mulcahy discuss the pain they feel when they lose someone under their respective care - a mind and a soul, respectively - and Mulcahy urges Sidney to focus on the success he has had in treating soldiers. Meanwhile, Sergeant Zale and Private Straminsky have been tasked with burning a batch of disease-infested clothing confiscated from Chinese patients. They argue back and forth at first, but soon decide to work together and add other combustible items to the pile in order to make a larger fire. An unamused Potter initially orders them to remove the extra material, but Sidney persuades him to let them go ahead with it as a way to relieve stress. The camp builds and lights a huge bonfire, throwing on items of particular annoyance (such as a copy of the Army cookbook, Radar's bugle, and Sidney's fatigues), and sings \\"Keep the Home Fires Burning.\\" The next morning, Radar digs his bugle out of the ashes and plays reveille, with Potter jokingly remarking that the instrument sounds slightly better for having been put in the fire. Cast Guest cast is Allan Arbus as Major Sidney Freedman, Johnny Haymer as Staff Sergeant Zelmo Zale, Peter Riegert as Private Igor Straminsky, and Michael O'Keefe as Tom. In \\"Mad Dogs and Servicemen\\", Michael O'Keefe played a soldier who suffered from hysterical paralysis. While the name of the soldier was Corporal Richard Travis, his middle name/nickname might have been \\"Tom\\". There are other indications, however, that despite the obvious similarities between the episodes there are also some notable differences: In the earlier episode, O'Keefe's character arrives at the 4077th with Hysterical Paralysis (without mentioning any specific incident that may have triggered it), so Hawkeye and Trapper contact Sidney by phone who advises them offscreen to try his technique themselves - which they do, and after some initial setbacks O'Keefe's character regains his mobility and returns to the front; however in this episode (despite utilizing the same guest actor, same diagnosis, and a similar scenario) Sidney claims that O'Keefe's character was carried into his office after witnessing 3 of his friends killed, and that he worked with the soldier directly before returning him to the front himself. He also appears grateful and shows no anger towards Hawkeye as he did in the prior episode for his role in returning him to the front, and instead directs all his hostility at Sidney. One of two episodes where Private Igor Straminsky was played by Peter Riegert, instead of Jeff Maxwell, who portrayed Igor in 59 episodes over the run of the show.

Introduced populations exist in a wide variety of locations in the Southern Hemisphere. Taxonomy The Javan rusa is featured on a 1988 Indonesian rupiah banknote Seven subspecies of the Javan rusa are recognised: *R. t. timorensis (Timor rusa deer) - Timor. *R. t. djonga - Muna and Butung Islands. *R. t. floresiensis (Flores rusa deer) - Flores and other islands. *R. t. macassaricus (Celebes rusa deer) - Celebes. *R. t. moluccensis (Moluccan rusa deer) - Molucca Islands. *R. t. renschi - Bali. *R. t. russa (Javan rusa deer) - Java. Description Rusa deer are distinguished by their large ears, the light tufts of hair above the eyebrows, and antlers that appear large relative to the body size. The antlers are lyre- shaped and three-tined. Males are bigger than females; head-to-body length varies from , with a tail. Males weigh 152–160 kg, female about 74 kg. The pelage is grayish-brown and often appears coarse. Unlike most other deer species, newborn fawns do not bear spots. Distribution and habitat Herd of rusa deer at the Baluran National Park The Javan rusa natively occurs on the islands of Java, Bali, and Timor in Indonesia. It has been introduced to Irian Jaya, Borneo (Kalimantan), the Lesser Sunda Islands, Maluku, Sulawesi, Pohnpei, Mauritius, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, the Christmas Islands, the Cocos Islands, Nauru, Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, New Britain, and New Ireland. Rusa deer were introduced by the Dutch to New Guinea during the early 1900s.Georges, A., Guarino, F., & Bito, B. (2006). Freshwater turtles of the TransFly region of Papua New Guinea – notes on diversity, distribution, reproduction, harvest and trade. Wildlife Research, 33(5), 373. Its habitat preferences are similar to that of the chital of India: open dry and mixed deciduous forests, parklands, and savannas. Rusa deer have established populations in remote islands, probably brought there by Indonesian fishermen. They adapt well, living as comfortably in the dry Australian bush as they do in their tropical homelands. This trait is shown well in the more frequent encounters on the fringes of Wollongong and Sydney, and in particular in the Royal National Park, indicating steadily growing numbers and strong herds. Ecology Rusa deer are active mostly in the early morning and late afternoon. They are rarely seen in the open and are very difficult to approach due to their keen senses and cautious instincts. The species is very sociable, and individuals are rarely found alone. When alarmed, a rusa stag lets out an extremely loud honk. This is an alarm call and alerts any other deer in the vicinity. As with other deer species, Javan rusa mainly feed on grass, leaves, and fallen fruit. They do not drink water, deriving all required fluid from their food. The main predators of the species include the Javan leopard, the dhole, crocodiles, pythons, and the Komodo dragon. =Reproduction= The Javan rusa mates around July and August, when stags contest by calling in a loud, shrill bark and duelling with the antlers. The doe gives birth to one or two calves after a gestation period of 8 months, at the start of spring. Calves are weaned at 6–8 months, and sexual maturity is attained at 3–5 years, depending on habitat conditions. Javan rusas live 15–20 years both in the wild and in captivity.

The film was directed by John Stockwell and was co-distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures. Plot A sea plane flying on a stormy night malfunctions and crashes in the sea off the coast of the Bahamas. Jared and Sam are lovers living a rustic life in a trailer, next to the beach in the Bahamas. Sam works as a guide in the local aquatic theme park, while Jared works a number of odd jobs in his field of passion, diving. His real dream is to find one of many treasure-filled merchant and pirate ships lost in the waters around the Bahamas. Derek Bates has similar dreams and a better boat, but Jared turns down repeated offers to work for him. Jared's childhood friend, Bryce, and his girlfriend, Amanda (whom he just met the night before), come to visit. Bryce, a lawyer in New York City, has acquired the use of a luxury vacation house from a client he defended. While snorkeling, Jared finds artifacts on the sea bed that seem to stem from a ship wreck. The four of them investigate and find several other pieces that turn out to be the remains of legendary French pirate ship Zephyr. They also discover the crashed plane and its cargo of cocaine--Bryce and Amanda want to recover it, but Jared refuses, dispersing the brick they retrieved into the ocean. Needing money for equipment to salvage the treasure, Bryce and Amanda dive to the plane then try to sell a few bricks of recovered cocaine to local night club owner Primo. Primo turns out to be an associate of drug lord Reyes, to whom the cocaine belonged in the first place. Jared, Bryce, and Amanda are threatened by Reyes, who demands that they retrieve his cocaine or face deadly consequences. When the trio inform Sam, she berates Jared for violating his principles by helping a drug lord. He tries to explain the situation, but she leaves him, saying that 'they' are over. After nightfall, Jared, Bryce, and Amanda dive at the plane wreck to salvage the cocaine and more artifacts. As they are moving the cocaine packs from the plane to their boat, Amanda is attacked and bitten on the leg by a tiger shark. They abandon the cocaine at the dive site to rush her to the hospital, where she dies. Hearing of the tragedy, Sam reunites with Jared, mourning for the loss of Amanda. Sam insists on going to the police, and goes to the home of one of their friends, a local cop named Roy. Roy turns her over to Derek Bates, knowing that he was Reyes' partner in the cocaine deal. Primo has captured Jared and taken him aboard Reyes' ship, where they find that Bates has killed Reyes and his entire crew, eventually killing Primo and Roy as well. Jared and Bryce learn of Sam's captivity, and set out to rescue her from Bates' ship, now anchored over the cocaine plane. Sam is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape. They kill Bates' divers at the plane, while their friend Danny helps Sam dispatch the men on Bates' boat. Below, Jared and Bates are the only ones left. Jared confronts Bates in the plane, eventually using an air tank as a missile by hammering off the valve. Bates dodges it, but it hits the fuel tank at the back of the plane, causing a major explosion, killing Bates. Sam jumps into the water and rescues Jared. Six weeks later, the trio is salvaging the Zephyr. While trying to bring an old cannon to the surface, the rope breaks and the cannon sinks back down breaking a part of the ship. Jared is ready to call it a night, but Bryce dives in again and shouts that he has found gold.

It shows film crews wearing chain mail as protection, while the cast members perform in the water unprotected. The filming was made possible by the development of shark tourism in the Bahamas. The sharks are used to being hand fed and will not generally attack humans, but as a result, will grab any item that \\"hits\\" the water as potential food. In an early scene, Paul Walker has to grab two fins and a dive mask flung to him by Jessica Alba. During filming, he missed the mask. It was never seen again after hitting the water and the DVD suggests that it was taken by a shark. In an interview with Sean Evans on the 1st of October 2020 for his show Hot Ones, Jessica Alba explained how the production had caught a tiger shark, which they then caged. Director John Stockwell wanted her and another actor to be in the water with the tiger shark. Alba refused to get into the water, citing concerns about swimming with a wild tiger shark. Reception =Box office= Into the Blue was a box-office flop. Produced on a budget of $50 million, the film made just $18 million in North America and $26 million internationally for a total of $44 million worldwide. =Critical response= Rotten Tomatoes lists it with a \\"rotten\\" rating of 21% based on 125 reviews. The site's consensus is: \\"Even the endless shots of bronzed beach babes and buffed dudes can't keep this soggy scuba flick's plot from drowning\\". Metacritic lists a rating of 45 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, which indicates \\"mixed or average reviews\\".Metacritic (Into The Blue) =Awards= Jessica Alba earned a nomination for Worst Actress at the 26th Golden Raspberry Awards for her performance in the film (as well as for her performance in Fantastic Four), but lost the trophy to Jenny McCarthy for Dirty Love.

Life Edward Baldwin Whitney was born August 16, 1857. His father was linguist William Dwight Whitney (1827–1894) of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin, daughter of US Senator and Governor of Connecticut Roger Sherman Baldwin. He graduated from Yale College, 1878, where he was a member of Skull and Bones along with future US President William H. Taft. After Yale he went on to the Columbia Law School and was admitted to the bar of New York, 1880. He was managing clerk, Bristow, Peet & Opdyke.

(1971). \\"The Flatback Turtle, Chelonia depressa Garman in Southeast Queensland, Australia\\". Herpetologica 27 (4): 431–446. is a species of sea turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. This turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other sea turtles. It can be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other sea turtle hatchlings when they hatch. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time. It was previously listed as vulnerable in 1994. It is not as threatened as other sea turtles due to its small dispersal range. Taxonomy The flatback sea turtle was originally described as Chelonia depressa in 1880 by American herpetologist Samuel Garman. The genus Natator (meaning \\"swimmer\\") was created in 1908 by Australian ichthyologist Allan Riverstone McCulloch, and in the same scientific paper he described what he thought to be a new species, Natator tessellatus, thereby creating a junior synonym. In 1988 Swiss paleontologist Rainer Zangerl assigned the flatback sea turtle to the genus Natator as the new combination Natator depressus. Because Chelonia is feminine, and Natator is masculine, the specific name was changed from depressa to depressus. Description Illustration of a top view of a flatback sea turtle. The flatback turtle is a sea turtle that can be recognized by its smooth flat-domed shell, or carapace, which has upturned edges along the sides. It has the coloration of olive green or a mixture of grey and green. This matches the coloration of its head. The underside, also called the plastron, has a much lighter coloration of a pale yellow. The flatback sea turtle has an average carapace length ranging from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 in), and weighs from 70 to 90 kg (about 155 to 200 lb). The females of this species are larger than the males in adulthood and also have been found to have longer tails than their male counterparts. Features of this sea turtle which help contribute to its recognition are the single pair of prefrontal scales on the head, and the four pairs of coastal scutes on the carapace. Another unique feature of this species of sea turtle is the fact that its carapace is found to be much thinner than other sea turtle carapaces. This feature causes the shell to crack under the smallest pressures. The skull superficially resembles that of the olive ridley but details of the braincase most closely resemble those found in the green sea turtle Geographic range The flatback sea turtle has the smallest range of the seven sea turtles. It is found in the continental shelf and coastal waters of tropic regions. It does not travel long distances in the open ocean for migrations like other sea turtles. It can typically be found in waters of or less in depth. It does not have a global distribution like the other sea turtles. The flatback sea turtle can be found along the coastal waters of Northern Australia, the Tropic of Capricorn, and the coastal areas of Papua New Guinea. Its distribution within Australia is in the areas of eastern Queensland, Torres Strait and Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory, and Western Australia. The distribution of nesting sites can be found across Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, with the greatest concentration found in Queensland, in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Within Queensland, the nesting sites can be found from the south in Bundaberg to the Torres Strait in the north. The main nesting sites in this range are the southern Great Barrier Reef, Wild Duck, and Curtis Island. The Torres Strait contains the major nesting sites for these turtles. Within the Northern Territory, nesting sites are more widely dispersed in this area with a wide variety of beach types on this coastline. In the Western Australia area, the important nesting sites found have been the Kimberley Region, Cape Dommett, and the Lacrosse Island. Habitat The flatback sea turtle lives in the shallow, soft-bottomed tropical and subtropical waters. This turtle sticks to the continental shelf of Australia and can be found in grassy areas, bays, lagoons, estuaries, and any place with a soft-bottomed sea bed. The habitats that females prefer for nesting sites are sandy beaches in tropical and subtropical areas. They prefer beaches where the sand temperature can be in the range of 29 °C to 33 °C (84 to 91 °F) at nest depth, which are the temperatures that help determine the hatchling's sex. Life history =Early life= The hatchlings begin to leave the nests during the beginning of December, and the clutches will continue to hatch until late March. The peak of hatchling emergence can be seen during February. A flatback sea turtle hatchling is larger than other sea turtle hatchlings with its carapace length averaging . Its large size helps protect it from some of the predators after hatching, and allows it to also be a stronger swimmers. The hatchlings tend to stay close to shore and lack the pelagic phase of other sea turtles. The hatchlings will feed on the macroplankton present in their surface-dwelling environment.A flatback turtle hatchling on its way to the sea. =Reproduction= A flatback sea turtle is sexually mature anywhere between 7–50 years of age, and an adult female will nest every two to three years. Mating occurs while the male and female are out at sea; therefore, the males will never return to shore after they hatch. The flatback nesting sites can only be found along the coast of Australia within the slopes of the dunes. A female will return to the same beach for her subsequent clutches within the same nesting season. She will return for other nesting seasons, as well. Depending on the area of the nesting site, the nesting season can go from November to January or can last the entire year. Females are able to lay up to four times throughout the nesting season, and the intervals between nesting can be 13–18 days. While using her front flippers to dig, the female will clear away the dry sand located at the top. After she clears the sand, the female will create an egg chamber using her back flippers. After she has laid her eggs, she will then cover the nest again using her back flippers, while also tossing sand back with her front flippers. The number of eggs in a flatback sea turtle's clutch are fewer than other sea turtles. It will have an average of 50 eggs laid each time in a clutch, while other sea turtles may lay up to 100-150 eggs in a clutch. The eggs are about long within these clutches. The sex of the flatback turtle hatchling is determined by the temperature of the sand that the egg is in. If the temperature is below 29 °C (84 °F), the hatchling will be a male, and if the temperature is above this 29 °C it will be female. Ecology A sea cucumber, which is an organism found in the flatback sea turtle's diet. =Diet= The flatback sea turtle is an omnivorous species, but predominantly eats a carnivorous diet. It feeds mostly on the prey found within the shallow waters where it swims. It has been found to feed on soft corals, sea cucumbers, shrimp, jellyfish, mollusks, and other invertebrates. It will also occasionally feed on seagrasses, even though it rarely feeds on vegetation. A fox, which is a terrestrial predator of the flatback sea turtle. =Predators= The flatback sea turtle is preyed upon by both terrestrial and aquatic organisms. The terrestrial predators it must face are foxes, feral dogs, and pigs. The aquatic predators to this turtle are sharks. The hatchlings also face predation from crabs, birds, and small crocodiles on their journey to the waters. Once in the water, the hatchlings can be preyed upon by fish and even sharks. Due to their large size when they are born and their strong swimming skills, the likelihood of capture is lowered. Conservation =Status= An example of gillnets, which are a threat to the flatback sea turtle. On the International Union for the Conservation of Nature or the IUCN's official website the flatback sea turtle is listed as data deficient. However, the flatback sea turtle is listed as vulnerable nationally in Australia. It is the least endangered of all of the sea turtles. Unlike other sea turtles, there is not a big human demand for the meat of the flatback sea turtle. It does not swim far from shore; thus, it does not get caught in nets as often as other sea turtles. These reasons can contribute to why it is not in more danger of extinction. =Threats= All marine turtles are faced with threats such as habitat loss, the wildlife trade, collection of eggs, collection of meat, by-catch, pollution, and climate change. The flatback sea turtle is specifically threatened by the direct harvest of eggs and meat by the indigenous people of Australia for traditional hunting. These people are given the right to harvest by the government, but only if for non- commercial purposes. Another threat is the destruction of nesting beaches due to coastal development and the destruction of feeding sites at coral reefs and the shallow areas near the shore. Camping on these beaches compacts the sand and contributes to dune erosion, and the wheel ruts caused by vehicles driving on the beaches can trap the hatchlings on their journey to the sea. Coastal development contributes to barriers that make it difficult or impossible for adult turtles to reach nesting and feeding sites. The flatback sea turtle also falls prey to incidental capture. It is caught by fishermen, particularly by trawling, gillnet fishing, ghost nets, and crab pots. Lastly, pollution is a concern for this creature. Pollution can affect the timing of egg laying, how it chooses its nesting site, how hatchlings find the sea after emerging, and how adult turtles find the beaches. Historically climate change was thought to be an influential factor affecting the success of flatback sea turtle development, however, through recent research, performed on a select group of turtles, this was found to be untrue. Researchers have studied whether increased nest temperatures would be detrimental to embryos, whether through embryo death or negatively adapted phenotypes. However, the increased nest temperature did not reduce the success of the hatchlings, the hatchling body size, but it did accelerate the development of the embryo. It was also discovered that there was a high 'pivotal sex-determining temperature' in the specific flatback population, which shows that some populations may had adapted to maintain large number of hatchlings of both sexes even under the effects of climate change. =Conservation Methods= In 2003, a recovery plan was set in place nationally to help this species along with other sea turtles. This plan aims to reduce mortality rates through actions within commercial fisheries and to maintain a sustainable harvest by indigenous people. Monitoring programs are being developed and integrated, along with managing factors that affect the reproductive success of this species. In Kakadu National Park, a monitoring program has already been set up for this species. This species' critical habitat is being identified for protection. People are also trying to enhance the communication about information on the flatback sea turtle, and enhance the cooperation and actions internationally.

The station is located at the junction of Yishun Avenue 2 and Yishun Avenue 5, and is currently one of the two MRT stations that serve Yishun New Town; the other being Khatib station. Yishun station was the terminus of the NSL upon its completion on 20 December 1988, until the Woodlands Extension of the NSL was completed and opened on 10 February 1996. History Platform level of Yishun station. Yishun opened on 20 December 1988, two years earlier than planned. During the start of construction in December 1984, Nee Soon North― the original name of the station― was renamed to Yishun and Nee Soon South was renamed to Khatib. Yishun station was one of the first three stations to undergo testing as to whether the platform screen doors were viable for elevated stations. Eventually, installation of the half-height platform screen doors started on 26 August 2009 and operations commenced on 2 December that year. Half-height screen doors have been installed in all elevated stations since. Yishun station also have high-volume low-speed fans installed, which started operations since 27 June 2012. Yishun station was also the first batch of ten stations to have additional bicycle parking facilities under a National Cycling Plan announced in 2010. =Incidents= Concourse and ticket barriers at Yishun station. Exit A of the station. In 1990, there was a power failure which occurred at Yishun station. In December 2001, the Singapore embassies attack plot was discovered, and had included plans to bomb Yishun MRT station at several points, including the sewers near the station. This was brought up in a debate during a session of the parliament, during which new security measures were proposed, especially on the MRT system itself. On 16 April 2003, power supply to trackside equipment between Yio Chu Kang and Sembawang stations was disrupted at 8:02am due to a lightning strike which affected eight point machines along the track. After the SMRT staff manually secured the points and fixed the positions, northbound train services were restored at 8:30am while southbound services were restored at 8:48am. On the early morning of 5 December 2006, a foreign worker in his early twenties, was hit by a southbound train at the station and caused trains from Sembawang to Yio Chu Kang stations to be disrupted for more than an hour. He was later pronounced dead. In February 2007, a leaked CCTV footage of the incident along with another at Admiralty station began circulating on the Internet, with the man in question crawling from under the platform and onto the track as the train approaches,\\"Leaked footage of man hit by train sets Net abuzz\\", Melissa Sim, The Straits Times, 26 February 2007 leading to suggestions that it was a case of suicide. On 19 January 2008 at about 3:30pm (SST), a call was made from a public telephone at the MRT Station alleging that there was a bomb at the station. Police arrested a 31-year old Chinese man believed to be linked to the crime on 23 February that year at 4:00pm. The man was charged on 25th of that month for transmitting a false message that makes reference to a bomb. At 11:45am on 11 October that year, a man was found on the tracks of the station and was sent to hospital. Train service was disrupted in between Sembawang and Yio Chu Kang stations, affecting 2,900 people. Regular service resumed at 12:16pm.

The team first appears in The Champions #1 (October 1975) and was created by writer Tony Isabella and artist Don Heck. Their titular series is regarded as an example of a failed superteam comic, suffering from constant turnover in the writers and artists working on the series, lack of a consistent direction or concept, and mediocre sales. Publication history According to the letters page of Champions #6, writer Tony Isabella developed the concept of a new team of superheroes and originally wanted the roster to consist of former X-Men the Angel and the Iceman, and the newly created Black Goliath. Black Goliath became unavailable when the character debuted in his own title, forcing Isabella to rethink the concept. Editor Len Wein insisted on at least five members, and Isabella added three established heroes: Russian spy Black Widow, the Greek god Hercules, and the supernatural avenger Ghost Rider. Captain Marvel, Power Man, and the Son of Satan were all considered for the final place on the roster before selecting the Ghost Rider. Writer and publisher David Anthony Kraft is credited with naming the team, with the title originally intended to be published in the Giant-Size format as Giant-Size Champions. Production difficulties, which caused a three-month delay between the first and second issues, prevented this. Isabella has disputed this account on several points. First, he said, his original concept for the series was not a team book at all, but a humorous heroes-on-the-highway series in the vein of Route 66 with Angel and Iceman. Black Goliath was not discussed during the meeting which laid out the series concept, but rather was a character he planned to have join the Champions later, precisely because he was a character with his own series, also written by Isabella. Finally, he insisted that the series was always going to be in a regular size format, and has hypothesized that the \\"giant-size\\" story was put forward to cover up the fact that the team was missing deadlines. He also said that he chose the Black Widow, Hercules, and the Ghost Rider for the group under the editorial requirements that the team must have a woman, a strong man, and at least one character with their own series. The title was eventually published as The Champions, and ran for 17 issues from October 1975 to January 1978. Publication continued to be erratic; the series went back and forth between monthly and bi-monthly throughout its run. The creative team saw an exceptionally high level of overturn, with 12 different writer/penciller/inker combinations over the course of just 17 issues. In addition to Don Heck, artists who drew the series include George Tuska, Bob Hall, and John Byrne. Starting with issue #8, the remainder of the series was written and pencilled by industry newcomers still learning their craft with the sole exception that the final issue was pencilled by Tuska. Though the reason for this is not known, it has been hypothesized that the series was already on the brink of cancellation at this point, making it a less risky place to field rookie creators. A common criticism of The Champions was that the team lacked any sort of theme or reason for the members to continue working together. Isabella intended from the beginning for the Champions to be a superhero team for the common man, but admitted that the series never brought this theme across in a convincing way. The team never acquired their own rogues gallery, and instead battled established Marvel villains such as Pluto, the Stranger, and Kamo Tharnn, along with the occasional new foe such as Swarm. The Black Widow is elected the leader of the Champions in issue #5, and in issue #7 the team gets a headquarters. Russian heroine Darkstar became a regular character starting in issue #10, though she never actually joins the team. Black Goliath guest-stars in issue #11. In an effort to boost the series's flagging sales, the Champions were featured as guest-stars for three consecutive months: in Iron Man Annual #4 (August 1977), The Avengers #163 (September 1977), and Godzilla, King of the Monsters #3 (October 1977). The attempt failed, and Champions was cancelled with issue #17. The second-to-last issue continued a story involving a power struggle between villains Doctor Doom and Magneto from the title Super-Villain Team-Up. Loose plot threads left by the last issue were wrapped up in Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #17-18 (April-May 1978), in which the Champions disband. In the short story \\"On the Air\\", published in the 1996 anthology The Ultimate X-Men, an interviewer asks the Angel about the Champions. The Angel defends the group's worth, saying they should be judged not by the short time they were together, but by how many people they helped.

A new team also called the Champions, composed of teenage superheroes and with no connection to the 1970s team, debuted in October 2016. Trademark dispute In 1987, Heroic Publishing began using the name \\"The Champions\\" for a role-playing game series which has been adapted into comic books. The United States Patent and Trademark Office ruled that Marvel had abandoned its trademark of the name and could no longer use it, causing a planned 2007 revival of the series to be renamed The Order. This has since been resolved, with Marvel publishing a new Champions series that debuted following their Civil War II event.

He maintains that sexual orientation is heavily influenced by biology and male homosexuality is most likely inborn. Bailey wrote The Man Who Would Be Queen, a book intended to explain the biology of male sexual orientation and gender to a general audience, focusing on gender nonconforming boys, gay men and male-to-female transsexuals. The book elicited reactions ranging from strong criticism to a nomination for an award, later retracted, from the Lambda Literary Foundation, an organization that promotes gay literature. Education and career Bailey was born in Lubbock, Texas. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Washington University in 1979 and his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989, where he studied under behavioral genetics researcher Lee Willerman. Bailey became a professor at Northwestern University in 1989. In the 1990s, Bailey published several papers that suggested a heritable component for sexual orientation. In 2003 he published The Man Who Would Be Queen. In October 2004, Bailey stepped down as chairman of the Psychology Department. Bailey continues to serve as a Northwestern professor. According to Google Scholar, Bailey's works have been cited more than 15,000 times and he has an h-index of 61. Research =Biology and sexual orientation= Bailey is well known for research involving biology and sexual orientation. In the early 1990s Bailey and Richard Pillard coauthored a series of twin studies which examined the rate of concordance of sexual identity among monozygotic twins (52% concordance), dizygotic twins of the same sex (22%), non-twin siblings of the same sex, and adoptive siblings of the same sex (11%). More recent research by Bailey et al. on twins however found much lower concordance rates for monozygotic twins regarding homosexual orientation of only 20% for men and 24% for women pointing to a significant contribution of environmental factors in sexual orientation; Bailey suggests an explanation for the much lower concordance rate among monozygotic twins in this study as opposed to previous studies: In those previous studies, twins deciding whether to participate in a study clearly related to homosexuality probably considered the sexual orientation of their co-twins before agreeing to participate.Bailey, J. Michael; Dunne, Michael P; Martin, Nicholas G.Genetic and Environmental Influences on Sexual Orientation and Its Correlates in an Australian Twin Sample. J Pers Soc Psychol, Volume 78(3).March 2000.524–536. link http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/JMichael- Bailey/Publications/Bailey%20et%20al.%20twins,2000.pdf =Homosexuality= Another line of Bailey's research has concerned the ways that homosexuals are sex-atypical (or gender nonconforming) compared with heterosexuals, as well as the ways that homosexuals are sex-typical and gender conforming. For example, he published a meta-analysis showing that on average, homosexual men and women recall being much more gender nonconforming children, compared with heterosexual children. In contrast, he also showed that for many traits related to mating (such as interest in casual sex, and emphasis on a partner's physical attractiveness), homosexuals appear to be similar to heterosexuals of their own sex. He has also researched the gaydar phenomenon. Bailey has been interested in the evolutionary paradox of the persistence of homosexuality. \\"Male homosexuality is evolutionarily maladaptive,\\" he told The New York Times, which also noted that Bailey intended \\"that the phrase means only that genes favoring homosexuality cannot be favored by evolution if fewer such genes reach the next generation.\\" In an article coauthored with Aaron Greenberg, he suggested that allowing parents to choose the sexual orientation of their children is morally acceptable, provided the means used to accomplished that goal are themselves morally acceptable. (For example, killing infants who will become homosexual would obviously be wrong. The acceptability of aborting \\"gay fetuses\\" or \\"straight fetuses\\" would depend on whether one believed that abortion, per se, is morally acceptable.) Alice Dreger criticized Greenberg's and Bailey's argument and they responded. =Sexual arousal= A third line of research has examined sexual arousal patterns and their relation to sexual orientation in men and women. This research has focused on both genital and self-reported sexual arousal measures. For example, Bailey's lab showed that men's genital sexual arousal patterns closely tracked their sexual orientations, but women's did not. In 2005 this research produced a study which questioned whether male bisexuality exists in the way that it is sometimes described; the study was based on results of penile plethysmograph testing. The testing found that of men who identified themselves as bisexual, 75% were substantially more aroused genitally by sexual imagery of men, and 25% were substantially more aroused genitally by sexual imagery of women. They concluded: \\"Male bisexuality appears primarily to represent a style of interpreting or reporting sexual arousal rather than a distinct pattern of genital sexual arousal.\\" The study received wide attention after a New York Times piece on the study. A 2011 study using similar methodology filtered participants more stringently, requiring at least two sexual partners of each sex and at least one romantic relationship lasting three months or longer; this study finds both genital and subjective arousal, though it is not clear which arousal pattern is more prevalent in the modern bisexual community. The 2005 article and study were criticized by gay and bisexual groupsNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force (July 2005). The Problems with \\"Gay, Straight, or Lying?\\" (PDF) Retrieved July 24, 2006. and by FAIR.FAIR (July 8, 2005). New York Times Suggests Bisexuals Are \\"Lying\\": Paper fails to disclose study author's controversial history. Critics argued the sample size was relatively small, consisting of 100 men. Also, all of these subjects were \\"self-selected\\", from ads placed in gay and \\"alternative\\" publications. Then the researchers had to disregard results of 35% of this population as non-responders. Agreeing with the author's conclusion that bisexuality is a subjective experience, Fritz Klein, a sex researcher and the author of The Bisexual Option, argued that \\"social and emotional attraction are very important elements in bisexual attraction.\\" Bailey's sexual arousal work was attacked by The Washington Times and some socially conservative commentators as prurient and a waste of taxpayer dollars. In response, Bailey and his defenders have said that studying sexual arousal patterns is important in understanding human sexuality, especially sexual orientation. Bailey's lab has also studied sexual orientation and sexual arousal using fMRI. The Man Who Would Be Queen Book cover Bailey's book The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender Bending and Transsexualism was published in 2003.Bailey, J. Michael (2003). The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of Gender-Bending and Transsexualism. Joseph Henry Press, In it, Bailey reviewed evidence that male homosexuality is innate, a result of heredity and prenatal environment. He also reviewed the theory of Ray Blanchard that there are two unrelated forms of transsexualism, one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a paraphilia known as autogynephilia. Written in a popular science style, the book summarized research supporting Bailey's opinions. The book generated considerable controversy. The most detailed investigation into that controversy was reported by Alice Dreger, a bioethicist and historian, known for her activism in support of intersex rights. Dreger included additional details in Galileo’s Middle Finger, an analysis of modern clashes between scientists and activists whose beliefs are challenged by them. In her documented account of the Bailey case, she concluded that a small group of self-styled activists tried to bury a politically challenging scientific theory by attacking Bailey: \\"These critics, rather than restrict themselves to the argument over the ideas, had charged Bailey with a whole host of serious crimes,\\" but that \\"what they claimed about Bailey simply wasn't true.\\" pp. 9-10. A transgender woman that he described in the book filed a complaint with Northwestern University alleging that her many discussions with Bailey about his view of trans women and the book he was writing made her a non-consensual subject of IRB-regulated research by Bailey, and that during this time, she had consensual sex with him.Wilson, R. (2003, Dec. 19). Northwestern U. psychologist accused of having sex with research subject. The Chronicle of Higher Education, p. 17. Northwestern found no basis for the complaint.Barlow, G. (2003, Dec. 17). NU professor faces sexual allegations. Chicago Free Press. Transgender professors Lynn Conway and Deirdre McCloskey filed a complaint against Bailey with Illinois state regulators, alleging that he practiced psychology without a license by providing brief case evaluation letters suggesting candidacy for sex reassignment surgery; however, the department did not pursue those allegations, as he did not accept remuneration for the services and therefore did not violate the law.Carey, Benedict. (2007-08-21.) \\"Criticism of a Gender Theory, and a Scientist Under Siege.\\" New York Times via nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2007-09-19. At least two women who said they were subjects in his book filed a complaint with Northwestern alleging that Bailey committed scientific misconduct by not informing them that they were to be the subjects of research used in the writing of his book.Wilson, R. (2003, July 25). Transsexual 'subjects' complain about professors' research methods. The Chronicle of Higher Education, p. 10.Associated Press (July 26, 2003 ), Transsexuals accuse professor of research misconduct\\" Northwestern did investigate this allegation. Although the findings of that investigation were not released,Wilson, R. (2004, Dec. 10). \\"Northwestern U. Will Not Reveal Results of Investigation Into Sex Researcher.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, p. 10. Northwestern's Vice President for Research, C. Bradley Moore, said, \\"The allegations of scientific misconduct made against Professor J. Michael Bailey do not fall under the federal definition of scientific misconduct.\\" and that the university \\"has established a protocol to help ensure that Professor Bailey's research activities involving human subjects are conducted in accordance with the expectations of the University, the regulations and guidelines established by the federal government and with generally accepted research standards.\\" Bailey says that he did nothing wrong and that the attacks on him were motivated by the desire to suppress discussion of the book's ideas about transsexualism, especially autogynephilia. Alice Dreger, a bioethicist, published an account of the controversy in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. According to Dreger, the allegations of misconduct could accurately be described as \\"harassment\\", and an \\"anti-Bailey campaign\\". Dreger wrote that of the four women who complained to Northwestern, two acknowledged that they were aware they would be included in Bailey's book in their letter to the university. The other two were not described in the book. Dreger also reported that while there was no definitive evidence to refute the allegation of sexual misconduct, datestamps on e-mails between Bailey and his ex-wife indicated that he was at her home looking after their two children at the time the misconduct was said to have occurred. The journal published in the same issue 23 commentaries regarding multiple aspects of the controversy, including criticism of Dreger's analysis.Archives of Sexual Behavior. 2008, volume 37, 365–510. Some critical commentaries have been made available on-line by their authors: Deirdre McCloskey's Politics in Scholarly Drag: Dreger’s Assault on the Critics of Bailey, Julia Serano's A Matter of Perspective: A Transsexual Woman-Centric Critique of Dreger’s ‘‘Scholarly History’’ of the Bailey Controversy. Outside of the transsexual community and sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable because of its implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, \\"If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself.\\" While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and Andrea James posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest. Helen Boyd explained what might have motivated some to object to the book: In response to such criticisms, Bailey reiterated a line from his book: \\"True acceptance of the transgendered requires that we truly understand who they are.\\" Appearances in news media Bailey and his work were featured prominently in a Boston Globe story by Neil Swidey entitled \\"What Makes People Gay?\\"Swidey, N. (2005, Aug. 14) That story was included in the 2006 volume of \\"The Best American Science Writing.\\" Bailey and his lab were also prominent in the CBS News 60 Minutes story \\"Gay or Straight?,\\" which first aired on March 12, 2006 and was the most popular news story on the CBS News website the following week. This story provoked reactions ranging from \\"fantastic and fascinating\\" by gay author Jeremy Hooper at the Good As You blogHooper, Jeremy (March 13, 2006). Go watch, don't Stahl: '60 Minutes' airs fantastic piece on nature vs. nurture Good As You to negative comments from gay author David Ehrenstein, who noted the show was \\"replete with the sort of clichés about gay men and effeminacy that haven’t been seen in a network news context since the 1967 CBS broadcast The Homosexuals.\\"Ehrenstein, David (April 6, 2006). Kinder, gentler homophobia. The Advocate Shari Finkelstein, the producer of the \\"Gay or Straight\\" segment, responded: \\"We were aware of the controversy surrounding Michael Bailey's book, and we looked into all the allegations before we decided to interview him for the story....\\" She concluded: \\"We didn't feel there was anything that disqualified him from being interviewed. And in fact, his work is highly regarded by all of the researchers in the field who we spoke with, and we felt that he was a very worthy person to discuss these issues.\\" In 2011, Bailey's human sexuality class at Northwestern made the headlines of major news organizations after he allowed a female guest speaker and her male partner to perform an impromptu live mechanized sex toy demonstration using a \\"fucksaw\\"—a modified reciprocating saw converted into a sex toy by attaching a \\"phallic object\\" instead of a blade—to bring the woman to orgasm in front the audience. Students were advised beforehand of the nature of the demonstration in this optional after-class event on kinky sex and female orgasm. In the aftermath, Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro criticized Bailey for \\"extremely poor judgment\\" and launched an investigation. Bailey at first defended the demonstration, saying that students found lectures featuring guest speakers valuable, but subsequently issued an apology, saying he regretted the upset caused and its effect on the university's reputation. He said there would be no repeats, but maintained that the demonstration had been relevant to the topic of his course, and said that the students who chose to attend were over 18, \\"legally capable of voting, enlisting in the military, and consuming pornography\\", and contended that the criticism he had received was poorly reasoned. The response among academics was mixed. Joseph Epstein criticized Bailey's class as failing academic standards in a long piece for The Weekly Standard, and ultimately compared Bailey to a pimp. In contrast, Laurie Essig, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, thought that the incident \\"triggered a national conversation about what we can and cannot look at\\". In a web-only feature for Esquire, Bailey's former research assistant Paul Schrodt defended his teaching and research methods. Alice Dreger also defended Bailey's class as being of high quality in general, but agreed with Schapiro that the demonstration \\"was a case of poor judgment, because it wasn't worth it\\". Eventually, in response to the incident, Northwestern administrators removed Bailey's human sexuality course from the following year's curriculum. A year later, Northwestern reintroduced a somewhat differently themed sexuality class taught by Lane Fenrich, according to whom the new class emphasized \\"the major questions\\" and \\"the major thinkers\\" rather than being \\"geared toward sexual practices\\".

In 1992, the CR250R was given a newer, more aggressive design, but a disadvantage was the amount of power the new engines were producing in relation to the weak steel frame. Many riders advised Honda to change the frame to something stronger; but successful riders who were sponsored by Honda such as Jeremy McGrath and Ronnie Mac only the screaming eagle preferred the old stiff weak frame. In 1997, the aluminum frame was introduced. Many racers liked this frame but the bike was not selling to casual desert riders, so Honda undertook a redesign and in 2000 introduced an improved aluminum frame. In 2002, the only real change was the bike was made way faster and lighter and the electronic power valve and third- generation aluminum frame. The Honda CR250 had a liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine that produced about 45 hp. It had a five-speed transmission with Showa suspension and a two-gallon fuel tank.

Due to conflicts within the group, the album features less of lead singer Joey Ramone, both in performing and writing, and less performing from guitarist Johnny Ramone. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote and sang more on this album than on previous albums, and Richie Ramone became the first drummer to write songs for the band since Tommy Ramone, the band's original drummer. The album spawned four singles, all of which charted on the UK Singles Chart, as well as other charts. In addition to singles, the band promoted their album using a music video for \\"Something to Believe In,\\" which parodied the contemporary benefit concert Live Aid and Hands Across America. Lyrical themes of the album range from band members' frustrations with one another, themselves, and loved ones, to more politically themed songs—a rarity in Ramones music. \\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)\\" saw the Ramones criticizing U.S. President Ronald Reagan for his controversial visit to a military cemetery in Bitburg, Germany, despite Johnny Ramone disagreeing with the song's message. Critically, Animal Boy was not nearly as acclaimed as its predecessor, Too Tough to Die, receiving generally mixed reviews. Critics were quick to point out that the band had strayed far from their original style and were experimenting with several genres by this point. However, the album charted in four different countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. Background By 1985, there was a considerable amount of conflict between band members. Lead singer Joey Ramone went so far as to withdraw from the writing process, after having been a vital part of it on previous records.Leigh 2009, pp. 258, 261. Joey recalled: \\"I'd had it with the Ramones. 'Mental Hell' is about that. Part of it came from breaking up with [then girlfriend] Angela. The other part of it was that I had really had it with the band.\\" In later interviews, however, Joey stated that it was not the conflict that made him stop writing, but rather that he'd had \\"ideas on the backburner.\\" Bassist Dee Dee Ramone claimed guitarist Johnny Ramone was the reason for much of the stress, alleging that Johnny did not want to do songs Joey wrote for multiple reasons: \\"Joey will present a great tune and Johnny won't do it because it's this or it's that. 'I'm not going to play minor chords. I'm not going to play lead. I'm not going to come to England.' For God's sake! That's why Joey gotta do his solo album.\\" Consequently, the somewhat recently added drummer Richie Ramone stepped up to the writing process, resulting in the hit song \\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\\" released as a single and later appearing on the band's first compilation album, Ramones Mania (1988). \\"Joey was always encouraging me to write songs,\\" explained Richie, \\"but I didn't really need the encouragement.\\"Leigh 2009, p. 261. This would be the first time the band featured the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey reasoning that he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band; he felt past drummers had not been so much a part of the band, nor any good at writing, and called Richie a \\"regular Phil Collins.\\"True 2005, ch. 23 pp. 10–11. Johnny would later say the album needed better production quality, commenting that the guitar moments did not sound like he had performed them. \\"The producer on [Animal Boy], Jean Beauvoir,\\" Johnny related, \\"was selected by the label, not us.\\"Ramone 2012, ch. \\"Animal Boy\\" p. 1. Marketing and promotion For the album's front cover, the band wanted to take a photo with a monkey from the Bronx Zoo. George DuBose originally took the picture in the zoo's monkey house, but this photo was rejected by the zoo director. The zoo would not allow the band to borrow a chimp for photographing, so DuBose decided to try hiring Zippy the Chimp, a baby chimpanzee who had appeared on Late Night With David Letterman and was successful. The resulting idea was to take the picture of the band standing in front of a gorilla cage with Punk Magazine founder Legs McNeil in a gorilla costume. Richie is holding Zippy, and DuBose had to refrain from flashing light so as not to frighten it. However, according to DuBose, the chimp was already out of control. \\"Zippy was getting wild,\\" Dubose recalled. \\"He wasn't looking at the camera and was fucking around with the guys. I wasn't getting the picture because the chimp was out of control, so finally the trainer goes up to Zippy and whacks him across the face.\\" The lack of flash resulted in a lowlighted, warmer colored photograph, which would be used as the album's cover.Melnick & Melnick 2010, p. 212. The music video for \\"Something to Believe In\\" satirized the 1985 Live Aid benefit concert. Rather than saying \\"Live Aid\\" with an image of Africa, the stage in the video says \\"Ramones Aid\\" with the band's logo.True 2005, ch. 23. pp. 5–6. Animal Boy was released on May 19, 1986. While touring for its promotion, the band only used four to five songs from the album while the rest of the set list was derived from songs off earlier releases. Johnny described this type of concert setlist to promote releases to be common for \\"a lot of later [Ramones] albums,\\" saying it was \\"because the material didn't measure up to our other stuff.\\" In addition to touring, Sire Records and Beggars Banquet Records in the UK released four singles to help promote the album in hopes of receiving more radio airplay. The first single from Animal Boy was \\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg),\\" issued by Beggars Banquet in June 1985. \\"Go Home Anne\\" was the B-side, produced by Ed Stasium and mixed by Lemmy Kilmister, lead singer of Motörhead.Leigh 2009, pp. 237, 249. There were multiple explanations given for why the single was not released in the United States: the product manager at Sire Records explained that it was both a \\"financial and political\\" decision, while the parent company, Warner Bros. Records, claimed that \\"It just wasn't considered a good enough record.\\" The single's jacket cover depicted President Reagan giving a speech at Bergen- Belsen concentration camp before going to Bitburg, but the image was removed from later pressings. British newspaper Melody Maker claimed it was removed because the band received pressure from \\"Moral Majority, the Patriotic League of the Alamo, and the SS.\\" The music video for \\"Something to Believe In\\" was a parody of both the Live Aid benefit concert and Hands Across America. The video was described by author Everett True to be \\"reassuringly foolish\\" and \\"a welcome return to [the Ramones'] old sense of humor.\\"True 2005, ch. 23. p. 6. Several guests are featured in the video, including The B52s, Weird Al Yankovic, Spinal Tap, Ted Nugent, The Circle Jerks, Toni Basil, Rodney Bingenheimer, Holly Beth Vincent, and Afrika Bambaataa. Because the music video was praised by Warner Bros., they released \\"Something to Believe In\\" as a double A-side with \\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink.\\" \\"Something to Believe In\\" was also released with \\"Animal Boy\\" in the United States and \\"Crummy Stuff\\" in the UK through Beggars Banquet.Ramone 2003, p. 244.Popoff 2010, p. 971. Lyrics and composition Animal Boy featured a range of genres and musical elements that were completely new to the band and had not been featured on previous albums. Frequent use of synthesizers, as well as minimalistic \\"gimmicky\\" lyrics, caused critics and fans to feel as though the Ramones had strayed far away from their early, raw punk sound, despite Animal Boys predecessor Too Tough Too Die being acclaimed for the band returning to their roots. \\"The main problem with Animal Boy,\\" explained author Everett True, \\"was that there was no longer one discernible Ramones sound: it sounds as disjointed as the band members probably felt. The guitar parts could've been played by anyone, and Richie's drumming was slipping away from Tommy's original template. The Ramones were turning into a 9-5 job, night not day.\\"True 2005, ch. 23 p. 3. The album begins with Joey singing \\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\\" written by Richie, who stated that he came up with the lyrics while he was dating Frankie Valli's daughter and mistakenly drank after someone else in a nightclub. Rolling Stone editor David Fricke described Joey's vocal performance in the song as an \\"exaggerated wino growl while Johnny crushes the chord changes with his trash-compactor guitar.\\" \\"Animal Boy\\" and \\"Apeman Hop\\" were compositionally similar to \\"Cretin Hop\\" from 1977's Rocket To Russia, but were described by True to be \\"a thousandth as good.\\"True 2005, ch. 23 p. 4. \\"Love Kills\\" was inspired by the Alex Cox biopic Sid and Nancy (also known as Sid and Nancy: Love Kills). The lyrics relate that the couple will never be able to win with drugs, despite the fact that the song's writer himself, Dee Dee, would later succumb to a heroin overdose. Animal Boys fifth track, \\"She Belongs to Me,\\" is a ballad written by Dee Dee and Beauvoir regarding unrequited love, and features heavy use of synthesizers, while earlier albums would have used a soft acoustic guitar or occasionally strings for ballad-type songs. Side A of the album concludes with \\"Crummy Stuff,\\" played in a pop punk style, with repetitive lyrics based on the band's past of being chaotic and never meeting expectations. Side B begins with one of the Ramones' few explicitly political songs, \\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg).\\" The lyrics encapsulated the feelings of Joey, Dee Dee and Beauviour while watching US President Ronald Reagan visit a military cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany to pay tribute to the victims of Nazism. In an interview with East Coast Rocker, Joey explained: \\"What Reagan did was fucked up. Everybody told him not to go, all his people told him not to go, and he went anyway. How can you fuckin' forgive the Holocaust? How can you say, 'Oh well, it's OK now?' That's crazy!\\"True 2005, ch. 21, p. 30. Dee Dee also asserted that Johnny had made the band seem right winged. \\"It was the first time we could make a statement to show we weren't prejudiced,\\" he explained. \\"We'd just had these skinheads at our gigs, punks walking around wearing swastikas.\\" Johnny disliked the song and resisted playing the song live, saying that Reagan was his favorite president of his lifetime. It was Johnny who insisted that the song's title be changed to \\"My Brain is Hanging Upside Down\\";https://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2011/feb/1/reagan-100-quotes- and-about-ronald-reagan-johnny-r/ \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\", the original title, was relegated to parenthesis. \\"Bonzo\\", a pejorative nickname for Reagan, refers to a chimpanzee from a 1951 Comedy Film which Reagan starred in. \\"Mental Hell,\\" the next track and the second written by Joey, dealt with his recent stress with the band and his relationship with his girlfriend, Angela, ending. Author Dave Thompson described \\"Eat That Rat\\" as \\"reaching back to their pure punk past.\\"Thompson 2000, p. 582. While \\"Eat That Rat\\" is one minute and thirty-seven seconds long, the shortest track on the album is the next song, \\"Freak of Nature,\\" which clocks in at one minute and thirty-two seconds. Johnny explained that it was written by him and Dee Dee while changing reels in an open-reel audio tape recording at the studio. \\"Hair of the Dog,\\" a piece about the guilt of alcoholism, is the third and final song written by Joey. The album's last track, \\"Something to Believe In,\\" was influenced heavily by British pop, and was described by Susan Cummings of Spin as a \\"pseudo-AOR attempted teen anthem\\" and by author Scott Schnider as a \\"surging, yearning anthem.\\"Schnider 2008, p. 556. Reception The album received mixed reviews from critics. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a \\"B+\\" and considered both \\"She Belongs to Me\\" and \\"Crummy Stuff\\" to be \\"defensive-sounding,\\" but called \\"Something to Believe In\\" an anthem and praised \\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg).\\" Rolling Stone critic David Fricke deemed the album a \\"reductionist masterpiece\\" that \\"proves they still have a lot more to give,\\" claiming that it rivaled previous albums Leave Home and Rocket to Russia. Eduardo Rivadavia, editor for AllMusic, later criticized the album for using more modern commercial conventions and for its heavy use of synthesizers and keyboards in an attempt to reinvent the band's style. Rivadavia specifically pointed to \\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink,\\" which he claimed \\"wastes an aggressive vocal performance from Joey Ramone by supporting it with a shamelessly polished synthesizer backing track,\\" and referred to \\"Something to Believe In\\" as \\"unbearably soft.\\" He concluded that the album had been a \\"career low\\" for the Ramones, but still rated it three out of five stars. In the United States, the album entered the Billboard 200 on June 21, 1986 at #146, and rose to #143 the following week. Despite staying on the chart for six weeks, the album's peak position did not rise above #143. It entered the UK Album Charts on May 31, 1986, where it stayed for two weeks and reached a peak position of #38.

It is found only on the island of Tasmania. The long-tailed mouse is an omnivore that feeds on insects and a range of plants. It is found in forested areas, particularly in sub-alpine scree, and may live in burrows. The species reaches a weight of about 70 grams. It is distinguished from other species by its two-tone tail, which is white on the underside and dark above. The tail is 1.3 times longer than the head and body combined. It is stipulated that P.higginsi uses its tail for balance while leaping in habitat such as boulder screes.Wapstra, M. 1994. Hind limb adaptations in the long-tailed mouse, Pseudomys higginsi. Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria, 33:15-31. Fossils of this species have been found in Cloggs Cave, Buchan in eastern Victoria and were identified by palaeontologist Jeanette Hope. The date for the remains based on C-14 dating were between 12-20,000 years old.Josephine Flood (2004) Archaeology of the Dreamtime, J.B Publishing, Marleston __TOC__ Distribution and habitat The long-tailed mouse ranges from sea level to approximately 1,200 m. and seems to prefer habitats that offer high rainfall, such as wet forests.Driessen, M. M., & Rose, R. K. (3 December 1999). Pseudomys higginsi. Mammalian Species, 623, 1-5. Retrieved 15 November 2016, from http://www.science.smith.edu/resources/msi/pdfs/i0076-3519-623-01-0001.pdf It is a habitat generalist which is resilient to environmental modifications. In a study of short-term responses of native rodents to various logging styles in old growth wet Eucalyptus forests, it was found that the long-tailed mouse was equally abundant across all forestry treatments and was positively correlated to reduced ground cover.Stephens, H. C., Baker, S. C., Potts, B. M., Munks, S. A., Stephens, D., & O’Reilly-Wapstra, J. M. (20 December 2011). Short-term responses of native rodents to aggregated retention in old growth wet Eucalyptus forests. Forest Ecology and Management, 267, 18-27. doi:10.1016/j.foreco.2011.11.037 Another study found that significantly greater numbers of long-tailed mouse were found in wet disturbed forests and that logging and harvesting did not effect the diversity of the local ecosystem.Flynn, E. M., Jones, S. M., Jones, M. E., Jordan, G. J., & Munks, S. A. (2011). Characteristics of mammal communities in Tasmanian forests: Exploring the influence of forest type and disturbance history. Wildlife Research, 38(1), 13-29. doi:10.1071/wr10025 A conservational study conducted in 2012 was able to compare the historical range of the long-tailed mouse to its current range to determine if this helped predict the risk of extinction.Hanna, E., & Cardillo, M. (2013). A comparison of current and reconstructed historic geographic range sizes as predictors of extinction risk in Australian mammals. Biological Conservation, 158, 196-204. doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2012.08.014 Reduced geographic range size is often a strong predictor of species decline. It was shown that despite modern habitat loss, the long-tailed mouse is less threatened than would be expected from just the loss of its historical habitat ranges. Diet The long-tailed mouse is an opportunistic generalist omnivore whose diet is seasonal and varies with local availability. Using fecal analysis, it was found to consume a wide range of plant matter, such as grasses, grains, bamboo, fruits, ferns, and mosses. It was also found to consume fungi and insects of wide varieties.Observations on the diets of the long-tailed mouse, Pseudomys higginsi, and the velvet- furred rat, Rattus lutreolus velutinus, in southern Tasmania. Australian Mammalogy, 21:121-130 Ecology The long-tailed mouse is a primarily nocturnal mammal but can also be active during the day. It is found primarily in rainforest, wet scrub, eucalyptus scrub, sedgeland, and low alpine vegetation.Taylor, R. J., S. L. Bryant, D. Pemberton, and T. W. Norton. 1985. Mammals of the Upper Henty River Region, western Tasmania. Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania, 119:7-14. Relevant abundance of the long-tailed mouse is correlated to several other species in its habitat. Lazenby et.al. was able to show across four independent sample areas that the abundance of the long-tailed mouse was correlated positively to swamp rats (Rattus lutreolus velutinus) and negatively correlated to feral cats (Felis catus). Tasmanian devils were also shown to have a negative effect on the long-tailed mouse and all other small mammal populations surveyed in this study.Lazenby, B. T., N. J. Mooney, and C. R.

Young become fully independent 33 days after birth and reach adult size at approximately 40 days. The tail will continue to grow until they are approximately 75 days old. There is no significant sexual dimorphism in this species. However, there is some geographic variation in the species concerning overall body weight, hind foot length, and tail length. As a mammal, P.higginsi nurses their young from shortly after birth until weaning. The young fasten themselves to the nipples, which allow for the mother to take evasive actions when necessary.Green, R. H. 1968. The murids and small dasyurids in Tasmania. Parts 3 and 4.

From the time of the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans to the foundation of Israel the Jewish people had no territory, and, until the 19th century they by-and-large were also denied equal rights in the countries in which they lived. Thus, until the 19th century effort for the emancipation of the Jews, almost all Jewish political struggles were internal, and dealt primarily with either religious issues or issues of a particular Jewish community. (See Judaism and politics.) Birth of Jewish political movements Moses Mendelssohn, the founder of the Haskalah movement Since Jews were excluded as outsiders throughout Europe, they were mostly shut out of politics or any sort of participation in the wider political and social sphere of the nations in which they were involved until the Enlightenment, and its Jewish counterpart, Haskalah, made popular movements possible. As long as the Jews lived in segregated communities, and as long as all avenues of social intercourse with their gentile neighbors were closed to them, the rabbi was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and clergy, a rabbi also acted as a civil judge in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and the Talmud was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated \\"coming out of the ghetto\\", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually. The example of Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), a Prussian Jew and grandfather of the composer Felix Mendelssohn, served to lead this movement. Mendelssohn's extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and man of letters revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews. The changes caused by the Haskalah movement coincided with rising revolutionary movements throughout Europe. Despite these movements, only France, Britain, and the Netherlands had granted the Jews in their countries equal rights with gentiles after the French Revolution in 1796. Elsewhere in Europe, especially where Jews were most concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe, Jews were not granted equal rights. It was in the revolutionary atmosphere of the mid-19th century that the first true Jewish political movements would take place. Emancipation movements During the early stages of Jewish emancipation movements, Jews were simply part of the general effort to achieve freedom and rights that drove popular uprisings like the Revolutions of 1848. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals like Heinrich Heine, Johann Jacoby, Gabriel Riesser, Berr Isaac Berr, and Lionel Nathan Rothschild were active with the general movement towards liberty and political freedom. Still, in the face of persistent anti- semitic incidents like the Damascus Blood Libel of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations started to form in order to push for the emancipation and protection of Jews. The Board of Deputies of British Jews under Moses Montefiore, the Central Consistory of Paris, and the Alliance Israelite Universelle founded by Adolphe Crémieux, all began working to assure the freedom of the Jews throughout the middle of the 19th century. Socialist and Labor movements Frustration with the slow pace of Jewish acceptance into European society, and a revolutionary utopianism, led to a growing interest in proto-socialist and communist movements, especially as early socialist leaders, like Saint-Simon, preached the emancipation of the Jews. Moses Hess played a role in introducing Karl Marx (who was descended from a long line of rabbis) and Friedrich Engels to historical materialism. The Jewish Ferdinand Lassalle, founded the first actual workers' party in Germany, the General German Workers' Association (which ultimately merged with other parties to become the Social Democratic Party of Germany) and made Jewish emancipation one of his goals. The more intellectual socialist movements of the Jews in Western Europe never gathered steam as emancipation took hold. In Eastern Europe and Russia, however, the Bundthe General Jewish Labor Unionfounded in 1897, became a key force in organizing Jews, and, at least initially, the major opponent of another Jewish political movement of the time, Zionism. There were other Jewish socialist parties in Russia, like the (territorialist) Zionist Socialist Workers Party and the Jewish Socialist Workers Party, which united their destinies in 1917 as the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party. Another left-wing Russian Jewish party was the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion). Zionist movements The aim of Zionism was to set up a secular state in the vicinity of the Biblical Land of Israel. Zionism, or the idea of a restored national homeland and common identity for the Jews, had already started to take shape by the mid-19th century, with Jewish thinkers such as Moses Hess whose 1862 work Rome and Jerusalem; The Last National Question argued for the Jews to settle in Palestine as a means of settling the national question. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become agrarianised through a process of \\"redemption of the soil\\" which would transform the Jewish community into a \\"true\\" nation, in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived Jews in Europe. Hess, along with later thinkers such as Nahum Syrkin and Ber Borochov, is considered a founder of Socialist Zionism and Labour Zionism and one of the intellectual forebears of the kibbutz movement. Others like Rabbi Zvi Kalischer viewed a return to the Jewish homeland as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy through natural means. Theodor Herzl, a key figure in the development of Zionism As the 19th century wore on, the persecution of the Jews in Eastern Europe where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it did in Western Europe (or at all) increased. Starting with the state-sponsored massive anti-Jewish pogroms following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, through the bloody pogroms of 1903 to 1906 who left thousands of Jews dead and many more wounded, continuing with the Dreyfus Affair in France in 1894, Jews were profoundly shocked to see the continuing extent of anti-Semitism from Russia to France, a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty.Weinberg, Robert. The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps. 1993, p. 164. In reaction to the first, Judah Leib Pinsker published the pamphlet Auto-Emancipation on January 1, 1882. The pamphlet became influential for the Political Zionism movement. The movement was to achieve momentum under the leadership of an Austrian-Jewish journalist, Theodor Herzl, who published his pamphlet Der Judenstaat (\\"The Jewish State\\") in 1896. Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl had been an assimilationist, but after seeing how France treated its loyal Jewish subjects, he proposed building a separate Jewish state. In 1897 Herzl organized the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, which founded the World Zionist Organisation (WZO) and elected Herzl as its first President. After the state's establishment Zionism, in its various forms, would become the largest Jewish political movement, although more Jews would participate in the national politics of the countries in which they resided. Folkists In the aftermath of the 1905 pogroms in Russia, the historian Simon Dubnow founded the Folkspartei (Yiddishe Folkspartay) which had some intellectual audience in Russia, then, in independent Poland and Lithuania in the 1920–1930s where it was represented as well in the Parliaments (Sejm, Seimas) as in numerous municipal councils (incl. Warsaw) till in the late 1930s. The party did not survive the Shoah, the Holocaust. Territorialists The territorialists, who had split from the Zionists after the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, called for creation of a sufficiently large and compact Jewish territory (or territories), not necessarily in the Land of Israel and not necessarily fully autonomous. Some territorialist leaders, such as Nachman Syrkin, supported the Socialist versions of Zionism, while some others, such as Lucien Wolf, actively opposed Zionism and promoted anti-nationalist ideas. Isaac Nachman Steinberg, one of the founders of the Freeland League, held anti-authoritarian socialist views, as well as his close friend Erich Fromm, who supported Steinberg's territorialist ideas. Anarchists While the Jews in general played an important role in the international anarchist movements, many Jewish anarchists actively promoted Yiddish language and culture, focused on specifically Jewish issues. While most Jewish anarchists were irreligious or even vehemently anti-religious, some Jewish anarchist and anti- authoritarian thinkers, such as Martin Buber, rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, Isaac Nachman Steinberg and Gustav Landauer, were religious or religiously inclined and often referred to the Torah, Talmud and other traditional Judaic sources, claiming that anarchist ideas are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish anarchists believe that in the stateless, free and diverse anarchist society the Jews would have more opportunities to express their individual and cultural autonomy. Many Jewish anarchists, while promoting universal internationalist values, had actively participated in the development of the Yiddish culture and Jewish community life. There was some intersection between the Jewish anarchist, Folkist and Territorialist movements. For example, Isaac Nachman Steinberg, a renowned Territorialist leader, held anarchist views. Most Jewish anarchists supported anarcho-syndicalism and communist anarchism, while a few were individualist anarchists. The small contemporary anarchist movement in Israel is very active in peace and Palestinian solidarity actions. Modern Jewish political movements Zionism continues to be the central trans-national political movement of most Jews, although it has split into a variety of branches and philosophies that span the political spectrum from left-wing to right-wing. Jews are also active in government in many of the countries in which they live, as well as in Jewish community organizations that often take political positions. =In Israel= =Outside Israel= In the 20th century, Jews in Europe and the Americas traditionally tended towards the political left, and played key roles in the birth of the labor movement as well as socialism. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the conservative side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support pluralism more consistently than many other elements of the political right. Daniel J. Elazar connects this pluralist tendency to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, and argues that whereas Christianity and Islam anticipate a single world-state, Judaism does not. This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in their countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed for over 2,000 years. (See list of Jews in politics, which illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in politics.) There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as Hadassah and the United Jewish Communities, have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies. In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular United Jewish Communities (UJC), formerly known as the United Jewish Appeal (UJA), represents over 150 Jewish Federations and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local \\"Jewish Federation\\", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for philanthropic and humanitarian causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, B'nai B'rith and Agudath Israel represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues. The 21st century has brought changes in the political leanings of Jewish communities in the diaspora. In the U.S. and Canada, the two largest Jewish diaspora communities, voters are shifting from liberal to more conservative leanings. in 2011 an Ipsos Reid exit poll of voters in the federal election of Canada found that 52 per cent of Jewish voters supported the Conservatives, 24 per cent the Liberals and 16 per cent the NDP, reflecting \\" an enormous shift in voter preference among Canadian Jews.\\" The shift appears to reflect an alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government and its views on Israel's security.How the political shift among Jewish voters plays in Canada, The Globe and Mail, 28 September 2011 The Jewish community in Great Britain is also leaning conservative in the 21st century as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which according to a BBC poll had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes \\"en masse\\" for the Conservatives.

Son Codicille avec le Jargon et ses Ballades (vers 1500). One of the earliest examples of the use of thieves' cant in modern times Thieves' cant (also known as thieves' argot, rogues' cant, or peddler's French) was a cant, cryptolect, or argot which was formerly used by thieves, beggars and hustlers of various kinds in Great Britain and to a lesser extent in other English-speaking countries. It is now mostly obsolete, and is largely relegated to the realm of literature and fantasy role-playing, although individual terms continue to be used in the criminal subcultures of both Britain and the United States. Its South German and Swiss equivalent is the Rotwelsch, its Dutch equivalent is Bargoens and the Serbo-Croatian equivalent is Šatrovački. History It was claimed by Samuel Rid that thieves' cant was devised around 1530 \\"to the end that their cozenings, knaveries and villainies might not so easily be perceived and known\\", by Cock Lorel and the King of the Gypsies at The Devil's Arse, a cave in Derbyshire.Rid, Samuel (1610). Martin Markall, the Beadle of Bridewell. as quoted in It does seem to have originated in this period, but the story is almost certainly a myth. Cant was a common feature of rogue literature of the Elizabethan period in England, in both pamphlets and Elizabethan theatre. Thomas Harman, a justice of the peace, included examples in his Caveat for Common Cursitors (1566). He collected his information from vagabonds he interrogated at his home in Essex. He also called it \\"pedlars' French\\" or \\"pelting speech\\", and was told that it had been invented as a secret language some 30 years earlier. The earliest records of canting words are included in The Highway to the Spitalfields by Robert Copland c. 1536. Copland and Harman were used as sources by later writers. A spate of rogue literature started in 1591 with Robert Greene's series of five pamphlets on cozenage and coney- catching. These were continued by other writers, including Thomas Middleton, in The Black Book and Thomas Dekker, in The Bellman of London (1608), Lantern and Candlelight (1608), and O per se O (1612). Cant was included together with descriptions of the social structure of beggars, the techniques of thieves including coney-catching, gull-groping, and gaming tricks, and the descriptions of low-lifes of the kind which have always been popular in literature. Harman included a canting dictionary which was copied by Thomas Dekker and other writers. That such words were known to a wide audience is evidenced by the use of cant words in Jacobean theatre. Middleton and Dekker included it in The Roaring Girl, or Moll Cut-Purse (1611). It was used extensively in The Beggars' Bush, a play by Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher and Philip Massinger, first performed in 1622, but possibly written c. 1614. The play remained popular for two centuries, and the canting section was extracted as The Beggars Commonwealth by Francis Kirkman as one of the drolls he published for performance at markets, fairs and camps. The influence of this work can be seen from the independent life taken on by the \\"Beggar King Clause\\", who appears as a real character in later literature. The ceremony for anointing the new king was taken from Thomas Harman and described as being used by Gypsies in the nineteenth century. Bampfylde Moore Carew, who published his picaresque Life in 1745, claimed to have been chosen to succeed \\"Clause Patch\\" as King of the Beggars, and many editions of his work included a canting dictionary. Such dictionaries, often based on Harman's, remained popular, including The Canting Academy, or Devils Cabinet opened, by Richard Head (1673), and BE's Dictionary of the Canting Crew (1699). Some words from thieves' cant continued to be used into the twentieth century combined with slang words from eighteenth century London. In 2015 British an experimental folk group called Dead Rat Orchestra recorded versions of songs in thieves' cant as compiled by J. S. Farmer in his Musa Pedestris.Musa pedestris: Three centuries of canting songs and slang rhymes (1536-1896); by Farmer, John Stephen, 1845?-1915?Dead Rat Orchestra These formed part of a soundtrack created for artist filmmaker James Holcombe's film Tyburnia, and were presented live as part of a show about Secret Languages on BBC Radio 3's \\"The Verb\\", hosted by Ian McMillan. Sources for cant It was commonly believed that cant developed from Romany. Etymological research now suggests a substantial correlation between Romany words and cant, and equivalents, in many European languages. However, in England, Scotland, and Wales this does not apply. The Egyptians, as they were known, were a separate group from the standard vagabonds, and cant was fully developed within 50 years of their first arrival in England. Comparison of Romany words in the Winchester Confessions taken in 1616 with modern Welsh Romany show high commonality. This record also distinguished between Romany and Cant words and again the attributions of the words to the different categories is consistent with later records. There is doubt as to the extent to which the words in canting literature were taken from street usage, or were adopted by those wishing to show that they were part of a real or imagined criminal underworld. The transmission has almost certainly been in both directions. The Winchester Confessions indicate that Roma engaged in criminal activities, or those associated with them and with a good knowledge of their language, were using cant, but as a separate vocabulary - Angloromani was used for day to day matters, while cant was used for criminal activities. A thief in 1839 claimed that the cant he had seen in print was nothing like the cant then used by Roma, thieves and beggars. He also said that each of these used distinct vocabularies, which overlapped; the Roma having a cant word for everything, and the beggars using a lower style than the thieves.Ribton-Turner, C.

The 683 species are in 63 genera and 11 subfamilies, which is the largest number of genera of any frog family. Evolution A molecular phylogenetic study by van der Meijden, et al. (2007) has estimated the initial internal divergence of the family Microhylidae to have taken place about 66 million years ago, or immediately after the Cretaceous extinction event. The most recent common ancestor of the Microhylidae and their closest ranoid relatives is estimated to have lived 116 million years ago in Gondwana. Description As suggested by their name, microhylids are mostly small frogs. Many species are below in length, although some species are as large as . They can be arboreal or terrestrial, and some even live close to water. The ground-dwellers are often found under leaf litter within forests, occasionally venturing out at night to hunt. The two main shapes for the microhylids are wide bodies and narrow mouths and normal frog proportions. Those with narrow mouths generally eat termites and ants, and the others have diets typical of most frogs. Egg-laying habits are highly varied. =Reproduction= The microhylids of New Guinea and Australia completely bypass the tadpole stage, with direct development from egg to frog. The arboreal species can therefore lay the eggs within the trees, and never need venture to the ground. Where species do have tadpoles, these almost always lack the teeth or horny beaks typical of the tadpoles of other families. =Anatomy= The skull has paired palatines and frontoparietals. The facial nerve passes through the anterior acoustic foramen in the auditory capsule; the trigeminal and facial nerve ganglia are fused to form a prootic ganglion. The eight (or seven) presacral holochordal vertebrae are all procoelous except for a biconcave surface on last presacral. The pectoral girdle is firmisternal and some show reduced clavicle and procoracoids. The terminal phalanges are blunt, pointed, or T-shaped. The tadpole lacks keratinized mouth parts and has a large spiracular chamber emptied by a caudomedial spiracle.

He was an influential defender of evangelical doctrine and a contributor to The Fundamentals.  Biography  Orr was born in Glasgow and spent his childhood in Manchester and Leeds. He was orphaned and became an apprentice bookbinder, but went on to enter Glasgow University in 1865. In 1870, he obtained an M.A. in Philosophy of Mind, and after graduating from the theological college of the United Presbyterian Church, he was ordained a minister in Hawick. In 1885 he received a D.D. from Glasgow University, and in the early 1890s delivered a series of lectures that later became the influential The Christian View of God and the World. He was appointed professor of Church history in 1891 at the theological college of the United Presbyterian Church. He was one of the primary promoters of the union of the United Presbyterian Church with the Free Church of Scotland, and he represented the United Presbyterians in the unification talks. After they joined in 1900, he moved to Free Church College (now Trinity College, Glasgow), as professor of apologetics and theology. He lectured widely in both Britain and the United States.  Views  Orr was a vocal critic of theological liberalism (of Albrecht Ritschl especially) and helped establish Christian fundamentalism. His lectures and writings upheld the doctrines of the virgin birth and resurrection of Jesus, and the infallibility of the Bible. In contrast to modern fundamentalists and his friend B.B. Warfield, he did not agree with the stronger position of Biblical inerrancy.Dorien, p. 43 Like Warfield, but also unlike modern Christian fundamentalists, he advocated a position which he called \\"theistic evolution\\". Orr wrote that \\"evolution is coming to be recognized as but a new name for 'creation', only that the creative power now works from within, instead of, as in the old conception, in an external plastic fashion.\\"Waltke, Bruce K. (2007). An Old Testament Theology. Zondervan. p. 202. In his book Revelation and Inspiration (1910), he wrote that evolution is not in conflict with the Christian theistic view of the world.Orr, James. (2002 edition). Revelation and Inspiration.

Designed by Werner Stengel, it is a second-generation Impulse model manufactured by Intamin. The ride was marketed as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster in the world when it opened to the public on May 5, 2002. History Construction on Wicked Twister started on October 15, 2001 when the Stadium Games, formerly the Aquarium, were razed. Wicked Twister was officially announced about a month later on November 20. During its marketing campaign, the ride was billed as the tallest and fastest double-twisting impulse coaster in the world. The first pieces of steel were erected on December 15 and the first piece of track was installed four days later. The first test run occurred on April 2, 2002. Wicked Twister's media day was held on May 2, 2002 then it opened to the public on May 5. Additional supports were added to the ride's structure for the 2003 season. Two yellow supports were added to each spike to connect the track to the top of the main support structure. Ride experience =Layout= At the beginning of the ride, the linear induction motors propel the train forward out of the station during its first launch at , which carries the train approximately halfway up the front tower. After coming to a stop, the train falls and enters the LIM section again, where the train is accelerated during its second launch to in the backward direction so that the train climbs halfway up the rear tower. The train then stops and drops forward before re-entering the LIM section where additional thrust is added as the train gains to during its third launch, causing the train to reach its highest point on the front tower. Stopping and reversing, the train drops and re-enters the LIM section where the LIM launches the train for the fourth time, making the train reach a maximum speed of to travel a maximum of up the rear tower. With the one more final pass forward through the LIM section, the train goes up the front spike once more before the train reverses. As it travels back toward the station, the brakes are applied and it stops within the station platform. Unlike other Inverted roller coasters, there is no floor in the loading station that drops out underneath the train. Riders must climb into their seats when loading. Wicked Twister cars toward the top of one of the spiral towers =Details= Wicked Twister consists of two tall spikes. Both ends of the towers (track) are designed with 450-degree vertical twists which is the main difference between Wicked Twister and other Inverted Impulse roller coasters. Between the towers, a horizontal track section incorporates the load and unload area as well as the linear induction motor propulsion system. The ride was built directly on the Cedar Point Beach with its entrance plaza being in the former Aquarium location. The track is painted yellow with teal supports. The ride features one train that consists of eight cars. Riders are arranged two across in two rows for a total of 32 riders. Wicked Twister's theme song is \\"The Winner\\" by the Crystal Method.

Systematics C. insculpta is the only living member of the genus Carettochelys, the subfamily Carettochelyinae, and the family Carettochelyidae, though several extinct carettochelyid species have been described from around the world. Some literature claims two subspecies, but a recent paper rejects this.Georges, A.; Thomson, S. (2010). \\"Diversity of Australasian freshwater turtles, with an annotated synonymy and keys to species\\". Zootaxa 2496: 1–37. Description (video) Pig-nosed turtle swimming The pig-nosed turtle is unlike any other species of freshwater turtle. The feet are flippers, resembling those of marine turtles. The nose looks like that of a pig, having the nostrils at the end of a fleshy snout, hence the common name. The carapace is typically grey or olive, with a leathery texture, while the plastron is cream-coloured. Males can be distinguished from females by their longer and narrower tails. Pig-nosed turtles can grow to about carapace length, with a weight of over . C. insculpta in captivity Unlike the soft-shelled turtles of the family Trionychidae, pig-nosed turtles retain a domed bony carapace beneath their leathery skin, rather than a flat plate. They also retain a solid plastron, connected to the carapace by a strong bony bridge, rather than the soft margin of the trionychids. Behaviour Pig-nosed turtles are not completely aquatic. Little is known about their general behaviour, as there have been few studies in the wild. Their known extreme aggression in captivity suggests the species is markedly more territorial than most other turtles and tortoises. They seem to display a degree of social structure during the cooler dry season around the hydrothermal vents that line some river systems they inhabit. =Feeding= C. insculpta is omnivorous, eating a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including the fruit and leaves of figs, as well as crustaceans, molluscs and insects. =Breeding= Females of C. insculpta reach maturity at 18 or more years, and males around 16 years. They lay their eggs late in the dry season on sandy river banks. When the offspring are fully developed, they will stay inside the eggs in hibernation until conditions are suitable for emergence. Hatching may be triggered when the eggs have been flooded with water or by a sudden drop in air pressure signaling an approaching storm. Using environmental triggers, along with vibrations created by other hatching turtles in the same clutch, gives a better chance for survival. Using a universal trigger rather than simply waiting for incubation to finish means they all hatch at the same time. This provides safety in numbers; also, the more turtles that hatch, the more help they have to dig through the sand to the surface. Geographic range and habitat C. insculpta is native to freshwater streams, lagoons and rivers of the Northern Territory of Australia, as well as to the island of New Guinea, where it is believed to occur in all the larger, and some smaller, southward-flowing rivers.Georges, A.; Rose, M. (1993). \\"Conservation biology of the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta \\". Chelonian Conservation and Biology 1: 3-12. Status and conservation C. insculpta experienced a population decline of more than 50% in the thirty years between 1981 and 2011. Although the turtles are protected in Indonesia under Law No. 5/1990 on Natural Resources and Ecosystems Conservation, smuggling occurs. Some 11,000 turtles captured from smugglers were released into their habitats in the Wania River, Papua Province, Indonesia, on 30 December 2010. In March 2009, more than 10,000 turtles retrieved from smugglers were also released into the Otakwa River in Lorentz National Park. 687 pig-nosed turtles were seized at an Indonesian airport in March 2013. They were reportedly destined for Hong Kong. Captive care Carettochelys insculpta at the Los Angeles Zoo. Pig-nosed turtles have become available through the exotic pet trade, with a few instances of captive breeding. While juveniles are small and grow slowly, their high cost and large potential size makes them suitable only for experienced aquatic turtle keepers. They tend to be shy and prone to stress. They get sick easily, which can cause problems with their feeding, but they are known to eat commercially available processed turtle pellets or trout chow, as well as various fruits and vegetables. Breeding is rarely an option to the hobbyist, as adults are highly aggressive and will attack each other in all but the largest enclosures. Wild populations of this turtle are declining rapidly because of illegal capture for the pet trade. It is estimated that between 2003 and 2013, more than 80,000 individuals were confiscated in 30 seizures in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-10-08/pig-nosed-turtles-are- adorable-and-thats-made-them-target-traffickers References Further reading * Boulenger, George Albert (1889).

Proponents claim that students bound for college may be able to use such skills to realize a distinct educational advantage over other students in their major. Additionally, vocational-technical schools often provide training to adults from the surrounding communities. The training, offered for a cost, may range from a single course to an entire program of ten or more courses. Vocational-technical schools are licensed, registered, or accredited like any other high school. Types Though less common, some vocational-technical schools are full-time. Not only do they provide vocational and technical training, but they also provide traditional academics that students would typically receive during high school, all within one school district or building. Such schools often expose students to their academic classes during one half of the day, and to their vocational and technical classes during the other half, or have academic weeks and vocational-technical weeks. Most vocational-technical schools, however, are part-time. This means that they only provide vocational and technical training, while the academic portion of their education is obtained from their home school district. Students engaged in such schools often spend one half of the school year at their home school for academic classes and the other half of the school year at the vocational-technical school for training, alternatively they may go to their home school in the morning and their vocational-technical school after lunch.

A group G is said to have property FA if every action of G on a tree has a global fixed point. Serre shows that if a group has property FA, then it cannot split as an amalgamated product or HNN extension; indeed, if G is contained in an amalgamated product then it is contained in one of the factors. In particular, a finitely generated group with property FA has finite abelianization. Property FA is equivalent for countable G to the three properties: G is not an amalgamated product; G does not have Z as a quotient group; G is finitely generated. For general groups G the third condition may be replaced by requiring that G not be the union of a strictly increasing sequence of subgroup. Examples of groups with property FA include SL3(Z) and more generally G(Z) where G is a simply-connected simple Chevalley group of rank at least 2. The group SL2(Z) is an exception, since it is isomorphic to the amalgamated product of the cyclic groups C4 and C6 along C2. Any quotient group of a group with property FA has property FA. If some subgroup of finite index in G has property FA then so does G, but the converse does not hold in general. If N is a normal subgroup of G and both N and G/N have property FA, then so does G. It is a theorem of Watatani that Kazhdan's property (T) implies property FA, but not conversely. Indeed, any subgroup of finite index in a T-group has property FA. Examples The following groups have property FA: * A finitely generated torsion group; * SL3(Z); * The Schwarz group \\\\left\\\\langle{ a,b : a^A = b^B = (ab)^C = 1 }\\\\right\\\\rangle for integers A,B,C ≥ 2; * SL2(R) where R is the ring of integers of an algebraic number field which is not Q or an imaginary quadratic field.

It was first identified in a 5-month-old juvenile black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) collected near Ballina in northern New South Wales, Australia, in January 1995 during a national surveillance program for the recently identified Hendra virus. ABLV is the seventh member of the genus Lyssavirus (which includes Rabies virus) and the only Lyssavirus member present in Australia. Prevalence ABLV is distributed throughout Australia in a variety of bat species which are believed to be the primary reservoir for the virus. > Surveillance initiatives also confirmed the presence of lyssavirus in both > Pteropid (Gould et al., 1998) and insectivorous bats (Gould et al., 2002; > Hooper et al., 1997), and later, human infections were reported following > encounters with both fruit and insectivorous bats (Allworth et al., 1996; > Hanna et al., 2000; Warrilow, 2005; Warrilow et al., 2002).

Bat lyssavirus and human health Three cases of ABLV in humans have been confirmed, all of them fatal. The first occurred in November 1996, when an animal caregiver was scratched by a yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat. Onset of a rabies-like illness occurred 4–5 weeks following the incident, with death 20 days later. ABLV was identified from brain tissue by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In August 1996, a middle aged woman in Queensland was bitten on the finger by a flying fox while attempting to remove it from a child on whom it had landed. Six months later, following heightened public attention from the first ABLV death, she consulted a GP regarding testing for the virus. Postexposure treatment was advised, but for an unknown reason did not occur. After a 27-month incubation, a rabies-like illness developed. The condition worsened after hospital admission, and she died 19 days after the onset of illness. On the day the woman was hospitalized, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, and saliva were submitted for testing. On the fourth day of her hospital admission, these tests were returned with results of probable ABLV infection. Postmortem tests were all strongly positive for ABLV. The length of incubation is unusual as classical rabies has typical incubation periods less than 90 days. In December 2012, an eight-year-old boy was scratched by a bat in north Queensland. He became ill two months later, and died on 22 February 2013. Rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin are effective in prophylactic and therapeutic protection from ABLV infection. Since the emergence of the virus, rabies vaccine is administered to individuals with a heightened risk of exposure and vaccine and immunoglobulin are provided for postexposure treatment. ABLV is one of four zoonotic viruses discovered in pteropid bats since 1994, the others being Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Menangle virus. Of these, ABLV is the only virus known to be transmissible to humans directly from bats without an intermediate host. > Dr John Carnie [Victoria's Chief Health Officer] said Australian bat > lyssavirus was a rare but fatal disease that could be transmitted to humans > or pets bitten or scratched by bats. But he said only two cases have ever > been recorded, both in Queensland. No animal or person in Victoria has ever > contracted the disease, Dr Carnie said.

Only trained volunteers or workers should handle bats. Anyone who > encounters a sick or injured flying fox should not try to catch it but call > the DSE Customer Service Centre on 136 186. ABLV was detected in a bat found in the Melbourne suburb of Kew in July 2011. The discovery prompted health authorities to issue warnings to Melbourne residents not to touch the creatures.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/its- batty-not-to-cleanse-this-scourge/story-e6frfhqf-1226096070582 ABLV was confirmed in two horses on Queensland's Darling Downs in May 2013. Both horses were euthanased when their condition deteriorated despite treatment and the attending veterinarian performed a post mortem examination obtaining samples that allowed for the laboratory diagnosis. The property was then quarantined. Three dogs and the four horses in closest contact received postexposure prophylaxis, as did all nine in-contact people. The virus was isolated and identified as the insectivorous bat strain. These cases have prompted reconsideration of the potential spillover of ABLV into domestic animal species. Veterinarians are urged to consider ABLV as a differential diagnosis in cases of progressive generalized neurological disease.

History The Austin hospital was founded in 1882 as a charitable institution for incurables by Elizabeth Austin, the widow of Thomas Austin. It had name changes before becoming the Austin Hospital.History, Austin Hospital, retrieved 2009-03-03. =War and post- war= During World War II, two military hospitals were located at the site - the 115th Australian General Hospital, operated by the Australian Army, between 13 March 1941 and 19 May 1947, and the 6th RAAF Hospital, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force, between 1942 and 1947. The Australian Army handed over the military hospital to the Repatriation Commission on 19 May 1947, and the hospital then became known as the Repatriation General Hospital Heidelberg. The Repatriation Commission (Department of Veterans' Affairs) operated the hospital until 31 December 1994. In the decade leading up to transfer of the hospital to the state hospital system the name was modified to its current name - Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. =State Government operation= The Austin Hospital was transferred into the Victorian health system on 1 January 1995, with Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital and Austin Hospital amalgamating on 1 April 1995 to become the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre - \\"Victoria’s largest tertiary referral centre providing a broad range of patient services whilst enhancing established teaching and research profiles\\". In 1996 plans by the Victorian State Government of Jeff Kennett to privatise the hospital were leaked to the press. There was much community disquiet over this decision, and confidential reports on the privatisation were withheld from public scrutiny. Most hospital staff opposed this plan, but being bound by confidentiality agreements dared not speak out publicly fearing for their own jobs. The Labor Party pledged its opposition to the privatisation proposal. With the surprise election in 1999 of Steve Bracks, a minority Labor Government was formed with the support of three Independents. Immediately, privatisation plans for the hospital were shelved, and funding increased.Michael Wynne, \\"The Austin and Repatriation Privatisation\\" , 2002, Faculty of Arts, University of Wollongong, retrieved 2009-03-03. In August 2000 the Victorian Government announced the redevelopment of the Austin Hospital and incorporating the relocation of the Mercy Hospital for Women (MHW) from East Melbourne to Heidelberg. This public project was the largest hospital redevelopment ever undertaken in Victoria, and one of the largest in Australia, costing $376 million. =2003 onwards= On 30 April 2003, the Austin changed its name from the Austin & Repatriation Medical Centre (A&RMC;) to Austin Health. In January 2005, Dr Brendan Murphy was appointed CEO, and on 7 May 2005, the Mercy Hospital for Women fulfilled a long term plan and finally opened at Heidelberg. Services The hospital provides the only Victorian wide service for acute spinal injuries, liver transplant and is the state referral centre for toxicology. It has a Statewide psychiatry unit for young children (under 12), the Eagle Child Unit (now called Statewide Child Unit). The Victorian Respiratory Support Service (VRSS) is also located at Austin Hospital. The treatment of cancer is particularly important with the most comprehensive cancer service in the Southern Hemisphere with the largest Positron Emission Tomography (PET) service in Victoria. Cancer research based at the hospital is conducted by Ludwig Cancer Research. Austin Hospital is one of two major teaching hospitals in Melbourne which maintain a filmless radiology department using PACS.

The site was originally a landfill. The city park was dedicated in 1983. History The city of Mountain View bought the site in 1967 to build a recreational facility. However, the cost of importing earth to raise it by 20 feet in order to prevent flooding was too high, so it was instead operated as a landfill accepting garbage from San Francisco.Dylan Hernandez, San Jose Mercury News, \\"Shoreline goes from trashy past to 'oasis': Shoreline Park Was Built with San Francisco's Refuse, Money\\", Twin Cities.com, Pioneer Press, February 25, 2007, updated March 3, 2007. Shoreline Park opened in 1983, with some initial problems from methane fires.\\"Shoreline Park Reaches Maturity\\", San Jose Mercury News, June 4, 1988. In 1987, Shoreline won the League of California Cities' Helen Putnam Award for public works.\\"Dump-De-Dump-Dump That's Fanfare for Mtn. View's Dump Conversion at Shoreline\\", San Jose Mercury News, October 14, 1987. Features and trails Shoreline Park now features an 18-hole links-style golf course with pro shop and driving range, Shoreline Golf Links, and a artificial lake. On the lake's eastern shore is the Shoreline Aquatic Center, which offers sailboat, windsurfing, kayak, canoe, rowboat, and pedalo rentals, as well as sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking classes. The adjacent Shoreline Cafe is open daily and offers a variety of food to lake goers. Shoreline Amphitheatre is next to the golf course. The Rengstorff House, a historic Victorian mansion moved to the park from its original location elsewhere in Mountain View, and Michaels at Shoreline Restaurant are also in the built-up area of the park. Walkers, runners, bike riders, et al., can enjoy miles of paved and unpaved trails, some of which are part of the San Francisco Bay Trail. A good description of a loop trip can be found here. The trails connect to the Stevens Creek Trail at the eastern edge of the park and the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve on the western edge. Critical habitat Through the developed park, one reaches a wildlife refuge at the edge of the bay, where many birds can be seen at almost any time. Meadowlands near the mouth of Permanente Creek in Shoreline Park provide critical remnant habitat for western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), a bird that has vanished from many counties in the Bay Area. The owl was listed as a Species of Special Concern (a pre-listing category under the Endangered Species Act) by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979, and its Bay Area population continues to decline. In 2008, City of Mountain View evicted a pair of burrowing owls so that it could sell a parcel of land to Google to build a hotel at Shoreline Boulevard and Charleston Road. Eviction of the owls is controversial because suitable alternative habitat has vanished due to suburban sprawl. Development continued to encroach on the owls' habitat when, in 2010, the City of Mountain View approved Google's plan to build a 6.9-acre recreational park for its employees, so that they can play tennis, disc golf, shuffleboard and other activities on Google property that is part of the owls' foraging area. Although there were hundreds of burrowing owls in Santa Clara County when monitoring began in the 1980s, now there are only 35, with three breeding pairs raising ten eggs at Shoreline in 2011 (less than half the number of young in 2003).

He is the first Jesuit to have been made a cardinal (in 1593).  Biography  After studying under Domingo de Soto, Toledo became a professor of philosophy at the University of Salamanca from 1555 to 1559. He was ordained priest at Salamanca in 1556 and two years later, in 1558, entered the Jesuit order. After a brief period of spiritual formation he was called to Rome by the Superior General, Diego Láynez, where the budding Roman College was in great need of professors. Toledo successively (and successfully) taught Philosophy (1559-1562), Scholastic and Moral Theology (1562-1569), and was prefect of studies of the fast-growing university. In the 1570s he published a number of commentaries on Aristotle's works.Roger Ariew, René Descartes and the Jesuits, p. 164, in Mordechai Feingold (editor), Jesuit Science and the Republic of Letters (2002) He directed the work on the Clementine Vulgate, the revision of the Latin Vulgate that was published in 1598; this built on the Sistine Vulgate (the 1590 text), approved by Pope Sixtus V.

He was a well-known composer at the close of the 15th century, was a principal contributor to the Chigi Codex, and was secretary to Guillaume Dufay. Life Nothing is known about his life until 1451, when he became choirmaster at the church of St Vincent, Soignies, near Mons in Hainaut. This was an important musical establishment at the time, and several famous composers either worked there or trained there, including Gilles Binchois, who was probably an associate of Regis. The earliest datable music by Regis is preserved in the choirbooks of Cambrai Cathedral, between 1462 and 1465, indicating that he may have begun working there then. Between 1464 and 1474 he served as secretary to Guillaume Dufay, and possibly lived in Cambrai for much of this time. Also in the early 1470s he was mentioned as one of the major composers of the time by the theorist Johannes Tinctoris, indicating the spread of his reputation. He probably died in early summer 1496, since his post was declared vacant then, and eliminated. Music Although Regis was associated professionally with Guillaume Du Fay, his music is stylistically independent of Du Fay and is highly creative and technically innovative. Like his exact contemporary, Johannes Ockeghem, Regis liked to explore the low vocal register resulting in a very broad registral palette, and his music also evidences great harmonic and textural variety. Two masses, seven motets, and two secular songs, both rondeaux, by Regis have survived; some other music is mentioned by Tinctoris and other writers but is lost. One of his lost works is a Missa L'homme armé; dating from the 1450s;Fallows, Grove online it is one of the earliest known masses based on this most popular of all tunes for mass composition. In addition to this lost mass, he wrote another based on the same tune, a Dum sacrum mysterium/Missa l'homme armé; this one has survived, and is a contrapuntal tour-de-force which uses up to three pre-existing melodies simultaneously in the four voices. Regis is one of the few composers known to have written more than one L'homme armé mass. Also among Regis' music for the mass is a single movement, Patrem Vilayge. Regis' extended motet, Lux solemnis, Repleti sunt omnes, features a lengthy passage of call and answer bicinia dialogue between the upper two voices and the lower two voices, foreshadowing this technique that was made famous in the following generation by Josquin. Regis is one of the first composers to have written for five voices, a standard grouping in the music of the next generation (for example, in the music of Josquin des Prez). Indeed, his motets for five voices seem to have been used by the next generation, including Loyset Compère, Gaspar van Weerbeke, Josquin, and Jacob Obrecht as models for their own work.

It was built c. 1867 by Henry Rengstorff, a prominent local businessman who operated a ferry between San Francisco and Mountain View. It is built in the Italianate Victorian architecture style. The house's three-bay front facade features an entrance pavilion topped by a balustrade and a pediment on the middle bay. .  History  Henry Rengstorff built the house near Rengstorff Landing, an important grain shipping point. The house was built to demonstrate his prosperity, and to raise his six children in comfort, including a room built solely for his four girls, to accommodate their regular appointment with a dressmaker to try on the latest fashions. When Rensgstorff died, his daughter Elise Haag and grandson Perry Askam moved into the house. The ranch on which the house was located was purchased by the Newhall Development Company. This company did not have use for the house, but attempted to preserve the structure while having it relocated. The house was located about a mile from the present location at Shoreline Park. It was saved from destruction in the 1970s, but remained abandoned for many years, until the 1980s when the house was finally restored. There are stories of Hells Angels driving their motorcycles up and down the dilapidated staircase. The house is open for guided tours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Sundays.

On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired Gizmo5. On March 4, 2011, Google announced that the service would be discontinued as of April 3, 2011.http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/66xpUG8VkkI The Gizmo5 network used open standards for call management, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). However, the Gizmo5 client application was proprietary software and used several proprietary codecs, including GIPS and Internet Speech Audio Codec (iSAC).  History  Gizmo Project was founded by Michael Robertson and his company SIPphone. On November 12, 2009, Google announced that it had acquired Gizmo5 for a reported $30 million in cash. Prior to this acquisition, Gizmo5 had a working relationship with GrandCentral (now Google Voice) for years. Upon announcement, Gizmo5 suspended new signups until a Google relaunch. Google was also dogfooding a Google Voice desktop client based on Gizmo5, branded as Gizmo5 by Google. On April 3, 2011 Google shut down Gizmo5 and recommended users to use Google Talk instead.  Technology  Gizmo5 was based on the Session Initiation Protocol and could interoperate with other SIP-based networks directly, including the public switched telephone network. The latter required the Gizmo5 service features CallOut and CallIn. CallOut was available at a fee, whereas CallIn and calls to other VoIP users were generally free of cost. Gizmo5 also used encryption (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) for network calls and worked well with Phil Zimmermann's Zfone security features. Gizmo5 supported the following Codecs: * GSM — fixed bit rate, not loss tolerant, narrow band (8 kHz sampling rate) * PCMA — fixed bit rate (8 kHz sampling rate) * PCMU — fixed bit rate (8 kHz sampling rate, high band width) * EG711 (Enhanced G.711) — fixed bit rate, loss tolerant, narrowband * iSAC — variable bit rate, loss tolerant, narrow and wideband (8 to 16 kHz) * iLBC — variable bit rate, loss tolerant, narrow * iPCMwb — 16 kHz sampling rate * iPCM — fixed bit rate, loss tolerant, wideband Version 4.0 of the Gizmo5 softphone offered video calls. Gizmo5 also offered smartphone version. As of July 20, 2009, Gizmo5 was the only SIP service that could be used with Google Voice directly (without requiring a U.S. based phone number). The text chat function of Gizmo5 utilized the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) protocol. Users were addressed by an identification string in the format of username@chat.gizmoproject.com. An earlier incarnation of the service was ', a free software VoIP system based on the Pidgin instant messaging software and the SIP protocol handling of the Linphone VoIP software, but restricted to using (only) the SIPphone service. It is available under the GNU General Public License and sponsored by Linspire.  Service features  Gizmo5 supported outbound caller line identification in the United States. Gizmo5 provided a free voicemail service. Gizmo5 allowed paying subscribers of LiveJournal to place voiceposts if they are unable to use the voicepost telephone lines provided by the website.  Mobile phone support  The Gizmo5 mobile phone application used the phone's carrier voice network for all calls. The service called the phone numbers of both parties and bridged the call. On mobile phones that support SIP applications, calls may be placed over WiFi or 3G. In the case of WiFi, calls to Gizmo5 users were free, and calls to the public switched telephone network were charged Gizmo5 Call Out credit. On 3G, additional costs would apply depending on the user's data plan.  Gmail On August 26, 2010 Gmail accounts with Google voice were given a function to make and receive calls. Google Voice product manager, Vincent Paquet, confirmed that this function was added through the help of the technology received after the Gizmo5 acquisition.Google introduces Call from Gmail, free calls to US and Canada (update: impressions).

He was the son of Frank Gifford Tallman, Jr. (1894 – 1952) and Inez Evelyn Foster (1894 – 1982). Early life Growing up, he had a twin sister named Elizabeth. When Elizabeth was about 7, she died of a combination of pneumonia and measles. That same year Frank's sister Prudence was born. He also had one brother, Foster. Frank Tallman's father had been a military pilot during World War I. Tallman took his first plane ride in his father's lap at the age of five. As a teenager he took flying lessons and became a pilot. When World War II started, Tallman tried to enter the military as a pilot, but his application was declined due to his lack of the required two years of college. He worked for a time as a civilian pilot instructor and later in the war was able to join the U.S. Navy when they relaxed their education requirements. Tallman remained stateside until the end of the war. Postwar Tallman remained in the United States Navy Reserve after the war and started a business in Illinois. He had the opportunity to acquire a collection of pre-1920 aircraft and supplemented the collection with surplus World War II aircraft and more pre-war aircraft as he was able. In the late 1950s he moved his business and aircraft to southern California and began to do work for the entertainment business. He also performed in air shows around the country.Tallman biography at Aerovintage.com Tallmantz Aviation FG-1D Corsair that was formerly owned by Tallman. He acquired the aircraft in 1959 from the salvage yard of an aluminium smelting company. In 1961, Tallman formed Tallmantz Aviation with stunt pilot Paul Mantz. Based at Orange County Airport (now John Wayne Airport) in southern California, they provided pilots, camera planes, and a small fleet of antique and historic aircraft, along with background models of aircraft and ships, for movie and television productions. Mantz was killed in 1965 while flying a cobbled-together aircraft, the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1, designed with the assistance of Otto Timm, representing the fictional type built by oil explorers of pieces of their crashed Fairchild C-82 Packet downed in the North African desert in The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 version). Tallman injured his leg in a go-cart accident with his small son in the driveway of their home, which meant Mantz had to fly the Phoenix. Tallman was hospitalized. Infection set in and most of the leg was amputated. Tallman taught himself to fly with one leg, reportedly preferring to fly some planes without the prosthetic leg he used for walking. As an amputee, he eventually regained his airman medical certificate and ratings in propeller multi- and single-engine, jet, and rotary aircraft. Film credits Tallman performed the stunt flying in the 1963 chase movie It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, including the flight in a Beechcraft Model 18 through a Coca-Cola billboard. He also contributed to The Carpetbaggers (1964), The Wrecking Crew (1969), and The Thousand Plane Raid (also 1969). He served as the flying supervisor for Catch-22 in 1970 and was personally involved in locating and acquiring the 18 or so flyable film unit B-25s appearing in the film. Tallman flew the dramatic night shots of the Milo Minderbinder Air Force B-25 bombing its own base just over the heads of actors Jon Voight and Martin Sheen. In 1971, Tallman flew a Grumman J2F-6 Duck amphibian he restored in Murphy's War. Also in 1971 Tallmantz Aviation provided the aerial camera footage for an episode of Columbo entitled \\"Ransom For A Dead Man\\". In 1973 he flew in Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies and piloted a Stearman cropduster in Charley Varrick along with the television pilot films Death Race and San Francisco International Airport. He was aerial supervisor for The Great Waldo Pepper in which he performed barnstorming stunts. When the controls failed in his World War I aircraft replica, the plane went out of control and struck power lines. Tallman suffered a head injury. He also flew in Lucky Lady, both in 1975. Tallman also served as aerial coordinator and pilot for the television series Baa Baa Black Sheep (1976–1979). He also flew in the six-episode TV series Spencer's Pilots, starring Gene Evans, and the television film, Amelia Earhart, both in 1976. In 1973, Tallman recounted his experiences rebuilding and flying vintage aircraft in the book Flying the Old Planes. His last film projects were The Cat from Outer Space, Capricorn One, and 1941, all in 1978. Death On Saturday 15 April 1978, Tallman was making a routine ferry flight in a twin-engine Piper Aztec from Santa Monica Airport, California, to Phoenix, Arizona under visual flight rules when he continued the flight into deteriorating weather, a lowering ceiling and rain. He struck the side of Santiago Peak in the Santa Ana Mountains near Trabuco Canyon at cruising altitude, and died in the ensuing crash. Following Tallman's death, his historic collection of movie warplanes and camera planes was sold off.
