Maya is featured as the main support character to the protagonist Phoenix Wright in the first three games of the series and later returns in the sixth game. The character has also appeared in film, anime and manga adaptations of the series, a Japanese series of musicals and stage plays, and crossover video games such as Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Project X Zone 2 and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. Maya was created by Shu Takumi, the creator and director of the series, as he wanted the player character to have a partner to investigate with. For her design, she was given traditional clothing for Japanese spirit mediums, including a kimono and a magatama bead. When she was brought back for Spirit of Justice, she was at first written the same way as in her first appearances, but was then changed to be more mature at some points, to show that she had grown during the nine years that had passed within the games' story. Critics praised her character and her interactions with Phoenix, and her return in Spirit of Justice was well received, but her portrayal in the Ace Attorney film was criticized as off compared to her video game appearances.  Appearances  Maya first appears in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, where she is introduced as defense attorney Mia Fey's younger sister and a member of the Fey clan, a family of spirit mediums living in the isolated mountain town of Kurain Village. Following the death of her sister, she is framed and accused of sororicide, only to be defended and proven innocent by Mia's mentee, junior attorney Phoenix Wright. In gratitude, Maya becomes his legal assistant and partner, helping him investigate crime scenes and using her medium abilities to channel her sister's spirit when they need guidance. At the conclusion of the game, she decides to return to Kurain Village to focus on her medium training. In Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Justice for All, Phoenix and Maya reunite in Kurain Village, where Phoenix defends her from false murder charges orchestrated by her aunt Morgan Fey, and she once again becomes his assistant while watching over her younger cousin and Morgan's daughter, Pearl Fey. Later, she is kidnapped by an assassin and held ransom to force Phoenix into defending a guilty client. With his friends' help, Phoenix is able to solve the case and rescue Maya. Maya returns Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Trials and Tribulations, again acting as Phoenix's assistant during several cases. During a trip with Phoenix and Pearl to a mountain retreat, she is nearly killed as part of another plot by Morgan, only to be saved by Godot and her mother, Misty Fey, who had disappeared many years prior. Though she is briefly accused of Misty's murder, Phoenix discovers the true guilty party and proves her innocence. Maya does not make a physical appearance in the series' fourth and fifth entries. However, she is mentioned in dialogue by other characters in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. Later, in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Dual Destinies, she sends a letter to Phoenix encouraging him, which cheers him up during a difficult case. Maya returns in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney ‚àí Spirit of Justice, reuniting with Phoenix in the kingdom of Khura'in after spending two years training there to become a full-fledged spirit medium and the new head of the Fey clan. Once again being accused of murder, she is defended by Phoenix and assists him in his efforts to change Khura'in's legal system. In the game's DLC case, she joins with Phoenix as his partner and assistant once again for the duration of the case. =Other appearances= Outside of the main Ace Attorney series, Maya makes brief cameo appearances in the Ace Attorney Investigations spin-off titles, and once again appears as Phoenix's assistant in the crossover title Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Maya also appears in several other Capcom titles, including as part of Phoenix's attacks in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, as a solo unit with Phoenix in Project X Zone 2, as a playable character in Moe Moe ~ No Limit Off Beat Action Shooting and as a collectible card in Onimusha Soul. Maya has appeared in other media adaptations of Ace Attorney. She is a recurring character in the Ace Attorney manga series published by Kodansha Comics, in a series of stage musicals performed by the Takarazuka Revue, and in a series of stage plays performed by the Super Eccentric Theater. Maya also appears in the Ace Attorney film, which loosely adapts her role from the first game, and the Ace Attorney anime series, which adapts the events of the original trilogy. Concept and development Ace Attorney series creator and director Shu Takumi created Maya as a partner for Phoenix in order to make cases more fun to investigate by offering advice. While she was planned to be a partner from the start, she was initially planned to be a lawyer-in-training. For Spirit of Justice, it was decided early on to bring Maya back, due to frequent requests for her return from Dual Destinies players. The developers worried a lot about how she would be received, with the game's producer Motohide Eshiro saying that they were certain that people would criticize the use of the character regardless of what they did. At first she was written with the concept of having grown into an adult but still remaining the same inside; the game's director and writer, Takeshi Yamazaki, thought that this unchanged personality felt strange considering nine years had passed within the series' story since her last appearance, so it was decided to at some points have her act more maturely, to show that she had grown. To further this, her mastery of spirit channeling was written as improved compared to her last appearance. Yamazaki had problems with writing her dialogue, and said that he had to try his best to get her to sound right. They also had problems with getting the balance right between Maya's involvement in the story and the appearances of other characters; because of this, they decided to make her the defendant of the game's third case, thereby freeing up space for other characters during the investigation phase, and letting the player spend time with Maya during the trial itself. Along with the rest of the first game's characters, Maya was designed and drawn by Kumiko Suekane and Tatsuro Iwamoto. She was originally designed with clothes typical for traditional Japanese spirit mediums, including a kimono and a magatama bead; the kimono design was altered compared to the source material, however, with the hem drastically shortened. For situations when she channels Mia's spirit, her design changes: her hair and clothing remains, while her face and body change, looking like Mia's, with the intent of emphasizing the difference in their bust sizes. She is given yet another alternative design for part of the third game, Trials and Tribulations, where she wears a waitress uniform, replacing all of her regular clothes and accessories save for the beads in her hair. Because Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games feel like three installments in one larger work, he wanted to avoid a situation where the first game looks outdated compared to the third: because of this, Maya and other major characters such as Miles Edgeworth and Phoenix retain the same character graphics throughout all their appearances in the first three games. For Maya's reappearance in Spirit of Justice, she was given a renewed design; before settling on the final version, the development team considered using her mother, Misty Fey, as a motif and base for the redesign. =Localization= Starting with the second game, the localization direction was handled by Janet Hsu; one of the first decisions she had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the Fey clan. She decided to localize it around the idea that Ace Attorney takes place in an alternative-universe United States where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and Japanese culture flourished. Because of this, the Fey clan and things related to it, such as the Kurain channeling technique, were kept Japanese as it was seen as part of Maya's heritage. Despite this, Maya's favorite food, ramen, was changed to hamburgers in the English version; Maya is said to enjoy both foods in Spirit of Justice. =Portrayals= Maya is portrayed by three different actors in Japanese-language media: Mirei Kiritani in the Ace Attorney film and Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney; Satomi Hanamura in Project X Zone 2 and Spirit of Justice; and Aoi Y≈´ki in the anime series. In the English release of Spirit of Justice, she is voiced by Abby Trott, while she is voiced by Lindsay Seidel in the anime series. Kiritani was surprised when she was offered the role as Maya in the film, as she had been playing the games herself for a long time. Y≈´ki was anxious during the audition for the role, and said that she had her own idea of Maya's character at first, but learned to understand the character through directions from Ayumu Watanabe, the anime's director.  Reception  Maya was received well by critics, especially for her comic relief throughout the series. IGN listed Maya among the best video game sidekick characters for her helpfulness and quick-thinking in a list of the \\"best video game wingmen ever\\", commenting that Wright \\"owes a lot of his success to Maya Fey.\\" Hardcore Gamer praised the banter between her and Phoenix as among the best in video games. The website called them \\"the perfect leads\\" in the Ace Attorney manga due to their \\"goofiness\\" and how they are portrayed as close friends. Maya was also well received in the anime adaptation. Anime News Network called Maya their favorite character in the anime, and said that her character benefited greatly from being animated, with her playfulness well presented through her wide range of actions and expressions. However, Kotaku wrote that her portrayal and casting in the Ace Attorney film did not fare as well, where she appeared \\"emotionally unstable\\" rather than retaining her childlike innocence from the video games. Reviewers regretted Maya's omission from the fourth and fifth Ace Attorney games, and both reviewers and fans praised her return and design in the sixth game as feeling like \\"catching up with an old pal\\" and a reminder of what fans appreciate about the series. Toshi Nakamura at Kotaku considered Maya a staple of the series since its start, and said that it was shocking that she did not appear in Dual Destinies. Similarly, John Walker of Eurogamer questioned the series' move to a new cast with Apollo Justice, saying that Maya's character arc had not yet been completed in Trials and Tribulations. USgamer's Nadia Oxford described Maya's reappearance in Spirit of Justice as \\"catching up with an old pal\\", and as a reminder of why players \\"fell in love with\\" the series to begin with. Her reintroduction along with her new design as an adult was positively received by series fans, with a lot of excited discussion about her on social media. Bob Mackey, also writing for USgamer, discussed Spirit of Justice use of elements from previous games, and called Maya's return the most notable of them. Steven Bogos of The Escapist called her a fan favorite, and said that her return was a treat for players. Alexa Ray Corriea at GameSpot also liked her reappearance, and said that after playing one of the episodes set in the United States, she was \\"itching to get back to Khura'in\\" and spend time with Maya. Michael Brown of Dorkshelf commented that Maya's \\"charm and humour bring the series to life\\" and praised the development of her relationship with Wright. Brown highlighted the final cases of both Justice for All and Trials and Tribulations in which Maya and Wright are isolated from one another, stating that their relationship hits its \\"peak\\" in the latter case, its \\"conclusion and their reunion [...] even more satisfying.\\" References Category:Ace Attorney characters Category:Female characters in video games Category:Fictional spiritual mediums Category:Video game characters introduced in 2001 Category:Video game sidekicks ","title":"Maya Fey"},{"id":"9863761","text":"\\"Possession\\" b/w \\"Evil Temptation\\" is a rare single recorded by Iron Butterfly between 1967 and 1968, but not released until 1970 for unknown reasons.

KLCA airs a Top 40 (CHR) music format branded as \\"Alice 96-5\\". The station, part of Tom Quinn's Reno Media Group, operates with a transmitter atop Slide Mountain overlooking Reno, Carson City and Lake Tahoe, and its studios are located on Matley Lane in East Reno. KLCA was also the fictional Los Angeles radio station featured at the beginning of the Robert Downey Jr. film, Air America. KLCA is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=41884 History \\"Alice\\" was launched in early 1997 at the 100.9 frequency (replacing a country formatted station) where KRFN now broadcasts. In 1998, the two stations swapped frequencies, which gave the station a broadcast antenna atop Slide Mountain and improved coverage to include the Lake Tahoe and Carson City areas. Alice's growth was sluggish after moving to the 96.5 frequency as longtime Howard Stern fans in the Tahoe area were angry that they could no longer hear Stern on KRZQ's 100.9 frequency (with a tower on the valley floor). But the original Alice concept of a pop/alternative format designed to flank Hot AC KNEV (Magic 95.5) and CHR KWNZ (K-Wins 97.3) built a solid following on a diet of Matchbox 20, Third Eye Blind, Sugar Ray, etc. The original position statement was \\"Modern Hits.\\" Longtime KWNZ morning show host \\"Wild\\" Bill Cody was hired to host mornings. The pop/alternative audience didn't gravitate to Cody's CHR stunts, and the station moved in a different direction in 1998 while transiting to the 96.5 frequency. The station attracted fans with a playful attitude not typically heard on Hot AC radio at the time - including giving away a divorce on Independence Day (Reno is the divorce capital), conducting a displaced Bunny Ranch \\"working girls\\" job fair, hosting an Elaine Dance contest during the final episode of Seinfeld, looking for Nevada's best looking \\"Wookie\\" before the Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace premiere and bringing street side speed dating to Reno. It also played alternative rock songs that did not fit the hot AC format such as Weezer's Troublemaker in the playlist despite being on the playlist of KRZQ-FM (now KRFN). When the pop/alternative format began to fade nationally, KLCA moved more toward a pure pop/hits approach leading to today's positioning statement: \\"#1 for Today's New Music.\\" However, Mediabase moved KLCA to the contemporary hit radio panel, adespite KWNZ & KWYL continuing the contemporary hit radio trend. The last official day for Nielsen BDS reports as a hot adult contemporary for the station was on July 19, 2011. After that, the shift to contemporary hit radio completed, overlapping slightly for a month with its sister station KWNZ, which became adult hits after this. Two months later, the hot adult contemporary format resurfaced on KMXW, replacing alternative rock station KRZQ-FM.

George first appeared in the role in 1997 before the character was written out in 2004 when she was killed in a car accident caused by Milo Entwistle. While on the serial Helen was central to several storylines including a relationship with Gordon Cunningham, dealing with the suicide of her son Lewis Richardson and her daughter Mandy Richardson's abuse at the hands of her husband Dennis Richardson. Storylines For much of Helen Cunningham's early time in the Village she had the terrible misfortune of being saddled with a family intent on ripping itself apart. Helen had a tough time whilst she was married to Dennis Richardson (David McAllister), who had been abusive to her and had repeatedly raped their daughter Mandy. Helen was unaware of this until Mandy confessed to her brother Lewis. After Dennis was sent to prison for seven years, Helen found a new love interest in Gordon Cunningham (Bernard Latham). The pair slept together and Helen was shocked to realise that she was pregnant. Gordon did the honourable thing by asking her to marry him. They soon got married and Helen gave birth to baby Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins), but more tragedy came for Helen when she found out Lewis had attempted suicide and was slowly dying. This left Helen devastated and she found it hard to cope. Due to Lewis's death, the relationship between Helen and Mandy fell apart and the pair barely spoke to each other. After a while, however, the pair began to rebuild their relationship. Helen then enjoyed a period of happiness running the ironing and cleaning business 'Steam Team' next door to Gordon's Drive 'n' Buy whilst raising Tom. Then suddenly, for reasons best known to herself, Helen became restless: her shop changed its identity, and so did she, indulging in an affair with Tony, Gordon's friend. This was eventually exposed when an earthquake destroyed the barge the lovesick pair had chosen as a bolt hole. After much argument, Tony told Helen that he did not want to be with her any longer and that she should get back with Gordon for Tom and Mandy's sake. Helen took Tony's advice and she and Gordon were fully reconciled. Helen began to regain the respect of daughter Mandy and stepson Max Cunningham (Matt Littler), but soon things were back on rocky ground for her when husband Gordon had a death scare, suffering a heart attack. Helen blamed herself, but Max supported her and Gordon seemed to recover. However a week later, lightning struck twice when Gordon, Helen and Tom were involved in a car accident that left Gordon dead after he suffered another heart attack. Helen was devastated and although she returned home from the hospital, she later died in her sleep whilst sitting in a chair with a blanket over her legs. This left Tom, who survived the crash, an orphan. According to Helen's will, Tom was supposed to stay with Mandy. He then lived with his brother Max for four years until Max died when he was run over on his wedding day, and his widow wife Steph Dean begins to take care of Tom until her death in 2010. In 2012, her tombstone was briefly seen when Cindy Hutchinson went to mourn for Rhys Ashworth. In 2018, the Cunninghams discover that Milo Entwistle is responsible for the deaths of Gordon and Helen. Development Helen's son Lewis (Ben Hull) commits suicide. This damages her relationship with daughter Mandy (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dunn said having to film scenes where Helen and Mandy argue were \\"horrid\\". In scenes where Helen hits Mandy, Dunn said she trusted George enough to allow her to hit her \\"for real\\" as it would add to realism. George added that Dunn and herself \\"get on well\\" and added that if she had children she would \\"want a daughter just like Sarah\\". Helen has a brief affair with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard). Pickard said the storyline \\"shocked\\" him. Pickard later added that his character was \\"going out with the old lady at the moment\\". Pickard added that he \\"gets on well with Kathryn\\" but that it was \\"weird when you suddenly have to be necking her\\". Pickard added that they \\"just got on with it\\" although it was \\"embarrassing when there's a cut and you don't really know what to say to each other\\".

The NCAA was so incensed by Marquette, it instituted a rule that forced an NCAA Division I team to accept an NCAA bid over an NIT bid. A subsequent antitrust case brought by the NIT against the NCAA over this issue was later settled out of court. Meminger was also the MVP of the 1970 National Invitation Tournament, in which Marquette beat Pete Maravich and LSU 101-79 in the semi-finals before defeating St. John's 65-53 in the title game. He never during varsity career lost a home game. NBA career Meminger was drafted in the first round (16th overall) of the 1971 NBA Draft by the New York Knicks, with whom he played from 1971 to 1974 and 1976-1977.NBA Black History month interview As a rookie reserve guard in 1971-72, Meminger averaged 4.6 points in 15 minutes per game, followed by 5.7 points in 18 minutes per game in 1972-73. In that season, Meminger helped the Knicks win their second-ever NBA championship. Playing on a team which featured star guards Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe and Dick Barnett, in Game 7 of the 1973 Eastern Conference finals he replaced Monroe in the second quarter, frustrated the hot-shooting Boston Celtics guard Jo Jo White and scored 13 points. After knocking the Celtics out of the playoffs, the Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers for the title. In the postseason, Meminger played in all 17 games for the Knicks, making 31 of 56 field goal attempts for a percentage.https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/meminde01.html In Meminger's third season of 1973-74, his playing time increased to 26.7 minutes per game as he averaged 8.3 points and 3.6 rebounds per game (both career highs) and 2.1 assists. In 1974-75, Meminger played for the Atlanta Hawks, averaging career highs of 27.2 minutes, 5.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game in addition to 7.9 points per game. In 1975-76 with the Hawks, his fifth NBA season, in just over 20 minutes per game he averaged Basketball-reference.com statistics The 1976-77 season was his sixth and final NBA season as he returned to the Knicks and averaged 7.9 minutes per game. Coaching career Meminger was head coach of the New York Stars in the Women's Professional Basketball League (abbreviated WBL), which played three seasons from the fall of 1978 to the spring of 1981.Women's Professional Basketball League Meminger, with rookie trainer Rick Capistran at his side, guided the Stars to the league championship during the 1979-80 season and was named the league's coach of the year. The team's great success, however, was not enough to save the Stars, which lost so much money the team folded without being able to repeat as champions. Meminger was coaxed to head west, leaving Capistran behind, when he signed up to coach the San Francisco Pioneers in what would be the league's final season. Among the players Meminger coached to a championship were twins Faye and Kaye Young, fresh out of North Carolina State University. Kaye was married to former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher. Kaye Cowher died of skin cancer at age 54 on July 23, 2010. In 1982 Meminger was hired to coach the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Association. He was dismissed for his combative style with his players and replaced by his former Knicks teammate and friend Phil Jackson. Meminger convinced Jackson to let him try out for the team but he was unable to resurrect his career on the court. Meminger coached the USBL's Long Island Knights in 1987, and in later years, spent some time coaching at Manhattanville College in New York.The Daily News article: \\"Meminger featured in The Daily News\\" Personal life Meminger's son goes by the same name and is a news reporter and anchor for NY1 News.Dean Meminger staff profile at NY1.com On November 22, 2009, Meminger was rescued from a fire in the Bronx in New York City.

It is a spin-off of the Aero the Acro-Bat series and was released for the Sega Genesis first in October 1994 then for the Super NES in November 1994 along with the release of Aero the Acro-Bat 2. The main star is Zero, Aero's rival from the previous games. A remake for the Game Boy Advance was planned in 2003, but it was cancelled. Plot During the events of Aero the Acro-Bat 2, Zero receives a telegram from his girlfriend Amy telling him that an evil lumberjack named Jacques Le Sheets is deforesting their homeland Stony Forest to produce counterfeit money and has also captured her father. Ignoring Edgar Ektor's protests, Zero decides to put a stop to Le Sheets. Upon arriving at the island, Zero's plane is shot down and crashes on the beach, so he starts making his way to the forest on foot. During his journey, Zero learns that Amy has also been captured after an unsuccessful attempt to save her father by herself. At the paper factory, Zero fights Le Sheets and pursues him on a flying ship. Aboard the ship, Zero finds that the mastermind is none other than Edgar Ektor. After defeating Ektor with Amy's assistance, the two squirrels parachute safely away, while Ektor's ship crashes into a cliff. Development While David Siller was drawing and designing the concept art for Aero the Acro-Bat, his son Justin introduced a character who went up to the same level as Aero and put his thoughts on paper.http://justinsiller.com/files/EGM-article-pg-1.pdf Using the traits and sketches, it took a year to turn the concept character Zero into a digitized sprite. Siller submitted his proposal to Sunsoft and they approved it. The plot was based on the character animation. Some of the enemy boss sprites were rendered with 3-D Studio. The audio was based on a number of traditional Japanese melodies and sounds and incorporated a rock n' roll soundtrack. A number of ideas from the original concept were left out. The game was finally finished and released by fall.http://justinsiller.com/files/EGM-article- pg-2.pdf The game was showcased at 1994 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version an 8.25 out of 10, praising Zero's innovative techniques, especially his dive and swoop moves, and the colorful graphics, which one of the reviewers said surpass the Genesis's theoretical color limits. Captain Squideo of GamePro, in contrast, commented that while most of Zero's moves are fun, the dive and swoop moves are too difficult to control. He shared EGM's approval for the game's colorful graphics, but concluded that \\"Difficult controls make this martial arts squirrel less than an instant superstar.\\" He made similar remarks of the SNES version, which he described as \\"identical\\" to the Genesis version, but this time concluded Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel to be an overall good game despite its drawbacks.

It should not be confused with the band's debut album, which is also called The House of Love. It is generally referred to either as Fontana (after the record label it was issued on) or The Butterfly Album (after Trevor Key's sleeve art). Background The recording and mixing of The House of Love was beset with problems, with the band members distracted by hedonism, ego and indecision.House of Love biography by Dave Roberts (on fansite) Group leader Guy Chadwick would later comment \\"we really needed guidance at that crucial point. Most groups just go nuts. It's like this huge trolley full of booze being placed in front of you. With a whiff of success, people change towards you. We were taking too many drugs, I was drinking ridiculously and that's the worst combination when things are going wrong.\\" As opposed to the recording of the debut album (which had only taken one week, despite a protracted and argumentative mixing period afterwards), the new recordings were spread out over two years in multiple studios and would involve the work of four different producers (Dave Meegan, Paul Staveley O'Duffy, Stephen Hague and Tim Palmer) as well as production involvement by the band members themselves. The band would find themselves at odds with their A&R; man Dave Bates, who saw the band as generators of hit singles and who had selected the album producers (whom Chadwick deemed \\"quite obviously wrong for us\\") as well as commissioning remixes which the band loathed and had not authorised. During the slow and argumentative recording process, The House of Love's rhythm section Chris Groothuizen and Pete Evans would moonlight as members of a separate band, My White Bedroom. More seriously affected was lead guitarist Terry Bickers, an introverted character who was already unhappy with the implications of the band's deal with Fontana. Bickers would retreat into manic depression as his relationship with Chadwick deteriorated into a non-speaking one in which the two were more likely to communicate by post rather than have a face-to-face conversation. Following the completion of the album, Bickers would acrimoniously quit The House of Love during the early days of the sixty-date promotional tour.Levitation/Terry Bickers interview in Volume #3 , February 1992 (copy hosted on Levitation fansite), accessed December 2, 2010 A couple of years later he would comment \\"I just found at the time that I didn't have the same aspirations as the rest of the band. I was more into exploring music than exploring the exploitation of markets around the globe. They were really into crusading. And winning. I wasn't.\\" Singles The House of Love would eventually generate four singles. The first of these was \\"Never\\" (issued against the band's wishes) which stalled at number 41 in the singles chart on release in 1989, as did the November follow-up \\"I Don't Know Why I Love You\\" (although the latter would achieve greater success as a Radio 1 Single of the Week and in reaching number 2 on the Modern Rock charts in the USA). The third single was a re-recording of the band's debut single \\"Shine On\\", which became the band's biggest and best-known British hit (reaching number 20). The last of the four was \\"The Beatles and the Stones\\", which reached number 36. Re-recordings Several tracks on the album were re-recordings of previously released House of Love songs.

Early career West was born on April 5, 1959, and raised in the San Diego, California area, the daughter of a Marine Corps family. As a child she was not much exposed to jazz, as her father preferred classical music. She only started to explore jazz and jazz vocal music during college; these explorations became more serious and focussed when she moved to San Francisco after graduating from college. She has also been at some pains in the past to note that \\"I never sang in church.\\"\\"Margo Jefferson on Paula West\\", liner notes to Paula West, Come What May (2001). She arrived in San Francisco around 1988‚Äì89 and worked as a waitress (indeed, she held one job or another waiting tables for many years until her singing career was well established). During this time, she gradually started to appear at open mike jam sessions, during the course of which she met pianist Ken Muir, who would eventually become her long-time accompanist. She also undertook a program of serious vocal study while continuing to appear at local lounges. 1990s As word spread through the Bay Area, West started to get one- and two-week residencies at San Francisco hotel lounges, most notably the Ritz-Carlton. During this period she started to refine the distinctive elements of her approach to the expectations placed upon jazz singer/cabaret performers: a careful attention to the lyrics of the songs (\\"I sing the verses,\\" she was once quoted, \\"not just the chorus.\\" ), an ability to sustain notes without use of vibrato, a sparing reliance on the hoary chestnuts of the genre, a willingness to re-imagine the standards that she does perform,\\"Reflections with Philip Elwood and Sheila Jordan\\", liner notes to Paula West, Temptation (1997). and an eagerness to identify worthy songs not usually found within the jazz/cabaret repertoire. As an illustration of the last point, she has performed or recorded such non-standard songs as Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", \\"If I Only Had A Brain\\" from The Wizard of Oz, The Beatles' \\"Fixin' A Hole\\", Ella Mae Morse's \\"Cow Cow Boogie\\", \\"Who Will Buy\\" from Oliver!, Bert Williams' turn of the (20th) century classic \\"Nobody\\", and Johnny Cash's \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", as well as \\"Danny Boy\\". West performed predominately in clubs in San Francisco and New York City, with occasional performances in Europe. For ten years she held a one-month residency at the Empire Plush Room at the York Hotel in San Francisco (since closed). She also had recurring engagements at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel in New York. West is one of the contributors on BBC World News' The Real... talking about her favorite places in San Francisco. 2000 to present West performed with Eric Reed and reviewers began to take note that her career was \\"spiraling in the right direction.\\" In 2007 West began performing with noted pianist/arranger George Mesterhazy (who accompanied the late Jazz great Shirley Horn), and their work together has been lauded in The New York Times, \\"Ms. West is accompanied by the George Mesterhazy Quartet, a limber ensemble whose leader, pianist and arranger shares her passion for taking songs in unexpected directions and deepening their meanings without wrenching them out of shape. With each engagement Ms. West, who made her Oak Room debut in 1996, displays more courage, maturity, interpretive insight and vocal confidence. She and the quartet, which also includes Ed Cherry on guitar, Tony Reedus on drums and Barak Mori on bass, are a match made in pop-jazz heaven.\\" As that collaboration grew into a full- fledged partnership she performed most often with Mesterhazy's quartet of Barak Mori on bass, Jerome Jennings on drums, and Ed Cherry on guitar, in residencies at the Empire Plush Room and the Rrazz Room in San Francisco. They then established themselves at Yoshi's in San Francisco's revitalized Fillmore Jazz District, and in New York at The Jazz Standard where West, Mesterhazy and his Quartet recorded her first album in 11 years \\"Live at The Jazz Standard\\". In February 2013, West returned to New York to appear with Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra to perform in Blood on the Fields for which he won a Pulitzer Prize.

It was originally introduced in 1963 and was discontinued in 1982. The Super Reverb was a Fender Super amplifier with built-in reverb and \\"vibrato\\" (actually tremolo). The original Super Reverb amplifiers were all-tube designs and featured spring reverb. There were two different designs, distinguishable by the color of the \\"face\\" or front control panel. Super Reverbs from 1963 through 1967 had \\"blackface\\" panels. From 1968 until its discontinuation in 1982, the Super Reverb had \\"silverface\\" cosmetics and circuitry. Early models in 1968, while cosmetically \\"silverface\\", did contain \\"blackface\\" circuitry. Fender introduced a reissue '65 Super Reverb in 2001 featuring a printed circuit board design rather than the hand-wired circuitry of the original '65 Super Reverb.http://fenderguru.com/amps/super- reverbhttp://www.fender.com/guitar-amplifiers/vintage-pro-tube/65-super- reverb/product-021760.html The Super Reverb is commonly used by blues guitarists due to its ability to deliver loud, warm tube distortion through its four 10\\" speakers.http://www.musicradar.com/us/tuition/guitars/the-10-best-amps-for- blues-guitar-263987/10 It is also known as having a scooped mids tonality, meaning that there is less midrange and an emphasis of sparkly treble and full, round bass frequencies.

There are known as the \\"ultralinear\\" models with different transformers. Master volume was added after 1972, and pull-out boost circuit added in 1975. Line Out jack socket and a 3-band equalization for the Normal Channel added in 1978.) Silverface amps made between '68 and '72 were emblazoned with \\"Super Reverb-Amp\\" with a tailed amp logo in the grille cloth. After 1972 this was changed to just \\"Super Reverb\\" and the tailed Fender logo from the mid-1960s was replaced with a modern \\"unscripted\\" tailless amp decal (changed to a \\"scripted\\" style in 1977). There were only minor adjustments made to the pre-1975 silverface Super Reverbs. Today aftermarket kits are sold for non-master silverface amps allowing them to be taken back to the more desired blackface specs. * A master volume was added in late 1974. * A \\"Boost\\" control was added in 1975. * A Mid control for the Normal channel and a Line Out jack socket were added in 1978. * Super Reverbs produced between late 1980 and 1981 have blackface cosmetics and a silver sparkle grille cloth but the same circuitry as prior years. Some early Super Reverb amplifiers came with the option of factory equipped JBL speakers instead of the Jensen, Oxford or Utah speakers widely used in the majority of Fender amplifiers. The JBL speakers had aluminum dust caps with larger magnets and voice coils, this gives a fuller response range and handles more power reducing the risk of \\"blowing a speaker\\". These models also add to the overall weight of the amp, making casters (wheels) a very good option. Super Six Reverb The Super Six Reverb is essentially a master volume Twin Reverb or Dual Showman Reverb equipped with six Oxford 10L6 (or CTS 10\\" AlNiCo) speakers featuring 10\\"/5.2 ohms (8 ohms each in series-parallel) and 100 watts RMS (changed to 135W in 1977).

Established in the 18th century in the Virginia Colony, the Warwick Road effectively provided a portage around the portion of the James River containing dams and rapids near the fall line in the area of the towns of Manchester and Richmond, Virginia, which were located along the south and north banks of the river respectively. Historical path from 18th-century port town Warwick Road originated at its namesake, the former 18th century port town of Warwick which was located near the confluence of Falling Creek and the James River. Established around 1750 by Archibald Cary, Warwick was destroyed in 1781 by British General Benedict Arnold's troops during the American Revolutionary War. The 18th-century roadway called \\"The Warwick Road\\" led through what is now the large DuPont Plant in Chesterfield County, crossed into areas of Chesterfield annexed by Richmond in 1944 and 1970 which are now part of South Richmond and returned into Chesterfield County in what is now the Bon Air, Virginia area. There, it intersected what was called the River Road, which ran closely along the south bank in a westerly direction. The Warwick Road and the River Road in combination formed a portage from the deep-water tidal James River around the falls, rapids, and dams near Manchester and Richmond to the river west of there, where it is more shallow. The upper James River was navigable with craft such as bateau boats for many miles to the west. 20th century Although apparently not used for portage purposes after the destruction of Warwick in 1781, much of the original Warwick Road remained intact as a through route until around 1960 when Chippenham Parkway was built and severed it between Jahnke Road and Midlothian Turnpike near Bon Air. However, portions of the old pathway remain in use in 2007. From east to west, these include sections of modern Walmsley Boulevard, Warwick Road, and Old Warwick Road in South Richmond, and Brown Road and Belleau Drive in Chesterfield County. Portions of Warwick Road were hard-surfaced after it became part of Virginia's Secondary Road System under the Byrd Road Act in 1932. During second half of the 20th century, portions of Warwick Road east of Chippenham Parkway became hazardous as the area became heavily developed with housing subdivisions and suburban growth, and the traffic volume increased greatly on the two-laned curving roadway, which had no shoulders and deep ditches along the narrow right-of-way which had been established many years before the invention of the automobile. Warwick Road became notorious for many fatal automobile crashes. Newer connector road in South Richmond In the 1990s, a newer 4.5-mile-long four-lane connector route was built in the annexed area of the City of Richmond at a cost of $41 million US with funding from the Virginia Department of Transportation. It was built partially along the some sections of the original Warwick Road, and followed the alignment generally. The connector route, most of which was assigned the historic name of Warwick Road, extends from the intersection of Bells Road and Belt Boulevard (State Route 161 across the CSX A-line (the former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Richmond-Florida main line) via a new bridge through major intersections with Broad Rock Boulevard (State Route 10), Hull Street Road (U.S. Route 360} to an intersection with Midlothian Turnpike, which carries U.S. Route 60. Several bypassed sections of the older roadway were renamed \\"Old Warwick Road\\".

In addition to its reviews, it is noted for its subversive, political, and sometimes surreal news, as well as its mixtape generator. History Originally called Tiny Mixtapes Gone to Heaven and hosted on GeoCities, the webzine moved to its current domain in 2001. Tiny Mix Tapes is a featured reviewer on Metacritic. The writing staff is composed of volunteers who often use pen names (such as \\"Wolfman,\\" \\"Mango Starr,\\" \\"Chizzly St. Claw,\\" and \\"Filmore Mescalito Holmes\\"). Some contributors, like Rebecca Armendarizhttps://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-armendariz and Alex Brown,https://www.tinymixtapes.com/writer/alex+brown go by their real names.

The \\"DeLorean\\" section reviews music released before Tiny Mix Tapes began that may no longer be popular, albums that the writer believes are \\"classic\\" or influential, or older music that is significant to the writer. Similarly, \\"Eureka\\" consists of reviews highlighted by the site as particularly noteworthy or exciting. There is also a features section devoted to interviews, articles, festival reviews, as well as a \\"Live Blog,\\" in which writers review live music shows. In 2009, Tiny Mix Tapes added a \\"columns\\" section. As of 2008, Tiny Mix Tapes started reviewing films and now has a section devoted to it. This section also includes features on filmmakers and other numerous subjects within the medium. =The Automatic Mix Tape Generator= The Automatic Mix Tape Generator, or AMG, was created to offer two-way communication with the website. Started in 2002, readers may submit a title or the theme for a mixtape, and a group of volunteers (called the \\"Mix Robots\\") will compile a track list. Due to the large volume of requests as well as request redundancy, not all requests are filled. The \\"Mix Robots\\" produce and submit track lists fulfilling the request as they interpret it. Mixtape track lists are then available on the website. Most of the songs on the mix tapes come from indie or underground bands/musicians. In 2008, Trillian, the AMG editor, was on Talk of the Nation talk radio program to discuss Valentine's Day mixes. =Chocolate Grinder= At the beginning of 2009, Tiny Mix Tapes began a feature podcast called Chocolate Grinder. Published approximately twice a month, each installment sees a writer collecting ten brand new tracks they want to shed light on and mix it as a continuous stream or download. The tracks are posted for stream or download in a single continuous file with a unique name. Currently, Chocolate Grinder remains a staple of Tiny Mix Tapes' daily media content, which includes videos, music streams, Internet premieres, interactive websites, and the like. =Benefit Compilation= In April 2009, the site began selling a benefit compilation CD/LP to benefit the victims of the War in Darfur. It featured 11 exclusive songs. =Humor and politics= On March 30, 2007, Tiny Mix Tapes announced it was hosting a festival in Minnesota. At this festival, long-since dissolved indie band Neutral Milk Hotel were billed to be \\"reuniting all over your Cheerios\\" as the headlining act. Amidst a blog flurry, and articles disputing the legitimacy of the event in Billboard and Prefix, the festival was revealed as an early April Fool's Day joke later the same day.

It can be associated with trauma. Because the septal cartilage has no blood supply of its own and receives all of its nutrients and oxygen from the perichondrium, an untreated septal hematoma may lead to destruction of the septum. Immediate drainage is necessary. Failure to recognize septal hematomas, or treat in a timely fashion, can cause a saddle nose deformity. This condition appears more in children because of the septum is thicker and the lining is more flexible. Causes Some causes of nasal septal hematoma include: broken nose, medication, surgery or injury to the soft tissue area. Symptoms Symptoms include: blockage in breathing, change in nose shape, painful swelling of nasal septum and nasal congestion. Diagnosis Nasal septal hematomaDiagnosis can be made by a physical exam with the use of a nasal speculum or otoscope. Sometimes palpatation is used to diagnose the hematoma. Treatment To treat a septal hematoma it is incised and drained to prevent avascular necrosis of the septal hyaline cartilage which depends on diffusion of nutrients from its attached nasal mucosa. Small hematomas can be aspirated with a wide-bore needle. Large hematomas are drained by an incision parallel to nasal floor. Systemic antibiotics are given after the incision and drainage to prevent local infection.

The new parish of Christ Church was created and a new structure was commissioned to be designed by Bath architect G. P. Manners in 1839. Consecrated in 1841, it was \\"originally...a simple design with plain walls, clear glass windows and stone flagged floors and was in the Perpendicular style.\\" Later Victorian taste in churches was for something more elaborate, so in 1875 it was \\"restored\\" by Sir George Gilbert Scott; the east end was rebuilt, with an extra bay beyond the east wall to form a sanctuary. After Scott's death in 1878, interior work was overseen by his son John Oldrid Scott. Further work in 1884 included the addition of a south porch, and in 1919 C.E. Ponting added the south chapel as a war memorial to C. Eric Moulton. The church has a memorial to Eric Moulton in the Lady Chapel, and a ring of eight bells cast in 1923 by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1952.

Although its design changed with time, it was generally a heraldic banner, i.e., one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle on a red field (Gules an eagle Argent crowned Or). The banner should not be confused with the flag of Poland, a white and red horizontal bicolor, officially adopted in 1919. Derived from early Slavic flag-like objects, a royal banner of arms dates as far back as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was replaced with the Banner of the Republic of Poland, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the Banner of the Republic. History = From stanica to chorƒÖgiew = Polish replica of the Holy Lance, Wawel Cathedral Treasury, Krak√≥w The banner of Poland traces its origins to the early Slavic vexilloids known as stanice (pronounced ; singular: stanica), probably used at least as early as the 10th century. Although no specimens or images are preserved, a stanica was probably a cloth draped vertically from a horizontal crosspiece attached to a wooden pole or spear, resembling the Roman vexillum. It was both a religious and military symbol; the stanice were kept either inside or outside pagan temples in peacetime and were taken to war as military insignia. Polish vexillum in 966 as imagined by Jan Matejko in 1889 With Poland's conversion to Christianity in the late 10th century, the pagan stanice were probably Christianized by replacing pagan symbols with Christian ones such as images of patron saints, or a Chi-Rho or dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit. In the year 1000, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno, the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor Otto III officially recognized Duke Boleslaus the Brave as King of Poland (see Congress of Gniezno), crowning him and presenting him with a replica of the Holy Lance, also known as Saint Maurice's Spear. This relic, together with the vexillum attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of King Boleslaus's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the vexillum. A royal banner was used as early as the reign of Boleslaus the Generous (r. 1076-1079). The earliest mention of a banner (, pronounced ) bearing the sign of an eagle is found in Wincenty Kad≈Çubek's Chronicle which says that Duke Casimir the Just fought the Ruthenians in 1182 \\"under the sign of the victorious eagle\\". A seal of Duke Premislaus II from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a crowned eagle. Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland, and his crowned white eagle a became the royal coat of arms of Poland. During the reign of King Ladislaus the Elbow-High (r. 1320‚Äì1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: chorƒÖgiew Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego). The orientation of the eagle on the banner varied; its head could point either upwards or towards the hoist. The actual rendering of the eagle changed with time according to new artistic styles. The national banner was identical with that of Lesser Poland, the territory where Krak√≥w, the capital of Poland until 1596, is located. It was therefore carried by the Standard-bearer of Krak√≥w until that office was replaced by the Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: chorƒÖ≈ºy wielki koronny, Latin: vexillifer regni). = Polish- Lithuanian union = Banner of Poland torn in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) as painted by Jan Matejko in 1878 One of the most famous standard-bearers of Krak√≥w was Marcin of Wrocimowice (d. 1442) who carried the national banner in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410. The military unit (chorƒÖgiew) that went to the battle under that banner comprised the elite of Polish knights, including such chivalrous celebrities as Zawisza the Black, which is a clear sign that the banner, described by the chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz as \\"the great banner of Krak√≥w Territory\\", was also the insignia of the entire kingdom. During the course of the battle, according to D≈Çugosz, the national banner slipped out of Marcin's hand and fell to the ground, but it was quickly picked up and saved from destruction by the Polish army's most valiant knights, which further motivated the Poles to strive for victory over the Teutonic Knights. Banner of Poland during the reign of Sigismund III Vasa. Royal Standard of Sigismund III Vasa. With the establishment of a dynastic union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1386, it became customary to use two banners--Polish and Lithuanian--as equally important insignia of royal authority. In the mid-16th century, before the creation of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth (real union) in 1569, a single banner for the entire entity also came into use. The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white emblazoned with the arms of the Commonwealth which combined the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). During the 17th century, the banner was often divided into three or four horizontal stripes of white and red, ending with swallowtails. Elective kings' dynastic arms were often placed in an inescutcheon. Variants with the White Eagle and the Pursuer placed side by side without an escutcheon directly in the field or with the Eagle on the obverse and the Pursuit on the reverse side of the banner were also used. During royal coronations, however, separate banners for each of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them and handed them to the kneeling king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers. = Time of partitions = Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century brought an end to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna established a semi-independent Kingdom of Poland (known as Congress Kingdom) under control of and in personal union with the Russian Empire. The King (Tsar) of Poland at that time used a white royal banner emblazoned with the arms of the Congress Kingdom--a black double-headed Russian eagle with the Polish White Eagle in an inescutcheon. = Interbellum = J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's coffin draped in the banner of the Republic (1935) In August 1919, the Sejm (lower house of parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law defining the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorƒÖgiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner was part of the insignia of the head of state--the State Leader (Naczelnik Pa≈Ñstwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It was plain red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wƒô≈ºyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. As a symbol of presidential authority, the banner was carried or flown to mark the presence of the head of state and, at the same time, the commander-in-chief. It was flown on the president's official residence, and used as a car flag and instead of number plates on the president's vehicle. The banner was also used on special national occasions including the welcome ceremony for Ignacy Paderewski in Pozna≈Ñ in 1918 and Poland's wedding to the Baltic Sea in Puck in 1920. It also draped the coffins of Henryk Sienkiewicz in 1924, the Unknown Soldier in 1925, and Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in 1935. = Second World War and People's Poland = Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki fled to Romania, taking the presidential insignia, including two specimens of the Banner of the Republic, with him. The banners were kept by the Polish government-in-exile in London until after the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989. Meanwhile, the new Communist authorities at home used a modified version of the banner with a crownless White Eagle and a wider border. It was first used during the celebrations of the anniversary of the battle of Grunwald in 1945. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the prime minister and, during the 1960s, by the Council of State, a collective head of state of the time. = Third Republic = Presidential jack based on the former Banner of the Republic of Poland On December 22, 1990, the last Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, including one of the banners rescued by Mo≈õcicki in 1939, to Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw was seen as a symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland. In 1996, the Minister of National Defense established a jack of the President of the Republic of Poland with the purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board. The jack is identical in its design to the former Banner of the Republic of Poland.

Until 1955, Zesto Drive-In was a chain of drive-in restaurants, owned by Taylor Freezer Corp, featuring ice cream and frozen custard. They are recognized for their ice cream favorites such as avalanches, milkshakes, sundaes and ice cream sodas, to name a few. Several of the original restaurants operated under the chain continue to operate independently today using the trademark, but many of the original and newer restaurants are not drive-ins. History Zesto was started by entrepreneur and inventor L.A.M. Phelan as a national franchise chain. Phelan was head of the Taylor Freezer Corporation, which in 1945 had developed the \\"Zest-O-Mat\\" frozen custard machine, and franchise agreements granted exclusive use of the Zest-O-Mat machines in a given territory under the Zesto name. The first known Zesto Drive-In was opened in Jefferson City, Missouri in 1948 at the foot of St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital on Missouri Boulevard by its original franchise owner, Lottie Traubtz; dozens more opened in the late 1940s and early 1950s, mostly in the U.S. South and Midwest. Taylor Freezer Corp, reportedly growing frustrated with managing a retail business and dealing with unhappy franchisees, abandoned the Zesto concept in 1955 and left the remaining franchisees to fend for themselves. Taylor Freezer Corp later became known as Taylor Company, currently a division of Middleby Corporation. While some former franchisees continued to operate under different names, others retained the Zesto name, and they do so today independently of each other and without support from a governing franchise structure. The Zesto trademark was first registered in 1985 by Zesto Inc., a Missouri corporation owned by Harold Brown, who purchased and operated the first known Zesto in Jefferson City, Missouri in 1973. The trademark currently belongs to Todd B. Jansa of TJ Group Investments LLC located in Wahoo, Nebraska, who grants exclusive rights to use the Zesto name by territory.

He claimed to have graduated from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University) with a major in biology and a minor in chemistry. He had indeed majored in biology, having graduated with a C average. He had never minored in chemistry, but had taken a few chemistry courses, all of which he either failed or barely passed. He had also failed an FBI course in forensic science. Nonetheless, no one checked his background. Zain soon gained a reputation among West Virginia prosecuting attorneys for being able to solve extremely difficult cases. His reputation was such that prosecutors throughout the country wanted to use him as an expert witness. There were problems, but Zain's supervisors chose to ignore them. During 1985, FBI Laboratory director James Greer told the state police that Zain had failed basic courses in serology and testing bloodstains. No corrective action was taken. Later that year, two workers claimed to have seen Zain record results from blank test plates. However, these complaints were not taken seriously because it was well known the workers and Zain didn't like each other. Zain also gained a reputation for being very \\"pro- prosecution.\\" In 1989, Zain became chief of physical evidence at the Bexar County medical examiner's office. However, West Virginia prosecutors continued to call upon him because his results appeared to be more favorable than others. West Virginia work discredited In 1987, Glen Woodall was convicted of a series of grisly felonies at Huntington Mall, including two cases of sexual assault, principally on Zain's testimony regarding semen from one of the victims. Woodall was sentenced to 335 years in prison. However, in 1988, DNA testing‚Äî- the first ever admitted as evidence at the state level in the United States‚Äî- proved conclusively that Woodall was innocent, and the conviction was reversed. Woodall's defense team performed its own tests, which determined that Zain had used flawed blood-typing methods in tying the semen to Woodall. More seriously, it seemed that Zain had initially determined a piece of hair was unidentifiable pubic hair, but later changed his identification to hair from Woodall's beard.Court Invalidates a Decade of Blood Test Results in Criminal Cases. The New York Times, 1993-11-12. On that basis, Woodall was freed in 1992. Woodall subsequently sued the state for false imprisonment and won a $1 million settlement. At the request of the state police, Kanawha County Prosecutor William Forbes began a criminal investigation. Forbes was so disturbed by what he found that he asked the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to appoint a special judge and a panel of lawyers and scientists to investigate the serology department. On November 4, 1993, Senior Circuit Court Judge James Holliday issued a report finding that Zain had engaged in a staggering litany of misconduct and outright fraud. According to the report, Zain had misstated evidence, falsified laboratory results and reported scientifically implausible results that may have resulted in as many as 134 people being convicted wrongfully. Holliday claimed that Zain's misconduct was so egregious that any testimony offered by Zain should be presumed as prima facie \\"invalid, unreliable, and inadmissible\\". It also found serious deficiencies in the serology division's quality-control procedures. The Supreme Court unanimously accepted Holliday's report on November 12, terming Zain's actions \\"egregious violations of the right of a defendant to a fair trial\\" and a \\"corruption of our legal system\\". Further investigation An investigation in Texas found that while working with the Bexar County medical examiner's office, Zain had engaged in misconduct and fraud that may have resulted in as many as 180 wrongful convictions. As in West Virginia, the Texas investigation found numerous instances of Zain filing reports on tests that had never even been done, reporting negative results as positive, and describing inconclusive results as conclusive. Bexar County dismissed him after learning of his misconduct in West Virginia. Reviews of the cases he had processed resulted in charges being dismissed and convictions reversed for multiple cases in West Virginia and Texas. West Virginia alone eventually paid a combined total of $6.5 million to settle lawsuits by people who had been convicted wrongfully due to Zain. Zain was charged with fraud, but his trial was delayed indefinitely after he was diagnosed with liver cancer. In 2001, he was charged with four counts of obtaining money by false pretenses, but the jury deadlocked. A new fraud trial was later scheduled for July 2003. In December 2002, Zain succumbed to his liver cancer and died in his home in Ormond Beach, Florida.

Miis were first introduced on the Wii, and later appeared on the Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, and various Nintendo apps for smart devices. Miis can be created using different body, facial, and clothing features, and can then be used as characters within games on the consoles, either as an avatar of a specific player (such as in the Wii series), or in the case of certain games (such as Tomodachi Life and Miitopia), portrayed as characters with their own personalities. Miis can be shared and transferred between consoles, either manually or automatically with other users over the internet and local wireless communications. A player can create nearly infinite varieties of Miis on any sort of basis such as themselves, famous people, etc. On the 3DS and Wii U, user accounts are associated with a Mii as their avatar, and used as the basis of the systems' social networking features, most prominently the now-defunct Miiverse. On the Nintendo Switch, a Mii can still be used as an account avatar, but avatars depicting various Nintendo characters are also available. However, games such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Go Vacation, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe use Miis as playable characters. Miis are also used as profile pictures for Nintendo Accounts, and can be used in Nintendo smart device games such as Super Mario Run and the now-defunct Miitomo. They are created by way of Mii Maker (Wii U and 3DS), Mii Channel (Wii), or the Mii system settings panel (Switch).  History  Nintendo's first public debut of free-form personal avatar software was at the Game Developers Conference in 1997, during the Nintendo 64 era. There, Shigeru Miyamoto said that the personal avatar concept had originally been intended as a Famicom demo, where a user could draw a face onto an avatar. Miyamoto commented that the concept could not be turned into a game and the concept was suspended. In 1999, the 64DD (a disk drive peripheral for the N64) was launched in Japan. Nintendo had produced a short film using the 64DD's Mario Artist: Talent Studios avatar maker, which includes clothes and a built-in movie editor. The player can optionally utilize the Game Boy Camera and the 64DD's Capture Cassette to put their own face upon the avatar. The next avatar implementation was for the Nintendo e-Reader and GameCube. Along with the Game Boy Camera, it can build an avatar maker. Miyamoto showed another short film they made with this software, which was shown at E3 2002 with the name Stage Debut. This software, renamed to Manebito, was discontinued prior to release. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki attributes his work on Talent Studio as having been foundational to his eventual work on the Mii, which was necessitated by the development of the game Wii Sports. Mii creation The Mii Channel, the first application used to create and view Mii characters on the Wii. Mii characters are created and stored in the Mii Channel or the Mii Maker, which are pre-installed on the Wii and the Nintendo 3DS/Wii U consoles respectively. While the user can assign a gender, name, birthday, favorite color, and mingle preference to a Mii, the majority of the interface used for Mii creation focuses on the appearance of its face and head: the user is given a variety of different hairstyles, eye, nose, and mouth shapes, and other features such as facial hair or wrinkles, to select from. Most of the facial features can be further adjusted, including their size, position, color, and alignment. Accessories such as hats and glasses are also available to add, and the Mii's height and build can also be adjusted. The Mii Maker installed on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U can use facial recognition to generate a Mii, which selects facial features based on a photograph of a person's face taken with the system's and GamePad's cameras respectively. The features can then be fine- tuned by the user. These versions also have more options than their Wii counterpart. Because the selection of facial features is considered by some to be limited, users are encouraged to develop caricatures of real persons instead of accurate depictions. = Special Miis = Nintendo periodically releases special Miis, usually during E3 or to commemorate game and franchise anniversaries. For a limited time between March 13 and March 30, 2007, Wii owners in Japan were sent Mii versions of comedian Sanma Akashiya and tennis player Shuzo Matsuoka. The duo had been featured in Japanese promotions for the Wii, highlighting Miis themselves. Miis of Satoru Iwata and Reggie Fils- Aime (the presidents of Nintendo and Nintendo of America, respectively) were released on the 3DS for the 1st anniversary of the handheld console. During 2013, Nintendo released special Miis of Shigeru Miyamoto and Kensuke Tanabe, and during E3 2013, also released special Miis for Takashi Tezuka, Koichi Hayashida, Eiji Aonuma, and Hideki Konno. Their Miis feature gold pants, as opposed to a gray pair, and cannot be edited or copied. If owners transfer them to another Wii or Wii Remote, they will be removed from their original location, instead of traditionally making another copy. In late 2011, Nintendo released Swapnote/Nintendo Letter Box for the Nintendo 3DS, which features an original female Mii character called Nikki („Éã„ÉÉ„Ç≠„Éº). Nikki gained a relatively small fan base of her own right, especially in Japan. After Nikki's debut, Nintendo featured the character in a few other games and apps, such as , a Nintendo 3DS travel guide app that was exclusively distributed via the now- defunct Club Nintendo in Japan. On the Nintendo Switch, Miis can also be copied from amiibo. = Editing limitations = It is possible to create special Mii-like characters through the use of third-party software, but Nintendo typically will force these entrepreneurs to shut down. Sometimes when a customer has needed to return his or her Wii for service, a replacement machine must be sent. When that happens, the Mii software recognizes it is a different system and will not allow any editing of Miis created on the original system. Nintendo, while offering to copy game data and Miis to the new machine, will not alter the Miis so that they can be edited on the replacement machine.  Wii  = Mii Channel = The Mii Channel is the app that allows Mii creation on the Wii. It can store up to 100 Miis and Wii Remotes are also able to store and transfer up to ten Miis to other consoles. It is also possible to see other Miis from TV shows and games. = Uses in games = The Mii Contest Channel in Europe. Miis are intended to be an extension of the player, and in keeping with this spirit, the user can use them in several Nintendo titles for the Wii. Wii Sports is perhaps the best- known example of this, and it adds a further personal touch to Miis by saving game statistics and records for individual Miis. Miis will make cameo appearances as computer-controlled opponents, teammates, or within the audience. Miis have been used to serve as game file icons (profiles) within several games. Often appearing as just a head for identification, this Mii has no impact on the actual gameplay other than to identify a player in another way besides the name, or represenation based on looks. Miis are primarily used in games such as Wii Sports, Wii Play, Wii Fit, Wii Party, Wii Fit Plus, Wii Music and Wii Sports Resort. Players can also use their Miis, however, in other first-party games, most noticeably within WarioWare: Smooth Moves, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mario Party 8, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Super Sluggers, Animal Crossing: City Folk (using their Mii's head as a mask) and in Go Vacation. The Japan-only Sega game Pachinko: Sammy's Collection is the first third-party game to incorporate Miis, while the Wii version of FIFA Soccer 08 is the first third-party game released in North America and in Europe and Australia to use the Mii Channel. Many other games, like We Ski, and Guitar Hero World Tour and Sonic Colors also use Miis. While a Mii's head always remains the same, its body varies between games. For example, in Wii Sports, the Mii's body is stylized, with spherical floating hands and bearing no arms, and Mii audiences or CPUs floating with spherical bottoms with no legs instead, but in Wii Fit its body is designed to look more natural, and its weight will be determined by the weight the Wii Fit found of the player in Wii Fit tests. Sometimes Miis will wear outfits in context with the game. In Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel, the Miis can be optionally used for the planet's icon that represents the save file, the other option being to use Mario characters for the planets. Only the Mii's head is shown and it's shown in a sphere-shaped like the planet. In Mario Kart Wii, Mii racers can be dressed in jumpsuits, or Mario style overalls for males and a Peach style dress for females, in Dr. Mario Online Rx, Miis appear in medical clothing, and in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, where they appear as bobblehead dolls, they will be dressed up in bounty hunter Samus Aran's Power Suit. In MLB Power Pros, Miis are designed to look like regular Power Pro-Kun avatar, with legs detached from the main body. In Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2, the Mii's body is formed more like a regular human. This design was however, criticized by IGN's Lucas M. Thomas, who sarcastically commented that \\"[it] doesn't look disturbing at all.\\" = Everybody Votes Channel = Miis were also incorporated in the downloadable Everybody Votes Channel, where Miis represented the voter. Up to six different Miis could be registered within the channel to use in voting. The channel was discontinued along with the Check Mii Out channel by Nintendo on June 28, 2013 as they moved on to other next- generation projects. = Check Mii Out Channel = Another Mii-centric channel, the Check Mii Out Channel, also known as the in Japan, Europe, and Oceania, was released on November 11, 2007. Perhaps an evolution of an idea shared by Shigeru Miyamoto at the Game Developers Conference in 2007, this channel allowed players to upload their Mii characters and share them with other users. There were also popularity contests, in which players would design a Mii that would personify a specific idea or character and then vote on the Mii that would best fit the suggestion. The channel was available for free download on the Wii Shop Channel from November 12, 2007, until June 27, 2013, when Nintendo discontinued the channel along with the Everybody Votes channel. Nintendo DS Although the platform lacks native support for Mii creation, a few games on the Nintendo DS console do support Mii functionality, and will work in conjunction with the Wii's Mii Channel. = Uses in games = Miis can be transferred from a user's Wii to supported Nintendo DS games via the Mii Channel. A code must be entered by the user to unlock the feature on the Mii Channel. (In order, tapping A, B, and 1 buttons on the Wii Remote, then holding down the 2 button for three seconds.)Wii to DS Connection Found in Mii Channel The Nintendo DS game Personal Trainer: Walking uses Miis to allow players to track their progress in the game. Players are also able to create Miis in-game.Personal Trainer: Walking Brings Mii Making To The DS The Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time also uses Miis.Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : Echoes of Time for the Wii & DS A new Nintendo DS game, Friend Connection will have Mii support. The life- simulation game Tomodachi Collection, only released in Japan for the Nintendo DS, also uses Miis and has a built-in Mii editor. Miis from the user's Wii's Mii Channel can be transferred to the game, and vice versa.  Nintendo 3DS  = Mii Maker = The is the app that allows Mii creation on the Nintendo 3DS. It can store up to 100 Mii characters. It is also possible to see other Mii characters from TV shows and games. The Mii Maker installed on the Nintendo 3DS can use facial recognition to generate a Mii, which selects facial features based on a photograph of a person's face taken with the system's cameras. = Uses in games = Unlike the Nintendo DS, which features limited support of Mii characters, its successor the Nintendo 3DS features Miis as a standard. Similarly to the Wii's Mii Channel, the Nintendo 3DS features its own Mii-creating application called Mii Maker, which is more advanced than the Mii Channel. Mii characters can be created manually with Mii Maker as on the Wii's Mii Channel, but they can also be created automatically through the use of the Nintendo 3DS's cameras. The system captures an image of a subject's face, and the application converts the image into a Mii likeness using integrated recognition software. Automated Mii character designs can be manually adjusted. Mii characters can also be imported from the Wii to the 3DS or from the 3DS to the Wii U. However, Miis cannot be sent from the 3DS to the Wii, as Mii Maker features an expanded selection of design parts that are not available on Mii Channel.Import Miis from Wii to 3DS one-way only - News - Aussie-Nintendo.com The Nintendo 3DS can generate and read QR codes that represent Mii characters. QR codes and pictures of Mii characters can also be transferred to an SD card in any picture format, and be used in various ways, such as posting them on a web page. Miis on the Nintendo 3DS can also be used in conjunction with the device's Augmented Reality software - the software includes a mini-app named 'Mii Pics' which allows the user to take a photo of their Mii within a regular photo, using an augmented reality card included with the system. The first Nintendo 3DS game to include support for Mii characters is Pilotwings Resort. Miis obtained through StreetPass appear as non-player characters in Nintendogs + Cats. Mii characters also appear in Pok√©mon Rumble Blast, Mario Kart 7, and in many more games. Currently, the most notable game to feature Miis in their entirety is Tomodachi Life, the sequel to Collection. This is also the first game to give Miis complete lines of dialogue as well as the first game to allow players to choose what Miis say. Miitopia is another Mii-centric game title for the Nintendo 3DS. =StreetPass Mii Plaza= A feature on the Nintendo 3DS, the makes use of the handheld's StreetPass feature, which data between nearby Nintendo 3DS consoles in standby mode. As Miis are gathered in the plaza, they can be used in numerous minigames, with the initial two being Puzzle Swap and Find Mii (known as StreetPass Quest in PAL regions). In Puzzle Swap, players can exchange pieces of several jigsaw puzzle panels based on Nintendo games, in which there were initially seven, but this number increased with occasional updates. Find Mii is an RPG minigame in which players use the Miis they gathered to fight through dungeons, earning accessories for their Mii. Each Mii possesses a different type of magic depending on their color, and become more powerful if the player meets them more than once. These games can be optionally played with Play Coins, though the results are more random than with Streetpass Miis. On December 6, 2011, the feature was updated to include SpotPass functionality, as well as new puzzle panels, a sequel to Find Mii, a map showing where players met other Miis, Accomplishments and a music player.Record 3D Movies on Your 3DS Starting Now Special Miis released by Nintendo and obtained through SpotPass can also be used in StreetPass Mii Plaza. They have access to all Puzzle Swap pieces and provide a level 5 player for Find Mii.  Wii U  = Mii Maker = Screenshot of the Mii Maker's creation tool on Wii U. The is the app that allows Mii creation on the Wii U. It can store up to 3,000 Miis. It is also possible to see other Mii characters from TV shows and games. The Mii Maker installed on the Wii U can use facial recognition to generate a Mii, which selects the features based on a photograph of a person's face taken with the Wii U GamePad camera. = Uses in games = Mii characters evolve further for the Wii's successor, Wii U. In addition to previous uses on the Wii, Mii characters are wholly integrated into the Wii U's social online network Miiverse, the WaraWara Plaza community where clusters of Mii characters crowd around the hottest games, and being depicted as personal avatars for individual Wii U players, who have the ability for twelve separate Nintendo Network ID User accounts that can be used on a single console at a time. User accounts with Mii representatives are used for both games and apps such as Nintendo TVii. Mii characters can be transferred from the Wii and/or the Nintendo 3DS to the Wii U, in which in the latter's case transfers between consoles can occur as many times as possible, as the Wii U has its own Mii Maker app similar to that of the Nintendo 3DS version, where Users could transfer, create, and/or store up to 3000 Mii characters on the Wii U. Mii characters also return as in-game characters for certain Wii U games, which in addition to Nintendo-published launch titles such as Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Mario Kart 8, New Super Mario Bros. U and Nintendo Land, they are also included in third-party titles such as ESPN Sports Connection and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.  Nintendo Switch  Miis can be used on the Nintendo Switch to represent accounts; unlike previous Nintendo consoles, users may optionally use a Nintendo character as their avatar instead, but Miis can still be integrated into games as a playable character such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Go Vacation, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. The Mii Maker is located within the console's system settings menu and, unlike previous Mii Makers, provides unnatural hair and eye colors. Miis can be transferred between Switches and imported from a 3DS or Wii U using an amiibo figure. Miis can also be imported from a Nintendo Account. Like with the Wii and Nintendo 3DS, the Nintendo Switch can hold up to 100 Miis.  Other platforms  When the freemium mobile app (since shut down) Miitomo launched on iOS and Android devices, it was possible for the first time to officially create Mii characters without the need for a Nintendo console. Mii characters created on the app initially resembled their Wii U counterparts, with a later update introducing Nintendo Switch standards, and use the same attributes. Nintendo Account holders can opt to use the app to create Mii avatars without the need to link their accounts to any Nintendo console, with the option also available. Miitomo was also be used to support Mii avatars on other Nintendo apps for smart devices. For example, an update released for Super Mario Run on April 25, 2017 introduced player Mii icon customization options with the support of Miitomo, and its in-game costumes, via the same Nintendo Account. Miitomo was only available in 60 of the 165 countries/territories recognized by Nintendo Accounts by May 9, 2018, when it was discontinued. On May 24, 2018, Nintendo introduced a browser-based Mii editor called Mii Studio. The editor is integrated into all Nintendo Accounts for users in all regions, including regions that did not originally have official support for Miitomo. Mii Studio supports all Mii attributes and standards introduced for the Nintendo Switch.

The revolutionary frame is an advanced aerofoil cross-section using a carbon composite monocoque.  Development  The use of monocoque frames for bikes was not new, but their development was improved through the work of Norfolk based designer Mike Burrows, who advanced both the design and build through utilising carbon fibre mouldings. Burrows's design was initially rejected by British cycling manufacturers. However, it was to be received more enthusiastically by the British Cycling Federation. The design was considered illegal by the UCI. Therefore the project was prematurely shelved in 1987. Three years later, in 1990, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) revoked its previous ban on monocoques. By this time Mike Burrows had lost enthusiasm for the concept and was focusing his attention on recumbent bicycles. However, his Mk2 Monocoque caught the attention of a keen local cyclist (and Lotus Engineering employee), Rudy Thomann. Aware of the revocation of the ban, Thomann took Burrows's design to Lotus Engineering. and presented it to his boss, Roger Becker. Roger could immediately see the potential of the design. Not only did it offer the opportunity for Lotus to utilize its expertise and diversify into a new market, but it also offered a morale lift to Lotus‚Äôs beleaguered workforce, which was suffering from the effects of the early 1990s recession. With Roger Becker's enthusiasm and support on the Lotus board, Rudy headed a small team of specialists to explore the design further, harnessing Lotus‚Äôs knowledge of aerodynamics and carbon fibre. By February 1992, Lotus Engineering had acquired the rights and marketed the bike as the LotusSport Pursuit Bike. In addition, the design was modified and perfected through a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by the Lotus aerodynamics specialist Richard Hill. UCI approved the bike for competition, and Bryan Steel rode it at an international race meeting in Leicester, shaving five seconds off his time in the two kilometre pursuit.  Racing  The profile of Lotus and Burrows was raised at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Chris Boardman won the 4000m pursuit, catching World Champion Jens Lehmann in the final, and setting a new world record of 4 minutes 24.496 seconds in the quarter-finals. The publicity of this medal, the first British cycling medal at the Olympics in 72 years, confirmed to Lotus the potential of marketing a production version. This was to become the Lotus Type 110. British professional cyclist Shaun Wallace raced a model 108 at the 1992 professional world cycling championships, finishing second in the 5 km pursuit. His model 108 was later offered for sale by Bonhams.  Current Locations  A total of fifteen Type 108s were built, including one prototype in 1991, as well as three frames for use in the Olympic Games. A further eight replicas were offered for sale at ¬£15,000 each. Of the fifteen, at least two are on display, one at the Lotus Factory at Hethel. A third example is on display at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum, located in Birmingham, AL, USA. Chris Boardman‚Äôs Olympic gold medal winning bike was on display at the Science Museum in South Kensington, London, in a temporary exhibition which ran from 16 March to 20 June 1993, entitled \\"SuperBike: An Exhibition on the Olympic Gold Medal Bicycle\\", and was later returned to Lotus Engineering. The Science Museum keeps in its permanent collection the second of the replicas made by Lotus Engineering.

Description  Entry gateway to the shrine complex. Rohri, also known as Sateen Jo Aastan is the resting place for the Seven Female-friends. According to folklore these female friends resided here. These unmarried female-friends veiled themselves from all males, a practice called purdah (the practice of preventing men from seeing women). But for the fear of a tyrannical raja resulted in their disappearance, possibly in a cave in the side of a hill. Thus they became satti. It is probable that this folklore has its origins in the Hindu ritual of sati, an inhumane ritual where widows burnt themselves or were burnt on their dead husband's pyre. In reality however, this is the burial place of a ruler from Sukkur, Mir Abu Al-Qasim Namkeen (961 A.H). The tomb complex was ordered to be built by him. It was constructed in the ochre stone similar to that used in the necropolis of Makli Hill. Inscriptions and Quranic verses in the finest Naskh script adorn the walls and interior of these structures. Rows of hujras (rooms on the ground floor) were constructed for travellers and students. The famous blue tiles of Sindh were used to enhance the aesthetic impact. A small mosque on the upper level and the western section is profusely embellished with blue, turquoise and white tile-work. Tradition states that when the Mir completed this fine complex, he would retire to it on full moon nights with friends and courtiers and entertain them to music, mangoes, sweets, honey and watermelons. The grand remnant of a bygone era is, unfortunately, in a state of ruin though it is a popular resort for picnickers and tourists. On one of the smaller hills that arises out of the river bank on the south has a leveled platform on which there are many carved gravestones like those on the Makli Hill at Thatta with chain ornaments and panels of Arabic quotations from the Quran. The entire space between the graves is paved and a flight of stairs leads up to the platform from the southside. Enameled tiled work is freely used on these tombs, most of which are dated 1018 to 1301 AH., that is between 1609 and 1883 AD. The principal grave is that of Mir Kasim one of the Sabzwari Shahids dated 1018 AD. This was probably the grave that sanctified the place, and the lamp post and lamp that were placed in front of it are still there; and it gives the name of Than Kasim Shah to the hill. But the name by which it is more generally known is the hill of the seven virgins. The building on the southern side of the hill is called Satbhain, which consists of a row of shallow rooms connected externally with coloured tiles. These cells are said to have been occupied by the seven female-friends. The seven Female-Friends had taken a vow of celibacy and to never look upon the face of a man. Richard Francis Burton, however, maintains that this derivation is wrong, claiming that the correct interpretation for Sati-na-jo-Than or seat of the Satis (i.e. celibate women) is seven.

The Politic: The Yale College Journal of Politics is a monthly Yale University student publication that traces its roots to 1947, when the Yale Political Journal: A Magazine of Student Opinion was founded. The magazine was revived in 1979 as the Yale Political Monthly by future political commentator and historian Robert Kagan, and known alternately as Yale Political Magazine for the following twenty years. In addition to Kagan, past Editors-in-Chief include author and CNN host Fareed Zakaria and Foreign Affairs Editor-in-Chief Gideon Rose.  History  In 1947, a group of undergraduate students started the Yale Political Journal: A Magazine of Student Opinion, or the Journal for short. In their first issue, the founding editors wrote: > \\"We have coined as our by-line, 'a magazine of student opinion' presupposing > that student opinion is worthy of separation from the attitudes of other > groups and that it is worthy as well of attention and study.‚Äù In 1979, Kagan revived the publication, which was for a period dormant, under a new name, Yale Political Monthly. At the time, Kagan was \\"frustrated that things tended to be one sided\\" at Yale, and he sought to provide a non- partisan platform for debate on campus. Students relaunched the publication again in 2001, this time as The Politic, in response to increased interest in politics on campus following the 2000 presidential election.  Other Projects  The Politic has also expanded beyond the monthly magazine. In 2014, The Politic interviewed more than 100 diplomats and published the collection as a book, Diplomatic Discourse. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, The Politic surveyed Yale students from all fifty states for their impressions of and predictions for the election and published them in an interactive map. And in 2017, The Politic released its first documentary, Resettled: New Haven's Refugee Community, which won the Best Student Film Award at the NHDocs Film Festival. In September of 2018, The Politic released its second documentary, 120 YEARS, which tells the story of Scott Lewis' wrongful conviction and ultimate exoneration after 20 years of incarceration. The documentary won the Human Rights Award at the Mystic Film Festival in October 2018 and Best Short Documentary Film at the 27th annual Pan African Film Festival (PAFF) in February 2019. The Politic regularly hosts events as part of a speaker series, The Politic Presents, for the Yale community. Past guests have included John Dickerson, Susan Glasser, Christiane Amanpour, Norman Ornstein, Jake Sullivan, Salman Rushdie, Jeffrey Sachs, Ken Burns, Jesse Jackson, Retired Gen. James Cartwright, and Malcolm Gladwell. The Politic also conducts interviews with a range of prominent public figures such as Fareed Zakaria, Ezra Klein, Marc Cuban, Christiane Amanpour, Frank Bruni, Malcolm Gladwell, Jeb Bush, Dan Ariely, Jonathan Haidt, Ron Paul, Jeffrey Toobin, David Brooks, Ben Carson, Jake Sullivan, Rush Holt, Jr., Martin O'Malley, Michael Dukakis, Russ Feingold, Gretchen Carlson, Gina Raimondo, and Jake Tapper. To date, The Politic features interviews with four 2020 presidential candidates: Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Andrew Yang.

The highlight of his high school career occurred in 1967, when he led Booker to the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association Class A State Basketball Championship. College career Porter then played collegiately at Villanova University, where he was a three-time All-America selection. He took Villanova to the 1971 NCAA Championship Game, in which Villanova lost to UCLA 68-62. Porter was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player after scoring 25 points in the final game. However, he was later ruled ineligible for the honor because he had signed a professional contract with the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association during the middle of his senior year. To the present day, the MOP for the 1971 Final Four is listed as \\"*Vacated\\". Professional career Porter never played for the Condors, instead joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1971.

Aplin describes its status as \\"obscure\\" and appearing to be an \\"unrevised transcription of a folk tale that was well known in slightly different versions throughout the Caucasus\\". Powelstock describes it as \\"what appears to be a transcription, in prose, of a Turkish fairy-tale\\". Together with his later A Hero of Our Time, Ashik Kerib testifies to the substantial part the landscapes and traditions of the Caucasus played in Lermontov's creative consciousness. \\"Ashik Kerib\\" is also part of the 19th-century genre of Russian literature of Caucasus writings (produced at a time when the Russian Empire was engaged in a prolonged drive to acquire the lands south of the Caucasus Mountains).  Synopsis  Kerib, a poor but good-hearted ashik (minstrel) living in the city of Tiflis, is in love with Magul-Megeri, the beautiful daughter of a local rich man. The feeling is mutual, but Magul-Megeri's father would prefer her to marry Kurshudbek, a rather rude but wealthier man who has long has his eye on her. Ashik Kerib makes a deal with her father: he will travel the world for seven years and earn enough wealth to be worthy of Magul- Megeri's hand. If he fails to return or returns with not enough, she will have to marry Kurshudbek. On Ashik Kerib's way out of the city, Kurshudbek meets him on the road and they travel together for a short while, until they reach a river. There is no bridge, so Kurshudbek tells Ashik Kerib to take off his robe and swim across, he would follow close behind. As soon as Ashik Kerib is in the river, though, Kurshudbek steals his robe and rides back to Tiflis, where he goes to the house of Ashik Kerib's mother and tells her that her son has drowned in the river, offering the wet robe as proof. She weeps bitterly, but Magul-Megeri tells her not to believe Kurshudbek, it is all a trick to make her marry him. For her part, Magul-Megeri flatly refuses to marry Kurshudbek before the seven years have gone by. Unaware of the drama unfolding back in Tiflis, Ashik Kerib wanders on, traveling from village to village, singing and playing his saz (Turkic lute) in exchange for food and shelter. Eventually he comes to the city of Khalaf, where he begins playing and singing in a tavern. In Khalaf there is a wealthy pasha who loves music, and many musicians have come to his court hoping for some rewards or gifts, but he is never satisfied with any of them and kicks each one out with no payment whatsoever. But as soon as the townsfolk hear Ashik Kerib, they all urge him to go and play for the pasha, who they say is sure to like him. Ashik Kerib is not entirely convinced, but goes and plays anyway. He sings a song in praise of his beloved Magul-Megeri, and it touches the angry pasha so deeply that he immediately agrees to take on Ashik Kerib into his own house. In the care of the pasha of Khalaf, Ashik Kerib gets very rich. He wears the finest clothes, eats the best food, and lives comfortably and happily, with all he could ever wish for. He stays with the pasha for nearly seven years, and all but forgets his home and his beloved. Meanwhile, back in Tiflis, Magul-Megeri is getting worried. Has her Ashik Kerib forgotten her? Or worse, has he really been killed like Kurshudbek said? She gets an idea, and goes to see the town merchant who is about to leave with the caravanserai. She gives him a golden plate from her home, one that she knows Ashik Kerib will recognize, and instructs him to show it to every man in every town he visits to see who recognizes it. He agrees, and it goes just according to plan: when he reaches Khalaf and is showing the dish around, Ashik Kerib shouts from the crowd that it is his. The merchant recognizes Ashik Kerib as well, and tells him that he'd better hurry up back to Tiflis, because the seven years are almost up and if he does not return in time, she will be given to Kurshudbek. Suddenly remembering everything, Ashik Kerib clutches his head in his hands with shame, and immediately gets on his horse to ride back to Tiflis. But he has only three days before the seven years are up, and it is at least three months to Tiflis. Everything looks hopeless. In despair, Ashik Kerib cries out to the heavens: \\"O mighty Allah! If you don't help me now, then there is nothing left for me on Earth!\\" Then suddenly Ashik Kerib sees in the distance a man on a great white horse. The man calls out to him: \\"What is it you desire?\\" Ashik Kerib miserably replies that he wants to die. \\"Well, get down on the ground then, if that's what you want, and I'll kill you,\\" says the man, but Ashik Kerib hesitates and decides he doesn't really want to die. The man invites Ashik Kerib to follow along behind him, but Ashik Kerib's horse is too slow, so the man lets him sit behind him in the saddle of the great white horse. The man asks him where he needs to go, and Ashik Kerib replies that first of all he needs to make it to the town of Arzrum. So the man instructs Ashik Kerib to close his eyes, and a few seconds later when he opens them he is astonished to see that they are in Arzrum! Ashik Kerib gets curious, and tells the man that he made a mistake, and he really had to be in Kars. So again, he closes his eyes and when he opens them, finds himself in Kars. Now Ashik Kerib is terribly ashamed of himself, throws himself down onto his knees and begs forgiveness from the mysterious man for lying, and tells him that really, he has to be in Tiflis. The man is angry, but agrees to take him finally to Tiflis.

Pete McRae is an American rock guitarist. Born Robert F. McRae, Jr. in Austin, Texas in 1955,http://www.demophonic.com/bio/petemcrae.html McRae and his family moved to California when he was aged ten. Pete graduated from Terra Linda High School, in Marin County, in 1973. He began serious guitar studies with Paul Miller, in Terra Linda, and with Dave Smith, in San Francisco. He went on to study with Jerry Hahn, David Creamer, and Barry Finnerty in the Bay Area. He got his first real performing experience in a Sonoma County band called Synergy (not to be confused with the Larry Fast projects under that name). In the fall of 1976 he migrated to Los Angeles. There he performed in original and cover bands with many soon-to-be illustrious artists and musicians, and early on became a founding member of The Kats. When The Kats big record deal fizzled terribly, McRae took offers to be a \\"guitar-slinger for hire\\", and seemed to be on track for a successful session career. In fact, prior to joining The Kats, he had some national exposure touring and recording with Cory Wells, from Three Dog Night. In 1982, disenchanted by what seemed like 'type-casting' in the work he was getting, McRae sought training and artistic growth in the Music Department at USC. There, he met and worked with Dr. Robert S. Moore, in composition, and with William Kanengiser, in guitar, for a brief period. (Dr. Moore also inspired McRae to take an interest in martial arts training, albeit from a pacifistic, meditative standpoint.) He was very pleased to be on the roster of the great Ted Greene's jazz guitar students, for a time. It was at USC that his interest in Harry Partch and a comprehensive art form including music, dance, drama, poetry, and visual design took hold, and he left school, convinced -perhaps erroneously- that the only meaningful way to continue his studies was outside the academy. From 1984 to 1993 he resumed his \\"guitar-slinging\\" while pursuing his own songwriting, singing, and composition. In the late 1980s he finally tracked down Danlee Mitchell, who set him on the path that led to Kraig Grady, and his mentor Erv Wilson. Mr. Mitchell was kind enough, too, to loan Pete one of Harry Partch's own instruments. From c. 1988 to 1993 Pete performed all over the Los Angeles area with Kraig Grady, playing a purely acoustic music in just intonation. But it seemed like every time Kraig set down to record, Pete went on tour. So it was not until Kraig's fourth CD, The Stolen Stars, that he is actually credited as a performer. In 1993, he returned to the Bay Area, performing and recording with Boris Dig, East Of Eden, Gary Claxton, Brandi Shearer, and Ted Savarese. It was during this period of career questioning that Pete became interested in teaching, inspired by the work of Rudolf Steiner. This led to a broadening and deepening of his interest in literature and language, as well as providing training courses in painting, drawing, sculpture, movement, and speech. In 2000, he went again to Los Angeles, where he renewed his interests in microtonal music and instrument construction, with Kraig Grady. He also worked and trained with some of the technicians he had met as a rock performer, with an eye towards original instrument creations. In 2001, following the death of his father, he moved back to Northern California, where he completed his undergraduate studies, with a degree in Music Education from Sonoma State University. He is currently living and working in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he has recorded and performed with Gina Ferrera, Rented Mule, and Todd Horton's ROMP. He has been known -from his LA days- to have worked with: Roach and the White Boys, Josie Cotton, Billy Rankin, Bobbyzio, The Kat Club, Connie Stevens, Eddie Jobson (Roxy Music; Zappa), Mr. Mister, Peter Kingsbery (Cock Robin), David Baerwald, and Stan Ridgway. He also toured with The Rembrandts, playing Cello and Mandolin and with the Tom Petty tribute band, Petty Theft.  Discography  * L.A.

Faced with racial discrimination after graduating from nursing school, Staupers became an advocate for racial equality in the nursing profession.Carnegie, Mary Elizabeth, The Path We Tread: Blacks in Nursing, 1854-1990, National League of Nursing Press, 1991, p. 95. She also successfully paved the way for African Americans to be accepted in the U.S. military as well as other educational, institutional, and organizational structures. Biography Staupers was born on February 27, 1890, in Barbados, West Indies. In 1903, at the age of thirteen, she emigrated to the United States, Harlem, New York, with her parents, Pauline and Thomas Doyle and received American citizenship in 1917. She attended Freedmen's Hospital School of Nursing in Washington, DC, where she graduated with honors. After graduation, she worked as a private duty nurse. Staupers fought for the inclusion of black nurses in World War II to the Army and Navy as the executive secretary of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses (NACGN). She wrote that \\"Negro nurses recognize that service to their country is a responsibility of citizenship.\\"Hine, Darlene Clark, Black Women in White: Nursing Conflict and Cooperation in the Nursing Profession, 1890 to 1950, Indiana University Press, 1989, p. 174. Staupers became the executive secretary of NACGN, and the main goal of the association was to advance the status of African American nurses, most of whom were barred from nursing schools and professional associations in a number of states. Staupers, along with the president of NACGN, Estelle Masse Riddle, led the struggle of black nurses to win full integration into the American nursing profession. Staupers was a great organizer and an astute political tactician whose focus was social change. One of the major social changes led by Staupers and what she is known for today is playing a crucial role in the desegregation of the military's nursing corps during World War II. She continued fighting for the full inclusion of nurses of all races in the U.S. military, which was granted in January 1945 because at the time the military had a strict 56 black nurse quota to enter the service and it enforced segregated practices for those who were already in the service. Outraged by this, Staupers attacked the hypocrisy of Surgeon General Norman T. Kirk's plan to draft white women as nurses instead of qualified black nurses to meet the shortage of nurses in the military. In 1945, the U.S Army opened its Armed Forces Nurses Corps to all applicants regardless of race. In 1948, the American Nursing Association followed suit and allowed African-American nurses to become members after , Staupers dissolved the NAGCN because she believed the organization had completed its mission. In 1951, the NAACP honored Staupers with the Spingarn Medal in recognition of her efforts on behalf of black women workers. During World War II, Staupers assembled support and fought to stop the usage of quotas in the military.Hine, C. D., Hine, C. W., Harrold, S. (2011), The African-American Odyssey. Upper Saddle River, N J.: Pearson. Quotas were used in the military to restrict the number of black nurses the military hired. While working as a private nurse in Washington and New York, Staupers helped establish the Booker T. Washington Sanatorium. It was the first and one of the few in-patient centers founded to care for African Americans who had tuberculosis, at a time when other hospitals refused black medical experts privileges or staffing positions. Staupers served as Superintendent for the Booker T. Washington Sanatorium from 1920 to 1922. She used her influence and management skills and became executive secretary of the Harlem Committee of the New York Tuberculosis and Health Association, a position she held for twelve years. In December 1935, Staupers attended a gathering of African American women leaders, organized by Mary McLeod Bethune to establish the National Council of Negro Women.

Born in St. George, Utah Territory, to Orin Nelson Woodbury and Ann Cannon, Woodbury served in many capacities in the church on a local level. Some, but not all, LDS Church sources list Woodbury as \\"Acting Presiding Patriarch\\" of the church between 1934 and 1937. However, Woodbury was never sustained to this calling in a general conference of the church and it is unknown whether he was ordained or set apart to serve in this office or calling. It is also unclear whether Woodbury was considered by the church to be a general authority. In 1937, church apostle George F. Richards was officially called and sustained as the Acting Patriarch to the church. After his release, Woodbury served as a local stake patriarch in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The Transalp bikes series feature a liquid-cooled, four-stroke 52¬∞ V-twin engine.  History  The first prototype was built in 1985 as an off-road motorbike with a engine. Further development introduced an increase to and more road-oriented features, notably an improved fairing.  Models  thumb The most usual models are: * The XL600V from 1986 - available in the United States in 1989 * The XL650V from 2000 * The XL700V from 2008 Other versions exist, such as the 400 cc version (ND-06) aimed at the Japanese market. The first version output at 8,000 rpm, increased to for the 1989 and 1990 version. Later models returned to the original 50 hp. From 1991, the rear drum brake was replaced by a disc brake, with a single-piston brake caliper. The appearance was altered in 1994: the original square lights were changed, and a new fairing was introduced. In 1996, new 34 mm carburetors were introduced, and the CDI ignition system was replaced by a microprocessor-driven design. The front brake was modified in 1997, introducing a second disc and reducing the diameter to . The weight of the Transalp increased over time, from for the first models to for the latest version. In 2000, the XL650V Transalp replaced the XL600V, introducing the engine from the Deauville and Honda Revere. The power output increased to at 7,500 rpm, torque increased to at 5,500 rpm. A 4 mm bore diameter increase gave a 64 cc displacement increase. The shock absorbers were redesigned for road use, the exhaust system was updated, the fuel capacity increased by one litre, the control panel was redesigned, and weight diminished by . In 2007, the XL700V Transalp was introduced, with a new 680 cc engine, which was also fitted to the NT700V Deauville, and compatible with Euro 3 emission standards. The front wheel diameter was reduced from 21 inches to 19 inches, the exhaust system was fitted with a catalytic converter, the lights were redesigned, and ABS was introduced. The 2008 model reinforces the road orientation of the Transalp, with larger tyres, lower saddle and more road-oriented shock absorbers. The 2008 XL700V engine is a liquid-cooled, eight-valve, four-stroke, single-overhead cam, 52¬∞ V-twin.

Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century is a United States federal law, signed on 5 April 2000, seeking to improve airline safety. It is popularly called \\"AIR 21,\\" and is also known as Public Law 106-181. Background On 11 September 1991, Continental Express Flight 2574, an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia carrying 14 people, crashed as it was approaching Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, killing all 14 people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that screws had been removed from the horizontal stabilizer during maintenance the night before the accident and, following a shift change, the screws were not replaced. NTSB cited the failure of airline maintenance and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures. The failure of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures was cited as a contributing factor. Some months after, the same airline had a similar incident when a plane was forced to return to the airport after bolts had been removed from a wing panel. NTSB decried that even a fatal accident and an FAA NASIP inspection weren't enough to overcome what appears to have been corporate culture. According to Meshkati (1997), the crash of Continental Express Flight 2574 was the most dramatic turning point for \\"safety culture\\" in the United States. As a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) at that time, Dr. John Lauber suggested that the probable cause of this accident included \\"The failure of Continental Express management to establish a corporate culture which encouraged and enforced adherence to approved maintenance and quality assurance procedures\\" (NTSB/AAR-92/04, 1992, pg. 54, as cited in Meshkati, 1997). As a result of this and other similar aviation accidents, safety culture came to the forefront as the exclusive topic at the U.S. National Summit on Transportation Safety, hosted by the NTSB in 1997. Enactment AIR 21 was known as H.R. 1000 in 106th Congress, second session. Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.) introduced it on 4 March 1999. It was enacted on 5 April 2000. Upon signing the bill into law, President Bill Clinton stated: > This bill contains many new provisions to advance aviation safety. Of > particular note is the inclusion of the \\"Aircraft Safety Act of 1999,\\" which > my Administration proposed to help stop the indefensible practice of > manufacturing, distributing, and installing fraudulently represented, > nonconforming aircraft parts. Several significant provisions to provide > \\"whistleblower\\" protections to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and > air industry employees, to close a potential loophole in the prosecution of > hazardous materials cases, and to combat \\"air rage\\" incidents in flight, > will also address real safety concerns we face today.Statement on Signing > the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century Safety provisions AIR 21 set requirements for safety equipment for specific aircraft, added consumer and employee protection provisions, and imposed new requirements for commercial air tour operations over national parks. Title V established civil penalties for individuals who interfere with or jeopardize the safety of a cabin crew or other passengers. This provision seeks to deter \\"air rage.\\" Section 507 modified the sanction for transporting hazardous materials by removing the requirement that the person have knowledge of the regulation related to the transportation of hazardous materials. However, it permits consideration of lack of knowledge in mitigation of the penalty. This requirement is at 49 U.S.C. 46312. Section 401 of the bill prohibited a state or local government from preventing people associated with disaster counseling services who are not licensed in that state from providing those services for up to 60 days after an aviation accident. Section 402 of the bill would expand a current preemption of state liability laws by limiting the liability of air carriers that provide information concerning flight reservations to the families of passengers involved in airline accidents. Air carriers are already provided immunity from state liability laws for providing passenger lists under these circumstances. Because neither mandate would require state or local governments to expend funds or to change their laws, CBO estimates that any costs associated with these mandates would be insignificant. In Section 725, the act required the Federal Aviation Administration to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for an independent study of the air quality in passenger cabins. Consumer protections Title II sought to improve consumer access in all regions of the United States, including those in small communities and rural and remote areas, to affordable, regularly scheduled air service. Section 221 made it an unfair or deceptive practice for any air carrier, or ticket agent utilizing electronically transmitted tickets for air transportation to fail to notify the purchaser of such a ticket of its expiration date. It did so by amending 49 U.S.C. 41712(b). Section 224 required airlines to file individual customer service plans with the Secretary of Transportation. Title IV made the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) inapplicable to aviation incidents, thereby broadening the circumstances under which relatives can seek compensation for the death of a family member in an aviation incident over the ocean. AIR 21 also includes a legislative advance for air travelers with disabilities. Financial provisions The Congressional Budget Office estimated that AIR 21 would result in additional outlays totaling about $56 billion over the 2000-2004 period. Title I authorized the appropriation of $47.6 billion for FAA operations, facilities, and equipment for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Title I also provided $19.2 billion in contract authority for the FAA's airport improvement program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. It provided an additional $7.1 billion in contract authority for the airport improvement program (AIP) over the 2000-2004 period (above the $2.4 billion a year assumed in the baseline). It allowed airports to charge higher passenger facility fees. AIR 21 took the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) off-budget and exempted AATF spending from the discretionary spending caps, pay-as-you-go procedures, and Congressional budget controls. This provision was a goal of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association which sought to unlock the aviation trust fund. Title VII extended the war risk insurance program and prohibited the FAA from charging fees for certain services. This title provided that, of the amounts appropriated for FAA operations in fiscal year 2000, $2 million may be used to eliminate a backlog of equal employment opportunity complaints at the Department of Transportation (DOT). Employee protections Title VI provided whistleblower protection for employees of air carriers who notify authorities that their employer is violating a federal law relating to air carrier safety. The bill set up a complaint and investigation process within the Department of Labor (DOL). The time limit for employees to make such complaints in writing to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is 90 days from the date of each adverse employment action. Public Availability of Airmen Records Section 715, \\"Public Availability of Airmen Records\\", allows the Federal Aviation Administration to release the names, addresses, and ratings held by nearly all pilots with a medical certificate. This includes the release of information to private businesses, including those not necessarily having any relation to aviation safety (the intent of the bill). The FAA must notify airmen of this clause via mail and notify them that they have 90 days to opt out of the inclusion of their personal information into the public record. If no action is taken within 90 days, then an opt-in is assumed.Airmen Certification: Public Availability of Airmen Records (Federal Aviation Administration) See also * Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association * Whistleblower * Airport and Airway Trust Fund * Wendell Ford References Meshkati, N.

It was established in 2001 to monitor patient safety incidents, including medication and prescribing error reporting, in the NHS. Since 1 April 2005 it had also overseen safety aspects of hospital design and cleanliness, as well as food (transferred from NHS Estates). This extended its remit to include safety in medical research, through the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC). Between 2005 and April 2012 it hosted the National Clinical Assessment Service that aims to help in resolving concerns about the performance of individual doctors and dentists. Finally, it also managed the contracts with the three confidential enquiries:National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death; Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK; National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness. This responsibility was transferred from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. As well as making sure that incidents are reported in the first place, the NPSA aimed \\"to promote an open and fair culture in hospitals and across the health service, encouraging doctors and other staff to report incidents and 'near misses'.\\" In various publications it encouraged the creation of a \\"no-blame culture\\" to encourage staff to report incidents without fear of personal reprimand and know that by sharing their experiences others will be able to learn lessons and improve patient safety. Where a trend emerges relating to incidents then it issued reports, recommendations and guidance to avoid repetition. The NPSA developed a National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) to collect and analyse information from staff and patients, as well as incorporating information from other sources. From 2005 it was possible for staff to submit information through web-based forms, although the roll out of the system took two years longer than originally envisaged. The last chief executive of the NPSA was Martin Fletcher. The chair was Philip Hunt, Baron Hunt of Kings Heath. On 1 June 2012, the key functions of the NPSA were transferred to the NHS Commissioning Board Special Health Authority., later known as NHS England. In April 2016, the patient safety function was transferred from NHS England to the newly established NHS Improvement. From 1 April 2019, NHS England and NHS Improvement are working together as a new single organisation to better support the NHS to deliver improved care for patients.

The film is based on the semi-hit 1927 stage musical of the same name (music composed by Emmerich K√°lm√°n and Herbert Stothart, book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach.) Plot The story takes place in colonial Africa, where Dawn is a white girl, kidnapped in infancy and is being brought up by a black native, Mooda, who runs a canteen in the now German colonial settlement. Dawn falls in love with a British rubber planter, Tom Allen, who is now a prisoner of war. The native black leader of the tribes in that region is also in love with Dawn and becomes extremely jealous when he hears of Dawn's love for Allen, who, in turn, is sent back to Britain by the Germans for attempting to steal Dawn, whom they believe is half black. Eventually, the British regain control of the territory and drive out the Germans. Allen returns to the colony. When the settlement experiences a drought, the local tribal leader attempts to incite the natives against Dawn, claiming God is angry because Dawn has dared to love a white man. Allen is unable to save Dawn because the colonial authorities refuse to act unless they have proof that Dawn is one hundred percent white. Eventually Dawn's \\"mother\\" (Mooda) confesses that she is not Dawn's true mother and that Dawn's real mother was white which Dawn's father confirms. Allen quickly brings British troops just as the natives are about to sacrifice Dawn. During the ceremony however, one of the virgin priestesses reveals that the jealous tribal leader has been lying about Dawn and that God is not interested in Dawn as she is pure white. Furthermore she reveals that the tribal leader had violated her (the priestess's) chastity and claims the true reason for God's anger was this sacrilegious act. The tribal leader is deposed and sacrificed to the anger of the natives and the drought quickly ends as rain pours down. In the end, Dawn and Allen, happily reunited, sail back to England together.

State Route 741 (SR 741) is a north-south state highway in the southwest portion of the U.S. state of Ohio. The southern terminus of the route is at a diamond interchange with I-71 at its Exit 25 near Kings Mills, adjacent to the Kings Island Amusement Park. State Route 741‚Äôs northern terminus is at a partial interchange with I-75 at its Exit 50B in Moraine, just south of Dayton. Created in the late 1930s, State Route 741 passes through the counties of Warren and Montgomery. The portion of State Route 741 in Montgomery County is also called Springboro Pike. Route description State Route 741's routing takes it through Warren and Montgomery Counties. No portion of the state route is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History When it was formed in 1938, State Route 741 was originally routed from its junction with U.S. Route 42 near Mason to its intersection with the former U.S. Route 25 (now Dixie Drive) near West Carrollton. By 1971, State Route 741 was extended north along Springboro Pike from Dixie Drive up to its current northern terminus at Interstate 75 in Moraine. In 1985, the highway would be lengthened again, this time on the south end. From U.S. Route 42, State Route 741 was extended south and east to Exit 25 off of I-71 near Kings Mills, which marks the route's present-day southern terminus. On June 4, 2010, a continuous-flow intersection (CFI), the first of its kind in Ohio, was built at SR 741 and Austin Boulevard (the former Miamisburg-Springboro Pike/Austin Pike) in southern Montgomery County. The intersection was built in conjunction with the addition of a nearby interchange between I-75 and Austin Boulevard. By 2012, congestion at the new intersection had led to calls for improvements. It is a matter of dispute whether the problems were caused by faulty traffic projections, too much development around the interchange or the fact that a \\"two leg\\" CFI was built, rather than a full \\"four leg\\" CFI. There are some suggestions that a full CFI was not built in order to allow land which would have been used for right-of-way to instead be retained by developers. As of early 2012, the solution to the traffic problems was also a matter of debate.

(2014). Planorbarius corneus (Linnaeus, 1758). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=819958 on 2014-11-06 The shell of this species appears to be dextral in coiling, even though it is in fact sinistral or left-handed. Distribution Planorbarius corneus is distributed from western Europe, through central Europe and into the Caucasus, north into Siberia and south into the Middle East. In western Europe, it has been recorded in Belgium, France and the British Isles (including Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey). It is not found in Spain, but it has been recorded on some Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic islands, including Madeira, the Azores, the Canary Islands. In the Nordic countries, it has been recorded in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Its range extends through central Europe (including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Lichtenstein, Switzerland and the Czech Republic) into southern Europe (where it has been recorded in Greece and Italy) and eastern Europe and the Caucasus (including Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Ukraine). The species is also found in western Asia, having been recorded in Kazakhstan, Iran, western regions of Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Additionally, as the species is sometimes sold in the aquarium trade, it is also found outside of its main range in small ponds where they have been released or placed. Description All species within family Planorbidae have sinistral shells. Planorbarius corneus is the largest European species of ramshorn snail (family Planorbidae), with a shell typically measuring across when fully-grown. The coiled shell has between 3 and 4.5 rounded whorls with deep sutures, the last whorl predominating. The upper side is weakly depressed and the lower side is deeply depressed (flattened on the underside but spire recessed on the upper side). There is no keel. The shell is light yellowish with a brown, reddish or greenish periostracum, radially and spirally weakly striated. The aperture is wide and almost circular. The animal is brown or reddish. Habitat This large planorbid is found in water which is still, or only moving slowly, where there is a good growth of many different kinds of pond weeds, and where there are high levels of calcium dissolved in the water.Janus, Horst, 1965. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe young specialist looks at land and freshwater molluscs‚Äô‚Äô, Burke, London P. corneus under high temperatures has been studied by Kartavykh & Podkovkin (2002).

Apart from being a world-renowned theatre artist, Lai is also an award-winning filmmaker, and a practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism and has translated multiple books on the subject. Life Lai was born on 25 October 1954 in Washington D.C., where his father was serving in the Republic of China's Embassy. He returned to Taiwan with his mother in 1966. Lai studied English literature at Fu Jen Catholic University and graduated in 1976. In 1978, Lai married Ding Nai-chu (‰∏Å‰πÉÁ´∫). After the marriage, the couple went to the US for further studies. The couple have two daughters: Stephanie, an actress, and Celeste Lai, a New York- based animator. Lai received his Ph.D. in Dramatic Art from University of California, Berkeley in 1983. After his return to Taiwan, Lai taught and served as Dean of School of Theatre Arts at Taipei National University of the Arts.

Lai became the Artistic Director while Ding served as the Managing Director. Their work has revitalized theatre in Taiwan and continually pioneered new horizons in modern Chinese theatre. Since its founding in 1984, Performance Workshop has produced more than 40 of Lai's theatrical works and collaborations, including iconic pieces such as Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land, The Village, A Dream Like a Dream, and AGO. In 2006 and 2007, Lai taught at Stanford University as Visiting Professor and Resident Artist for the I.D.A. program. In 2013 he lectured at Berkeley as Avenali Fellow and Artist in Residence. In 2019 he taught at Berkeley as Artist-in-Residence. A prolific author of 40 original performed plays to date, Lai was also commissioned by the government of the Republic of China to work on a number of large-scale events in Taiwan. In 2009 Lai was Creative Director of the acclaimed Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the International Deaflympics Games in Taipei. In 2010, Lai worked as Creative Director for the Gala in Celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China.

China's prominent literary critic Yu Qiuyu says that Lai's work ‚Äúalways has the ability to touch the heartstrings of countless audiences.‚Äù Lai's most famous works includes That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk (1985), which revived the dying art of \\"Crosstalk\\" in Taiwan; The Village (2008), described by the China Times as \\"a collectible treasure for our generation\\" and by the Beijing News as \\"The pinnacle of our era of theatre\\";„Äà‰∏ÄÂÄãÊôÇ‰ª£ÁöÑÁèçËóè„ÄâÔºå‰∏≠ÂúãÊôÇÂ†±Ôºå2008-12-08 the 8 hour epic A Dream Like A Dream (2000), described by prominent theatre critic Raymond Zhou as \\"a major milestone in Chinese theater, possibly the greatest Chinese-language play since time immemorial\\";Cosmic Dream Drama and perhaps his best known play Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land (1986), described by the New York Times as \\"may be the most popular contemporary play in China‚Ä¶by the end, the audience is left to contemplate the burdens of memory, history, longing, love and the power of theater itself.\\"Acclaim in China for tried and true 'Secret Love in Peach Blossom Land' Unauthorized productions of the play in China alone number over an astounding 1,000 performances. In 2007, Lai directed his own English translation of the play at Stanford University. Lai's ‚Äúcrosstalk‚Äù (xiangsheng) plays, starting with the groundbreaking That Evening, We Performed Crosstalk (1985) have virtually forged a new theatrical genre. These hugely popular works have resuscitated the dying traditional performing art form of Xiangsheng. His epic 8 hour A Dream Like A Dream (2000), which has been compared to Peter Brook's Mahabharata, ‚Äúmay be the most cosmic piece of theater in the Chinese-language canon,\\"Cosmic Dream Drama revealing Buddhist and universal themes of suffering and recurring life cycles in a unique performance format devised by Lai that places the audience in the center of the space, with performance surrounding audience. Lai remains a significant cultural bridge between Taiwan and China, and his influence on contemporary Chinese culture continues to grow. Aside from his creative bases in Shanghai and Taipei, Lai has been commissioned to create new works in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Beijing. In 2009 Lai was also chief director of the Deaflympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies held in Taipei, which received high acclaim for their aesthetic beauty and representation of the deaf spirit. The Far Eastern Economic Review describes his work as \\"the most exciting theatre in the Chinese-speaking world.\\"Acts of Defiance, Lincoln Kaye, Far Eastern Economic Review, 1990-07-26 Newsweek calls it \\"the most recent piece of evidence that Taiwan is creating the boldest Chinese art in Asia today.\\"A New Model Monkey King, Newsweek,1988-2-29 International Herald Tribune says \\"His work is never one dimensional or linear, there are always layers to it.\\" Preserving Taiwan‚Äôs Collective Memory, New York Times, 2009-02-13 In 2013, Lai served as the Artistic Director of the Inaugural Wuzhen Theatre Festival in the scenic water town of Wuzhen, China. A Dream Like A Dream opened the festival. Lai's main tool for playwriting is his use of improvisation in collaboration with the actors, which include many of the most respected names of the time. This is a method he learned from his mentor Shireen Strooker of the Amsterdam Werkteater, and he is one of the world's foremost exponents of using improvisation as a creative tool. His 40 plays are widely varied in style and reflect on the individuality of each project he undertakes, as well as the uniqueness of each cast he works with. Lai has also written and directed two widely acclaimed feature films, The Peach Blossom Land (1992) and The Red Lotus Society (1994). The former received top prizes at the Berlin, Tokyo, and Singapore international film festivals. His improvisational experiment in television, All In the Family are Humans (1995‚Äì97), was a surprising alternative hit on Taiwan TV and ran for 600 episodes. Lai occasionally directs the works of others, including the Chinese language premiere of Angels in America, Part I, which he translated. He has also directed innovative versions of Western classics, including an evening of Samuel Beckett plays in an ancient Chinese garden environment, Mozart‚Äôs operas Don Giovanni, Cosi fan tutte and The Marriage of Figaro, all set in Chinese backgrounds, in collaboration with Taiwan's National Symphony Orchestra. In 2007, Lai became a best-selling author in Taiwan and China with his book on creativity called Stan Lai On Creativity (Chinese Pinyin: Lai Shengchuan de Chuangyixue), based on a course on Creativity he taught at Stanford University. This book has gained a reputation in business as well as artistic readers as a unique take on how one can train in creativity. His plays have been published in numerous Chinese editions in both Taiwan and China, as well as in English versions from Oxford and Columbia University Press. In 2011 Lai embarked on a book tour with his Stan Lai On Theatre, sharing his experience as a playwright/director for the past three decades. A collection of nine major Lai plays was published in Chinese by CITIC Press Group in 2019.

Shell description The minute shell is nearly planispiral in its coiling, but the spire is actually considerably sunken rather than raised (which is usually the case with gastropods). The shell has regular transverse ridges which form points extending beyond the main curve of the periphery of the shell. The shell color is a translucent yellowy-brown. The maximum shell dimension is about 3 mm. Ecology This snail lives on water plants in clear still freshwater. In Ireland it is common in medium to very small habitats including slow streams, drains and marsh and fen pools It is occasionally found in very acid waters. This minute species, although technically a pulmonate gastropod, does not use air for respiration but instead absorbs oxygen through its mantle cavity which is full of water.

It is the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop of Homs and Hama. The present structure dates from the mid-nineteenth century, but the site over which the church is built is claimed to have been one of Christian worship since 59 AD. According to Ross Burns, the church may rest on Byzantine foundations. According to Joseph Nasrallah, the existence of a church dedicated to Mary in Homs is attested as early as 478. The church contains a venerated Holy Girdle that is supposed to be a section of the belt of Mary, mother of Jesus. The church was damaged during confrontations between the armed opposition and the security forces in the 2011‚Äì2012 Syrian unrest.

History Postwar logo of SG Sch√∂neiche ca. 1950. The earliest predecessor of today's association was the gymnastics club MTV Germania Kleinsch√∂nbeck Sch√∂neiche founded in 1894. In the aftermath of World War II occupying Allied authorities disbanded organizations across the country, including sports and football associations. Germania was re- established as SG Sch√∂neiche and became part of the separate East German football competition that emerged in the Soviet-occupied part of the country. As was common in East Germany through the 1950s and 1960s the team underwent several name changes, playing as BSG Lokomotive Sch√∂neiche, BSG Motor Friedrichshagen, BSG Motor Ostend, BSG Empor K√∂penick, TSG Sch√∂neiche. Before German re-unification the club was known as BSG ZBE Landbau Sch√∂neiche. The footballers did not enjoy any real success, with their play being limited to district league competition. After reunification in 1990 the club was re- christened SV Germania Sch√∂neiche and in the mid-90s the footballers began to show signs of improvement beginning with an advance out of the Berzirksliga Brandenburg (VII) into the Landesliga Brandenburg/Nord (VI) in 1997. Two years later they won promotion to the Verbandsliga Brandenburg (VI) where they would compete for the next seven years until capturing the division title in 2006 and moving up to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (V). Sch√∂neiche captured the Brandenburg Pokal (Brandenburg Cup) in 2004 and subsequently took part in the opening round of the 2004‚Äì05 German Cup competition going out 1:2 to 2. Bundesliga club 1860 Munich. In 2009 Sch√∂neiche again reached the final, but lost the match in their own stadium against SV Babelsberg 03 with 0‚Äì1. After six seasons in the Oberliga the club withdrew in 2012 despite finishing sixth in the league and played in the Brandenburg-Liga again.

It is situated off ash-Shouhada street, adjacent to the city's historical roofed souqs (\\"markets\\"). History Originally, under the Roman Empire, the Great Mosque was the site of the city's pagan temple for the sun god (\\"El-Gabal\\"). The temple gained Emesa (Homs) prominence in the region as an important center of paganism and one of its priests, Elagabalus, became Emperor of Rome. El-Gabal's temple was paid tribute by Aurelian after he attributed his victory of Zenobia to the deity.Mannheim, 2001, pp.205-206. Later during the Byzantine phase of the Empire, the temple was converted into a church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist during the reign of Theodosius I as part of Christian persecution of paganism. After the city was conquered by the Muslims, one-fourth or half of the church was transformed into the Friday Mosque (Jama'a Masjid) of Homs. According to numerous Muslim geographers who visited the city throughout the centuries of Islamic rule, a talisman made of white stone stood over the gate of the mosque facing the church. It depicted an image of a man whose lower body was that of a scorpion, and local tradition claimed that if a man was stung by a scorpion, he should take clay, press it on the image, then dissolve the clay in water and drink it. Afterward, pain from the sting would cease and he would quickly recover.le Strange, 1890, pp.353-357. In 1154, Muslim geographer al-Idrisi wrote that the mosque was \\"one of the largest of all the cities of Syria\\".le Strange, 1890, p.355. During the reign of Nur ad-Din the Zengid sultan, between 1146 and 1174, much of the modern structure was built and thus the name \\"al-Nuri\\" was attributed to him. The Great Mosque has since undergone extensive modifications over the centuries. Architecture The body structure of the Great Mosque of al-Nuri is large and rectangular and inside the mosque is courtyard of the same shape. The courtyard includes a raised terrace along the wall, possibly representing a part of the podium on which the cella of the pagan temple would have stood. Other independent structures in the courtyard include a heavily decorated basalt basin, perhaps being an old sarcophagus. Columns with Corinthian capitals line the wall, some of which are clearly of Roman origin. The mihrab (\\"pulpit\\") of the mosque contains remnants of mosaics in its arch. The main entrance to the mosque is arched, decorated with black and white stone, and carved with Arabic inscriptions on either side. References Bibliography .

It attempted to influence the outcome of a number of papal conclaves. History The papal conclave of 1644 to elect Pope Urban VIII's successor had been a matter of divided loyalties. Many of the cardinals created by Pope Urban VIII had formed a faction loyal to the Kingdom of France, controlled by Urban's Cardinal-Nephew, Antonio Barberini. Others had formed a faction loyal to the Kingdom of Spain. French envoy Cardinal Mazarin had not arrived in time to exercise France's jus exclusivae and Innocent, an ally of Spain, was elected. At the death of Pope Innocent X, the College of Cardinals came together for the papal conclave of 1655. While Pope Urban's Barberini nephews and supporters still pushed for Giulio Cesare Sacchetti to be elected, Innocent had created a large number of cardinals; some with loyalties to Spain, others with no loyalty to any particular monarchy. Many of these cardinals refused to support the Barberini. Making matters worse, Urban's reign (only 11 years earlier) had been famous for its rampant nepotism, much of which had benefited those same nephews. Innocent's reign had been little better and so cardinals were inclined to elect a pope who would bring repute back to the papacy. At the same time, Innocent's third and final Cardinal- Nephew, Camillo Astalli, had fallen into disrepute. Though he remained a Cardinal and would participate in the conclave, he did not control the College in the same way as the Barberini had tried to control the previous conclave. History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (2009, Wellesley College Library) And so the conclave of 1655 began with the Spanish still opposed to Sacchetti, the French still opposed to anyone nominated by those loyal to Spain and no-one to control the cardinals. As a result, the cardinals entered the conclave with an unprecedented level of independence. A group of cardinals, led by Cardinal Decio Azzolino, began to further the view within the College that it was time for a pope who would lead the Catholic Church away from the nepotism which had caused the Church considerable suffering over the preceding decades. Azzolino was also the representative of the very-much-in-fashion Christina, Queen of Sweden.Church Politics in Seventeenth-Century Rome: Cardinal Decio Azzolino, Queen Christina of Sweden, and the Squadrone Volante - Acta Universitatis Stockholmiensis: Stockholm Studies in History by Marie-Louise Rod√©n, 2000, The group called themselves the Flying Squad; Squadrone Volante. Conclave of 1655 The conclave of 1655 was straightforward enough ‚Äì the cardinals wanted an end to nepotism and the Squadrone could provide exactly that. Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni (later elected Pope Alexander VIII) is said to have exclaimed, \\"this time we must seek an honest man!\\". Azzolino gave his reply; \\"If you want an honest man, there stands one\\" and pointed to Cardinal Fabio Chigi. With no better a suggestion to be found, the College elected Chigi who took the papal throne as Pope Alexander VII.Note: Though this also required Olimpia Maidalchini to be convinced ‚Äì a group of older cardinals, perhaps including her long-time ally Azzolino, convinced her that Chigi presented a better option than a group of bored, younger cardinals looking to cause trouble (who might become bored enough to vote for anyone in protest). Conclave of 1667 Still protected by Christina of Sweden and led by her now-favouriteNote: Likely also her lover. Azzolino, the Squadrone continued to operate during Pope Alexander's reign and remained highly involved in European politics in the second half of the 17th century. In 1667, Alexander died and the College of Cardinals again convened for the papal conclave of 1667. By then, the Squadrone had developed a good working relationship with those cardinals who remained loyal to the French. While still independent, the Squadrone engineered the nomination by the French of Giulio Rospigliosi who was acceptable to the leader of the Spanish faction, Cardinal Ernst von Harrach. Rospigliosi was elected and took the throne as Pope Clement IX. Adding further credence to the alleged involvement of the Squadrone, Rospigliosi, who was Cardinal Secretary of State, resigned the post and appointed Cardinal Azzolino as his replacement on the very night he was elected.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) See also *Roman Curia Further reading *Journal of the Swedish embassy in the years 1653 - 1654.

Founded in 1894 as a free kindergarten for the children of indigent immigrants and as one of the first settlement houses in the nation, Lenox Hill Neighborhood House is the oldest and largest provider of social, legal and educational services on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Each year, they assist thousands of individuals and families who range in age from 3 to 103, represent dozens of races, ethnicities and countries of origin and \\"live, work, go to school or access services\\" on the East Side from 14th Street to 143rd Street and on Roosevelt Island. Their clients include indigent families and the working poor who live in the East Side's housing projects and tenements or who travel to the Upper East Side to work in low-wage jobs such as cashiers, housekeepers, nannies and laborers; 10,000 seniors; and hundreds of mentally ill homeless and formerly homeless adults. They have five locations between 54th and 102nd Streets, offer programs at dozens of East Side locations; their headquarters is located on East 70th Street. The Neighborhood House has served the community for 126 years and has eight departments (Adult Education, Children and Family Services, Fitness & Aquatics, Food Services, Homeless and Housing Services, Legal Advocacy, Older Adult Services and Visual and Performing Arts), more than 20 different programs, nearly 200 staff and over 1,100 regular volunteers. Their mission is to help those in need who live, work, or go to school on Manhattan's East Side and to improve the quality of life for all individuals and families in their community. They define need broadly to include economic, social, emotional, and physical need, but give priority to those in economic need. Foundation The Neighborhood House was founded in 1894 as a free kindergarten for the children of immigrants living and working on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. As the community has grown and diversified over the last 125 years, so has the Neighborhood House. It has long been a center of community activism and leadership, addressing such issues as affordable housing, poor working conditions, health care, hunger, childcare, poverty, unemployment, homelessness, juvenile delinquency, crime prevention, and long-term care for older adults. In addition to creating New York City's first tenants' rights group, the Neighborhood House helped organize New York City's first \\"Meals on Wheels\\" program, first government- funded social adult day care program, and helped create a continuum of care for homeless people in New York City. The Neighborhood House was profiled as ‚ÄúAgency of the Month‚Äù by the New York Nonprofit Press.New York Nonprofit Press Programs =Adult education= The Neighborhood House offers classes in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). =Children and family services= The Early Childhood Center is a year-round program that ensures that children can attend the Neighborhood House from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., five days a week, 12 months a year. Their rich curriculum includes computers, field trips, art and music activities, outdoor play and swimming. In 2012, the Early Childhood Center was re-accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. The RealArts After School Program serves more than 150 low-income children (ages 5 through 13) throughout the academic year, operating from 3 p.m. ‚Äì 6 p.m. and on full days during school holidays. With a strong emphasis on arts education and aquatics, RealArts offers age appropriate activities in dance, drama, music, visual art and swimming. During the summer months, the program transforms into the RealArts Summer Camp. =Fitness and aquatics= The Neighborhood House operates a Fitness and Aquatics Center. Memberships are available to community members. Swimming instruction is part of the curriculum for all pre-school and school-age children. Their gym is a neighborhood resource: a number of special fitness activities are targeted at older adults, and the gym is used by several neighborhood schools. =Food services= Their Food Services staff prepare and serve more than 350,000 meals a year to older adults, children and homeless and formerly homeless adults. The Lenox Hill Neighborhood House Community Supported Agriculture program began in 2009. CSAs are partnerships between regional farmers and consumers to get fresh produce directly from the farms into NYC communities. The Lenox Hill Neighborhood House CSA has partnered with GrowNYC again for the 2019 season, which runs from June through early November. =Homeless and housing services= Through the Homeless and Housing Services Department, the Neighborhood House provides a comprehensive network of programs and services to homeless and formerly homeless men and women each year to help them gain independence and stability. The Department provides support to more than 500 homeless men and women each year who are homeless, formerly homeless, or threatened with eviction and life on the streets. The Department's programs include: an 80-bed women's mental health shelter serving women age 45 and over who are mentally ill; a supportive housing residence with apartments for 54 formerly homeless adults who are mentally ill; and the East Side Homeless Network (a collaboration with two other New York City non-profits, Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, and Yorkville Common Pantry) which coordinates services from outreach to transitional housing to employment for homeless men and women. =Legal advocacy= The Legal Advocacy Department provides direct legal assistance and representation to hundreds of Neighborhood House clients in multiple legal areas including housing, family law, government benefits and health insurance and integrates civil legal representation and education into the continuum of services and care for all clients in need. This integration of general legal services into social service and educational programs is the first of its kind in a New York City community-based, multi-service organization. The Legal Department utilizes a model multidisciplinary approach with lawyers, social workers, educators and advocates working together to meet the diverse legal and social service needs of clients. The Department consists of five attorneys and two non-attorney advocates. The Department also works with several pro bono attorneys (including members of the Neighborhood House's Board of Directors) and law school interns. =Older adult services= The Neighborhood House's Older Adult Services Department serves more than 10,000 seniors throughout Manhattan each year. The majority of these older adults are low- income individuals on fixed incomes. =Visual and performing arts= The Visual and Performing Arts Department integrates arts instruction including visual art, creative movement, music and drama and performance into most of the Neighborhood House's programs. =Volunteer program= Lenox Hill Neighborhood House has over 1,100 active volunteers who provide support to their programs and operations.

He was Lord Provost of Glasgow and Member of Parliament. Life Kirkman Finlay was born in the Gallowgate, the second son of well known Glasgow merchant and textile manufacturer James Finlay (1727‚Äì1790). Upon his father's death in 1790 he became head of James Finlay & Company, manufacturers and East India merchants. He made strenuous efforts to capture lucrative Asian markets, successfully challenging the supremacy of the British East India Company in trade with India and the Far East. Under his leadership the business expanded, moving into cotton manufacturing with the purchase of the Ballindalloch Works in 1798, the Catrine Mills in 1801 and the Deanston Mills in 1806.. They became the largest textile concern in Scotland and the first British merchant to trade directly with India (1816).Kirkman Finlay. University of Glasgow (see \\"Summary\\" for birth/death dates) Whilst developing James Finlay & Co. into the leading merchant firm of its time he also led a very active public life. He was Governor of the Forth and Clyde Navigation, President of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce eight times, Dean of Guild, Lord Provost of Glasgow (1812), Member of Parliament (1812‚Äì1820). A marble statue by John Gibson (1790‚Äì1866) is in the vestibule of the Merchants' House on George Square. His opinions, especially on mercantile questions, were listened to when he was in the House of Commons, and quoted there when he had left it; always a busy man, he still found time for much public and charitable work ‚Äì he was a liberal and a kindly man, and his word was as good as his bond. Described as \\"a political economist of an advanced type\\", his knowledge of banking was considerable. He was an extraordinary director of The Royal Bank of Scotland from 1821 until his death in 1842, and made his presence felt in many matters of importance in Scotland at that time. He was part of the abortive scheme to raise a joint-stock bank in Glasgow around 1793, he agitated for the retention of the Scottish one pound note in 1826 (appearing before the House of Commons Committee on Promissory notes in Scotland and Ireland), and was also active in opposing the changes to factory conditions in 1833. Finlay's financial success demonstrated the central importance of cotton textiles in Glasgow's domestic economy and he deserves a place on the roll of those who have helped to make Glasgow. Statue in the Merchants' House, Glasgow He built Castle Toward on the Cowal peninsula as his country home. Finlay was educated at the Glasgow Grammar School and briefly studied at the University of Glasgow and was elected its Rector in 1819. In 1820, unfounded rumours spread around the university that he was building up a motion to disallow student voting at rectorial elections. In the resulting student campaign Finlay was defeated in the re-election by Francis Jeffrey. He however later served as Dean of Faculties between 1839 and 1840. Finlay's nephew George Finlay was a noted historian and philhellene.

The structures stand on wood or reinforced concrete pilings, generally ten feet above the shallow water, which varies from one to three feet deep at low tide. History Most sources claim the first stilt shack was built in the early 1930s, but some Dade County historians say that there were a dozen shacks in \\"the flats\\" as early as 1922. =Crawfish Eddie= \\"Crawfish\\" Eddie Walker built a shack on stilts above the water in 1933, toward the end of the prohibition era, allegedly to facilitate gambling, which was legal at one mile offshore. Crawfish Eddie sold bait and beer from his shack and was known for a dish he called chilau, a crawfish chowder made with crawfish he caught under his shack. Thomas Grady and Leo Edward, two of Eddie's fishing buddies, built their own shack in 1937. Shipwrecking and channel dredging brought many people to the area and more shacks were constructed, some by boating and fishing clubs. Local newspapers called the area \\"the shacks\\" and \\"shack colony\\".

When it opened in November, membership cost $150 by invitation only and the club became one of the most popular spots in Miami. The club's popularity grew after an article about the club appeared in Life magazine on February 10, 1941. The article noted that this was an \\"extraordinary American community dedicated solely to sunlight, salt water and the well-being of the human spirit.\\" The club was described as \\"a $100,000 play-palace equipped with bar, lounge, bridge deck, dining room and dock slips for yachts\\".Life Magazine: February 10, 1941-FISHERMEN GET AWAY FROM IT ALL AT A CLUB KNEE-DEEP IN BISCAYNE BAY The local newspapers began running stories and photographs of parties with celebrities. The Quarterdeck Club was viewed by tourists as a \\"must see\\" attraction at Miami Beach, Florida. Rumors of gambling persisted, and the club was raided in 1949, but no evidence of gambling was found. Hotelman Warren Freeman purchased the club in 1950 and envisioned it as a high-class operation. The structure was renovated and expanded, only to be heavily damaged by Hurricane King late in the season. Dejected and broke, Freeman sold what remained. The club was rebuilt, but never regained the popularity of its early years. Hurricane Donna in 1960 damaged most of the structures in Stiltsville, including the Quarterdeck Club, then the building was completely destroyed by a fire in 1961 that burned all the way to the pilings.

These three houses, as well as the Ellenburg house, were among the seven buildings included in the 2003 Stiltsville Trust. Nearly all of the structures included full wrap-around porches.

Their town hall is a floating Bikini Club that swings both day and night.\\"Argosy Magazine: May, 1967-Bikinis on Stilts by Ward Kennedy By the time the story was published, the Bikini Club had been gone for over a year. =Radio tower= AM radio station WRIZ constructed radio towers in Stiltsville in 1967, on the south side of the Biscayne Channel. It became radio station WRHC in 1985, and used the Stiltsville towers for daytime broadcasting at 10,000 watts on 1550kHz, until the site was decommissioned in approximately 1990. Because salt water is highly conductive, it makes an excellent ground plane for signals in the mediumwave radio band, which allowed the station a greater broadcast range on the same power. Regulation Stiltsville's frontier era ended with Hurricane Betsy in 1965. Beginning in August 1965, the state of Florida required building owners to pay $100 annually to lease their quarter-acre circular \\"campsites.\\" No permits for new construction were issued, and structures that sustained more than 50-percent damage could not be rebuilt. Building codes were implemented and the state banned commercial operations after 1969. =Lease renewals= In 1976, the state renewed leases for $300 annually but included an expiration date of July 1, 1999. A clause in the lease stated that structures remaining after that date would be removed at the owner's expense. Congress expanded the Biscayne National Park boundaries in June 1980, bringing the area containing Stiltsville within the park. The state of Florida deeded the submerged lands in the expansion area to the United States in 1985. The Park Service agreed to honor the terms of the existing leases, so nothing really changed. At the beginning of 1992, there were 14 \\"campsites\\" with structures present at Stiltsville. After Hurricane Andrew struck on August 24, 1992, only seven buildings survived and were still standing by July 1, 1999. =Deadline for lease renewals= As the lease termination date approached, the leaseholders requested renewals. In the mid-1990s, the park service told leaseholders it lacked the authority to renew leases and suggested they pursue a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Several preservation groups took up the cause, but Stiltsville twice failed to earn National Register status, primarily because the surviving houses weren't 50 years old. Dr. Paul George, historian for the Historical Museum of Southern Florida, explained the significance of Stiltsville thus: \\"It really is an only-in-Miami kind of thing. It had an aura, a rascally mischievous past. But it was also just a place people could go to enjoy getting away. It would be a terrible loss.\\" Life magazine featured another article on Stiltsville, 57 years after the original. The November 1998 issue included an article entitled, \\"Stiltsville: The residents of a fading Florida community make a stand to save it.\\" Jason Fulford was credited for the photography.Life Magazine: November, 1998-Stiltsville: The residents of a fading Florida community make a stand to save it by Jason Fulford =Petition= In a last-ditch effort, a petition drive was started: The response from the community was overwhelming. More than 75,000 people asked that Stiltsville be spared, and the park service reversed their decision. In August 2000, the Park Service announced the approval of a Stiltsville amendment to the 1983 General Management Plan for Biscayne National Park. Under the revised plan, the houses would not be demolished and the existing leases would be extended while a preservation plan was developed. Stiltsville Trust In 2003, a non-profit organization called the Stiltsville Trust was established and included the seven remaining leaseholders, called caretakers, and eight members of the community. In addition to raising funds, their goal was to preserve and rehabilitate the structures to help showcase the park's marine resources with support for educational and interpretive services. Possible uses included community meeting space, a visitor center, research facilities, an artist in residence program and a satellite National Park Service office in the northern part of the park. The park service added hurricane strapping to protect the structures from wind damage in major storms. Caretakers still perform basic maintenance on their former weekend retreats, but the Stiltsville buildings are owned by the National Park Service and have been secured and posted with \\"no trespassing\\" signs. Access to the buildings by non-trust members is by permission of the park's superintendent. The Park Service hopes the Stiltsville Trust will alleviate one of Biscayne National Park's problems: the facility is 95-percent water and essentially inaccessible to non-boaters. According to park superintendent Linda Canzanelli, > \\"A lot of people hear about Biscayne National Park because of Stiltsville. > It can be a wonderful educational tool if we can get people out there so we > can talk about the local history and marine environment.\\" Stiltsville area of Biscayne National Park =Seven remaining houses= A - Jimmy Ellenburg House B - A-Frame House C - Baldwin, Sessions & Shaw House D - Leshaw House E - Bay Chateau F - Hicks House G - Miami Springs Power Boat Club Popular culture Stiltsville has been the setting for scenes in numerous media works, such as: ;Films The made-for-TV movie The Fantastic Seven (1979), and the films Around the World Under the Sea (1966); The Fantastic Seven (1979), Absence of Malice (1981), and Bad Boys II (2003) ;Games Stiltsville is depicted in the video games Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002), in the fictional city based on Miami called \\"Vice City\\", and in Driv3r (2004), which features Miami as one of the settings. ;Literature Les Standiford's novel, Done Deal; three Carl Hiaasen novels: Skin Tight, Stormy Weather, and Skinny Dip; A J Stewart's novel, Crash Tack; Susanna Daniel's novels, Stiltsville: a Novel and Sea Creatures. ;Television Stiltsville is depicted in the television series Dexter, Miami Vice, and Sea Hunt, and a 2011 episode of The Layover which focuses on the culture and history of MiamiYou can see Stiltsville in the background of some shots in the Ace of Base music video for ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Turn Around.‚Äù See also * Cape Romano Dome House * Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta * Stilt house References External links * Stiltsville Preservation * Key Biscayne Stiltsville * Category:Houses in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:History of Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Tourist attractions in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Biscayne National Park Category:1930s establishments in Florida Category:Populated places established in the 1930s ","title":"Stiltsville"},{"id":"9865306","text":"Isaac Andreyevich Chatzkin (1832 - June 1902) was a Russian Jewish physician.

She appeared from 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008, from the series eight episode \\"I'll Be Back\\" to the series eleven episode \\"Sweet Bitter Love\\". Ayola had made a former minor appearance in the show several years prior to being cast as Kyla, and was later asked to return in a more permanent role. She departed from the show after becoming pregnant with her second child. Kyla is a nurse and single mother, constantly trying to balance her career, her child and her love life. Her storylines see her subjected to domestic abuse by her husband, temporarily lose her son to foster care and become an alcoholic. After getting her life back on track, she departs from Holby, moving to Ghana with her partner Abra Durant (Adrian Edmondson). In August 2006, Ayola was shortlisted for the \\"Female Performance in TV\\" award at the fourth Screen Nation Awards for her portrayal of Kyla, and was granted \\"Honourable Mention\\" in the same category the following year. However, the character has also been criticised for the dramaticism of her storylines, and the manner in which they reflect upon real NHS nurses. Development =Casting= Prior to being cast as Kyla, Rakie Ayola had made former appearances in both Holby City and its sister show Casualty - in the former as a patient, in series five, episode 32 \\"By Any Other Name\\", and the latter as a patient's relative, in series 13, episode 19, \\"Trapped\\". She was approached about returning to Holby City in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne and Tom Chambers as Sam Strachan. After a series of three meetings, two years after the birth of her first child, she agreed readily, despite being \\"nervous about signing such a long contract\\", and having claimed just sixteen months previously that she had no desire to work in any long running serial - lambasting the quality of long- term recurring characters by stating: \\"I watch lots of soaps and love watching them but I often think how frustrating it must be when they make a character into such an idiot. I think it would drive me mad to pick up a script and think, 'Who am I kissing now?'\\" Ayola has since explained that her change of heart stemmed from becoming a mother. In the early years of her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: \\"I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful.\\" Ayola signed a three-year contract to play Kyla, which expired in October 2008. It was announced on 11 October 2008 that she would be departing from the show in order to have a second child. Ayola said of her decision to leave: \\"It's strange but sad at the same time. I've had a great time and I'll miss it. I made the decision purely because I was pregnant, but I wasn't really ready to put down the character of Kyla. I'm very sorry to have to let her go\\". =Personality= Upon announcing the character's arrival, BBC Publicity described Kyla as a \\"survivor\\", someone who had \\"been through a lot in her life, firstly losing out on her dream career as a runner and then escaping a violent marriage.\\" It was stated: \\"Kyla is compassionate, feisty, gives others the benefit of the doubt, strong and loyal - but you wouldn't want to cross her. Kyla has a habit of picking the wrong men, she's inflexible once she's made her mind up and can be volatile if pushed. She has come to Holby with her son Max eager to start anew.\\" From May 2007 onwards, the character was portrayed as increasingly emotionally unstable, having had \\"her whole world crash down around her\\", following storylines including the death of her husband, and her son's request to be taken into foster care. As this emotional instability continued and worsened with the abrupt ending of another relationship, the character was seen to develop full blown alcoholism. Series producer Diana Kyle said of the storyline: \\"It's important we cover topics that are relevant today. Every day, people in the medical profession deal with patients who have drink or drug problems. Plus, the fact that some of the Holby staff are also suffering with these addictions is very pertinent to hospitals in real life.\\" Speaking of Kyla's struggle to deal with her addiction, she added: \\"She'll work so hard to get her life together. She has a long way to go, but hopefully there's a light at the end of the tunnel...\\" Discussing the storyline which saw Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous companion Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: \\"It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts about other people are wrong ‚Äì so she ends up running off. [...] [Kyla] has no excuses ‚Äì all she can think is that she‚Äôs really messed up and needs to leave.\\" This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). Ayola explained: \\"He suggests she takes a demotion, so she‚Äôll have less to worry about and more time to deal with her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she‚Äôd end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze.\\" When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: \\"I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is.\\" =Relationships= Kyla was involved in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, the first of which was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: \\"She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper.\\" Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: \\"I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the more I think he might not be the reason for their split\\". She expanded: \\"They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't.\\" Asked in July 2006 what she hoped for Kyla in the long run, Ayola responded: \\"Most of all I‚Äôd like to see her laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not just because he is attractive but someone who can work her out and understand her\\". Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: \\"He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll forgive him, but I love working with Ade ‚Äì he‚Äôs a gorgeous man.\\" The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana. Storylines Kyla arrives at Holby General as an agency nurse in the episode \\"I'll Be Back\\". She makes a good impression on consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), and is invited to take on the position of Acting Sister. When her former boyfriend, physiotherapist Justin Fuller, begins working at the hospital, they briefly renew their relationship. Kyla tires of Justin's immaturity, however, and breaks up with him again. In retaliation, Justin kidnaps Kyla's son Max, plying him with alcohol, and sending him into a hypoglycemic coma. While Kyla and her ex-husband Harvey manage to get to Max in time to save him, Harvey tells Kyla she is an unfit mother and he will be filing for sole custody of their son. Kyla and Harvey fight a brief custody battle. When it is revealed that Max has been bullying his classmates, his parents realise they need to set aside their differences for their son's sake. Shortly after this, Kyla begins a relationship with new general surgical consultant Abra Durant. Kyla helps Abra cover up an illegal xenotransplantation he performed, and keeps quiet when she discovers he has been stealing and shipping returned anti-retroviral drugs to African hospitals in need. When Abra's illegal dealings are uncovered, he is forced to flee the country, devastating Kyla. Shaken by Abra's departure, when Max falls ill with food poisoning in the episode \\"Feast or Famine\\" Kyla realises he needs a male influence in his life and begrudgingly allows Harvey to move back in with them. Harvey becomes physically abusive, is suspended from his work as a police officer, and begins drinking heavily. When Harvey discovers lingerie bought for Kyla by Abra, the pair fall out once again, culminating in Harvey falling to his death from the hospital roof. Max, who witnessed this, blames his mother, causing her to lash out at him. As a result, he is taken into foster care, and although social services decide he may return to Kyla's custody, he requests to remain in his new foster home. Abra returns to Holby, and although Kyla initially rebukes his advances, they ultimately resume their relationship, moving in together. Abra makes a drunken proposal to her in episode \\"Bad Reputation\\" however laughs it off as a joke when she assumes he is not serious. Kyla is seen to develop an increasing dependence on alcohol as she grieves for her son. When Abra abruptly terminates their relationship in order to move back to Africa, this alcohol dependence continues and worsens. Kyla is devastated when Max applies for a Guardianship Order, and becomes negligent at work, leading to the deaths of two patients. Kyla admits she has become an alcoholic and agrees to begin attending AA meetings. Initially this goes well, and she is supported by new consultant Stuart McElroy who is also an alcoholic. However, Kyla's confidence is damaged when Stuart violently attacks colleague Chrissie Williams, and she resorts to drinking once more. She attempts to hand in her notice, but Mark Williams persuades her to take a voluntary demotion to give her more time to deal with her problems. Kyla is shocked when Abra returns to Holby again, contemplating going back to both him and alcohol, but managing to resist. In the episode \\"Send No Flowers\\", she is unexpectedly reunited with Max when he arrives at the hospital to visit his foster brother, a patient in Kyla's care. After an argument, Max suffers cardiac arrest and requires an operation. Kyla suspects he has been neglected by his foster mother. Max is initially highly defensive of her, but after a stern talking to by Abra, and being implored to do the right thing by Kyla, Max admits to his social worker that his foster mother is frequently neglectful. Kyla is delighted when he finally asks to come home with her. Kyla briefly re-unites with Abra, when he reveals to her that he was subject to a machete attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, however he then leaves Holby once more to check himself into a psychiatric hospital. When Lola Griffin (Sharon D. Clarke) finds Abra being treated for post-traumatic stress by his own mother, she and Kyla convince Abra to discharge himself and return to Ghana. Shortly thereafter, Max is accepted into a prestigious football academy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Kyla hands in her notice, intent on leaving with him, however Max convinces Abra to return and take Kyla back to Ghana with him. Kyla initially refuses, but comes to realise that Max only wants to make her happy, and agrees to leave with Abra, who proposes marriage to her. Reception Ayola was shortlisted in August 2006 for the \\"Female Performance in TV\\" award at the 2006 Screen Nation Awards, for her portrayal of the character. The 2007 Screen Nation Awards saw Ayola receive \\"Honourable Mention\\", again for \\"Female Performance in TV\\", however she failed to make shortlist this time around. Kyla has achieved mild popularity with Holby City fans. She was voted fans' fifth favourite newcomer of series eight in the official 2006 Holby.tv Awards, and she and Abra were voted fifth favourite couple of series nine, the following year in the 2007 awards. The level of dramaticism of some of the character's storylines, as well as those of other Holby City nurses was heavily criticised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The lead article of the July 2007 issue of the NMC magazine tackled nurses in popular culture, discussing \\"the ease with which writers can attach terrible storylines to a caring profession\\", and stating: \\"Nurses who become prostitutes to pay the bills, nurses who kill their husbands, nurses who abuse the system to get their own way - Holby City has always been a hotbed of slanderous storylines. Good people doing bad things makes excellent entertainment... The bald fact is that real life nurses doing their jobs well just aren't that entertaining.\\" Kyla's \\"no-nonsense\\" personality has led to mixed reviews in the press. A number of episodes central to her storylines have been reviewed by various publications as televisual 'picks of the day' - from her introductory episode, to the death of her husband, to the surprise return of her former boyfriend Abra. Her \\"fiery\\" stance resulted in the assessment that, from a viewing perspective, the character \\"has never been one of the more likeable members of staff\\", however her descent into alcoholism drew some more sympathetic reviews, with Linda Gibson of TV Quick writing of the character: \\"Let's hope that Kyla pulls herself together, gets her son back and meets a man who can give her what she wants.\\" Conversely, Daily Mirror TV critic Jim Shelley opined that the character had formerly been one of the more \\"normal\\" and \\"reliable\\" members of the cast, but criticized the handling of her alcoholism storyline, stating that the character seemed to have become an alcoholic \\"overnight\\". In October 2007, drinks' industry body the Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about a scene in Holby City which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show the negative consequences of this action, the series was presenting a \\"highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking\\". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident. In response to the accusation that \\"We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes\\", the BBC released a statement tying the complaint closely to the alcoholism storyline being played out with Kyla at the time, explaining that: \\"Holby City is in the middle of a storyline in which a key character (Kyla) has spiralling problems in her personal and professional life because of alcohol ‚Äî a storyline that fully and realistically depicts the negative impact of alcohol dependency in the workplace. Kyla has now been seen to seek help for alcoholism and the audience will see how she fares on the road to recovery.\\" In popular culture The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a version of Hung Up by Madonna. Ayola as Kyla featured prominently in this sketch, performing the song's bridge and providing vocals for its introduction. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Ayola, alongside Nadine Lewington (Maddy Young) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. On 3 June 2008, BBC Two cooking programme Ready Steady Cook broadcast a Holby City special, featuring Ayola and Edmondson. As well as competing over their cooking skills, the pair discussed their characters' relationship and storylines.

History  Founded in 1901 as Pennsylvania's first co-educational medical school, the institution has attained a national reputation for training humanistic and dedicated clinicians. The school was founded with the central principle that quality education should be afforded to everyone regardless of their ability to pay. In addition, the school has emphasized the development of humanitarianism; a value highlighted by Sir William Osler's quote, \\"The good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease.\\" This quote is inscribed on one of the walls in the Medical Education and Research Building. = Revitalization and reconstruction= Under the leadership of Dean John Daly, M.D., alumnus of the class of 1973, TUSM underwent revitalization. The institution hired 262 new professors in 4 years; added clinical and basic science departments; and completely revamped the medical curriculum to meet changing educational paradigms. Additionally, on November 1, 2007, TUSM broke ground on a new home. At a projected cost of $160 million, the project is the largest capital improvement project in the history of Temple University. The new building, an 11-story, glass and brick structure designed by Philadelphia-based architecture and engineering firm Ballinger, opened in May 2009. Notable features include: a modern anatomy laboratory with computers and high definition LCD screens on articulating arms; a fully interactive patient simulation center with simulated doctor offices, emergency medicine department, and surgical apparatuses as well as a staff of simulated patient actors, simulated patient mannequins, and full-time instructing physicians; and a 24-hour, 50,000 sq. foot library with individualized study rooms containing high definition televisions with multimedia and wireless accessibility. The new medical education building also features a wide array of attributes designed to lower stress of its faculty, staff, and students. Examples include: a classical grand piano on the third floor; a medical student lounge with cable, high definition television; and a three-story atrium/commons area containing armchairs and medical art.

The first two years are taught in an integrated approach, closely tying basic science concepts to clinical medicine, professionalism and medical ethics. The clinical years are marked by hands-on experience in caring for patients. The William Maul Measey Institute for Clinical Simulation and Patient Safety allows students to learn basic clinical skills and teamwork in a safe learning environment throughout the curriculum. = Year 1 = The major goal of Year 1 is normal structure, function and development. The year is divided into six blocks: *Human Gross Anatomy *Elements of Bioscience *Body Systems 1 *Body Systems 2 *Body Systems 3 *Basic Principles of Immunology, Pathology and Pharmacology studies A doctoring course running throughout the curriculum enables students to learn the basics of history-taking, physical exam skills and professionalism. The course uses clinical cases to integrate the teaching and evaluation of clinical skills with the basic science concepts in each of the blocks, and utilizes the William Maul Measey Institute for Clinical Simulation and Patient Safety to aid learning through interactive clinical scenarios. Faculty preceptors provide individualized mentoring and career advising. = Year 2 = Year 2 focuses on the causes, mechanisms, identification and treatment of major human diseases. The second year is divided into 5 blocks: *Microbiology and Infectious Diseases *Diseases of the Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems *Diseases of the Renal, Endocrine and Reproductive Systems *Diseases of the Central Nervous and Musculoskeletal Systems *Diseases of the Gastrointestinal System, Hematology and Oncology The Doctoring 2 course enables students to practice and improve their clinical skills and professionalism through closely supervised rotations in both ambulatory and hospital settings. = Year 3 = During Year 3, beginning in mid-May of the second year, students rotate through core clerkships in: *Family Medicine *Internal Medicine *Neurology *Obstetrics and Gynecology *Pediatrics *Psychiatry *Surgery *Elective (clinical, research or academic) The third year Doctoring course emphasizes career advising, evidence-based medicine, professionalism and clinical decision-making. = Year 4 = In Year 4, beginning in May of the third year, students focus on areas of interest through a large variety of electives. They are required to do a sub-internship in either pediatrics, surgery, or medicine, as well as rotations in an intensive-care unit, the emergency department, and radiology. The balance of the fourth year is given over to electives, research, and residency interviews. Available electives include multiple medical and surgical sub- specialties. Students interested in specialties like obstetrics or neurology may also elect to do a second sub-internship in these specialties.  Clinical campuses  Temple offers opportunities to perform third and fourth year rotations at a number of Pennsylvania-based clinical campuses. * Temple University Health System, Philadelphia (including: Temple University Hospital (TUH), TUH Episcopal Division, and Jeanes Hospital) * Abington Memorial Hospital, Abington * Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Johnstown * Crozer- Chester Medical Center, Upland * Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia * Geisinger Medical Center, Danville * Lehigh Valley Hospital, Allentown * Mercy Hospital, Scranton * Reading Hospital and Medical Center, Reading * St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia * St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem * Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh  Branch campuses  In response to the increasing demand for dedicated U.S. and Pennsylvania physicians, Temple University School of Medicine established branch campuses in various Pennsylvania locations. These regional campuses provide the same basic science courses offered at the main Philadelphia campus, however will be based in separate cities. The first of these branch campuses was established at St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and opened in the Fall 2011 with an inaugural class of 30. Plans were in place to open a branch campus at Allegheny Health Network (formerly West Penn Allegheny Health System) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in June 2011 which already serves as a site for clinical rotations for Temple University School of Medicine Since then, no further development in the establishment of the branch campus has been made.

It is now registered on the List of IEEE Milestones as a key advance in electrical engineering. The Astron was unveiled in Tokyo on December 25, 1969, after ten years of research and development at Suwa Seikosha (currently named Seiko Epson), a manufacturing company of Seiko Group. Within one week 100 gold watches had been sold, at a retail price of 450,000 yen (US$1,250) each (at the time, equivalent to the price of a medium-sized car).The price of Toyota Corolla E10 was 432,000 yen (US$1,200) when it was released in 1966. Essential elements included a Y-type quartz oscillator of 8192 cps, a hybrid integrated circuit, and a phase locked ultra-small stepping motor to turn its hands. According to Seiko, Astron was accurate to ¬±5 seconds per month or one minute per year, and its battery life was 1 year or longer.  Anniversaries  In March 2010, at the Baselworld watch fair and trade show in Switzerland, Seiko previewed a limited edition new version and related designs of the original Astron watch, commemorating the fortieth anniversary in December 2009 of the debut of the Astron watch.\\"The new SEIKO Quartz Astron: A demonstration of SEIKO‚Äôs four decades of dedication to the perfection of the quartz watch\\", Seiko press release, March 18, 2010 References and footnotes  (alternate version)  Further reading  * \\"Seiko Quartz 35 SQ: The Seiko 35 SQ Astron was the first quartz watch on the market\\", Smithsonian Institution website. * Thompson, Joe, \\"1969: Seiko‚Äôs Breakout Year\\", WatchTime Magazine, December 20, 2009 Category:Products introduced in 1969 Category:History of electronic engineering Category:Watch models Category:Seiko Category:Seiko Epson Category:Japanese inventions ","title":"Astron (wristwatch)"},{"id":"9865340","text":"Mallika Dutt at the World Economic Forum on India 2012 Mallika Dutt leads Inter-Connected, a new initiative that uplifts the independent nature of self, community and planet to advance collective wellbeing.

His brother, Pieter van der Werff (1661‚Äì1722), was his principal pupil and assistant. Life At the age of ten he started to take lessons, two years later moving in with Eglon van der Neer, specializing in clothes and draperie. At the age of seventeen he founded his own studio in Rotterdam where he later became the head of guild of Saint Luc. In 1696, he was paid a visit by Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine and his wife, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici. The couple ordered two paintings to be sent to Cosimo III of Tuscany, Anna Maria Luisa's father, in Florence. During the next years Van der Werff traveled regularly between D√ºsseldorf and his home town. In 1703, he became the official court painter and a knight, when his former teacher and predecessor Van der Neer died. Van der Werff, with a perfect technique, was paid extremely well by the Elector for his biblical or classical (erotic) paintings. In 1705, he painted a portrait of Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1716, he lost his job when the Elector died because the treasury was empty. Van der Werff became one of the most lauded Dutch painters of his day, gaining a European reputation and an enormous fortune. Arnold Houbraken, writing in 1718, considered him the greatest of the Dutch painters and this was the prevailing critical opinion throughout the 18th century: however, his reputation suffered in the 19th century, when he was alleged to have betrayed the Dutch naturalistic tradition. In the Victorian Age people could not appreciate his art, so most of his work went into the cellars of the Alte Pinakothek. Van der Werff also practised as an architect in Rotterdam, where he designed a few houses.

Charles de Bourbon (22 September 1523 ‚Äì 9 May 1590) was a French cardinal. The Catholic League considered him the rightful King of France after the death of Henry III of France in 1589. His claim was recognized as part of the secret Treaty of Joinville concluded between Philip II of Spain and the League. Biography He was born at La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre, in what is now the department of Seine-et-Marne, the eighth child of Charles IV de Bourbon, duke of Vend√¥me. His mother was Fran√ßoise d'Alen√ßon. Charles made a rapid career in the Roman Catholic hierarchy. He was bishop of Nevers (1540‚Äì1545), bishop of Saintes (1545‚Äì1550, elevated to cardinal in 1548), archbishop of Rouen (1550‚Äì1590), bishop of Nantes (1550‚Äì1554), Papal legate in Avignon (1565‚Äì1590) and bishop of Beauvais (1569‚Äì1575). Following the massacre at Wassy and with tensions rising between Guise and Conde forces in Paris, Catherine de' Medici appointed him governor of Paris. Charles attempted to get both to leave Paris to no avail. On 31 December 1578 he was made the first commander in the Order of the Holy Spirit. When the duke of Alen√ßon and Anjou died childless in 1584 while King Henry III of France was also still childless it was clear that the house of Valois would come to an end with the death of the king and the succession to the French throne would then pass to the house of Bourbon- Vend√¥me who were descended from Louis IX. However, the senior member of the family, Henry III of Navarre (son of Charles's late elder brother Antoine), was a Protestant. The Catholic League, party to the French Wars of Religion, excluded all Protestants from the succession, which made Charles de Bourbon their champion. In the secret Treaty of Joinville of 31 December 1584 he was recognized by the leaders of the league and a representative of Philip II of Spain as the heir to Henry III of France. Henry III had Charles imprisoned in the castle of Blois on 23 December 1588. He was transferred from one castle to another, presumably to prevent escape. On Henry III's death in 1589, the League proclaimed Charles king, while he was still a prisoner and in the castle of Chinon. He was recognized as Charles X by the parlement of Paris on 21 November 1589. His prison was considered too close to Catholic territory, so he was again transferred, this time to Fontenay-le-Comte. The Catholic League issued coins in his name from 2 August 1589 to his death from 15 Mints, including Paris. Charles, however, renounced the royal title and recognized his nephew Henry IV, whose succession was disputed by the Catholic League. He died in the castle of Fontenay-le-Comte. When the Comte d'Artois ascended the French throne in 1824, choosing to believe that Charles de Bourbon had never been King, he styled himself Charles X of France.

Directed by William A. Goldwyn and produced by Hugh Benson, Renee Valente and Sinatra, Contract on Cherry Street was trumpeted as a major event that garnered positive reviews and strong ratings when it premiered on NBC on November 19, 1977. The role of Detective Inspector Frank Hovannes was Sinatra's first acting role in seven years. The film was shot on location in New York City and New Jersey over a period of three months. The book on which the film was based was said to be a favorite of Sinatra's mother Dolly, who had been recently killed in an airplane crash in Las Vegas. This was the only television film in which Sinatra played the lead. Plot When his partner is gunned down, Frank Hovannes, a detective inspector with the New York City Police Department, wants to lead his organized-crime unit against the mob. Legal and departmental restrictions inhibit him, so Hovannes decides to take the matter into his own hands. A vigilante act, a contract hit against one of the crime syndicate's members, is designed to stir the mob into action so that Hovannes and his men can catch them in the act. He runs into strong objections from his superiors in the police force along the way. Cast *Frank Sinatra as Det. Insp. Frank Hovannes *Martin Balsam as Capt.

After airing, renowned critic Leonard Maltin would comment: \\"Sinatra's first TV movie has him well cast as a NYC police officer who takes on organized crime in his own fashion after his partner is gunned down. Aces to this fine thriller.\\" Judith Crist, however, would question why Sinatra was starring in a \\"mealy-mouthed morality tale,\\" although most reviews were positive.

After losing a leg to cancer at age 12, she went on to win 10 world and 19 United States championships between 1986 and 1990 as a three-tracker, or one-legged skier. Golden also won an Olympic gold medal in giant slalom at the 1988 Calgary Games, where disabled skiing was a demonstration sport. She participated in alpine skiing at two Winter Paralympic Games, in 1980 and 1988, winning two gold medals in the latter year. After retiring from skiing, cancer returned in 1992 and 1996, with her last bout of cancer resulting in her death in 2001. Early life Diana Golden grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts and began skiing at the age of five, making regular trips to Cannon Mountain Ski Area with her parents. However, in 1975, at the age of 12, her right leg collapsed while she was walking home from skiing and doctors diagnosed bone cancer. As a result, the doctors had to amputate her leg above the knee to stop the cancer from spreading. Following the surgery the first question Golden asked was whether she would be able to ski again and was relieved to discover that she would be able to. After being fitted with a prosthetic device she learned to walk and then ski again within six or seven months with the help of the New England Handicapped Sportsmen's Association. In her junior year at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School she became a member of the ski team and by the age of 17 had joined the United States Disabled Ski Team (USDST). After high school, Golden went to Dartmouth College and gained a degree in English Literature in 1984. While there in 1982 she competed at the World Handicapped Championships in Norway, winning a gold medal in the downhill and a silver in the giant slalom. However, she then became disillusioned with competitive skiing and would join a group of born again Christians. After college, she went to work for a local firm selling computer software before a friend reintroduced her to skiing and she rediscovered her love of it. In 1985 she rejoined the USDST and would gain sponsorships and a scholarship in order to be able to pursue it full-time. Skiing career Within a year of taking up skiing again Golden had won 4 gold medals internationally including 3 in the 1986 World Disabled Championships. She was dominant in the United States Disabled Alpine Championships winning all four of the giant slalom, slalom, downhill and combined disciplines in both 1987 and 1988. Also in 1988 Golden won 2 golds at the World Disabled Championships and most famously won a gold in the giant slalom at the Winter Olympics in Calgary, where the event was a demonstration sport. Golden retired in 1990 but before this she would win 3 gold medals at her last World Disabled Championships in 1990 at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. In total throughout her career Golden won 19 national, 10 World and 1 Olympic disabled gold medals. Golden at first used outriggers when skiing but would abandon these in favour of the standard ski poles so being able to reach greater speeds but requiring more strength and stamina. In 1990 using the normal ski poles and one ski Golden was recorded as travelling at 65 miles per hour during a downhill race. As well as competing in disabled events Golden also took part in able-bodied events and she got the United States Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) to pass the \\"Golden Rule\\" in 1985. Under this rule the top disabled skiers were able to race after only the top 15 skiers had taken part, thus enabling the disabled skiers to compete before the course becomes rutted from heavy usage. In 1987, competing against able-bodied competitors, Golden finished 10th in a USSA competition. Golden received a number of awards during her career including the USSA's Beck Award in 1986 honouring the best female skier in international competition. It was in 1988 however that Golden received the most recognition when both Ski Racing Magazine and the United States Olympic Committee named her female skier of the year, choosing her ahead of able-bodied skiers. Later life Golden became a motivational speaker following her skiing career, and also took up rock climbing and mountaineering leading to a successful climb of Mount Rainier. However, in 1992, at the age of 29, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, for which she had to be treated with bilateral mastectomies. While operating on her, doctors also found a pre-malignant growth and as a result had to remove her uterus. After this, realising she could never have children, Golden became depressed and in 1993 attempted suicide, something which she would consider again. Golden recovered and resumed motivational speaking but would give this up for good in 1996 when she was again diagnosed with breast cancer, which was treatable but now incurable. She returned to New England from Colorado and it was here that she once more met Steve Brosnihan, a freelance cartoonist she had known at Dartmouth College. Brosnihan and Golden fell in love and were married in August 1997. Golden died in August 2001 from the cancer at the age of 38. Following her death, Golden would inspire a race series called the \\"Diana Golden Race Series\\", hosted by Disabled Sports USA, at mountains which offer programs that teach the physically disabled how to ski.Diana Golden Opportunity Fund - Disabled Sport USA website The Diana Golden Opportunities Fund is the endowment that supports and encourages junior athletes with disabilities in their pursuit of excellence in skiing by providing scholarships for purchasing equipment or participating in an adaptive race or development camp. After her retirement from skiing Golden continued to be honoured by various organisations. In 1991 the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman Memorial Award, while in 1997 she was inducted into the US National Ski Hall of Fame and the International Women's Sports Foundation Hall of Fame. The citation on her entry into the International Hall of Fame read \\"She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.\\" See also *Passion for Snow References Category:1963 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American female alpine skiers Category:Alpine skiers at the 1988 Winter Olympics Category:Paralympic alpine skiers of the United States Category:Alpine skiers at the 1980 Winter Paralympics Category:Alpine skiers at the 1988 Winter Paralympics Category:Paralympic gold medalists for the United States Category:People from Lincoln, Massachusetts Category:Medalists at the 1988 Winter Paralympics Category:Sportspeople from Massachusetts Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Rhode Island Category:Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School alumni Category:Paralympic medalists in alpine skiing ","title":"Diana Golden (skier)"},{"id":"9865624","text":"\\"The Best Is Yet to Come\\" is a 1959 song composed by Cy Coleman to lyrics by Carolyn Leigh.

The film features Faye Dunaway, David Dukes, Brenda Vaccaro, James Whitmore, and Martin Gabel in his final role. The film is based on the 1973 novel of the same name written by Lawrence Sanders. The screenplay was written by Mann Rubin. The film originally was slated to be directed by Roman Polanski, who was dropped by Columbia Pictures after statutory rape charges were brought against him. Director Brian G. Hutton took over the production after Polanski fled to France. The last of nine films produced by Sinatra, and his final starring role, he plays NYPD Sergeant Edward X. Delaney, a troubled veteran New York City Police Department homicide detective. In a small role, Dunaway is Delaney's ailing wife, hospitalized during the entire story with a rare kidney affliction. Bruce Willis makes his film debut as an extra walking past Sinatra in a restaurant (although he is virtually unrecognizable due to a hat that covers his eyes). The First Deadly Sin was the third production by Sinatra's Artanis production company and was shot on location in New York City. It premiered on October 23, 1980 at Loew's State Theatre in Times Square as part of a benefit for the Cabrini Medical Center, a key location in the film. The musical score was by composer and arranger Gordon Jenkins, who first worked with Sinatra on the 1957 album Where Are You? Plot The film opens outside Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on West 81st Street in Manhattan. A man is attacked by another man wielding an ice axe. The attack is intercut with graphic closeups of a woman undergoing surgery. The NYPD arrive to process the scene. The coroner, Dr. Ferguson (Whitmore), shows Sergeant Edward Delaney (Sinatra) that the fatal wound on the skull was made with a round object. Meanwhile, the 20th Precinct receives news that Delaney's wife Barbara (Dunaway) is recovering from emergency surgery. The information is relayed to Delaney at the scene, and he rushes to the hospital. Barbara's surgeon, Dr. Bernardi (Coe), explains that complications from her kidney stones forced him to remove the organ. Over the course of the film, Barbara's condition worsens, and Delaney harbors deep suspicions that Bernardi is incompetent. The murder on 81st Street is a kind of solace for Delaney. Much to his colleagues' surprise, he throws himself into the case despite constant admonitions from his friends and supervisors that the NYPD's priorities are elsewhere. One of his early visits is to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he consults with Arms and Armor curator Christopher Langley (Gabel) about the type of weapon that could make such a unique wound. The elderly Langley is thrilled to have such a unique problem to solve, and he devotes a great deal of time to research. The angle of entry and the perfectly spherical nature of the wound eliminate most of the weapons familiar to Langley. He decides the weapon must have been some kind of tool, and he visits a hardware store, where he explicitly asks for the best implement to kill someone. A bemused clerk helps Langley deduce that the weapon was most likely an ice axe. Delaney has discovered that a similar attack had occurred recently on West 79th Street. After consulting with the perpetually harried Ferguson, he discovers that the wound patterns are nearly identical. As they investigate, they realize that similar attacks have been taking place all over New York City. Langley uses the new information to locate the exact model of ice axe that would cause such injuries. At one sporting goods store, the owner hands over the addresses that he collected from every customer who bought that ice axe. The addresses eventually lead Delaney to the high-rise building of Daniel Blank (Dukes). Blank has been seen intermittently throughout the film cleaning up after his murders. As Delaney closes in on him, Blank attempts one more attack, but it does not go as planned. After striking several blows, his victim escapes only to be hit by a passing car. Delaney's investigation of Blank confirms that he is the killer. Delaney realizes that his chances of arresting and obtaining a murder conviction against Blank are slim due to Blank's wealth and high social position in the city. Before going to confront Blank in his luxury apartment, Delaney gets a Luger nine millimeter pistol from a closet in his home. It is a souvenir that Delaney brought home as a soldier returning from World War II. Delaney finds Blank curled up in a closet in a deeply disturbed state. He confesses to his crimes before composing himself. Blank brags about how respectable and well-connected he is, and he guarantees that he will get away with his crime. He confidently goes to the phone to report Delaney for breaking and entering. Delaney shoots Blank in the head with the Luger pistol as Blank is speaking with the police operator on the telephone. Delaney goes to his office at the police precinct station house and retires from the police department. As he is leaving the station house, the desk sergeant tells him of the discovery of Blank's body and asks him if he wants to respond to the call. Delaney informs the sergeant that he just retired as he walks out of the building. The final scene shows Delaney reading to his wife in the hospital, holding her hand. He cries as she dies.

Here, a less subtle approach allowed the ending to be more in tune with the rest of the film.

Lowe played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide under Bear Bryant from 1972 to 1975. College career After a stellar career at Central High School in Phenix City, Alabama, Lowe enrolled at the University of Alabama in 1972, where he found instant success. Lowe became one of only two Crimson Tide players to be named an All-American three times (the other being Cornelius Bennett) when he was named an All- American in 1973, 1974, and 1975. Lowe also played on four Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship teams, and one national championship team, while he was at Alabama. Lowe also holds the Alabama record for most tackles in a season, with 134 stops as a sophomore in 1973. He ranks third all-time in tackles at Alabama, with 315 in his career. San Diego Chargers After his time at Alabama, Lowe was chosen by the San Diego Chargers in the 5th round (131st overall pick) in the 1976 NFL Draft. In his eleven years in San Diego, Lowe was known largely as the epitome of durability and longevity, because he missed only one game in his entire eleven-year NFL career. Moreover, despite his skills in defending the run, Lowe was particularly adept as a pass defender, which is a bit of a rarity for a linebacker. All told, Lowe racked up 21 interceptions as a Charger, and 4 were returned for a touchdown. Coaching After retiring from the NFL, Lowe became a football coach. He spent six years in the NFL as a defensive assistant for the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs, and eventually returned to his alma mater as an assistant coach, a stint which included the Red Devils' 1993 state championship. After spending five years with the UAB Blazers, Lowe moved back to the high school ranks and became the head coach for Central's biggest rival, Smiths Station High School. Lowe was removed from his position at Smiths Station by the Lee County Board of Education in 2008 after compiling a total record of 12 wins and 19 losses in only 3 years as head coach. Lowe was an assistant coach at Jackson-Olin High School in Birmingham. On December 30, 2009 Lowe was named the head coach and returned home to his alma mater, Central High School in Phenix City, AL. He was relieved of his coaching duties in May 2014. Awards For his impact through athletics as a player and a coach, Lowe was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009. Personal life Lowe is the brother of Eddie Lowe, the mayor of Phenix City.

The ship was then purchased by China as an incomplete vessel in 1993 from post-Soviet Ukraine. The ship has a near sister ship () operating with the Indian Navy. After significant refit, the ship was consecutively renamed Qinghaihu (885), formerly ex Nancang (Nanyun 953) and ex-Vladimir Peregudov. Another similar ship was built and sold to Thailand and currently in service with the Royal Thai Navy as HTMS Similan (871). The Type 908 AOR is the second generation Chinese replenishment ship that is outfitted with a total of six cranes, four oil refuelling stations, and two stores stations. This allows the ship to replenish three warships simultaneously. The ship, through her helicopter facilities, is able to replenish warships operating nearby via vertical replenishment (VERTREP). Background The Type 908 was the second stage in Chinese replenishment ship development and construction. Although considered somewhat successful, the first Type 905 replenishment tanker (Fuqing class) could not completely satisfy the requirements of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). One of the primary drawbacks of this class was that they are mainly for replenishment of liquid supplies, i.e. fuel and water. These ships of the first stage of the development of Chinese replenishment ships could only replenish extremely limited dry supplies, and are virtually incapable of resupply of ammunition, because the Chinese industry at the time lacked the capability to provide sounding safety measures for resupplying and storing ammunition with fuels. This is one of the two primary constrains that despite the fact that on August 28, 1977, the Central Military Commission ordered the resumption of the development of fleet replenishment ship that is capable of one-stop replenishment, (i.e. being capable of resupply ammunition, fuels, water, and solid supplies together by a single ship, a concept first pioneered by United States Navy), the project was eventually put on hold. The other primary constrain was budget constraints as Chinese economy was near the verge of total collapse resulting from the Cultural Revolution. Eventually, as the economic reform in the People's Republic of China in 1979 rapidly improved the Chinese economy, the second stage of the development of the Chinese fleet replenishment ship was resumed in 1988, after around a decade of dormancy. PLAN had a lot of expectations for the new class of ship: in addition to being capable of one-stop replenishment, the new ship was also required to be capable of serving as a hospital ship. However, to meet such high expectation of PLAN, costs was driven up multiple times. As the design was completed, the price of the proposed new ship exceeded what PLAN could afford and the project was in danger of being cancelled again. Origin Just as the second stage of the development of the Chinese fleet replenishment ship was about to be yet again put on hold, there was an unexpected turn of fortune that saved the project from being scrapped. After the breakup of Soviet Union at the end of 1991, Ukraine was eager to sell a half completed replenishment ship built for the Soviet navy. Originally laid down as Soviet Ship Vladimir Peregudov, a Komandam Fedko-class merchant tanker, the ship was modified as a replenishment ship for the Soviet Navy, but building work was halted due to insufficient funding. Chinese were interested in the ship and the original chief designer of the proposed second generation Chinese replenishment ship, Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Zhang Wende (Âº†ÊñáÂæ∑) was named as the head of the Chinese delegation and chief negotiator, and his team was sent to Ukraine to evaluate the ship intended for the former Soviet navy. The Chinese delegation discovered that the main engine and the generator had been already installed, but not the pipes, cables and wires, overall they considered the ship was in excellent condition. Upon returning China, Zhang Wende and his colleagues strongly suggested to the Chinese authorities to buy the ship, and they were sent to Ukraine for the second time to finalize the deal. Because many of the subsystems of the ship were built in Saint Petersburg, some of Zhang Wende's team members were also sent to Russia to secure the purchase of these subsystems, which they completed successfully. On November 6, 1992, the deal was formally signed by China and Ukraine, and the original funding for developing the second generation domestic Chinese replenishment ship was diverted to purchase the uncompleted ship for the former-Soviet Navy. Development On May 1, 1993, the uncompleted former Soviet naval ship was towed to Dalian shipyard from Ukrainian Kherson shipyard. In addition to the hull and subsystems, China also purchased the design, which was immediately modified to meet the Chinese needs. Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Zhang Wende (Âº†ÊñáÂæ∑), the original chief designer of the second generation domestic Chinese replenishment ship was named as the chief designer and the program manager of this conversion project. The deputy general designer is Mr. Huang Wei (ÈªÑËîö), another general engineer of the 701st Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC).deputy general designerdeputy general designer of the ship On May 8, 1996, it entered Chinese service in South Sea Fleet, where it has remained until today. The pennant number was originally Nanyun (ÂçóËøê)-953, but later changed to 885, with name Qinghaihu (ÈùíÊµ∑Êπñ), and this upgraded ship became the second generation Chinese replenishment ship, replacing the originally planned indigenous one. The conversion project was deemed successful and worthy but Chinese, who had gained important insights on Soviet design principle, core technologies, important subsystems, layout, and other expertise that were difficult for Chinese to obtain, and these valuable knowledge would later help China in designing its next generation replenishment ships. The most important gain, however, was financial. The original funding that was insufficient to develop a proposed indigenous 2nd generation Chinese replenishment ship was not only enough to buy the uncompleted former Soviet ship, but also had enough left to cover the following conversion work. One of the primary areas of improvement of the original former-Soviet design was in damage control, which was woefully inadequate (Rumored due to its original civilian merchant tanker design). Some of the interior wiring was exposed, and the ship's battle damage control system was very limited, with a near absence of internal damage limitation, insufficient fire-suppression system and water-tight locks. Incorporate the experienced gained from the rework of Type 053 frigates exported to Royal Thai Navy, the damage control of the ship was upgraded to western (mostly German and American) standards. There are a total of four transfer stations, with dry cargo transfer station followed by liquid cargo transfer station, which is exactly the opposite of arrangement of other replenishment ships in Chinese service, which is the major reason for China to indigenously develop the third generation replenishment ship.Type 908 replenishment ship A total of 9,630 tons of fuel can be carried, and with other dry cargoes such as food and ammunition, the total provision Type 908 can supply is 23,000 tons. HTMS Similan HTMS Similan In January, 1993, China received the notification from Thai government, informing the former's intention to purchase a replenishment ship for its light aircraft carrier fleet. China decided to join the bid, among other western shipbuilders including DCNS, Fincantieri, BAZAN, Hyundai and Dutch Schelde shipyards, and the Chinese design would be very similar to the converted former-Soviet ship, with work on both ships would be performed simultaneously. The original chief designer of the cancelled second generation domestic Chinese replenishment ship, academician Zhang Wende (Âº†ÊñáÂæ∑), who was named as the chief designer and the program manager of the conversion project for the Chinese navy, was also assigned an additional task, as the chief designer of second ship China would be building for export to the Thai navy. China managed to beat its western competitors and won the Thai contract. Work on the ship built for the Royal Thai Navy went well and the ship was completed on August 12, 1996. Zhang Wende, the chief designer personally stayed on board the ship for twelve days during the voyage to Thailand, gathering information at the very last moment, so that it would help in the future design of the next generation Chinese replenishment ship. Whenever possible, Zhang personally operated the ship, including radars, handling boats the ship carried, and other tasks. The ship was formally accepted to the Thai naval service on September 12, 1996, and was named HTMS Similan (pennant number 187). HTMS Similan is very similar to its sister ship in Chinese service, except it uses a Chinese hull. The most important difference, however, is in upgrading its replenishment capability. Despite being able to replenish solid supplies, the capability to resupply ammo is still rather limited for the Chinese ship. The Thai ship has further overcome this problem by increasing the ammunition resupply capability. Despite the difference between two ships, most of the technologies and components, especially those core technologies for both ships remain the same, and for this reason, China has placed HTMS Similan and the Chinese ship Qinghaihu (ÈùíÊµ∑Êπñ) in the same class. This class would eventually evolve into Type 903 replenishment ship (Fuchi class).

The municipality, one of the smallest by land area in Cantabria, is notable for being one of the nearest towns to the headwaters of the Ebro River. It is completely surrounded by the municipality of Campoo de Enmedio and was created a city by King Alfonso XIII in 1927, being one of only three urban centres in Cantabria with that honour, the others being Santander and Torrelavega. History The first documents mentioning the town date back to the year 1000, when it was divided into four solars by Sancho Garc√≠a, the Count of Castile.Amad√≥, Ram√≥n Ruiz. \\"Castile and Aragon.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. By 1404, it was emerging as the main town of the region and was organised into seven Hermandades, military units aimed at retaining law and order. The procurators of these brotherhoods met once a month with the Corregidor to organise the town's affairs. In 1497, Prince John, son of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon met his affianced wife Margaret of Austria here, the meeting or marriage ceremony probably taking place in La Casa de las Princesas. In 1517 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor was passing through the town when he was taken ill. He stayed for nine days at the Convento de San Francisco while he recovered. The convent was being built at the time, and a hundred years later had thirty friars while the town had five hundred inhabitants. In the eighteenth century, under the Bourbons, a new highway and a bridge over the River Ebro were built. These works contributed to an economic boom in the region and the town becomes a bustling and prosperous place, on one of the main routes to the port of Santander. In 1927 it received its charter as a city from King Alfonso XII. Geography Reinosa is the largest town in this area of Cantabria and is on the main railway line and located close to the A67 motorway. The town contains a number of hotels and restaurants, and Montesclaros High School is located here. The source of the River Ebro is in the village of Fontibre where a stream emerges from the ground from the town; a large artificial lake Embalse del Ebro was created in the Franco era by damming the river just below Reinosa. This is one of the largest reservoirs in northern Spain and is mainly filled in spring as a result of the melting of the winter snow in the mountains. The lake is the uppermost of many reservoirs on the Ebro. Twin towns * Deltebre, Spain, located at the mouth of the Ebro River.

The episode was first aired in the United States on the NBC network on September 18, 2006. Written by series creator Aaron Sorkin, and directed by executive producer Thomas Schlamme, the episode introduces the chaotic behind- the-scenes depiction of a fictional Saturday Night Live type show also called Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Plot The executive producer of a late night sketch comedy show sparks a media frenzy when he has an on-air meltdown during a live broadcast. The newly appointed network president, Jordan McDeere (Amanda Peet), has to scramble to make things right by hiring back two former prized employees to become the new executive producers of her network's flagship program. In doing so, she appoints two former members of the team: writer Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and former sketch producer, now director Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford), who had left the show years before on terms that were not amicable. Meanwhile, Albie and ex-girlfriend Harriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) come to terms with having to work on the show together very soon after their breakup. Reception =Ratings= The episode scored a Nielsen rating of 8.6/14 during its premi√®re on NBC, but suffered from a significant drop in viewers from the first-half hour to the second. Aired directly after Deal or No Deal, the show retained 81% of its audience with an average 13.4 million viewers tuned in at 10pm.

He was professor of history at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, and also served at the Royal Military College of Canada. In the Festschrift published in his honor in 1997, the editors hailed Schurman as the \\"founder of the serious study of naval history in Canada\\". Early life and education The son of Bertrand Lloyd Schurman, a civil servant, and his wife, Mabel P. Mackenzie, Schurman joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and became a flying officer in 1945. After demobilisation, he attended Acadia University, where he earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1949. Going on to graduate studies at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, he completed his Ph.D. in history in 1955 with a thesis on Imperial defence, 1868-1887. Career Schurman began his work as an historian of the British Empire, but this topic became unpopular as a scholarly subject so Schurman translated his interest in imperial history to naval history. His 1965 book 'The Education of a Navy: The Development of British Naval Strategic Thought, 1867-1914' (London: Cassell, 1965), focused on the development of strategic thinking in the Royal Navy, creating a new approach to the subject that linked naval thinkers and their personalities with British imperial naval policy and strategy. It also resurrected the memory of British naval historian Sir John Knox Laughton. He followed this with a biography of the important strategic naval thinker Sir Julian Corbett. Schurman's research on this subject had a profound effect on the study of naval history in Canada, and influenced a new generation of naval historians in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1972, Schurman joined with John Matthews, professor of English at Queen's University to start a search for the letters of Benjamin Disraeli as a sabbatical project. Their success in tracking down many previously undiscovered manuscript letters led to the establishment in 1975 of the Disraeli Project. They were joined in their effort by Professor J. A. W. Gunn, head of the Political Science Department at Queen's. Professor Matthews was appointed senior editor, and Schurman joined in editing the first two volumes of the project. When the funding ended after the first two volumes, the project became dormant, but has since continued on the foundation that Matthews and Schurman initially laid.

It has also been found in Chena Slough and Chena Lakes in Fairbanks; a few lakes near Cordova; and Daniels, Stormy, and Beck Lakes on the Kenai Peninsula. It is suspected that it may have entered the lake through the dumping of an aquarium as this species is a popular aquatic plant used by aquarium hobbyists and is commonly used as a teaching specimen in local middle schools. This introduction is of much concern due to Elodea's ability to negatively impact recreational uses, floatplane operations, fish and wildlife habitat, and property values. Another local attraction is Kincaid Park to the west. The residential area becomes generally more affluent nearer to the lake, with quite a range of demographics expanding out.

In the British Isles, this species is restricted to a small number of sites in the Norfolk Broads and the Pevensey Levels and Arun Valley in Sussex and Surrey.  Habitat  This small snail lives in pools with standing water and in oxbow lakes, but these biotopes are threatened because of sedimentation and ecological succession. It favours ditches with much aquatic flora but little emergent vegetation. Invasive plants such as floating marsh pennywort, (Hydrocotyle ranunculouides), that sometimes chokes ditches, and the Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) are particularly harmful. This species often lives in places where there is abundant duckweed Lemna spp.. Water quality that is suitable for Anisus vorticulus is water without turbidity, with a high pH and a low level of nutrients. The main threats to this snail include land drainage, poor habitat management and eutrophication.

Straub was born in Wiesensteig in Germany and studied in Munich, but he spent most of his career in Austria, first in Vienna, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, and then in Graz, where in 1730 he joined the workshop of the sculptor Johann Jakob Schoy (1686-1733). In 1733, upon the death of Schoy, Straub married the widow of his mentor and took over his workshop. He remained in Graz for the rest of his life. He died there, aged 68. Straub worked primarily in stone and wood in a Rococo style that was deeply influenced by local Styrian traditions.

It was performed in the Great Hall of Whitehall PalaceChapman's masque was not staged in the Whitehall Banqueting House, the normal venue for Court masques, since that facility was set up for Francis Beaumont's The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, which was scheduled for the next day though actually performed on 20 February. on 15 February 1613, as one item in the elaborate festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King James I, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine in the Rhineland. Exoticism The masque had a Virginia theme; Chapman had been a follower of the Prince of Wales, Prince Henry, before Henry's death in November 1612, and Henry had been a strong backer of the movement to colonize the New World. The principal masquers were stylized as Native Americans, \\"Princes of Virginia,\\" though without much representative accuracy: they were dressed in \\"cloth of silver embroidered with gold,\\" with olive-colored masks, though they were also lavishly feathered and equipped with ornaments \\"imitating Indian work\\" ‚Äî an attempt at an effect \\"altogether estrangeful and Indian-like.\\" The conceit was that these sun-worshippers had come to honor the wedding couple and to accept Christianity. The show The celebration began with a torchlit parade down Chancery Lane, headed by fifty gentlemen on horseback, followed by the figures of the anti-masque, boys dressed as baboons in \\"Neapolitan suits and great ruffs,\\" and the musicians and masquers in chariots.Leapman, pp. 130‚Äì1. At Whitehall, Jones's stage set was a golden mountain. Next to it on either side were a silver temple, octagonal and domed, and a hollow tree ‚Äî representing the poles of experience of masque and anti- masque: temple for the masquers, tree for the \\"baboons.\\" The presenters were figures of classical mythology and personifications typical of the masque form: Plutus; a personified Honor, with Eunomia, one of the three Hours, as her priestess; and Capriccio, a Commedia dell'arte-style figure. The golden rock moved forward toward the viewers, then split open to release the anti- masquers. Later the top of the mountain opened to reveal the principal masquers and a crew of torchbearers. The torchbearers danced with torches lit at both ends; then the masquers danced their dances, finally joined by the audience. The general reaction was highly positive, giving the masque a reputation as one of the best-received works of its type in the Stuart era. Sponsorship The masque was sponsored by two of the four Inns of Court, those mentioned in the title. (The other two Inns of Court sponsored their own wedding tribute, The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, by Francis Beaumont.) The records of Lincoln's Inn show that the Inn spent just over ¬£1086 on the masque, charging its members fees ranging from ¬£1 10 shillings to ¬£4 to pay the bill. The records of the Middle Temple are not as complete in their details, though its share of the total bill was likely equal, and its charges were probably very similar. Chapman was paid ¬£100 for his masque, while Robert Johnson earned ¬£45 for his music.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 262. Publication The masque was entered into the Stationers' Register on 27 February 1613; the quarto edition that followed, printed by George Eld for the bookseller George Norton, is undated, but probably was issued as promptly as possible after the masque's performance, to capitalize on public interest. A second edition, also undated, was later issued by Norton.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 260‚Äì1. Chapman dedicated the work to Sir Edward Phelips, the Master of the Rolls, who along with Henry Hobart the Attorney General had been responsible for selecting Chapman as the author and for driving the whole project to a successful completion. Credits Unlike Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones's most common literary partner in masquing, Chapman was a close friend of Jones, and did not engage in the kind of ego competition that Jonson maintained with Jones for some two decades. The masque's printed text shows that Chapman let Jones ‚Äî a man of no small ego himself ‚Äî take the lead in grabbing credit; the title page states that the work was \\"Invented and fashioned, with the ground and special structure of the whole work, by our kingdom's most artful and ingenious architect Inigo Jones. Supplied, applied, digested and written by George Chapman.\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 260 (spelling and punctuation modernized).Leapman, p. 132. Notes Sources * Chambers, E. K.

His process was not an economically feasible method for producing sodium hydroxide though because it could not prevent the chlorine that formed in the brine solution from reacting with its other constituents. Hamilton Castner solved the mixing problem with the invention of the mercury cell and was granted a U.S. patent in 1892 (). Austrian chemist, Karl Kellner arrived at a similar solution at about the same time. In order to avoid a legal battle they became partners in 1895, founding the Castner-Kellner Alkali Company, which built plants employing the process throughout Europe. The mercury cell process continues in use to this day.Chemistry Chronicles Current-day mercury cell plant operations are criticized for environmental release of mercury Chlorine Plants: Major, Overlooked Source of Mercury Pollution, Oceana leading in some cases to severe mercury poisoning as occurred in Japan Minamata_disease. Due to these concerns, mercury cell plants are being phased out, and a sustained effort is being made to reduce mercury emissions from existing plants.WCC Submission to United Nations Environment Program on Reduction of Mercury in the Chlor-alkali sector Process details Castner‚ÄìKellner apparatus The apparatus shown is divided into two types of cells separated by slate walls. The first type, shown on the right and left of the diagram, uses an electrolyte of sodium chloride solution, a graphite anode (A), and a mercury cathode (M). The other type of cell, shown in the center of the diagram, uses an electrolyte of sodium hydroxide solution, a mercury anode (M), and an iron cathode (D). The mercury electrode is common between the two cells. This is achieved by having the walls separating the cells dip below the level of the electrolytes but still allow the mercury to flow beneath them.Newell, Lyman C.; Descriptive Chemistry p. 291; D. C. Heath and company, 1903 The reaction at anode (A) is: :Cl‚àí ‚Üí1/2 Cl2 \\\\+ e‚àí The chlorine gas that results vents at the top of the outside cells where it is collected as a byproduct of the process. The reaction at the mercury cathode in the outer cells is :Na+ \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí Na (amalgam) The sodium metal formed by this reaction dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam. The mercury conducts the current from the outside cells to the center cell. In addition, a rocking mechanism (B shown by fulcrum on the left and rotating eccentric on the right) agitates the mercury to transport the dissolved sodium metal from the outside cells to the center cell. The anode reaction in the center cell takes place at the interface between the mercury and the sodium hydroxide solution. :2Na (amalgam) ‚Üí 2Na+ \\\\+ 2e‚àí Finally at the iron cathode (D) of the center cell the reaction is :2H2O + 2e‚àí ‚Üí 2OH‚àí \\\\+ H2 The net effect is that the concentration of sodium chloride in the outside cells decreases and the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the center cell increases. As the process continues, some sodium hydroxide solution is withdrawn from center cell as output product and is replaced with water. Sodium chloride is added to the outside cells to replace what has been electrolyzed.

History The question of whether the Yishuv would need to defend itself against a possible German invasion rose twice during the Second World War. The first major threat was a German invasion from the north, from the pro-Nazi Vichy regime in control of Syria and Lebanon. This danger ended after Operation Exporter, the allied invasion of these countries on 8 June 1941, and their liberation from Vichy control. In 1942 a more serious threat emerged as the German Afrika Korps, under the command of Erwin Rommel, threatened to overrun British possessions in the Middle East. The \\"200 days of dread\\" ended after the Allied victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein. According to historians Klaus-Michael Mallmann and , based on archival research, Einsatzgruppe Egypt was to carry out a mass killing of the Jewish population in Palestine and Egypt. Despite the word \\"Palestine\\" never being mentioned in the archival documents, the researchers state that the unit's objective was to go there in order to enact systematic mass murder of Jews.Klaus-Michael Mallmann, Martin C√ºppers: ‚ÄûBeseitigung der j√ºdisch- nationalen Heimst√§tte in Pal√§stina.‚Äú Das Einsatzkommando bei der Panzerarmee Afrika 1942.

Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2006, (Ver√∂ffentlichungen der Forschungsstelle Ludwigsburg der Universit√§t Stuttgart, Bd. 7).The unit was standing by in Athens and was ready to disembark for Palestine in the summer of 1942, to be attached to the Afrika Korps. Given its small staff of only 24 men, Mallmann and C√ºppers theorize the unit would have needed help from local residents and from the Afrika Korps to complete their assignment. According to historian Haim Saadon, Director of the Center of Research on North African Jewry in World War II, there was no extermination plan: Rauff's documents show that his foremost concern was assisting the Wehrmacht, and his plan for this was to place the Jews in forced labour camps to achieve this. In relative terms, the North African Jews escaped the Final Solution. The Hebrew term \\"200 days of dread\\" was coined only later by the contemporary journalist Haviv Canaan, as taken from the title of his 1974 book on this period. In 1941‚Äì42 the Haganah was preparing a last stand in the event that the British would retreat from the German army as far as Syria and Iraq. The \\"Plan of the North\\" was also called \\"Masada on the Carmel\\", and \\"Haifa‚ÄìMasada‚ÄìMusah Dag\\".Nachman Ben-Yehuda. Masada Myth: Collective Memory and Mythmaking in Israel.

The community meets up with the Central Business District CBD to the west and south, and residential areas east and north. Location Within the Lawson Suburban Development Area (West Side), the subdivision of the Central Industrial area reaches as far north as 33rd Street East, and is bordered to the west by Idylwyld Drive. The western boundary is just west of the buildings along First Avenue but not inclusive of them, and to the south, just north of the buildings along 24th Street but not inclusive of them. Due to its size the Robin Hood Flour Mill dominates the area. History The industrial area comprising the remnants of the Canadian National Railway train yards and business sector or warehouse district of historical Saskatoon. The Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway reached Saskatoon in 1890 and crossed the South Saskatchewan River, causing a boom in development on the west side of the river. The CNR Bridge (present day site of the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge or Freeway/Idywyld Bridge) crosses the South Saskatchewan River through the city connecting Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. The CNR train yards were moved away from the Central Business District. In 1890 the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway Line (QLLR) or The Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Steamboat and Railway Line (QLLSR) extended from Regina through to Prince Albert, crossing the South Saskatchewan River where the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge crosses the river presently. Steam engines could be refilled easier on the west banks of the river which were not so steep. Businesses sprang up around the pumping station forming the beginnings of the Central Business District.A History of Saskatoon To 1914 URL accessed February 1, 2007 The Saskatoon downtown revitalization project began in the 1950s and 1960s when the Canadian National Railway yards were removed and replaced with a shopping mall (which would be renovated several decades later to resemble the original station) called the Midtown Plaza, and its neighbor the TCU Place.Saskatoon and District Chamber of Commerce South Downtown Taskforce URL accessed February 1, 2007] =CPR switching yards= The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) downtown switching yards are connected to Saskatoon's east side Sutherland Industrial CPR switching yards via the CPR Bridge across the South Saskatchewan River. The City of Saskatoon, Canadian Pacific Railway and the CNR are under negotiations currently to remove these switching yards. This would mean the CPR could use CNR rail lines through the city and be able to use the CN Chappell Yards for switching. Likewise the CNR could run trains along the CPR track through the city and use the Sutherland CPR switching yards. This would involve construction of a connecting switching yard between CP and CN rail lines near 11th Street and Dundonald which could be done as part of the new Circle Drive South Bridge extension project. In the largest area vacated by the CPR yards would be installed a new larger City Police Station. 25th Street would not be truncated, but rather continue in length connecting Idylwyld Drive and the University Bridge or 25th Street Bridge. There would be provision to make a safe intersection of the main CPR railway track and 25th Street crossing.

With the resignation of Emperor Kazan in 986, Tametoki was relieved of all his posts, and devoted his time to educating his son Tametoki went without position for 10 years, in marked contrast to the man who would become Lady Murasaki's husband, who was at one time Tametoki's predecessor on the same job (secretary of Shikibe-j≈ç and chamberlain) yet continued to gain lucrative governorships. Tametoki finally wrote a poem to Emperor Ichij≈ç that so moved the monarch it garnered him governorship of Echizen Province. Lady Murasaki accompanied Tametoki there, though she did not stay for the full four year tenure and returned after 1 or 2 years. Kojidan includes an episode that the governorship of Echizen had already gone to who had to be recalled in order to give way to Tametoki wrested the position away. This so distressed Kunimori he fell ill, and even though he was awarded Harima as replacement, he never recovered and died.This is more fully discussed in :ja:Ëó§ÂéüÁÇ∫ÊôÇ#Ë∂äÂâçÂÆà‰ªªÂÆò„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÈÄ∏Ë©±, including the relevant extract from Kojidan. Tametoki was promoted to the rank of \\"Senior fifth rank, lower grade\\" (Ê≠£‰∫î‰Ωç‰∏ã), and in 1009. Subsequently he was commissioned as governor of Echigo Province in 1011, but his son Nobunori died in Echigo that same year, and her returned to the capital in 1014 before the full term. He became a monk at Mii-dera temple (located in what is now ≈åtsu, Shiga) two years later. Scholars do not agree about the years of Tametoki's birth or death, although some give his death year as 1029.

Michael Idomir Allen (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1983), 198. By her marriage, she became Queen of the West Franks, and then Empress of the Franks. She also served as a regent. Richilde was the daughter of Bivin of Gorze, Count of the Ardennes, and the sister of Boso of Provence (of the Bosonid dynasty). Her aunt was Theutberga, the wife of Lothar II of Lotharingia. Her marriage to Charles the Bald, in 870 after the death of his first wife, Ermentrude of Orl√©ans, was intended to secure his rule in Lotharingia through her powerful family and her connection to Theutberga, the previous Queen consort. She bore him five children, but only the eldest daughter, Rothilde, survived to adulthood. Whenever Charles went to war, Richilde managed the realm, and acted as head of state after the death of Charles in 877. Louis the Stammerer (son of Charles the Bald and Ermentrude of Orl√©ans) died on 10 April 879 while his children were too young to rule on their own. Richilde planned to place her brother Boso, Duke of Burgundy, on the throne. However, she was accused of incest with her brother and the lords of the kingdom refused to subject themselves to her authority. She then helped Boso to become King of Provence. She attempted to assume a position of authority upon the death of Louis III in 882, and of Carloman II in 884; however, the empire was agitated and under threat by the Normans, and the grandees of the realm forced her to withdraw to Provence, then the realm of her nephew Louis the Blind, where she died on 2 June 910.

She appeared in Aag (1948), Patanga (1949), Sheesh Mahal (1950), Mirza Ghalib (1954), Yahudi (1958), Do Kaliyaan (1968), etc. but she is most notably remembered for playing the role of \\"Bahar begum\\" in the historical epic film Mughal-e-Azam (1960). She was the wife of filmmaker K. Asif. She died in May 2000, in Mumbai, India. Early life and education Nigar Sultana was born on June 21, 1932 in Hyderabad, India. She was the youngest daughter of a family of five. She has two brothers and two sisters. She spent her childhood in Hyderabad where her father held the rank of a Major in the Nizam‚Äôs State Army.Nigar Sultana - Interview She went to school for a while and later studied at home. She took part in a school drama on one occasion and ever after was keen on acting. Career The first film Nigar ever saw was Hum Tum Aur Woh (1938). She was so utterly thrilled by it that when Jagdish Sethi, a friend of her father‚Äôs, offered her the lead in a film he was making with Mohan Bhavnani, she took it on the spot. She entered the films with the 1946 film Rangbhoomi. Raj Kapoor's Aag (1948) was her first big break to Bollywood. She played the character role of \\"Nirmala\\", which was equally appreciated by critics and audience. After that, she played character roles in a number of films.Nigar Sultana Profile Portrait of Nigar Sultana Her first big picture was Shikayat (1948), made in Poona; then came Bela (1947), a Ranjit production, and after that many more in which she played leading roles. She played the role of the court dancer \\"Bahar\\", who envies the love of Saleem(played by Dilip Kumar) with Anarkali (played by Madhu Bala) . The songs Teri mehfil mein and jab raat ho aisi matwali were picturised on her. Her other films included Dara (1953) and Khyber. Patanga (1949), Dil Ki Basti (1949), Sheesh Mahal (1950), Khel (1950), Daman (1951), Anand Bhavan (1953), Mirza Ghalib (1954), Tankhah (1956), Durgesh Nandini (1956) and Yahudi (1958) are among her noted movies.

Personal life Portrait of Nigar Sultana from Khel Nigar Sultana married two times. Her first marriage was with producer/director S. M. Yousuf, who migrated to Pakistan in the late 1950s. No children were born of this marriage. In the early 1950s, she was linked with Pakistani actor Darpan Kumar, who was also a Hyderabadi like her.Nigar Sultana with her little girl On 13 June 1954, Nigar Sultana held a press conference specifically to deny reports that she had married the Pakistani actor.Vintage Tidbits ‚Äì Indian actress Nigar Sultana denying reports of her marriage with Pakistani actor Ishrat (Darpan Kumar) Later, Nigar Sultana married K. Asif, producer-director of Mughal-e-Azam (1960). She became his third wife, and one of his previous wives was concurrently married to him.

Asif's second wife had been Sitara Devi, but Asif had divorced her within a few months of marriage and therefore Nigar Sultana never shared her husband with Sitara. Sitara Devi had previously been married to the actor Nazir Ahmed Khan, who was both the first cousin and the brother-in-law of K. Asif. Nazir Ahmed Khan's first wife, Sikandar Begum, was his first cousin and she was the sister of K. Asif. Nigar Sultana and K.

He composed mostly instrumental works, for orchestra, chamber music and piano music, especially pedagogic works. In 1946, he received the Stalin Prize for his first violin concerto, which became known internationally.  Life  Born in Kaluga, Rakov first studied violin at the Rubinstein Music School in his hometown, and later composition at the Moscow Conservatory with Reinhold Gli√®re and Sergei Vasilenko. After graduating in 1931, he served as Gli√®re's assistant at the Conservatory in the following year, before becoming a lecturer himself in 1935 and professor of orchestration in 1943. Rakov's pupils included Edison Denisov, Boris Tchaikovsky, Nikolai Peiko, Andrei Eshpai, and Alfred Schnittke. In addition, he also gave concerts, as a violinist and as a conductor, and wrote several books on problems in orchestration. He received the Stalin Prize in 1946 for his Violin Concerto No. 1 in E minor (1944) and was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1975. He died in Moscow.  Style  Rakov was a staunchly conservative composer who exercised a solid grasp of orchestration and melody; many of his works ventured only a little beyond the style of Alexander Glazunov and Reinhold Gli√®re, though his expressive range is far greater than the latter. Unabashed tonality, late Romantic harmonies, and flowing tunes were the hallmarks of his work, in which the Russian national idiom always took prominence. In his later works, Rakov began to show some interest in Neoclassicism. Rakov devoted special attention to music for children and wrote numerous piano pieces for pedagogical purposes, as well as instructive chamber music. His music has been described as \\"well constructed, thematically appealing\\", with \\"attention to detail. Its expressive range is broad and notable for a vein of romantic lyricism in numerous slow movements. He was also capable of adding an element of lightly etched irony in his shorter works, a quality not typically associated with Soviet composers\\".  Works  Rakov's compositions are mostly instrumental. He composed music for orchestra, including four symphonies, a sinfonietta, suites (Mari Suite), a concert overture, four piano concertos with string orchestra, two violin concertos and a concertino, and a fantasy for clarinet.

The third tropical cyclone, second named storm, and first hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Bertha developed from a frontal low pressure area offshore of North Carolina on July 24\\\\. Initially subtropical, it slowly acquired tropical characteristics while tracked southeast and then southwestward. By early on July 27, the cyclone was re-classified as a tropical depression. Following its transition, the depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bertha on July 28\\\\. The storm then curved northeastward and rapidly strengthened. Bertha became a hurricane early on July 29, though it weakened back to a tropical storm later that day. On the following day, Bertha re-intensified into a hurricane and peaked as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane on July 31\\\\. Early on August 2, Bertha made landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia while weakening and transitioning back into an extratropical cyclone. Large waves impacted the East Coast of the United States; waves were reported along the coast of North Carolina. In Florida, rough seas caused two fatalities by drowning, as well as at least 200 lifeguard rescues. Seven other drowning deaths occurred offshore when the S.S. Corazon sank near Cape Cod. Minimal impact occurred on Bermuda, limited to mainly tropical storm force wind gusts. In Canada, strong winds caused moderate crop damage on Prince Edward Island and collapsed a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia. Rainfall caused minor flooding in the region. Overall, Bertha caused nine fatalities and approximately $3.91 million (1990 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A cold front moved eastward through the United States in the middle part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July 23\\\\. By the following day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July 25\\\\. Convection developed closer to the center of circulation as it gradually decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July 27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335 miles (539.1 km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. Upon transitioning into a tropical cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, and based on ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July 28\\\\. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July 29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July 29, with the center exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States. Operationally, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center speculated whether Bertha was transitioning into a subtropical cyclone, due to its deep convection being located, at times, over 200 miles (321.8 km) from the center. However, the convection progressively returned to the center and by late on July 30, Bertha re-intensified into a hurricane as the convection covered the center, about 415 miles (667.8 km) east of where it first formed. Early on July 31, the hurricane briefly attained peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) before weakening and accelerated northeastward as the ridge of high pressure was slowly eroded. Bertha maintained hurricane status as it approached Atlantic Canada, and briefly reached winds of 80 mph (129 km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia on August 1 as a 70 mph (113 km/h) tropical storm. The storm was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while approaching Atlantic Canada, and lost all tropical characteristics shortly after moving ashore. The weakening extratropical remnants of Bertha turned northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and lost its identity shortly thereafter. Preparations and Impact Image of Hurricane Bertha The formation of Bertha in close proximity of the East Coast of the United States prompted residents to stock up on emergency supplies and monitor the storm. The Maritimes Weather Center and National Hurricane Center began to issue warnings for Nova Scotia and most of Atlantic Canada on July 31 and August 1. By the following day, all warnings and advisories for Atlantic Canada were dropped as Bertha dissipated. Bertha's broad circulation produced high waves which were reported along the southeastern coast of the United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25‚Äì50 ft (7.6-15.2 m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200 other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous sliding glass doors and exhausted several air conditioners. Offshore, several ships came in contact with Bertha, many reported sustained winds of 35-58 mph (56‚Äì93 km/h) and a Canadian ship reported a barometric pressure of . The only reported shipwreck caused by Bertha was when the Corazon, a Greek freighter capsized and sank during the storm. The ship, which was off the coast of Cape Cod at the time of its sinking, was experiencing strong winds up to 78 mph (126 km/h) and 30 feet (9.1 m) waves. The rough seas caused the ship's keel to break, causing the crewmen to send a distress signal and evacuate the sinking vessel. During the evacuation, one crewman drowned when trying to board a lifeboat, his body was later found by a Soviet merchant ship. Another merchant ship, the Vyapel, spotted twelve of the 27 sailors in their liferaft and the crew of the Vyapel tried to rescue the sailors but to no avail as the rough seas caused the liferaft to drift near the ships propeller and rudder area. The turbulence caused by the ships propeller knocked seven sailors into the water, five of them drowned and a search for their bodies continued until the following day. The remaining 21 sailors were later rescued by crews of other freighters and merchant ships. An investigation by the United States Coast Guard revealed that the Corazon's lifeboats were in too poor of a condition to use in case of an emergency. Initially, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of Bertha impacting Bermuda. However, the storm bypassed Bermuda, which caused only minor effects on the island; limited to rough seas and wind gusts reaching 45 mph (72 km/h). In Atlantic Canada, Bertha brought strong tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall. Two weather stations in Baddeck, Nova Scotia and Hunter's Mountain recorded 7 inches (177.8 mm) of rainfall. In Prince Edward Island, the storm produced a wind gust of 71 mph (115 km/h) and 4.72 inches (101.6 mm) of rain. A weather station in Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador reported a wind gust of 63 mph (102 km/h) and 2.51 inches (50 mm) of rain. The high winds brought by Bertha caused moderate damage to tobacco and corn crops in Prince Edward Island and damaged a suspension bridge in Nova Scotia. Heavy rainfall from Bertha caused minimal flooding at a golf course. In Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia, six people were injured when waves from Bertha washed them into the sea. Damage was estimated at $4.427 million (1990 CAD, $3.912 million 1990 USD).

This galaxy has slightly more mass than our Milky Way. It was detected on 2 March 2007. Structure This unique spiral galaxy, which is situated 3.2 billion light-years from the Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars. It rushes at 3.5 million km/h through the cluster Abell 2667 and therefore, like a comet, shows a tail, with a length of 600,000 light-years. Galaxy fate The –°omet Galaxy is currently being ripped to pieces, moving through a cluster at speeds of greater than 2 million mph. As the galaxy speeds through, its gas and stars are being stripped away by the tidal forces exerted by the cluster - just as the tidal forces exerted by the Moon and Sun push and pull the Earth's oceans. Also contributing to this destructive process is the pressure of the cluster's hot gas plasma reaching temperatures as high as 100 million degrees. Scientists estimate that the total duration of the transformation process is close to one billion years. What is seen now in the Hubble's image is roughly 200 million years into the process. Even though the Comet Galaxy's mass is slightly greater than the Milky Way, it will lose all its gas and dust, and so not be able to generate stars later in life. It will become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars. During the ram pressure stripping process, the charged particles strip and push away the infalling galaxy's gas, just as the solar wind of charged particles pushes ionized gas away from a comet to create a gas tail. For this reason the scientists have nicknamed the stretched spiral the \\"comet galaxy.\\" \\"This unique galaxy, situated 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, has an extended stream of bright blue knots and diffuse wisps of young stars driven away by the tidal forces and the ram pressure stripping of the hot dense gas,\\" said Jean-Paul Kneib, a study collaborator from the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille. The image of the Comet Galaxy by Hubble helped show that huge gravitational interactions between galaxies in massive clusters cause tremendous damage to the structure of a galaxy, and the amount of gas they have. Galaxies near the center of clusters experience the most damage of all, which galaxies at the outskirts are relatively unharmed. The galaxy collisions can distort the shape of galaxies, and even fling out ‚Äúhomeless stars‚Äù into intergalactic space. Even though its mass is slightly larger than that of the Milky Way, the spiral will inevitably lose all its gas and dust as well as its chance of generating new stars later, and become a gas-poor galaxy with an old population of red stars. The finding sheds light on the process by which gas-rich galaxies might evolve into gas-poor galaxies over billions of years. The new observations also reveal one mechanism for forming of ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù stars seen scattered throughout galaxy clusters. The strong gravitational pull exerted by the galaxy cluster's collective mass has bent the light of other, more distant galaxies and distorted their shapes - an effect called gravitational lensing. The giant bright banana-shaped arc seen just to the left of the cluster center corresponds to the magnified and distorted image of a distant galaxy located behind the cluster's core.

Similar in appearance to Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 model \\"Hi-Power\\" pistol, the BDM was actually a new design created to compete in service trials for a proposal as a standard issue pistol for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). However, the BDM was ultimately not adopted for purchase and issue by the FBI, so was instead sold only in the commercial market. Design The Browning BDM was developed in 1991 by the Browning Arms Company, and unlike Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 Hi-Power model, was manufactured only in North America, in Utah and Montreal. Having a similar profile to the Browning P-35 Hi-Power, the BDM and its variants are often conflated as mere variants of the much older P-35 model, or other newer Browning or FN Herstal pistols that were updated variants of the P-35, such as the Hi-Power DAO. The BDM pistol is a magazine-fed, self-loading, hammer- firing type which was designed with a trigger \\"mode\\" switch installed on the left-hand side of the slide (actually only a flush inlaid disk with a bisecting groove), toggling between double-action/single-action (DA/SA) pistol mode, and the double-action-only (DAO) or \\"revolver\\" mode‚Äîthough, of course, other than the similarity of the trigger mode, the BDM has no resemblance to revolvers. This mode switch is what gives the handgun its name, with BDM standing for \\"Browning Dual Mode\\" or \\"Browning Double Mode\\". Variants of the BDM lacked the mode operating switch, and so were either full-time \\"revolver\\" mode, such as the model BRM-DAO (Browning Revolver Mode - Double Action Only), or full-time double-action/single-action pistol mode, model BPM-D (Browning Pistol Mode - Decocker). Finishes included blued, matte-chromed (which Browning advertising called \\"silver chrome\\"), and a two-toned combination of a silver chromed frame and blued slide, called the \\"practical\\" finish. The BDM and BPM-D variant have an ambidextrous frame-mounted safety/decocker lever, which when operated returns the pistol to the hammer-down, pre-cocked \\"safe\\" condition. Unless the hammer is manually pulled rearward into the cocked position, the usual first shot of a series requires only a relatively longer and heavier double-action trigger pull. Each subsequent cartridge can then be fired by a lighter, shorter single-action trigger pull, until the hammer is reset to the down and \\"safe\\" position by depressing the safety/decocker lever. The BRM-DAO variant lacks a safety/decocker lever, returning the hammer to the down and \\"safe\\" position after every shot fired. Operating the trigger of the BRM-DAO variant is the same as operating the double-action trigger pull (usually the first round fired of a series) of the BDM and BPM-D models. However, because the hammer of the BRM-DAO model automatically returns to the down and \\"safe\\" condition after every shot, the BRM-DAO is a full-time \\"double-action only\\" (DAO) pistol. All trigger pulls for the BRM-DAO are essentially consistent. The BDM and its variants utilize within the pistol's grip a removable box magazine, of the double-stack variety with a capacity of 10 or 15 rounds of 9√ó19mm Parabellum ammunition. To comply with the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, BDM magazines were initially limited to 10-round capacity for civilian purchasers, although 15-round magazines were available for law enforcement use. After the 2004 expiration of the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, 15-round magazines became legal and available in most states for civilian use. The Browning BDM, BPM-D, and BRM-DAO were noted for being among the narrowest full-sized 9x19mm pistols ever manufactured (even more narrow than the Browning or FN Herstal Hi-Power models) which made them easier to conceal and to operate by persons with smaller hands.

The Puget Sound mosquito fleet was a multitude of private transportation companies running smaller passenger and freight boats on Puget Sound and nearby waterways and rivers. This large group of steamers and sternwheelers plied the waters of Puget Sound, stopping at every waterfront dock. The historical period defining the beginning and end of the mosquito fleet is ambiguous, but the peak of activity occurred between the First and Second World Wars. Beginnings Puget Sound and the many adjacent waterways, inlets, and bays form a natural transportation route for much of the western part of Washington. For navigation purposes, Puget Sound was sometimes divided into the \\"upper Sound\\" referring to the waters south of the Tacoma Narrows, and the lower sound, referring to the waters from the Tacoma Narrows north to Admiralty Inlet. The first steamboat to operate on Puget Sound was the Beaver, starting in the late 1830s. Beaver was a sidewheeler built in London, which reached the Northwest under sail, with her paddle wheels dismantled. In 1853, Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company brought a new steam-powered vessel into the area, the Otter, a propeller-driven bark. The Native Americans traversed Puget Sound in well-built cedar canoes, as they had for thousands of years, and for some time so did the American settlers, who only began to arrive in very small numbers in 1846. In 1851, Olympia became the only formal American town on Puget Sound. In November 1851, the schooner Exact disembarked passengers at Alki Point, which was the beginning of the city of Seattle. In February 1852, three of the settlers, Arthur A. Denny, C.D. Boren, and William N. Bell, took soundings on the east side of Elliott Bay, found the water to be deep enough near the shore to form a port, and staked land claims along the water. The first American steamboat on Puget Sound was the sidewheeler Fairy built in San Francisco in 1852. Captain Warren Gove, born in Edgecomb, Maine, in 1816 (one of three Gove brothers involved in early maritime affairs) brought Fairy to Puget Sound on the deck of the bark Sarah Warren and lowered her into the sound on October 31, 1853. Fairy was the first steamboat on Puget Sound to have a formal schedule, published for the first time on November 12, 1853, in the Columbian newspaper of Olympia. The \\"splendid steamer\\" Fairy, as she was advertised, was supposed to make two trips a week between Olympia and Steilacoom, and one trip a week from Olympia to Seattle. Fares were high, $5 for Olympia-Steilacoom, and $10 for Olympia-Seattle. Fairy, however, proved unseaworthy in the rougher winter weather in the lower sound, and after a few runs from Olympia to the then small village of Seattle was eventually replaced by a sailing schooner, which ran irregularly and, more predictably, by mail and passenger canoes. These were owned and crewed by the First Nations. In those days, at least two days and often three were needed to make the trip from Seattle to Olympia, and travellers camped on the beach at night. (Following her failure on the upper sound, Fairy was placed on the much shorter Olympia-Fort Steilacoom run, until 1857, when her boiler exploded. No one was killed, but that was the end of her.) The next steamboat on the Sound was the Major Tompkins, which arrived on September 16, 1854. Tompkins (151 tons and long) was an iron-hulled steamer with a propeller, built at Philadelphia in 1847, and somehow brought around South America to California, where she had collected gold from gold seekers during the great California gold rush. Paid off by her California competitors in a typical monopolistic deal of the era, Major Tomkins was sitting idle at the dock in San Francisco in 1854 when she was bought by Capt. James M. Hunt and John M. Scranton, who brought her north to Puget Sound. Once she arrived, the Pumpkins, as the locals called her, made her very slow way (about 5 miles per hour) among Olympia, Seattle, Victoria, and other places, carrying mail, freight, and passengers. Pumpkins was lost at Victoria, blown ashore in a squall following a mistake in navigation; all aboard reached safety in a narrow escape. Effect of Fraser River Gold Rush Other boats were brought in during these early times, including Traveler, Constitution, the diminutive Water Lily, Daniel Webster, Sea Bird, and the steeple-engined Wilson G. Hunt, none of them succeeding particularly well until the Fraser River Gold Rush in 1858. Puget Sound then became a shipping point for supplies and goldseekers, and the steamboats profited well. Bellingham Bay was one jumping-off point for the rush, which was handicapped by the almost complete lack of roads or paths into the mainland of British Columbia at the time, and boats were also brought in to carry miners from Victoria to the mainland, and thereafter up the Fraser River. Rise of steam navigation Teaser in foreground In the 1860s and the 1870s, many new steamboats, most built of wood, were brought in to the area or built. One of the earliest, and most famous boats was the sidewheeler, Eliza Anderson. Her owners equipped Eliza Anderson with a steam calliope which blasted out a variety of tunes, including (to the irritation of Canadians when she operated north of the border) \\"Yankee Doodle\\" and \\"Star Spangled Banner\\". Other boats began to appear, and by 1864, J.B. Libby, Mary Woodruff, Pioneer, Alexandra, and Jenny Jones had all appeared on the sound. Steamboat operations were still irregular and unsatisfactory to the general public, as shown by a newspaper commentary of the day: > It has been generally supposed by everybody that steamboating on this Sound > was an unprofitable business, and that without mail subsidies and such like > emoluments it was scarcely possible for even a single steamer to make weekly > trips and pay expenses. ... We do know, however, that several steamers, > large and small, are constantly plying the Sound, and even with their > annoying irregularity and the competition among them, they manage to keep > afloat, continue in trade, and the owners of some evince a degree of > disrespect for popular favor very indicative of plenty of business and fat > purses. ... The arrivals and departures of steamers at both ends of the > route, as well as way ports, seem especially arranged to discomfort, rather > than accommodate the public. Steamers come and go like a thief in the night, > and no man knows the day or the hour. After spending a whole week of > sleepless nights, waiting and watching for boats, passengers frequently have > to make two-forty time, in their stockings and nightcaps, to reach the > landings before the steamer shoves out. Though they take a whole week to > make a twenty-four-hour voyage, they hurry in and out of a way port as if > the devil or a sheriff was after them, and the people generally are > beginning to indulge the hope that one or the other of those persons may > speedily catch and keep them.The Seattle Gazette, August 20, 1864 In April 1866, the sidewheeler Cyrus Walker arrived in the sound under Capt. A.B. Gove. Seattle residents, predominantly male and apparently hard-drinking, mistook her for the promised ship full of brides that Asa Mercer was supposed to be bringing from the east coast. Supposedly a tug, Cyrus Walker also carried freight and passengers; in those days on the sound, no firm distinction was necessarily drawn between steam tugs and other steam-driven craft. Eliza Anderson was still dominating the main route on the sound at the time, which was the Olympia to Victoria run. Slow but cheap to operate, the Eliza bested all competitors, including Josie McNear, New World, and the oddly designed (as a result of her steeple engine) Wilson G. Hunt Boom time King & Winge shipyard, in West Seattle, looking south, circa 1915 (but possibly earlier): The sternwheeler Vashon is on the marine railway at right. The lookout tower of the original clubhouse of the Seattle Yacht Club, originally just south of the shipyard, can also be seen. The Eliza's monopoly on the main route was broken in 1869, when first she was taken off the main route. Her owners led by Captain Finch, replaced her with the newer Olympia. To make matters worse, the mail contract which had sustained Eliza was awarded to a firm of upstart competitors, led first by Captain Nash, and then by his financiers the Starrs, who had found the cash to buy the Varuna and build the sidewheeler Alida and the propeller Tacoma in the water. A fare war broke out, and on June 23, 1871, the Starrs brought into Puget Sound the then-new sidewheeler North Pacific to run against the Olympia. When North Pacific proved faster than Eliza, the fare war was ended with the customary anticompetitive agreement, whereby the Starrs would pay Finch for keeping the Eliza and Olympia at the dock. Captain Geo. E. Starr died in 1876, but his company survived him, and built in 1879 the sidewheeler George E. Starr named in his honor. By the 1880s and 1890s, the population the Puget Sound region had risen greatly, and steamboat technology had also improved. Many new and fast vessels were launched, such as the sternwheelers Greyhound and Bailey Gatzert and the famous propeller steamer Flyer. Roads were still poor, and of course as yet no automobiles. The water route was the preferred way to travel between the cities on the sound. In 1890, for example, regular daily service began between Tacoma and Seattle with the Greyhound. In the early 1900s, larger and more durable steel-hulled boats were either built at Puget Sound shipyards, like the Tacoma (launched 1913) or brought in from other areas, like Indianapolis, Iroquois, and Chippewa. The Tacoma could make the run from Seattle to Tacoma in 77 minutes dock to dock. Navigation Galbraith Dock (Pier 3), Seattle, circa 1912, Vashonian in center, Norwood at right Over 40 different steamboat routes were on Puget Sound. While steamboats were shifted from route to route, also a strong tendency existed for vessels to be run on the same route for a long period of time, and in fact many vessels were purpose-built for a particular route. Some of the reasons for this were economic, as high-passenger routes, such as the Seattle-Port Orchard or the Seattle-Tacoma routes might justify one or even several high-speed passenger- only vessels, like Tacoma, Flyer, or Athlon. Others, like the East Pass route of the Virginia V, warranted a mixed-use passenger/freight/mail boat. One important consideration which will not necessarily be obvious in modern times of radar, GPS, and depth-sounders, is the degree to which navigational skill and experience on a particular route played in making sure each run was completed safely and profitably: the steamboats could not stop running at night or in bad weather. Heavy fog was particularly hazardous, and could come any time of year. Once a steamboat was in a fog bank, a captain would have to reckon very carefully from his experience on the run just where his boat was. With no radar, captains proved remarkably adept at determining their position with echoes from the steamboat's whistle. Sound travels at about 1,080 feet per second in a fog bank, and rounding off to 1,000 feet for safety, that meant that if an echo was heard one second after the whistle blast, the steamboat was 500 feet from shore. The maritime historian Jim Faber well- summarized the degree of detail that an experienced crew could deduce by echo location: An experienced captain needed years of navigation on a particular route to be able to safety pilot his boat through a fog bank or a dark, rainy night using this method. This, of course, made it difficult simply to put a new boat on a particular route without a crew with strong local experience. Selected routes and landings Seattle waterfront 1907, showing in foreground sternwheeler Skagit Queen Multnomah at dock at Three Tree Point, Puget Sound, Washington, sometime before 1909 Multnomah (on right) and S.G. Simpson (left) at dock in Olympia, circa 1911, with unidentified smaller steamer approaching at far left =Olympia= Olympia's main steamboat landing was Percival Dock. In 1910, boats operating from this dock included the then- new gasoline-engined tug Sandman, the Foss launch Lark, and the mail boat Mizpah. The sternwheeler Multnomah also came to Percival Dock on her Seattle- Tacoma-Olympia route. =Shelton= The little sternwheeler Willie (67 feet long) was built at Seattle in 1883 for the Samish River service. In 1886, Capt. Ed Gustafson bought her and put her on the Olympia-Shelton route. In 1895, Captain Gustafson replaced her with the City of Shelton, and Willie went north of the border to serve on the Fraser River. =Hood Canal= In 1899, service to Hood Canal from Seattle's Pier 3 (now Pier 54) was effected by the propeller steamer Dode. A typical wooden boat of the mosquito fleet, the 99-foot Dode left Seattle every Tuesday on the run to Kingston, Port Gamble, Seabeck, Brinnon, Holly, Dewatto, Lilliwaup Falls, Hoodsport, and at the end of what must have been a long day, Union City. The next morning, she returned to Seattle on the same route. Safety and shipwrecks =Crew safety= Safety was a constant issue for steamboats. Some vessels, particularly the later steel-hulled ones, had perfect safety records. This was not always true, and the lives of both passengers and crew were often endangered. Many instances of crewmen falling off vessels and drowning occurred. Crew did not wear life preservers, as is now required on all riverine vessels. For example, in the case of the Mizpah, the engineer went on deck, apparently slipped, fell overboard, and was drowned. Another case was that of Captain O.A. Anderson, a Port Townsend pilot who fell from a ladder in rough seas in late December, 1912, when trying to board the steamship Setos from the pilot launch. =Fire= after a fire that killed more than 1,000 people A great danger to all wooden boats was fire. One of the worst disasters in all shipping history was the fire in New York harbor of the General Slocum on June 15, 1904, in which more than 1,000 people died. While the General Slocum was a large vessel, similar sized wooden boats were on Puget Sound and the Columbia River (for example, Alaskan, Olympian, and in particular Yosemite, which routinely boarded more than 1,000 passengers), where on a busy day or a crowded excursion such a death toll could have occurred. Hunter, one of the premier historians of steamboats on the Mississippi-Ohio-Missouri river systems, well summarized the causes of fire in wooden steam craft: The cause of fire can be readily seen when one considers that in the midst of this pile of oil-soaked wood was placed the biggest furnace that could be afforded by the owner, capped with an enormous smokestack to generate the maximum amount of draft for the fire. Added to this was the risk, in the days before electric light, associated with oil and kerosene lanterns and other sources of ignition. Many vessels were destroyed by fire, two examples being Mizpah and Urania. =Collisions= Collisions were also too common, when steamboats continued to operate in fog or night, without radar or other modern navigation aids, and often caused greater loss of life than fire. Unlike fire, which often could be fought until the vessel reached a beach where passengers and crew could evacuate,In the General Slocum fire, where more than 1,000 people died, the captain was criticized sharply for continuing on course instead of running his ship ashore collisions came suddenly. Where a substantial difference existed between the size or construction of the vessels, such as steel against wooden hull, destruction could be quick. Thus, on the night of November 18, 1906, the small, lightly built passenger steamer Dix (130 tons), designed specifically for the very short run across Elliott Bay from Seattle to Alki Point, collided with the much larger steam schooner Jeanie. The night was clear, and the collision seems to have been caused by an error of the Dix's unlicensed mate, who had the wheel while the captain, consistent with the practice of the day, collected the fares. Though the collision speed was small, Dix was lightly built and top-heavy; she quickly heeled over, filled with water, and sank in 103 fathoms, taking 45 people down with her, including her mate. The wreck was so deep that no bodies could be recovered. Similarly, but less tragically, the wooden sternwheeler Multnomah was rammed (also in Elliott Bay, scene of much marine traffic) by the much larger, steel-hulled, express passenger Iroquois on October 28, 1911, sinking Multnomah in 240 feet of water, but with no one killed. =Safety measures= Loss of the Clallam By 1904, the causes of shipping losses were well-known and safety measures had been established by law, and enforced by the U. S. Steamboat Inspection Service. Each vessel's certificate stated how many lifeboats, fire axes, and similar items were supposed to be carried. Yet, that year had the tragic loss of life on the Clallam, which left Seattle bound for Victoria on January 8, 1904, under the command of Capt. George Roberts. A storm came up as she neared Victoria, and she started taking on water. When her pumps failed (apparently they actually brought water into the vessel rather than evacuating it), her boiler fire was extinguished by the rising water, and she lost all power, save for an emergency sail. The captain ordered three lifeboats launched, and put into them the women and children, yet no ship‚Äôs officers went on board to command the boats in the rough seas. All three boats were lost with all the passengers on them. Clallam stayed afloat long enough to be found by rescuers, but even so, 54 lives were lost. Serious ship handling and mechanical defects seemed to have caused the loss of the Clallam, and the license of her master, George Roberts, a 29-year veteran steamboat man, was suspended, and that of her chief engineer was revoked. The supply of signalling rockets also seemed to be insufficient. Crackdown by steamboat inspectors Following the Clallam disaster, a crack-down on violations of the steamboat safety regulations began, which seems to have been widely ignored. At Port Townsend, following a surprise inspection of the steamer Garland on February 6, 1904, these defects were found: *No relieving tackle on the tiller (this was necessary to steer the vessel in case of wheel failure or loss of the main steering ropes through fire) *No ladders or stairways to the hurricane deck where the fire buckets and lifeboats were kept *Fewer fire buckets than required by the vessel‚Äôs certificate, and no water in many of what firebuckets were on board *Fewer fire axes than required by her certificate *Life raft had no designation on it of the number of persons it was supposed to carry in an emergency *Lifeboats and launching gear generally in poor condition Similar conditions were found on the same day on the Prosper, and to a lesser degree on the Alice Gertude and the Whatcom, although they were referred for special boiler inspections. The inspections and fines assessed on these four vessels were just part of a campaign by the inspectors to enforce the regulations on all steam craft operating in Puget Sound. By February 17, 1904, 16 more vessels, including some well-known ones, had been inspected, found deficient, and fined for similar reasons, and in addition failure to maintain adequate fog horns and not providing sufficient written instructions to passengers as to the location of life preservers. Vessels found deficient included the well-known George E. Starr, Rosalie, and Athlon. All of the many defects found by the steamboat inspectors on Puget Sound were typical of the lax standards of the day, which contributed to the horrible death toll in the loss by fire of the General Slocum. This loss, which occurred while the General Slocum was packed with a crowd for an excursion, produced swift results on Puget Sound, as inspectors strictly counted the total numbers of persons boarded on each vessel, and gave notice that remissions of fines for equipment defects would be no more. (By custom, heavy fines imposed on steamboats would be remitted upon a showing of compliance by the vessel's owners.) Conversion to ferries and decline As automobile ownership rose and highways and roads improved, passenger travel fell off. Many boats were converted to automobile ferries, the first being the Bailey Gatzert. Others were eventually just abandoned on beaches or never repaired after a wreck or a mechanical breakdown. Some, like the Magnolia, were converted into towboats. Others had different fates. Arcadia, the last passenger vessel (capacity 275 passengers, 100 tons freight) operating between Tacoma and upper Puget Sound landings under the command of Capt. Bernt Bertson, was sold to the federal government for use as a tender for the federal prison on McNeil Island, where she was renamed J.E. Overlade. This was not the end of Arcadia, however, as in 1959, she was bought back from the federal government by Puget Sound Excursion Lines, renamed Virginia VI, and placed in the excursion business with the Virginia V then under the same ownership. Nicknames and popular verse Seattle waterfront, circa 1912, showing piers and a variety of vessels alongside, including boats of the mosquito fleet Steamboats attracted a lot of nicknames, not all of them complimentary. As mentioned, the Tomkins was called the Pumpkins. The Greyhound was called the Hound, the Pup and the Dog. Wealleale was known to all as Weary Willie. The Robert Duinsmere, originally as a sidewheel steamer in Canada for the Vancouver-Nanaimo route, was later rebuilt as propeller collier, thereby suffering the misfortune of becoming known as the Dirty Bob. The City of Shelton, lacking a spray guard over her paddlewheel, was called Old Wet-Butt by crew of the propeller Marian, her competitor on the Olympia- Shelton route. And in the 1920s, Barely-Gets-There was the appellation for the once-sleek Bailey Gatzert sponsoned-out as she was to carry as many autos as could be loaded on her, and made more ugly yet with the addition of a loading elevator on her foredeck. The sidewheeler George E. Starr lasted from 1879 to 1911, and slowed down to the point where a song was composed about her: William J. Fitzgerald, who later became Seattle's fire chief, at age 8 was said to have composed a little tribute to two Seattle pioneers and two famous steamboats as: Final years Nisqually (later Astorian), 1912, an example of a later express passenger boat A single \\"last voyage\\" of the mosquito fleet never occurred, in contrast to the famous last runs of the Georgie Burton in 1947 on the Columbia or the Moyie on Kootenay Lake in 1957. Races were staged up through the 1950s, and a few revivals on a few runs, even as late as the Second World War. By the late 1920s, though, automobiles and highways had filled the transportation needs that steamboats had once supplied, and in 1930, the Tacoma made her last run on the Seattle-Tacoma route, under the command of Captain Everett D. Coffin, the only skipper she had ever had . This marked the real end of commercial passenger activity for the steamboats. Newell and Williamson documented the occasion: > The Tacoma and the Indianapolis passed a little south of Three Tree Point. > ... Capt. Coffin pulled down a window and leaned out in the driving rain. > The Indianapolis floated by, a dozen squares of light topped by a star. She > spoke; three long, lingering blasts. ... Capt. Coffin reached for his own > whistle cord. Three long blasts. And he let the last blast die away slowly, > until it was only a moan in the throat of the whistle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the last time > we pass each other,‚Äù he said. When Tacoma arrived at her dock in Tacoma harbor that last night, every ship in the port blew three blasts on their whistles as a salute. Andrew Foss, owner of the great Foss tug concern, sent Foss No. 17 to help Tacoma make her landing, though two years had passed since Tacoma could afford the help of a tug. As she left that last time on her return to Seattle, Tacoma passed the hull of the Greyhound, once the fastest boat on the sound and now, minus her upper works, engines, and sternwheel, in her last service as a mudscow. Legacy Virginia V, at Olympia, Washington, July 4, 1996 The Washington State Ferries system now runs on many of the routes of the mosquito fleet, of which the fine steamer Virginia V, newly restored, is one of the last remaining vessels. The oldest remaining vessel is the motor vessel Carlisle II, built in Bellingham in 1917 and still in regular revenue service between Bremerton and Port Orchard for Kitsap Transit. Of the other little ships, Gordon Newell, one of their greatest historians, wrote: As a modern reminder of the little ships, in 2001, Kitsap County inventoried all the many landings and docks of the mosquito fleet on Bainbridge Island and the Kitsap Peninsula, and developed the Kitsap County Mosquito Fleet Trail for bicycles and foot traffic. Presently, Kitsap Transit operates a passenger-only ferry between Port Orchard and Bremerton. The Carlisle II has been designated as a floating museum. It is one of few mosquito fleet-era ferries operating on Puget Sound today. It runs every half-hour beginning on the hour and half-hour on the Port Orchard side and 15 and 45 minutes after the hour on the Bremerton side. One- way fare is $2.00. Return of the mosquito fleet Occasionally, talk of restoring the mosquito fleet revives, which in modern parlance has become known as the \\"passenger-only ferry\\", although apparently not much has come of these ideas, as they seem to be dependent on public funding or subsidies. (Although not necessarily a subsidy, since they were getting paid the going rate for the work, the first mosquito fleet was heavily supported by mail carriage contracts.) Some movement towards this may be happening. In August 2007, the city of Kingston received a $3.5 million grant from the federal government to cover at least some of the costs of building a terminal and a passenger-only ferry between Kingston and Seattle. In April 2007, the countywide The King County Ferry District was formed to expand transportation options for county residents through passenger ferry services. The district board is composed of all nine members of the Metropolitan King County Council. On July 1, 2008, the KCFD took over the operations of two existing passenger- ferry services and considered up to five new routes. In 2015 the district was absorbed into the county Department of Transportation. Kitsap County voted in 2016 to subsidize three passenger ferries to Seattle. One, a low wake catamaran started service in July 2017 with six round trips daily, three in the morning and three in the afternoon. Service from Kingston to downtown Seattle began November 26, 2018 with three round trips each in the morning and afternoon. Previously riders from Kingston arrived in Edmonds and must take ground transportation from Edmonds to Seattle. One more route from Southworth to downtown Seattle will begin in 2020. These join two other mosquito routes, Bremerton to Port Orchard and Bremerton to Annapolis.

She was built at John Brown & Company shipyards in Clydebank, Scotland. When construction started in 1941 she was intended as a merchant ship, but was completed and launched as an escort carrier, entering service at the end of 1943. Nairana operated escorting convoys and doing anti- submarine work in the Atlantic and Arctic theatres. On 26 May 1944, Royal Navy Sea Hurricanes operating from Nairana claimed the destruction of three Junkers Ju 290s during the defence of a convoy. This represented 10 percent of the total German inventory of the type. She survived the war, and in 1946 was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy as the Karel Doorman (QH1), the first Dutch aircraft carrier. In 1948, she was replaced in the Royal Netherlands Navy by another vessel of the same name. Nairana was returned to the Royal Navy, and sold to the Port Line company, becoming the merchant ship Port Victor. Design and description The Nairanas were a class of three escort carriers built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War.Cocker (2008), pp.76‚Äì78 Escort carriers were designed to protect convoys of merchant ships from U-boat and aircraft attack.Poolman (1972), p.155. Following the successful conversion and operation of , the Admiralty decided to take over three more merchant ships while they were still under construction and convert them into escort carriers.Poolman (1972), p.111. The three ships chosen were being built at three different shipyards Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland, Swan Hunter in England and John Brown & Company in Scotland. The prototype was built by John Brown who supplied the other two companies with copies of the plans. The three ships were supposed to be identical but in reality they were all slightly different. HMS Nairana‚Äîbuilt by John Brown was launched on 20 May 1943 and completed on 12 December 1943.Poolman (1972), pp.111‚Äì112. She had a complement of 728 men and displaced . Her other dimensions were a length of , a beam of and a draught of .Cocker (2008), p.77. Her aircraft facilities included a flight deck, a hangar measuring , eight arrestor wires and an aircraft lift measuring . She had a traditional rivetted hull, steel flight decks and a closed hangar.Poolman (1972), p.112. Propulsion was provided by diesel engines connected to two shafts giving , which could propel the ship at . Her armaments concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two dual purpose guns on a twin mount, sixteen AA autocannons on eight twin mounts and sixteen 2-Pounder \\"Pom Pom\\" AA guns on four quadruple mounts. Aircraft assigned were either anti-submarine or fighter aircraft, which could be made up of a mixture of Hawker Sea Hurricanes, Grumman Martlets or Fairey Swordfish.Cocker (2008), p.80. Service history Nairana was commissioned in December 1943, and moved to Gourock for working up.Poolman (1972), p.114. Nairana with 835 Naval Air Squadron Fleet Air Arm on board commenced flying exercises with Activity on 27 January 1944. Both carriers left the River Clyde on 29 January with the 2nd Escort Group under the command of Captain Frederic John Walker. They were to form a \\"hunter killer group\\" in the waters west of Ireland, providing cover for two southbound convoys OS 66 and KMS 70. Weather conditions had prohibited flying until 31 January. With clearer weather Nairana turned into the wind to send off her first anti- submarine patrol. At the same time, reported contact with a submerged U-boat on her ASDIC. Warning Nairana that she had just turned into danger, the carrier took avoiding action. was sunk by Wild Goose and Walker's own ship , while a Fairey Swordfish from Nairana circled the area.Poolman (1972), p.115. At the end of May 1944, Nairana sailed with the 15th Escort Group. Her air group was still 835 Naval Air Squadron equipped with nine Swordfish and six Sea Hurricanes. The Swordfish patrolled day and night and some contacts were made on the air to surface vessel radar (ASV). All the contacts came to nothing; it is now known the older model ASV in Nairanas Swordfish could be detected by receivers on board U-boats. In May, they escorted convoys SL 157 (Freetown to Britain) with MKS 48 (Mediterranean to Britain) and the next group SL 158 with MKS 49\\\\. On 25 May, the convoys were located by German Junkers Ju 290 reconnaissance aircraft. From then until the next morning, they were driven off undamaged, but one Sea Hurricane failed to pull out of a dive killing the pilot.Poolman (1972), p.141‚Äì142. On 26 May 1944, shortly after daybreak, a Sea Hurricane piloted by Sub Lieutenant Burgham from Nairana shot down Ju 290 9K+FK of FAGr 5 over the Bay of Biscay. The afternoon of the same day, Sub Lieutenants Mearns and Wallis attacked two more Ju 290s, Mearns shooting down 9V+GK piloted by Kurt Nonneberg, which ditched in the sea. The other Ju 290 disappeared on fire into cloud and was assumed to have crashed.Obituary of Lt-Cdr Sammy Mearns Three Fairey Swordfish armed with RP-3 rockets. Russian convoy JW 61‚Äîwhich sailed on 20 October‚Äîhad three escort carriers, Nairana, and . This was a large convoy of 62 merchant ships with a large escort group. Vice-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton was in command with Vindex as his flagship. Nairana had 835 Naval Air Squadron with 14 Swordfish IIIs and six Wildcat VIs on board for what would be their first Arctic convoy. Vindex had the same aircraft types and numbers. The third carrier‚ÄîTracker‚Äîhad 10 Grumman Avengers and six Wildcats. The short Arctic days meant that most flying would be at night. The three carriers worked a system of eight-hour watches; one would be the duty carrier with its aircraft aloft, the second would be on standby with its aircraft arranged on deck ready to scramble and the third resting. The two Swordfish-equipped squadrons, because of their better night-flying equipment, shared the nighttime hours while Trackers Avengers worked the daylight hours.Poolman (1972), p.144. The strength of the convoy's escort may have deterred the Germans and no U-boats or reconnaissance aircraft were detected until the convoy approached the Kola Inlet; even then the heavy escort prevented any attack and the convoy reached port safely. The return convoy RA 61 was equally as successful with only one frigate damaged by a torpedo just after leaving Kola and Vindex had to take avoiding action after detecting a torpedo coming towards her.Poolman (1972), p.145. Vindexs inexperienced squadron lost a Wildcat pilot when his plane crashed into the sea attempting to land back on board. A Swordfish crashed into the sea following a rocket-assisted take off with the loss of the two-man crew. Another Swordfish crashed on landing with the aircraft initially hung over the ship's side from its tail hook. When the hook gave way, it crashed into the sea and only the pilot was rescued. The squadron in total lost or so severely damaged eight Swordfish and two Wildcats that they could not fly again.Poolman (1972), p.146 A Fleet Air Arm Grumman Wildcat. On 6 February 1945, Nairana, , the cruiser , and eight fleet destroyers joined 26 merchant ships in convoy JW64. This time, the squadrons had spare aircrews for their aircraft and Campanias squadron included a Fairey Fulmar fitted with a Royal Air Force A1 air-to-air interception radar, for use as a dedicated night fighter.Poolman (1972), p.147. Shortly after the escorts and convoy came together Campanias radar operator reported a target approaching. Both carriers scrambled two Wildcats to intercept the intruder. Campanias Wildcats arrived first and shot down a Junkers Ju 88; one of the Wildcats was also shot down with the loss of the pilot. The next morning at 07:45, Campanias radar detected aircraft approaching. Two groups of Junkers Ju 88 torpedo bombers appeared and the convoy's escorts opened fire. The ships manoeuvred to avoid the torpedo attack and Nairanas Wildcats were airborne by 08:10. No ships were hit during the attacks and the bombers evaded the fighters in the heavy cloud cover. Campanias Swordfish were flying the daylight anti-submarine patrols, with a mixed armament of four RP-3 rockets and two depth charges. On 7 November 835 Squadron claimed a Junkers Ju 88 damaged.Poolman (1972), pp.147‚Äì148. The long Arctic night with only four hours of light a day‚Äîtogether with heavy seas and low visibility‚Äîhampered any operations by the Wildcats. In the darkness, the ships could hear the engines of the shadowing German aircraft closing in. Campanias night fighting Fulmar took off at 17:30, but its electrics failed as it was approaching the German aircraft and it was forced to return to the carrier. The Fulmar landed off centre and crashed into the safety barrier, putting itself and the carrier out of action. On 10 November, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol reported 30 Junkers Ju 88s approaching the convoy. The Wildcats took off to intercept the torpedo bombers and the escorts opened fire on them. The combined fire from the escorts and the Wildcats shot down four Ju 88s, two more were claimed as probably shot down by the Wildcats, and another was severely damaged. Those Ju 88s that did release their torpedoes failed to hit any of the ships and a number of the torpedoes were seen to detonate in the ships' wakes, as they turned away from the attack. Two of the Wildcats were also shot down by the barrage from the escorts.Poolman (1972), pp.148‚Äì149 The combined losses had reduced the escort's fighter cover to three aircraft, one on Campania and two on Nairana. At 11:30, another group of Ju 88 torpedo bombers were discovered approaching. Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down. The others, under fire from the escorts, dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed.Poolman (1972), p.149. The return convoy RA 64 left Kola Inlet on the morning of 17 February. One of the escorts and a merchant ship were torpedoed almost immediately. Another merchant ship was torpedoed that afternoon. Terrible weather conditions kept all aircraft grounded until 20 February. When it began to clear, the Luftwaffe also appeared and the Wildcats were scrambled to intercept them. Two Ju 88s were shot down by the fighters, another two by the escorts, and three were damaged.Poolman (1972), pp.151‚Äì152. The convoys had lost to enemy action two fighters, two escorts and two merchant ships. In return, they claimed 15 aircraft destroyed, seven aircraft probably destroyed and one U-boat sunk.Poolman (1972), p.154. Campania did one more Russian convoy JW 65 in March 1945, which had two merchant ships torpedoed and sunk on their approach to Kola Inlet. These were the last losses on a Russian convoy. With the war over there was no further need for escort carriers. Nairana was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1946. In Dutch service, she was renamed HNLMS Karel Doorman until 1948, when she was converted into a merchantman named the Port Victor.Poolman (1972), pp.155‚Äì156. Until March 1968, Port Victor was owned by the Cunard Line but managed by Blue Star Port Lines. She eventually became owned by Port Line in 1971; on 21 July, she was sent to Faslane to be scrapped.

Peterson wrote several books on Jefferson, including The Jefferson Image in the American Mind (Oxford University Press, 1960; reprinted with new foreword, University Press of Virginia, 1998), and Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation (Oxford University Press, 1970). Other works include Lincoln in American Memory (Oxford University Press, 1994), John Brown: The Legend Revisited (2002), and most recently Starving Armenians: America and the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1930 and After (Univ. of Virginia Press). Early life and education Merrill D. Peterson was born in Manhattan, Kansas, his father a Baptist minister. His parents divorced when he was in the third grade and his mother began running a boarding house.\\"Merrill D. Peterson, Jefferson Scholar, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, 2 October 2009 After spending two years at Kansas State University, Peterson earned his B.A. at the University of Kansas and then took his Ph.D. in the history of American civilization at Harvard University. Career After teaching at Brandeis and Princeton, Peterson was hired to teach at the University of Virginia, which remained his academic home for the rest of his life. He succeeded the great Jefferson biographer Dumas Malone there and ultimately became Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History. Works Peterson adapted his dissertation as his first book, The Jefferson Image in the American Mind (Oxford University Press, 1960), which won the 1961 Bancroft Prize for History. It is still hailed as a pioneering exploration of the history of American memory, which has become an increasingly important topic for historians. Peterson undertook the work to assess what history had made of Thomas Jefferson. At the end of a decade, he published a lengthy one-volume biography, Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation (Oxford University Press, 1970), which he considered his most important book. His 1994 Lincoln in American Memory, was written from a similar stance as his first book on Jefferson. It was a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for biography. Peterson's shorter studies include works on John Brown, President Woodrow Wilson, and Wilson's biographer, Ray Stannard Baker. Peterson edited several anthologies of Jefferson's writings. In 1988, Peterson published another landmark work, The Great Triumvirate (Oxford University Press), a joint biography of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun. Part of a generation that was admonished in its youth to \\"remember the starving Armenians,\\" Peterson traveled to Armenia in 1997 as a Peace Corps volunteer and was moved by the country‚Äôs troubled history. After research, he edited a collection of essays published by the University of Virginia Press under the title \\"Starving Armenians\\": America and the Armenian Genocide 1915-1930 and After (2004), which explores the American response to the violence against and dispersion of the Armenian people during and after World War I, when more than 1.5 million of the country's minority population died. He begins with the initial reports to President Woodrow Wilson from Henry Morgenthau, Sr., his ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Peterson also covers the contemporary period and the continuing campaign by ethnic Armenians and others to convince the U.S. government to officially recognize the actions as genocide, which Turkey has denied.

The house and furnishings reflect the lifestyle of the prominent family who lived in the house for seventy-five years. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Di Vernon Averill commissioned architect Henry Conrad Mauer to build the house, which was sold the next year to Di's brother, William P.H. McFaddin. McFaddin and his wife Ida Caldwell McFaddin, from Huntington, West Virginia, moved into the house in 1907 with their three children: Mamie, age 11, Perry, Jr., age 9, and James Caldwell, age 6. A substantial carriage house was added in the same year. The carriage house had a stable, hayloft, garage, gymnasium and servant's quarters. When the McFaddins' daughter Mamie married Carroll Ward in 1919, the newlyweds moved in with the McFaddins and lived their entire married lives there. Before Mamie McFaddin Ward died in 1982, she created a foundation to preserve the house as a museum which opened to the public in 1986. Guests ages 8 and older are welcome for tours of the home led by volunteer docents Tuesday through Saturday. The museum strongly encourages reservations as tours run approximately one to one and a half hours long. Self-guided tours of the first floor are available on Sundays. The carriage house and grounds are open to all ages during museum hours. Outside the three-floor home are spacious lawns, flower beds and rose gardens. Inside, a substantial permanent collection of antique furniture and household items are in view. The McFaddin‚ÄìWard House is one of the few house museums in which the home's original furnishings are intact and on display. It is also one of the few Beaux-Arts Colonial homes still open to the public. Educational programs focus on history and are geared toward children and adults. The museum hosts lectures, special celebrations, summer camps, and open houses. New exhibits and displays are changed often, giving fresh interpretations of the home. Christmas time is especially celebrated with special events and an open house when the public is invited to enjoy eggnog and McFaddin family recipes before touring the first floor of the house. In addition, it was named a Texas State Historic Landmark in 1976. The home has been featured various TV's Arts & Entertainment's America's Castles as a Lone Star Estate (only 3 Texas homes were featured), and the house has been included in several important architectural books.

Beth is the stepdaughter of the late Bradley Raines and daughter of Lillian Raines. She is the mother of Lizzie, James, and Peyton Spaulding and is known for her tumultuous relationship with her husband Phillip Spaulding. The character was originally portrayed by actress Judi Evans from her introduction in 1983 until 1986 and then by Beth Chamberlin who portrayed the character on and off from her re- introduction in 1989 until the finale in 2009. Background The character of Beth Raines has been half of two supercouples: Beth and Lujack Luvonaczek (Vincent Irizarry) and Beth and Philip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander). Beth has also been married to Philip's father, Alan Spaulding (Ron Raines) and Philip's best friend Rick Bauer (Michael O'Leary). Beth, Philip, Rick and Mindy Lewis (Krista Tesreau) called themselves \\"The Four Musketeers\\" in the 1980s. Together they were four best friends with an unbreakable bond. Storylines =1983‚Äì86= From the start, the character of Beth Raines was a recognized fan favorite. Soap Opera Digest named her 1984's Most Beleaguered Heroine, called her a part of \\"one of the top triangles ever to grace daytime\\" and compared later storylines to General Hospital's romantic/adventure couple Luke and Laura.Soap Opera Digest, 1984 Beth Raines first appeared on Guiding Light in the spring of 1983. Beth was acknowledged to have been born March 16, 1966. Her biological father was killed in Vietnam. Her mother, Lillian, a nurse, had remarried Bradley Raines. In 1983, a 17-year-old Beth was admitted to Cedars Hospital as an unconscious victim of an abusive stepfather. Her roommate was Mindy Lewis. Mindy was friends with two orderlies, Phillip Spaulding and Rick Bauer. The four of them formed a fast friendship, nicknamed \\"The Four Musketeers\\" which quickly developed into a romantic quadrangle. Beth was a shy, artistic teenager. Philip and Mindy, both heirs to two of Springfield's premier families, were dating when Philip fell for Beth who was dating Rick. Fate seemed to be pushing Philip and Beth together when they were named king and queen at their high school prom. When a traumatized Beth became nearly catatonic after being raped by her stepfather, the two of them ran away to New York City. The storyline took place at Christmas time and introduced the character of Nick, a Santa-like figure who would make later appearances on the show throughout the years around the holiday season. The location shoot was plagued by bad weather and a need for many reshoots. However, the result was a charming memorable love story that Grant Aleksander (Philip) said was worth the extra effort. They returned to be married, but discovered that Mindy, Beth's maid of honor, was pregnant with Philip's child, and Philip married Mindy instead. Beth moved on with a gangleader named Brandon Luvoneczek, who called himself Lujack . Lujack eventually learned that Alexandra Spaulding was his mother. Beth was temporarily blinded in an explosion, when a jealous Philip hired someone to blow up a bar that Lujack was building with one of his past theft victims, Floyd Parker (Tom Nielsen). Lujack was accused of the murder of Andy Ferris (whom Philip had paid to blow up Lujack's bar). Lujack was eventually cleared and pursued his music career, but was killed in an explosion on a ship, leaving a heartbroken Beth to eventually reunite with Philip briefly before being kidnapped and presumed dead in 1986.https://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/lujack.php =1989‚Äì1991= In 1989, paintings of Beth surface and Philip becomes convinced that she is still alive. Meanwhile, Beth has returned to Springfield with Neil Everest, but with amnesia and unable to speak. A run-in with Bradley leads to her recovering her memory and eventually making amends with her stepfather. That December, Philip and Beth are reunited at the Willow Hills Sanitarium, where Philip stops Beth's marriage to Neil and Beth regains her speech. In 1990, Neil helps Beth recall what really happened when she was believed to be dead. She reveals that she killed her abductor, Professor Blackburn, when he tried to attack her. She sleeps with Philip who is at this time married to Blake, who refuses to grant him a divorce. When she finds out she's pregnant, she's unsure of the baby's paternity. She thinks it is Neil but later finds out that it's Philip. Neil is killed in an explosion that Philip is accused of causing. Philip, with the help of Rick and Beth, fakes his death to escape jail time. Beth and Rick marry to throw off suspicion related to Philip's fake death. Philip returns in October, and Beth gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Spualding (Lizzie), in November. In December, Beth and Rick divorce. Rick becomes Lizzie's godfather. The following year (1991) Philip and Beth marry and moved to Arizona with Lizzie. =1997-2001= In 1996, Philip and Beth were divorced off-screen. In 1997, Beth returns to Springfield with Lizzie (played by Hayden Panettiere). Philip is dating Harley Cooper. Beth begins to date Ben Warren and announces to Philip that she intends to stay in town. In 1998, she teams up with Annie Dutton to try to win Philip back from Harley. She is named as a suspect in the murder of Carl Stevens. It is later revealed that young Lizzie shot and killed Carl because he had abused her mother. She protects Lizzie and unhappily allows her to be in Philip and Harley's wedding. In 1998, Beth makes a play for Matt Reardon, but later dates Jim Lemay (legally father to Harley's daughter Susan, who she gave up for adoption as a teen mom). When Beth, Philip and Jim are in a plane crash, Jim escapes to find help. Beth and Philip, thinking they are about to die make love. After being rescued, Beth accepts Jim Lemay's proposal. In 2000, Beth found out that she was pregnant with Philip's baby. She convinced Philip to allow her to pass the baby off as Jim's, in order to preserve both of their marriages. However, that same year, Lizzie is diagnosed with leukemia. Jim refuses to allow the doctors to induce labor in order to use the stem cells from the cord blood to save Lizzie's life. After breaking up and then reconciling, Jim saves Lizzie and baby James from a fire but died shortly afterward. In 2001, Beth allows herself to be seduced by Prince Edmond Winslow of San Christobel and conspires with him to overthrow his brother, Prince Richard Winslow. She became a princess but divorced Edmond when she found out that he was holding Cassie prisoner. When she found out about it Edmund kept her in the same place he had been holding Cassie. She escaped and was saved by her ex Phillip. In 2001, Beth is presumed dead again when she is caught up in a flash flood in San Christobel. =2002-2009= Edmund later meets a country girl named Lorelei Hills who looks exactly like Beth. He convinces her to come to Springfield and scam the Spauldings out of Beth's fortune by convincing them that Beth wasn't really dead. The con is successful and Philip began to fall in love with \\"Beth.\\" When he realizes that she is an impostor, Lorelei and Edmond are jailed. In jail, Lorelei has flashbacks of Beth's life and it is revealed that she really is Beth, only she that had amnesia all this time. Her fingerprints match and it is confirmed that she is the real Beth. Lorelei/Beth now struggles with her split personality. Lorelei dominates temporarily and runs off with Edmund. Eventually Beth's personality wins out and she is reunited with Philip and Lizzie. Just as they start to get back on track, a lover from Lorelei's past comes to Springfield in the unlikely person of Bill Lewis, the son of Billy Lewis and Vanessa Chamberlin Reardon, who was last seen as a teenager and is now a young college student. In 2004, Philip was presumed dead, after having been shot by his father, Alan. In 2006 Beth was shocked to learn that Rick not only helped him fake his death, but had kept that information from her and everyone in Springfield. Beth married Philip's father Alan to obtain security for herself and her children. When she miscarried their baby, he became obsessed with a Lizzie's pregnancy and trying to gain custody of the child, fathered by Jonathan Randall, son of Alan's one-time wife, Reva Shayne. Beth divorced Alan Spaulding, but despite his short-lived marriage to Doris Wolfe, and his near death at the hands of her daughter Ashley, Beth and Alan continued to bounce back and forth in their relationship. At one point, during the investigation to find out who shot Alan, Beth attempted to seduce Alan's other son, Alan-Michael, but was unsuccessful. Beth focused on protecting Lizzie and her baby from Alan and reconnected with Rick, who was at the time married to Mel Boudreaux and father to their daughter Leah. Beth, Rick and Alan formed an on-again/off-again triangle. The affair was revealed by Jonathan Randall in an angry outburst. Rick and Mel divorced and Beth became pregnant, but paternity was uncertain. A distraught Cassie tampered with the paternity test to show that Rick was the father of Beth's baby, and Beth was married to Rick on the Fourth of July by Josh Lewis, who had become a preacher. Cassie blamed Alan for the death of her daughter Tammy, and wanted ostensibly to \\"protect Beth's child from having Alan Spaulding as a father.\\" Lizzie was dismayed and angry that she hadn't been invited and was one of the last people to find out. Thinking the baby was a Bauer, Beth named the baby Bernadette as a tribute to Bert Bauer, Rick's grandmother. At Bernadette's baptism, Reva blurted out the truth in order to save her own son from Alan's wrath. Beth decided instead after some additional thought to rename her daughter Peyton Alexandra Raines instead of Bernadette Bauer. Beth decided to go to law school, but her personal life remained more murky. When Alan had a brain tumor and started having visions of his dead son Gus, Beth started a relationship with Henry Cooper \\"Coop\\" Bradshaw who had been previously engaged to her daughter Lizzie. The relationship was supposed to be kept secret so Alan wouldn't find out but eventually everyone knew except Alan. When Alan found out he threatened to take Peyton from Beth and kill Coop if she didn't marry him. On the way to stop the wedding Coop got into a car accident. Phillip, who had been presumed dead for nearly five years, had recently decided to return to Springfield, and found Coop after the accident. He took him to the hospital, then went to the church to tell everyone what had happened. Beth was shocked to see Phillip alive, and then jolted to learn that Coop was clinging to life. Beth visited Coop on his deathbed, and his sacrifice made her decide not to marry Alan. During the relationship of Beth and Coop he wrote a book about their love and it was eventually published. Phillip's return jolted the entire Spaulding family, and they barely had time to adjust when Beth's and Phillip's 19-year-old son, James, returned from boarding school. James was running a Ponzi scheme and even when Phillip helped clear the charges against him, he resented Phillip's return. Beth was torn between the love of her life and the son who had only known the worst of his father. During this time Beth also helped her daughter Lizzie marry Bill Lewis. Eventually, Phillip learned he was dying. He didn't tell anyone, aside from Lillian (who was a nurse), and tried to repair the relationships in his life with the time he had left. Beth found out in what were supposed to be Phillip's last days, and she felt devastated as well as betrayed by Phillip and by her mother. Fortunately for Phillip, Alan agreed to a bone marrow transplant, and saved his son's life, but a few days later, Alan quietly died after attending the double wedding of Lillian and Buzz Cooper and Vanessa Chamberlain and Billy Lewis. Beth was forced to break the news to her young daughter Peyton. Shortly before Alan's death, Phillip had proposed to Beth, and she had happily accepted. James and Phillip were now reconciled and Lizzie was trying for a baby. Beth also decided to return to her first love, drawing. A year later, Beth and Phillip were happily remarried, and were celebrating the upcoming nuptials of their best friends Rick and Mindy.  Portrayers  Judi Evans debuted in the role in May 1983 and remained with the show until July 1986. Evans won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1984 for her portrayal of the character. After Lisa Loughridge stepped in as a temporary replacement, Beth Chamberlin assumed the role from October 2, 1989 to February 18, 1991, and November 1, 1997 to September 18, 2009. In 2010, Beth Chamberlin secured a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. = Lorelei's Diary = Inspired by a story where the character of Beth had an alter ego, Lorelei Hills, Chamberlin wrote a novel, Lorelei's Guiding Light: An Intimate Diary. The book was published under the pen name of the Lorelei character by St. Martin's Press in 2002.

Background Marcia and Ronald Brennan were from Ontario. They visited British Columbia and rented a car. They were in a serious accident. The plaintiff driver returned to Ontario to collect a provincial no-fault benefit from Unifund Assurance. Unifund sought reimbursement from the Insurance Corp of British Columbia under the Ontario law. The BC insurance company challenged the Ontario law as extraterritorial. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether s. 275 of the Ontario Insurance Act was constitutionally inapplicable in the circumstances. Decision of the Court Justice Binnie, writing for the majority, allowed the appeal and found that the Ontario law was inapplicable to the BC insurance company. Binnie described the issue as whether there was a \\"real and substantial connection\\" between a provincial law and an out-of-province defendant. This is a question of constitutional applicability for which Binnie gives four propositions (para. 54): #The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not sufficiently connected to it; #What constitutes a ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù connection depends on the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it; #The applicability of an otherwise competent provincial legislation to out-of-province defendants is conditioned by the requirements of order and fairness that underlie our federal arrangements; #The principles of order and fairness, being purposive, are applied flexibly according to the subject matter of the legislation. Binnie examines and applies these principles. He notes that the BC insurance co. does not carry on any business in Ontario. He finally concludes that the Ontario law is inapplicable. The analysis is significant in that it imports the conflict of laws approach in Morguard v De Savoye into the constitutional analysis from the Churchill Falls case and other extraterritorial cases.

The NEED Project's educator network includes over 65,000 classrooms nationwide who use NEED's annually up-dated curriculum materials. The NEED Project Beginnings Started in 1980, launched by a Congressional resolution spearheaded by Gerard Katz, a New York state physics teacher, the National Energy Education Development Project (NEED) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education association dedicated to promoting a realistic understanding of the scientific, economic, and environmental impacts of energy so that students and teachers can make educated decisions. On March 20, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4738, entitled \\"National Energy Education Day: By the President of the United States, A Proclamation.\\" The proclamation read, in part: The NEED mission The mission of the NEED Project is to promote an energy conscious and educated society by creating effective networks of students, educators, business, government and community leaders to design and deliver objective, multi-sided energy education programs. The NEED program includes innovative curriculum materials, professional development, evaluation tools, and recognition. NEED teaches the scientific concepts of energy and provides objective information about conventional and emerging energy sources‚Äî their use and impact on the environment, economy, and society. The program also educates students about energy efficiency and conservation while providing tools to help educators, energy managers, and consumers use energy wisely. The NEED mission, goals, and governance are described on the program's website and include links to the organization's annual report and financial statement. NEED Project Mission NEED's curriculum Experts agree students learn best by doing. NEED materials are inquiry based and incorporate the \\"Kids Teaching Kids\\" philosophy. NEED makes teaching and learning about energy exciting while developing students' leadership and critical thinking skills. NEED materials are available for all grade levels from kindergarten through high school. With NEED's extensive curriculum, educators can design classroom programs that spark the interest of their students and meet course objectives. NEED materials are designed to meet and correlate to the National Science Education Content Standards, as well as many state standards. Educators who use NEED materials report that their students score better on end-of-grade testing, are more actively engaged in learning, and develop leadership skills as members of the community. To ensure that teachers and students are working with accurate information, NEED materials are updated on a regular basis, using the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well as from a wide range of energy industry partners. NEED works with educators and students to improve existing materials and develop new ones to meet national and state curriculum requirements. In a special partnership with the Energy Information Administration, NEED helps make energy information and data available to students via the EIA Kid's Page website. In 2006, the Kid's Page was one of the most popular EIA products‚Äîaveraging over 350,000 user sessions per month. NEED welcomes partners who vitalize the NEED network with new curriculum materials and new schools. A partnership with Pacific Gas and Electric Company expanded the PG&E; Solar Schools program to over 600 teachers in the PG&E; service area. Schools receive NEED Solar Kits, Science of Energy Kits, teacher training and the opportunity to apply for photovoltaic (solar) installations and classroom grants. NEED continues to grow at the national and the local level thanks to the support of committed sponsors and partners. Companies and organizations of all types and sizes work with NEED to invest in the future of energy and energy education. NEED sponsors and partners recognize the value of educating tomorrow's workforce for careers in energy. Each partnership is unique. Each partnership considers an energy literate public a pathway to overcoming the energy challenges of the future. The NEED curriculum is divided into eight steps; each builds on the others to form a comprehensive energy unit that encourages even the youngest students to understand how energy is involved in everything that happens in the world. NEED offers over 130+ curriculum guides available for free PDF download at the NEED Store Training and professional development Teachers are the key to the success of the NEED program. NEED teachers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories reach more than four million students each year in their local schools, and many more through outreach programs. Providing teachers with innovative training programs and opportunities to increase their own energy knowledge is a major objective of the NEED program. Training is offered at local, state, regional and national levels. During the school year, NEED coordinators, lead teachers, and student leaders facilitate workshops for teachers, students, parents, and community members that may range from a few hours to several days. At these workshops, attendees receive an introduction to the NEED curriculum. Additional training for special topics like solar, hydrogen, wind, energy on public lands, or energy management is available in many areas of the NEED network. NEED specializes in creating a first-class training experience, which is consistently scored by participants as one of the best professional development experiences available. In the summer, the National Energy Conferences for Educators give teachers and energy professionals the opportunity to meet other educators from across the country, design and develop NEED units for their classrooms, increase their energy knowledge, and earn graduate credit. They participate in NEED activities and field trips to energy sites such as nuclear power plants, coalmines, offshore oil production facilities, solar energy facilities, hydroelectric dams, and energy efficiency projects. NEED sponsors and partners provide sponsorship for teachers, and they participate as speakers and field trip guides. Some NEED states also sponsor summer energy camps for kids, spring break day camps, and overnight energy weekends. Many NEED schools work with scout troops and community youth groups to help them gain energy-related merit badges and community service hours. NEED Energy Workshop Opportunities are listed on the NEED Calendar here: NEED Calendar The NEED network The long-term success of NEED depends on the support of its network. The educators, students, directors, coordinators, sponsors, and community partners who support the program say that working with NEED is one of the most rewarding things about their jobs. The board of Directors facilitates the implementation of NEED's strategic plan for expansion and helps support NEED's goal of providing an energy education program to every interested school in America. Board members volunteer their time and talents to make sure that NEED has a strong foundation and that the programs and materials reach the greatest number of people each year. Each member of the Board provides funding for the development of NEED programs. State programs are a vital component of NEED's mission. State coordinators and NEED lead teachers, partners, and sponsors provide day-to-day guidance to local programs, conduct regional and local training programs, design and distribute materials, support teachers, and help develop new NEED programs and activities. These state programs make NEED work at the local level‚Äîhelping connect the state education standards to NEED programs and materials. NEED stays connected to its network via its newsletters‚Äî Energy Exchange and Career Currents‚Äîand a variety of resources and opportunities available on NEED's website, www.need.org, and many outreach events each year. Energy Exchange provides teachers, students, and sponsors with information and activities about energy and exciting new technologies and discoveries. NEED's new newsletter, Career Currents, exposes students to the diversity of energy careers. Both newsletters are distributed bimonthly, and all issues are available on www.need.org. With a new look this year, www.need.org gives teachers a resource for curriculum publications and activity guides, a place to discuss their NEED programs, and links to a variety of supplemental resources. The website also provides students with methods for choosing science fair experiments, fact sheets for research projects, activities to reinforce knowledge, and resources on the nation's leading energy sources, electricity, and conservation. NEED also partners with the Energy Information Administration on their EIA Kid‚Äôs Page, the premier site for kids to find reliable, up-to-date energy information and loads of fun energy activities. Since its inception in 1980, NEED has grown from a one-day celebration of energy awareness to a national organization dedicated o introducing energy into the curriculum at every grade level. This growth would be impossible without the continued support of NEED's sponsors and partners at the national, state, and local level ho provide funding, time, energy, and technical assistance. NEED sponsors and partners believe in the importance of a comprehensive energy education program that helps teachers and students understand energy and its impacts on their world.

It is found on coastal and inland sand ridges and is characterized by an evergreen xeromorphic plant community dominated by shrubs and dwarf oaks. Because the low-nutrient sandy soils do not retain moisture, the ecosystem is effectively an arid one. Wildfires infrequently occur in the Florida scrub. Most of the annual rainfall (about ) falls in summer. It is endangered by residential, commercial and agricultural development, with the largest remaining block in and around the Ocala National Forest. Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge also holds a high proportion of remaining scrub habitat, while the Archbold Biological Station near Lake Placid contains about of scrub habitat and sponsors biological research on it. Plant communities There is a high level of endemism in the flora and fauna, including an estimated 40 species of plants, 4 vertebrates and at least 46 species of arthropod found nowhere else. =Florida peninsula inland scrub= Florida peninsula inland scrub is the plant community for which this ecoregion is named. Clumps of sand pines (Pinus clausa) constitute the canopy. Common plant species include sand live oak (Quercus geminata), myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia), sandhill oak (Q. inopina), Chapman oak (Q. chapmanii), Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), garberia (Garberia heterophylla), fetterbush lyonia (Lyonia lucida), rusty staggerbush (L. ferruginea), cup lichens (Cladonia spp.), scrub holly (Ilex opaca var. arenicola), American olive (Osmanthus americanus var. megacarpus), flag-pawpaw (Asimina obovata), silk bay (Persea humilis), Adam's needle (Yucca filamentosa), and eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa). Florida scrub jay =Longleaf pine sandhill= Florida longleaf pine sandhills are often found adjacent to the scrub. They consist of stands of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) on very well-drained, sandy hills. These stands are maintained by frequent fires. Turkey oak (Quercus laevis) is common in the understory and pineland threeawn (Aristida stricta) makes up the ground layer. =Oak dome and hammock= The southern coastal plain oak dome and hammocks occur as thick stands of evergreen oaks in small patches on shallow depressions or slight hills. These forests are distinct from their surrounding habitats, which are often dominated by longleaf pine. On mesic sites, common species are southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), sand laurel oak (Q. hemisphaerica), and American persimmon (Diospyros virginiana). The understory is sparse, with trumpet creeper (Campsis radicans) and greenbriers (Smilax spp). On xeric sites, common species are sand live oak (Quercus geminata), southern live oak (Q. virginiana), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), pineland threeawn (Aristida stricta), and southern dawnflower (Stylisma humistrata). =Highlands freshwater marsh= Floridian highlands freshwater marshes are highland marshes found in shallow peat-filled valleys, the basins of dried lakes, and the borders of existing lakes. The vegetation mosaic includes a range of mostly herbaceous plant communities, varying based on water depth. Deep water supports various submerged and floating plants. Meter-deep water supports emergent herbaceous perennial plants, typically in dense, monospecific stands, such as bulrush (Typha latifolia), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), and American lotus (Nelumbo lutea). Shallow areas submerged only during the wet season support more grasses, including maidencane (Panicum hemitomon) and southern cutgrass (Leersia hexandra). Subsidence and drainage pattern changes make these habitats shift and change over time. Soils can be mucky, loamy, or sandy, but they are generally above permeable subsoils that create standing water much of the year. These marshes may also be called meadows or prairies. =Nonriverine basin swamp= Southern coastal plain nonriverine basin swamps occur in large, seasonally-flooded depressions away from rivers. Sites are often forested in trees such as bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), swamp tupelo (Nyssa biflora), and sometimes slash pine (Pinus elliottii). Characteristic shrubs include buckwheat tree (Cliftonia monophylla), swamp cyrilla (Cyrilla racemiflora), laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia), and fetterbush lyonia (Lyonia lucida). Animals Notable animals of the Florida scrub include the Florida scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the endemic Florida mouse (Podomys floridanus), sand skink (Neoseps reynoldsi), bluetail mole skink (Plestiodon egregius lividus), Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi), Florida worm lizard (Rhineura floridana), and the gopher tortoise which is an important keystone species.

They may sometimes lead to \\"recovered factories\\", in which the workers self-manage the factories. They have been used in many strike actions, including: *the 1920‚Äì22 Biennio Rosso (in particular the Turin factory occupation of 1920) *1936 French general strike (see 1936 Matignon agreements) *in the May 68 revolts, supported by the Council for Maintaining the Occupations *in the 1970s in Italy (35-day occupation of the Fiat) *upper Clyde shipbuilder workers staged a work-in during 1971‚Äì72 with about 260 further occupations in Britain in the following decade *the 1971 Harco work- in, Australia *1973 Uruguayan general strike *Lip factory in France in 1973 *the occupation of the ceramics factory formerly known as Zanon in Argentina starting in 2001, that under workers' control changed its name to FaSinPat *the occupation of the Republic Windows and Doors factory in Chicago in 2008, and the re-occupation of the factory in 2012 *A 77-day occupation of the Ssangyong car factory in 2009 *Current occupation of Viomichaniki Metalleutiki in Thessaloniki, Greece, along the lines of factory occupations in Argentina.  Biennio Rosso  Radical unionism started after the first world war. The movement was a result of increasing internal commissions or \\"faculty councils\\". Around November 1918, the councils/commissions had morphed into a national problem. By February 1919, the federation of Italian metal workers had successfully received a contract permitting these commissions in their factories. In May 1919, these commissions began to transfer into councils that were managing the factories and were dominating the power structure of said workplaces. The contract also prevented democratic elections of these council members or \\"stewards\\". In April 1920, at Fiat, there was the beginning of sit- in strikes by the workers, which eventually grew to 500,000 workers striking at its peak.  The French General Strike  In France in January 1936, the PCF, a Stalinist communist organization spurred the creation of a coalition of radicals called the \\"popular front\\". This organization was designed to defend democracy and disassemble fascist bonds. In May 1936, the popular front won a majority election and assembled a cabinet of eighteen socialist, thirteen radicals and four independent socialist to govern. Communists supported the leaderrLeon Blum but refused to join the cabinet. This change in power was spurred by a massive general strike in the years preceding where thousands of factories had been occupied by French workers to ensure said democratic governance. Blum effectively ended the strike when this government came to power.  May 68 Revolution  During a period of civil unrest in France in the 1960s, student protests were joined by factory occupations and strikes by French workers. See May 1968 events in France.  Fiat Occupation in Italy  In the 1960s, a historic movement of strikes and factory occupations had a significant effect on Italy. After constant failure by the government to follow through on promises for reform in Italy, a surge of uprising and strikes occurred between 1968 and 1970. Earlier strikes at northern factories in Turin were successful in gaining momentum in 1962. The Lancia factory walkout was successful in gaining some workers rights. The Michelin Factory strike around the same time had less success. A large strike in Turin however, amassing 93,000 of the Fiat workforce for a massive walkout and intimidation of those who did not participate. After further political negotiation and action through the years that followed, and unsatisfactory changes in policy coupled with increasingly educated and aware workers, the series of massive strikes broke out in 1968. The autumn of 1969 is considered the climax of these strikes and they continued through the early 1970s resulting in significantly improved conditions for Italian workers. In 1973, over 6 million workers were on strike.  Upper Clyde Ship Builder Work-In  The Upper Clyde Ship Builders are a Scottish shipbuilder consortium that was birthed in 1968 by an adjoining of 5 shipbuilders. It was liquidated in 1971 resulting in occupation/work-in campaign by shop stewards in shipyards. See Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.  Harco Work-In  The Harco work-in of 1971 was an occupation by steel plant workers in New South Wales, Australia. The 4-week long work-in was the result of a dispute between Harco owners and workers on company sacking and rehiring practices during low production periods to save money. See 1971 Harco work-in.  Uruguayan General Strike  During 1973, a close of parliament and essential dictatorship by the president created unrest and the leftist union called for a general strike and occupation of factories. After two weeks most of the union leaders were in jail, exile, or dead. See 1973 Uruguayan general strike.  French LIP Factory  When the LIP factory in France decided to close a factory due to financial problems in the late 60s and early 70s, strikes and a very public factory occupation eventually transferred control and management of the factory to the workers. See LIP (company)  Zanon Factory Occupation  During the Argentine uprising of the early 2000s, there was a complete takeover of the Zanon tile factory in Argentina. The workers went on strike in the year 2000, the first of a series of strikes that was spurred by the death of a worker from a heart attack. They also were adamant about making their conflicts with the company very public. Workers traveled and occupied places other than factories as well. In January 2001, there was a 6-day strike over unpaid wages. In April 2001, there was a 34-day strike over outstanding wages. These strikes were followed by many other occupations and strikes that ultimately cause the factories to lose almost 50% of their production.  Republic Windows and Doors Occupation  When Republic Windows and Doors company was declared bankrupt in December 2008, an organized sit-own strike of 200 workers in the factory occurred to protest federal labor law violations by the company.  Ssangyong Car Factory Occupation  A long occupation of the Ssangyong car factory by 900 factory workers and several thousand others began on May 22, 2009 after a list of firings was released by the company that showed over 1000 workers to be laid off. This was the result of the company filing for bankruptcy in February 2009. Workers were essentially sieged by the company during their occupation and workers refused all company negotiations that did not include jobs.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 22, 2007. It was written by J. Stewart Burns and featured a guest appearance from Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo. This episode was first broadcast three days after the twenty-year anniversary of the first ever appearance of The Simpsons on television, in The Tracey Ullman Shows short \\"Good Night\\". Plot Marge is embarrassed at a Parent-Teacher Association meeting because she does not have an e-mail address. She decides to buy her own computer and is quite taken by the Internet. Quickly becoming bored with her lack of email messages she repeatedly hits the refresh button causing new advertising banners to appear. A banner ad for a MMORPG called Earthland Realms catches her attention. Marge clicks on it and soon creates a character for the game. She begins exploring the local town and interacting with game personas, all of whom are Springfield residents including Apu the gem trader, Seymour Skinner the turkey, Moe who looks like a troll but is not, Mrs. Krabappel the enchantress, Snake the Cobra King, Chief Wiggum the pig man, Smithers the Barbarian, Comic Book Guy the fully armored crusader-like warrior, and Sideshow Mel as a creature who looks surprisingly like a Tauren. Suddenly, everyone hides as a knight named \\"The Shadow Knight\\" appears riding a menacing black horse. The Shadow Knight is the most powerful and deadly character in the game (as Moe remarks \\"He once beat me to death with my life bar!\\"). While offline Marge walks by Bart's bedroom door. She unintentionally hears Bart say \\"Another senseless killing by the Shadow Knight\\" and realizes that Bart is the Shadow Knight. Meanwhile, Homer referees Lisa's soccer game. His subpar skills frustrate Lisa. Stung by her criticism, Homer learns the rules of soccer and becomes a better referee, briefly impressing Lisa. While playing soccer, Lisa trips when trying to steal the ball from another player. Homer calls a foul and gives the ball to Lisa. Upon getting the ball, Lisa decides to take advantage of the situation and pretends to be fouled hoping that Homer would grant her penalties. Brazilian footballer Ronaldo points out that Lisa is a \\"flopper\\" Homer gives Lisa a yellow card. Angry, Lisa rips up the yellow card, causing Homer to give her a red card for unsportsmanlike conduct and to eject her from the game. Back in the MMORPG, Marge goes to the Shadow Knight's castle and meets Milhouse who is cursed to look like a female servant as a result of an evil spell. Marge constantly frets about Bart and, to Bart's dismay, redecorates his \\"trophy room\\" with the Hello Kitty expansion pack. In a fit of rage Bart smashes many of the decorations with a mace. In the process, he accidentally kills Marge's character which severely disappoints real world Marge. Homer and Bart go to Moe's Tavern to escape the troubles that have occurred with Marge and Lisa. Moe gives them surprisingly good advice about their situations. Homer jokingly asks \\"What have you done with the real Moe?\\" and everyone laughs. A cutaway shot reveals that the real Moe is bound and gagged in the room next-door. Acting on fake Moe's advice, Bart makes up for killing his mother's character by reviving her with two-thirds of his life force. Revived, \\"Elf Marge\\" tends to the Shadow Knight; however, other characters raid the castle to take advantage of his weakened state. The other characters brutally kill the Shadow Knight. In a rare breach of character Bart is blas√© about his character's death. He decides to go outside and play. In the real world Homer enters Lisa's room. He offers her a BBC documentary produced in cooperation with Canal+ about \\"floppers\\", hoping that she will forgive him. Watching the documentary Lisa realizes it was she that was at fault. Instead of forgiving Homer, Lisa apologizes for her injustice against him. Homer, Bart, Lisa and Maggie play a game of soccer in their back yard; however, Marge continues gaming inside. Feeling sorry for Bart, Marge dons the Shadow Knight armour and begins a revenge campaign for him starting with Moe's character. Marge juggles Moe's character head like a soccer ball. As he is being beat up Moe comments on why he pays $14.95 a month to play the game. Cultural references Earthland Realms is a parody of 2000s MMORPGs, combining elements of RuneScape, Asheron's Call and World of Warcraft. In the documentary Lisa watches about \\"floppers\\", a fight scene occurs between the Virgin Mary and a horde of Brazilian soccer hooligans. Adagio for Strings is played during this scene, although the piece was uncredited. In addition, the scene is a partial shot-for-shot remake of the fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix Reloaded. The scene where the townsfolk kill the Shadow Knight is a reference to a similar scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Reception Adam Finley of TV Squad felt \\"the Homer/Lisa story might have worked better as the main plot, but even that segment of the episode was hindered by a terrible guest voice in soccer player Ronaldo\\". He went on to say: \\"I hate it when non- actors do guest voices on The Simpsons\\" and that \\"bad voice acting becomes much more of a distraction\\". In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Ronaldo's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 4.5/10 rating.

This is the end of the clearway section, as denoted by the signs near the junction. The destination on the sign is Ventnor: despite the fact the road goes to Ryde, motorists travelling there would have a shorter journey via Brook Village and Newport. The A3055 is an A-Class Road on the Isle of Wight in Southern England. It forms the Southern portion of the circular around-the-Island A-class loop, the northern section being the A3054. The stretch along the south-west coast of the Island is formed by the Military Road. Because of the road's relatively short length, there are no confirmatory signs with distances, although on a few direction signs at junctions there are distances to the next town. The final destination of the road (Freshwater/Totland or Ryde), in common with most UK roads, is not signed along the whole length of the route. As well as fitting with national practice, this is also because anybody wishing to travel from Totland to Ryde by road would do so via the North coast A3054, as it is much more direct. Since a landslide affecting Undercliff Drive in February 2014, the road has been severed into two distinct parts. Military Road near Compton Farm (ahead). Automatically in the event of a landslide, or manually in very poor weather, the sign (to the right here) can be illuminated to close the road at this vulnerable point. Military Road The Military Road is the section of the A3055 regional coast road on the Isle of Wight which starts at Chale in the East and ends at Freshwater Bay in the West. The road has had to be in part relocated and repaired due to coastal erosion at various times since it was built in the late nineteenth century, and this continues today.Military RoadIsle of Wight County Press - \\"Scenic Route Back In Business\\" The original Military Road was constructed as part of a defence network in about 1860 and remained as a private gated road for about 70 years. It served as a link between forts and barracks and fluctuated between private and military use with private rights vested in the Seely family. In 1930 or thereabouts, the landowner Sir Charles Seely donated what was then a narrow track to the Isle of Wight Council for public use. The original track was vulnerable to erosion and a new road was constructed further inland. Some vestiges of the original track are still visible along the coast from Shippards Chine to the north west of the slumped area. The construction of the new road took place in the early 1930 with the formal opening of the last section in March 1936.IW Council Military Road exhibition panels, 2010 The road from Chale to Niton was built as a diversionary inland route following the collapse of the previous coastal road between Niton and Blackgang in 1928. It is of similar construction and mostly from the same time period to the stretch to the west of Chale which was re-built and upgraded at this time. This length of road is not usually understood to be covered by the term 'Military Road' and its name on street maps and signs is different. The section from Brook to Freshwater Bay is a clearway, so stopping on this section is only permitted at the five car parking areas, of which one is free, and the rest are operated with a charge to those who are not members of the National Trust. Along the rest of the route, there is no such restriction, but most motorists choose only to stop in designated car parks. In Summer 2009 the Isle of Wight Council was warned that cliff slippage was endangering the road, and as of January 2010, portions of the cliff were only from the road. The harsh weather over winter 2009-10 caused a large number of landslides. By February 2010, another land slip on the section between Brook and Hanover car park, brought the top of the cliff to about 5 metres from the edge of the road. The coastal path was lost, and the council erected traffic barriers at one side of the road to alert drivers. A further landslide, on the same section, on 23 February 2010, brought the top of the cliff to virtually the edge of the road. The road was reduced to single file, with traffic light control. Since then various meetings of the Isle of Wight Council have included discussion of the road's future. One view has been that the road is unrepairable, and should be closed, while parking and turning areas should be created at both ends. More recently the possibility has been discussed of diverting the road and rebuilding as part of the county's refurbishment of all its roads under a Private finance initiative. The section of destroyed road was repaired, and a diversion has yet to be implemented. Undercliff Drive Undercliff Drive is the segment of the A3055 that runs the length of the Isle of Wight Undercliff between Niton and Ventnor. Due to the unusual geology of the area, with significant clay layers, it has long been vulnerable to weathering and underground watercourses causing erosion in the unstable landscape, with various plans for a long-term stabilisation of the land (including the road) drawn up in the first decade of the 21st century, not without controversy. Allegations of irregularities regarding the contract to rebuild the road following a landslip in 2001, which could have amounted to \\"criminal activity or public sector corruption\\" were investigated by Hampshire Police in November 2007, several senior officers at Isle of Wight Council were suspended, and John Lawson, the Deputy Chief Executive of the council was sacked after his resignation was refused. By March 2008 police determined there was insufficient evidence to continue their investigations. However, an internal investigation by Isle of Wight Council concluded that the council had broken both its own constitution, European Union and UK law by awarding a multimillion-pound contract without any tendering process. The scheme, which was abandoned by mid-November 2007, had already cost almost ¬£3 million and was projected to cost more than three times its original estimate of ¬£5.6 million. Another scheme designed to stabilise the road was started by Island Roads in 2013 as part of their Private Finance Initiative deal with the local council, at the same time as works on a similar issue near Yarmouth. However, a significant landslip occurred on 8 February 2014 after an \\"unusually heavy and prolonged rain\\" while these works were in progress, leading to the indefinite closure of the road to traffic, effectively cutting the numbered route into two separate sections. It has since come to light that Geotechnical Design Reports drawn up before the work began had identified the risk of geological failures overwhelming the work site as very high, and specifically noted that this was likely to depend on future rainfall and groundwater, but proposed no mitigation measures to counteract this problem. When this issue was highlighted, some people began to question why the works had been planned to take place during the wettest part of the year. The military helped to evacuate several homes, at least one of which suffered structural damage and was declared unsafe. Official proposals, costed at ¬£6-20 million have been to rebuild a replacement road for access to and from the West, with only a bridleway for access to the East, but these plans have been repeatedly subject to criticism. Despite the council announcing that a new access road would be built by the summer of 2015, there have been further delays. Initial works were quickly halted when it became clear they had been carried out on land of unclear ownership in a Site of Special Scientific Interest without permission or consultation with statutory body Natural England. Local residents, who had been cut off from the road network for eight months, rebuilt a road access themselves in October 2014, although there were concerns that this unofficial repair encroached onto the Site of Special Scientific Interest, might pollute the environment and the road itself could be dangerous, so this was cordoned off by safety inspectors. An agreement allowing the transfer of land between the council and a local wildlife trust was not agreed until September 2015 and a further year-long delay was expected when it became clear that a survey would be needed of the local bat population, which was not due to be completed until August 2016. However, in February 2016, two years after the landslide, Island Roads confirmed that there was no evidence of bat habitation in the majority of the trees which would be affected by the planned works. The short-term plan is now to construct a realigned road to a turning area for vehicles at each end side of the major slip, but there are still problems with groundwater levels which may delay construction. The road was lodged for planning permission in April 2016, and the council expected works to be completed between June and September. Leeson Road Leeson Road, named after the 19th century Bonchurch resident Henry Beaumont Leeson, is the segment of the A3055 that runs from Ventnor, at the foot of St Boniface Down, along the clifftop above Bonchurch, the Bonchurch Landslips and the Devil's Chimney.

She was built at Swan Hunter shipyards in Newcastle upon Tyne. When construction started in 1942 she was intended as a merchant ship, but was completed and launched as an escort carrier, entering service at the end of 1943. Vindex operated escorting convoys and doing anti-submarine work in the Atlantic and Arctic theatres. Her Swordfish aircraft were involved in the sinking of four U-boats during her service. She survived the war, and immediately afterwards served in the Far East transporting men and material to and from Japan. In 1947, she was decommissioned and sold for commercial use, to Port Line and renamed Port Vindex. In 1971, she was scrapped in Taiwan. Design and description The s were a class of three escort carriers built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War.Cocker (2008), pp.76‚Äì78 Escort carriers were designed to protect convoys of merchant ships from U-boat and aircraft attack.Poolman (1972), p.155. Following the successful conversion and operation of HMS Activity, the Admiralty decided to take over three more merchant ships while they were still under construction and convert them into escort carriers.Poolman (1972), p.111. The three ships chosen were being built at three different shipyards Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland, Swan Hunter in England and John Brown & Company in Scotland. The prototype was built by John Brown who supplied the other two companies with copies of the plans. The three ships were supposed to be identical but in reality they were all slightly different. HMS Vindex was launched on 4 May 1943 and completed on 3 December 1943.Poolman (1972), pp.111‚Äì112. She had a complement of 700 men and displaced . Her other dimensions were a length of , a beam of and a draught of .Cocker (2008), p.77. Her aircraft and her aircraft facilities included a flight deck, a hangar, six arrestor wires, and a aircraft lift. She had a traditional rivetted hull, steel flight decks and a closed hangar.Poolman (1972), p.112. Propulsion provided by diesel engines connected to two shafts giving , which could propel the ship at . Her armaments concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two dual purpose guns on a twin mount, sixteen autocannons on eight twin mounts and sixteen 2-pounder \\"Pom Pom\\" guns on four quadruple mounts. Aircraft assigned were either anti-submarine or fighter aircraft, which could be made up of a mixture of Hawker Sea Hurricanes, Grumman Martlets or Fairey Swordfish.Cocker (2008), p.80. Service history Three Fairey Swordfish armed with RP-3 rockets. Vindex was commissioned in December 1943, and moved to Gourock for working up.Poolman (1972), p.114. By this stage of the war, the Royal Navy had enough escort carriers available not only to double them up on a convoy escort but to permanently detach one to work with a \\"hunter killer group\\" operating outside the convoy system. The 2nd Escort Group still under the command of Captain Frederic John Walker was the group chosen with Vindex as the carrier. As she would not be supported by another carrier Vindexs air group was formed from the experienced 825 Naval Air Squadron, with a complement of 12 Fairey Swordfish Mk IIs and six Sea Hurricanes IICs. Even though there were 12 Swordfish on board they had only eight crews so the Sea Hurricanes carried out some of the daylight anti-submarine patrols. The Sea Hurricanes had been fitted with four racks for the same RP-3 rockets used by the Swordfish to attack submarines.Poolman (1972), p.120. Leaving Lough Foyle in Northern Ireland on 9 March 1944, the 2nd Escort Group moved to the area believed to hold the highest concentration of U-boats. On the night of 12 March, Swordfish on patrol had 28 contacts on their air to surface vessel radar (ASV). Their first attack was unsuccessful: two depth charges were dropped that failed to explode (believed to be caused by faulty safety clips) and during the attack the rear gunner in the Swordfish was killed by the U-boats anti-aircraft guns. The depth charges were dropped short on a second attack and failed to explode on a third attack during the same night.Poolman (1972), pp.120‚Äì121. On the night of 15 March, two Swordfish got an ASV contact ahead of the escort group. Unable to see anything in the darkness, they dropped flares and sea markers over the location. When the escort group arrived they picked up a contact on their ASDIC and the was sunk.Poolman (1972). p.121. Weather conditions were still not good for flying, and in the following days a Swordfish returning from a night patrol landed in the sea alongside the carrier and the crew were reported missing, believed killed. A pitching deck caused one Swordfish to crash into the sea on take-off and engine failure caused the crash of another Swordfish. One Swordfish clipped the island superstructure, losing off both wing tips when taking off. The pilot managed to get the aircraft into the air, circled around while jettisoning his depth charges, and landed again without mishap. Landing on the heaving deck was just as dangerous as taking off: two Sea Hurricanes and two Swordfish missed the arrestor wires and ended up crashing into the safety barriers. On 24 March, with its engine shot up and crew injured, a Swordfish attempted to land on Vindex. It crash landed on the flight deck, coming to a stop from the end of the flight deck. Leaking petrol set the wreckage on fire, the crew were rescued, but the fire exploded one of two depth charges stuck on their racks, blowing a hole in the flight deck. After 16 days at sea, Vindex returned to port. With two days flying lost because of the weather conditions, the Swordfish had amassed a creditable 275 flying hours and 122 deck landings by day and night. The Sea Hurricanes contributed another 47 hours flying and 39 deck landings.Poolman (1972), p.122. 825 Naval Air Squadron Sea Hurricane takes off from HMS Vindex. At the end of April 1944, Vindex joined the 5th Escort Group. On 6 May, a patrolling Swordfish was contacted by two of the escort frigates reporting they were in contact with a submerged U-boat. The frigates carried out a depth charge attack and forced to the surface. Despite anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat, the Swordfish dropped two of its depth charges which broke the submarine in half.Poolman (1972), p.138. Flying became dangerous in the heavy seas and poor visibility. One Sea Hurricane was damaged beyond repair after a serious crash into the safety barrier and another crashed into the sea with the loss of the pilot. The Swordfish crews fared little better three aircraft and one crew were lost during the same period. On 9 May, Vindexs aircraft lift broke down with a burnt out motor, the crew had to resort to manually cranking the lift up or down taking an hour to go each way. They eventually repaired the lift by moving the capstan motor through holes burned into the bulkheads.Poolman (1972), pp.139‚Äì140. During the second deployment by Vindex her aircraft had flown over 400 sorties in 13 days, but the strain on the aircrews began to show and only 35 per cent of the original Swordfish crews were still with the ship when they returned to port. It was during this second deployment that one of the ships officers, Sub-Lieutenant J.M. Morrison invented a blind landing system soon to be used on all the Royal Navy carriers. He modified an ASV radar set which was placed on the flight deck. The system employed the Air Directing Officer guiding aircraft to within of the ship. They could then be picked up on the ASV and brought in astern of the carrier at a height of .Poolman (1972), p.140. On 15 August, Vindex and joined convoy JW 59 the first Arctic convoy to Russia of the year. Vindex still had 825 Naval Air Squadron on board but they were now equipped with the Swordfish Mk III. This version of the biplane had a Rocket-assisted take off system (RATOG) and a new ASV radar in a dome on the underside of the aircraft. The extra weight reduced the crew to two, doing away with the Telegraphist-Air-Gunner. There was a full complement of 12 Swordfish and eight Sea Hurricanes (two unassembled spares) on board. The larger Striker had 12 Swordfish and 12 Grumman Wildcats. The Swordfish claimed their first success on 22 August, sinking , followed by on 24 August.http://www.uboat.net/boats/u344.htm Her rocket armed Sea Hurricanes also claimed a U-boat damaged. Neither convoy JW 59 or the returning RA 59A lost any ships.Poolman (1972), p.143. A Fleet Air Arm Grumman Wildcat. Russian convoy JW 61 which sailed on 20 October had for the first time three escort carriers, Vindex, and . This was a large convoy of 62 merchant ships with a large escort group. Vice-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton was in command, with Vindex as his flagship. Nairana had 835 Naval Air Squadron with 14 Swordfish IIIs and six Wildcat VIs on board for what would be their first Arctic convoy. Vindex had a re-formed 811 Naval Air Squadron with the same aircraft types and numbers. The third carrier‚ÄîTracker‚Äîhad 10 Grumman Avengers and six Wildcats. The short Arctic days meant that most flying would be at night. The three carriers worked a system eight hour watches, one would be the duty carrier with its aircraft aloft, the second would be on standby with its aircraft arranged on deck ready to scramble and the third resting. The two Swordfish equipped squadrons because of their better night flying equipment shared the night time hours while Trackers Avengers worked the daylight hours.Poolman (1972), p.144. The strength of the convoys escort may have deterred the Germans and no U-boats or reconnaissance aircraft were detected, until the convoy approached the Kola Inlet, even then the heavy escort prevented any attack and the convoy reached port safely. HMS Vindex in December 1945 The return convoy RA 61 was equally as successful with only one frigate damaged by a torpedo just after leaving Kola and Vindex had to take avoiding action after detecting a torpedo coming towards her.Poolman (1972), p.145. Vindexs inexperienced squadron lost a Wildcat pilot when his plane crashed into the sea attempting to land back on board. A Swordfish crashed into the sea following a rocket assisted take off with the loss of the two man crew. Another Swordfish crashed on landing with the aircraft initially hung over the ship's side from its tail hook. When the hook gave way it crashed into the sea and only the pilot was rescued. The squadron in total lost or so severely damaged eight Swordfish and two Wildcats that they could not fly again.Poolman (1972), p.146 From March to August 1945 the ship was part of the British Pacific Fleet attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron. With the war over there was no further need for escort carriers. Vindex was sent out to the Far East as the flagship for Rear Admiral Cunningham Graham. She was used to repatriate prisoners of war from Hong Kong back to Australia and Britain.Gittins, pp.160‚Äì161. On her return to Britain, she was placed in reserve and bought by her original owners the Port Line company. They renamed her Port Vindex keeping part of her name to honour her wartime service and converted into a refrigerated cargo ship on the United Kingdom to Australia route.Poolman (1972), pp.155‚Äì156. At the end of her merchant career, she was scrapped in August 1971 at Kaohsiung in Taiwan.

He played college football at Stanford University. Sports Illustrated named him the fourth greatest Montana athlete of the 20th century. Early years Donovan is considered to be one of the greatest athletes in the history of the state of Montana. While attending Class A Helena Central High School as a freshman and sophomore, he lettered in football, basketball and track and field, winning the state shot put title as a sophomore. After Helena Central closed, Donovan attended Class AA Helena High School, continuing to excel in track and field at the Class AA level, winning the shot put and discus competitions at the state meet in both his junior and senior seasons. He also was fast enough to anchor the school's 880-yard relay team to a state championship as a senior. He graduated as the holder of three school records in the shot put, discus and Javelin competitions. Donovan also led Helena to the state championship basketball final as a junior and senior, losing to Kalispell in 1970 and winning against Billings West in 1971. He was named all tournament both years. He went on to earn All-State honors on both offense and defense in football, was an All-State basketball player and won six first place medals at state track meets. In 1994, he was inducted into the Montana High School Association Hall of Fame and the National High School Sports Hall of Fame. College career Donovan received a football scholarship to play at Stanford University. He was named the right defensive end starter during his sophomore campaign and by the time he was a junior, he posted 109 tackles to lead his team and being named first-team All-American. As a senior, he received Consensus All-American honors. He was inducted into the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame and was also named to the Stanford's All-Century football team. Professional career Donovan was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round of the 1975 NFL Draft as a defensive end. He was one of 12 rookies who made the team that year - hence the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" nickname for the Cowboys 1975 draft, that helped the team reach Super Bowl X. In 1975, the Cowboys needed help at offensive tackle and like defensive tackle Blaine Nye a few years before him, he was switched to the offensive line three days into training camp. As a rookie, he gained more weight and saw action at both left and right tackle. After being a reserve during his first two seasons, he took over the right tackle job in 1977 when Rayfield Wright went down with an injury, helping the team win Super Bowl XII. In 1978, he moved to the left side after Ralph Neely retired and Rayfield Wright returned from injury. Donovan became one of the top offensive tackles in the NFL during the late 1970s and early 1980s and together with Herb Scott formed one of the best left-side tandems in the league. During his time with the Cowboys, center John Fitzgerald nicknamed the Cowboys offensive line as the \\"Four Irishmen and a Scott\\", when it was formed by Donovan, Fitzgerald, Jim Cooper, Tom Rafferty and Herb Scott. That group helped pave the way for Tony Dorsett's Hall of Fame rushing career. In the 1982 season, he helped blocked on Dorsett's record 99-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings. Donovan was a catalyst on the Cowboys offensive line and a four-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman from 1979 to 1982. He remains one of just five offensive tackles in club history to make at least four Pro Bowls, joining Rayfield Wright (six), Flozell Adams (five), Erik Williams (four) and Tyron Smith (four). He did not suffer any major injuries during his entire career, but at the end of the 1983 season, because of the accumulation of wear and tear, he ended up needing surgery to repair both shoulders and decided to retire. Donovan never missed a game in 9 seasons, played in 20 playoff contests, including six NFC Championships and three Super Bowls, earning a title ring in Super Bowl XII against the Denver Broncos.

The group disbanded in 1967. In 1968, Nalepa formed a group called Breakout which existed for 13 years before disbanding in 1981. Breakout had released 10 albums. In 1982, he debuted as a solo artist in the Gwardia Hall in Warsaw in concert \\"Rock-Blok\\". The same year he recorded an album for Izabela Trojanowska as well as formed his own band which consisted of (besides Nalepa): Ryszard Olesinski (guitar), Piotr Nowak (guitar), Bogdan Kowalewski (bass) and Marek Surzyn (drums). On 25 May 1985, Nalepa re-formed Breakout because of the band's 20th anniversary. In 1986, magazine Jazz Forum named him the best musician, composer and guitar player. Along with the other winners, he took part in the concert series \\"Blues/Rock Top '86\\" and at the same time, he also started co-operating with another Polish rock/blues band D≈ºem, (literally Jam). The two released a successful album Numero Uno. After series of concerts abroad, Nalepa released a dual album, To m√≥j blues (My Blues), which consisted recordings between 1982 and 1988. In 1993, he performed with Nalepa-Breakout and the group released an album Jeste≈õ w piekle (You are in Hell) and in the same year he was awarded the Maria Jurkowska Award by the III Program of the Polish Radio. The following albums, as Tadeusz Nalepa, were released with different band members. His last release was a DVD 60 urodziny (60th birthday) (the only one in his catalogue), released in 2006 which contained a show from 22 November 2003. It was reissued later on as a DVD+Cd. In 2003, Nalepa was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Polonia Restituta. Nalepa became very ill in the recent years and he had to be dialised because of the kidney problem. He died on 4 March 2007 due to serious illness of his digestive system.

Han River from the museum site, showing its then-peaceful situation. The Museum of Cham Sculpture is a museum located in H·∫£i Ch√¢u District, ƒê√† N·∫µng, central Vietnam, near the Han River. The establishment of a Cham sculpture museum in Da Nang was first proposed in 1902 by the Department of Archaeology of EFEO. Henri Parmentier, a prominent archaeologist of the department, made great contributions to the campaign for its construction. Reportedly founded in 1915 as the Mus√©e Henri Parmentier, its first building opened in 1919 and was designed by two French architects, M. Deleval and M. Auclair, who were inspired by Parmentier to use some traditional Cham elements in the composition. Prior to the establishment of the museum, the site was known as the \\"garden of sculptures\\" and many Cham sculptures that had been collected in Da Nang, Qu·∫£ng Nam and elsewhere had been brought there over the preceding twenty years. The museum has been expanded twice. The first expansion was in the mid-1930s, with two new galleries providing display space for the objects added in the 1920s and 1930s. Henri Parmentier directed the display based on the areas where sculptures were found. The 1000 meter square of floor space was arranged for the collections of M·ªπ S∆°n, Tr√† Ki·ªáu, ƒê·ªìng D∆∞∆°ng, Th√°p M·∫´m, Quang Tri, Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh and Kon Tum. In 2002, the Museum was again expanded with the two-story building providing an additional 1000 square meters. The new building provides not only space for display, but also for storage, a library, a restoration workshop and offices for staff. Before 2007, the Museum was managed by Da Nang Museums, an administrative organ in charge of the city's museums and heritage. In 2008 it became affiliated with the city Department of Culture, Sport and Tourism. The museum houses the world's largest collection of Cham sculpture and is a popular tourist destination.

He did not start any game during his first three years of play, but started at the left offensive guard position for the National Football League's Pittsburgh Steelers from 1970 to 1979. In 1970, Chuck Noll's second year as head coach, Davis replaced Larry Gagner and started all 14 games. From 1970 to 1979, he played next to left offensive tackle Jon Kolb and the two went on to win four Super Bowl rings together with the Steelers (Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV). However, Davis injured his foot before Pittsburgh's first Super Bowl and Jim Clack started in his place in Super Bowls IX and then retained the starting job throughout the 1975 season and Super Bowl X. In 1980, he was replaced by Ray Pinney. Death On September 10, 2019, at approximately 6:50 am, Davis, aged 75, was reported missing from the New Life Care Personal Home in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He had been suffering from dementia and was legally blind. Later that evening, authorities announced that Davis was found deceased inside of the facility. Davis' family later stated that he had died of a heart attack.

It is organized by the Colombian Cycling Federation, and was previously included in the UCI America Tour. History The first Vuelta a Colombia was held in 1951 as an idea of Englishman Donald W. Raskin and a few of his friends, emulating the European Tour de France. It was a 1,233 kilometers race which was divided in 10 stages which included three rest days. Thirty-five cyclists lined up for the race and of which thirty finished the race. The first champion of the Vuelta was Efra√≠n Forero Trivi√±o who won seven stages of the race. For the second edition, the race was increased in stages to 13 and was around 1,670 km in length. It was held from the 12 to the 27 or 28 January 1952. It appears that 60 cyclists lined up for the race. The 3rd edition of the race was the first edition to have 15 stages that covered 1,750 km. Over the years, there has been several serious accidents and even deaths during the race. Some of these cyclists, who have had very serious and career-ending accidents, include Conrado \\"Tito\\" Gallo, Gilberto Achicanoy, Felipe Li√±√°n and Ernesto Santander. In 2005, there was a tragic accident in the Vuelta in which a local radio journalist, Alberto Mart√≠nez Prader, died while transmitting the race. Martinez was traveling in a jeep with Jos√© Fernando L√≥pez and H√©ctor Urrego when, descending from the La Linea peak towards Calarc√°, the vehicle lost control on a curve and fell into a ravine. It is currently a fifteen-stage race that is regarded as one of the toughest races in cycling. The mountain passes that the peloton encounters are hundreds of metres higher than any of the passes used in the Tour de France. The 2010 edition was won by Sergio Luis Henao of the Indeportes Antioquia-Idea-FLA-Loter√≠a de Medell√≠n Team ahead of teammate √ìscar Sevilla and Jos√© Rujano, the previous year's winner. Doping On 21 November, R√≥binson L√≥pez (Loteria de Boyaca), current U23 Colombian champion, tested positive for the third generation blood booster - CERA.

Description  Green sturgeon Sturgeons are among the largest and most ancient of ray finned fishes. They are placed, along with paddlefishes and numerous fossil groups, in the infraclass Chondrostei, which also contains the ancestors of all other bony fishes. The sturgeons themselves are not ancestral to modern bony fishes but are a highly specialized and successful offshoot of ancestral chondrosteans, retaining such ancestral features as a heterocercal tail, fin structure, jaw structure, and spiracle. They have replaced a bony skeleton with one of cartilage, and possess a few large bony plates instead of scales. Sturgeons are highly adapted for preying on bottom animals, which they detect with a row of sensitive barbels on the underside of their snouts. They protrude their very long and flexible ‚Äúlips‚Äù to suck up food. Sturgeons are confined to temperate waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Of 25 extant species, only two live in California, the green sturgeon and the white sturgeon (A. transmontanus). (Moyle 2002) Green sturgeon are similar in appearance to white sturgeon, except the barbels are closer to the mouth than to the tip of the long, narrow snout. The dorsal row of bony plates numbers 8‚Äì11, lateral rows, 23‚Äì30, and bottom rows, 7‚Äì10; there is one large scute behind the dorsal fin as well as behind the anal fin (both lacking in white sturgeon). The scutes also tend to be sharper and more pointed than in white sturgeon. The dorsal fin has 33‚Äì36 rays, the anal fin, 22‚Äì28. The body colour of the white sturgeon is yellow with some pink instead of the green of the green sturgeon. Green sturgeon can reach 7 feet (210 cm) in length and weigh up to 350 pounds (159 kg).  Protected status  On April 7, 2006, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a final rule listing the Southern distinct population segment (DPS) of North American green sturgeon as a threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act. Included in the listing is the green sturgeon population spawning in the Sacramento River and living in the Sacramento River, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and the San Francisco Bay Estuary. This threatened determination was based on the reduction of potential spawning habitat, the severe threats to the single remaining spawning population, the inability to alleviate these threats with the conservation measures in place, and the decrease in observed numbers of juvenile Southern DPS green sturgeon collected in the past two decades compared to those collected historically (NMFS 2006). Critical habitat for the Southern DPS of green sturgeon was designated under the United States Endangered Species Act on October 9, 2009. The northern DPS of the green sturgeon (which spawn in the Rogue River, Klamath River, and Umpqua River) is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  Life history and habitat requirements  A juvenile green sturgeon Sturgeons life history strategy seems organized around reducing risks. Sturgeons live a long time, delay maturation to large sizes, and spawn multiple times over their lifespan. The sturgeon's long life span and repeat spawning in multiple years allows them to outlive periodic droughts and environmental catastrophes. The high fecundity that comes with large size allows them to produce large numbers of offspring when suitable spawning conditions occur and to make up for years of poor conditions. Adult green sturgeon do not spawn every year, and only a fraction of the population enters freshwater where they risk greater exposure to catastrophic events. The widespread ocean distribution of green sturgeon ensures that most of the population is dispersed and less vulnerable than they are in estuaries and freshwater streams. The ecology and life history of green sturgeon have received little study, evidently because of the generally low abundance, limited spawning distribution, and low commercial and sport fishing value of the species (Moyle 2002). Green sturgeon enters rivers mainly to spawn. and is more marine than other sturgeon species (Moyle 2002). The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) reported in 1995 that for the Klamath River, green sturgeon life history could be divided into three phases: 1) freshwater juveniles (<3 years old); 2) coastal migrants (3‚Äì13 years old for females and 3‚Äì9 years for males); and 3) adults (>13 years old for females and > 9 years old for males). Northern DPS green sturgeon migrate up the Klamath River between late February and late July (Moyle 2002). The spawning period is March‚ÄìJuly, with a peak from mid-April to mid-June (Moyle 2002). Spawning takes place in deep, fast water (Moyle 2002). Preferred spawning substrate is likely large cobble, but it can range from clean sand to bedrock (Moyle 2002). Eggs are broadcast and externally fertilized in relatively fast water and probably in depths greater than 3 m (Moyle 2002). Female green sturgeon produce 59,000‚Äì242,000 eggs, about 4.34 millimeters (mm) in diameter (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001 and 2006). Temperatures of 23‚Äì26 ¬∞C affected cleavage and gastrulation of green sturgeon embryos and all died before hatch (Van Eenennaam et al. 2005). Temperatures of 17.5‚Äì22 ¬∞C were suboptimal as an increasing number of green sturgeon embryos developed abnormally and hatching success decreased at 20.5‚Äì22 ¬∞C, although the tolerance to these temperatures varied between progenies (Van Eenennaam et al. 2005). The lower temperature limit was not evident from the Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 study, although hatching rate decreased at 11 ¬∞C and hatched green sturgeon embryos were shorter, compared to 14 ¬∞C. The mean total length of hatched green sturgeon embryos decreased with increasing temperature, although their wet and dry weight remained relatively constant (Van Eenennaam et al. 2005). Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 concluded that temperatures 17‚Äì18 ¬∞C may be the upper limit of the thermal optima for green sturgeon embryos. Growth studies on younger juvenile green sturgeon determined that cyclical 19‚Äì24 ¬∞C water temperature was optimal (Allen et al. 2006). Green sturgeon fertilization and hatching rates are 41.2% and 28.0%, compared with 95.4% and 82.1% for the white sturgeon (Deng et al. 2002). However, the survival of green sturgeon larvae is very high (93.3%) (Deng et al. 2002). Female green sturgeon invest a greater amount of their reproductive resources into maternal yolk for nourishment of the embryo, which results in larger larvae (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Five-day-old green sturgeon larvae have almost twice the weight of white sturgeon larvae (65 versus 34 milligrams (mg)) (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). This greater reserve of maternal yolk and larger larvae could provide an advantage in larval feeding and survival (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Compared with other acipenserids, green sturgeon larvae appear more robust and easier to rear (Van Eenennaam et al. 2001). Juveniles continue to grow rapidly, reaching 300 mm in 1 year and over 600 mm within 2‚Äì3 years for the Klamath River (USFWS 1995). Juveniles spend from 1‚Äì4 years in fresh and estuarine waters and disperse into salt water at lengths of 300‚Äì750 mm (USFWS 1995). A conceptual model of early behavior and migration of green sturgeon early life intervals based on the Kynard et al. 2005 study follows: Females deposit eggs at sites with large rocks and moderate or eddy water flow that keeps the large, dense, poorly adhesive eggs from drifting, so eggs sink deep within the rocks. CH2M Hill (2002) assumed that hatchling green sturgeon embryos drift downstream like hatchling white sturgeon embryos. This was incorrect. Hatchling green sturgeon embryos seek nearby cover, and remain under rocks, unlike white sturgeon which drift downstream as embryos (i.e. newly hatched green sturgeon do not exhibit pelagic behavior like newly hatched white sturgeon) (Deng et al. 2002). After about 9 days fish develop into larvae and initiate exogenous foraging up- and downstream on the bottom (they do not swim up into the water column, unlike white sturgeon). After a day or so, larvae initiate a downstream dispersion migration that lasts about 12 days (peak, 5 days). At the age of ten days, when exogenous foraging begins, green sturgeons are 19 to 29 mm in length (mean 24 mm) (Deng et al. 2002). At the age of 15 to 21 days, green sturgeon are 30 mm or greater in length (Deng et al. 2002). At the age of 45 days, metamorphosis is complete and green sturgeon are 70 to 80 mm in length (Deng et al. 2002). All migration and foraging during the migration period is nocturnal, unlike white sturgeon. During the first 10 months of life, green sturgeon are the most nocturnal of any North American sturgeon yet studied, and this was the case for all life intervals during any activity (migration, foraging, or wintering). Post-migrant larvae are benthic, foraging up- and downstream diurnally with a nocturnal activity peak. Foraging larvae select open habitat, not structure habitat, but continue to use cover in the day. When larvae develop into juveniles, there is no change in response to bright habitat, and no preference or avoidance of bright habitat. In the fall, juveniles migrate downstream mostly at night to wintering sites, ceasing migration at 7‚Äì8 ¬∞C. During winter, juveniles select low light habitat, likely deep pools with some rock structure. Wintering juveniles forage actively at night between dusk and dawn and are inactive during the day, seeking the darkest available habitat. For the Klamath River green sturgeon, an average length of 1.0 m is attained in 10 years, 1.5 m by age 15, and 2.0 m by 25 years of age (USFWS 1993). The largest reported green sturgeon weighed about 159 kg and was 2.1 m in length (USFWS 1993). The largest green sturgeon have been aged at 42 years, but this is probably an underestimate, and maximum ages of 60‚Äì70 years or more are likely (Moyle 2002). Little is known about green sturgeon feeding at sea, but it is clear they behave quite differently than white sturgeon (CDFG 2005a). Green sturgeons are probably found in all open Oregon estuaries, with a lot of movement in and out of estuaries and up and down the coast (ODFW 2005a). Adults feed in estuaries during the summer (ODFW 2005a). Stomachs of green sturgeons caught in Suisun Bay contained Corophium sp. (amphipod), Crago franciscorum (bay shrimp), Neomysis awatchensis (Opossum shrimp) and annelid worms (Ganssle 1966). Stomachs of green sturgeon caught in San Pablo Bay contained Crago franciscorum (bay shrimp), Macoma sp. (clam), Photis californica (amphipod), Corophium sp. (amphipod), Synidotea laticauda (isopod), and unidentified crab and fish (Ganssle 1966). Stomachs of green sturgeons caught in Delta contained Corophium sp. (amphipod), Neomysis awatchensis (Opossum shrimp) (Radtke 1966). Radtke 1966 also reported that while the Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea) was abundant throughout the Delta, Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay, it was not utilized as a food source by green sturgeons. Conservation Water diversion is one of the factors affecting conservation efforts for the green sturgeon. Threats to the green sturgeon include being taken as bycatch in salmon gillnet and other fisheries, water development projects that affect migration or decrease habitat quality, and other land use stressors that affect habitat quality. Exotic species may negatively affect the southern DPS. Commercial fisheries have been prohibited in the Columbia River and Willapa Bay since 2001. Harvest of green sturgeon in California has been prohibited since March 2007. Beginning in March 2010 and to protect green sturgeon on their spawning grounds, the Sacramento River sturgeon fishery was closed year-round between the Keswick Dam and Hwy 162 bridge (approximately 90 miles).  Current and historical distribution  Prehistoric fish distributions have been mapped by Gobalet et al. 2004 based on bones at Native American archaeological sites. Data were reported on dozens of sites throughout California and summarized by county. Sturgeon remains were observed in 12 counties, all in the Central Valley. Observations were concentrated at San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin and delta sites (Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco, Marin, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties). Historical 18th-century accounts report the aboriginal gillnetting and use of tule balsa watercraft for the capture of sturgeon, and fishing weirs were also likely employed on bay tidal flats (Gobalet et al. 2004). Most sturgeons were unidentified species but green sturgeons were specifically identified from Contra Costa and Marin County sites. Sturgeon remains (unidentified species) were also identified from lower Sacramento River counties (Sacramento, Yolo, Colusa, Glenn, and Butte counties). No sturgeon remains were found in samples from the upper Sacramento River although other fish species including salmonids were reported in those areas. Green sturgeons which spawn in the Rogue River, Klamath River, and Umpqua River are the Northern DPS green sturgeon, while the green sturgeons which spawn in the Sacramento River system are Southern DPS green sturgeon (NMFS 2005). Both the Northern DPS green sturgeon and Southern DPS green sturgeon occur in large numbers in the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor, Washington (NMFS 2005). A number of presumed spawning populations (Eel River and South Fork Trinity River) have been lost in the past 25‚Äì30 years (Moyle 2002). Moyle 1976 reported green sturgeon spawning in the Mad River, but does not mention the Mad River in 2002. Scott and Crossman 1973 reported potential spawning in the Fraser River in Canada, but Moyle 2002 reported that there was no evidence of green sturgeon spawning in Canada or Alaska. Green and white sturgeon enter the Feather River system annually and spawning of green sturgeon was documented for the first time in 2011(Seesholtz et al. 2014). No current use by sturgeon of Sacramento River tributaries, other than the Feather River system, has been reported (Beamesderfer et al. 2004, Moyle 2002). No evidence was found to indicate that green sturgeons were historically present, are currently present, or were historically present and have been extirpated from the San Joaquin River upstream from the Delta (Beamesderfer et al. 2004). There is no evidence of green sturgeon spawning in the Columbia River or other rivers in Washington (Moyle 2002, ODFW 2005a and 2005b). In contrast to those studies, samples from green sturgeon collected in the Columbia River suggest the existence of one or more spawning populations in addition to the Sacramento system, Klamath, and Rogue populations, suggesting not all spawning populations have been identified (Israel et al. 2004). The green sturgeon is the most widely distributed member of the sturgeon family Acipenseridae, and is also the most marine-oriented of the sturgeon species. Green sturgeon are known to range in nearshore marine waters from Mexico to the Bering Sea, with a general tendency to head North after their out-migration from freshwater (NMFS 2005). They are commonly observed in bays and estuaries along the western coast of North America, with particularly large concentrations entering the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor during the late summer (Moyle 2002, NMFS 2005). While there is some bias associated with recovery of tagged fish through commercial fishing, the pattern of a northern migration is supported by the large concentration of green sturgeon in the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, and Grays Harbor, which peaks in August (NMFS 2005). Individual Southern DPS green sturgeon tagged by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) in the San Francisco Estuary have been recaptured off Santa Cruz, California; in Winchester Bay on the southern Oregon coast; at the mouth of the Columbia River; and in Gray's Harbor, Washington (USFWS 1993 and Moyle 2002). Most tags for Southern DPS green sturgeon tagged in the San Francisco Estuary have been returned from outside that estuary (Moyle 2002). Green sturgeons remain present in all documented historic habitats and ranges in Oregon (ODFW 2005b). White and green sturgeon juveniles, subadults, and adults are widely distributed in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and estuary areas including San Pablo (Beamesderfer et al. 2004). White sturgeon historically ranged into upper portions of the Sacramento system including the Pit River and a substantial number were trapped in and above Lake Shasta when Shasta Dam was closed in 1944 and successfully reproduced until the early 1960s (Beamesderfer et al. 2004). Landlocked white sturgeon populations have been widely observed in the Columbia and Fraser systems but no landlocked green sturgeon populations have ever been documented in any river system (Beamesderfer et al. 2004), indicating that green sturgeon likely did not historically spawn in the upper reaches of rivers prior to the construction of large dams as NMFS 2005 has assumed. Taxonomy According to recent genetic data, the differences between the mitogenomes of the Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) and the Sakhalin sturgeon (Acipenser mikadoi) to correspond to the variability at the intraspecific level. The time since the divergence of the Green sturgeon and the Sakhalin sturgeon may be approximately 160000 years. References Further reading * * Allen, P. J., M. Nicholl, S. Cole, A. Vlazny, and J.J.

The tribunal began operations on 1 July 1993. On 1 January 2005, the tribunal's name was changed from Local Government Pecuniary Interest Tribunal reflecting an increase in its functions. On 1 January 2014 its functions were merged into the newly established New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NACT). Composition The Governor of New South Wales may appoint a person as a member of the tribunal. The person must be a lawyer who is eligible to be either a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales or the District Court of New South Wales. A retired judge of those courts is also eligible for appointment. The governor may also appoint a deputy to the tribunal if necessary. The current member of the tribunal is David Officer QC. Jurisdiction Since its creation, the tribunal has had exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into referred complaints about the failure to disclose pecuniary interests by mayors and local government councillors. A pecuniary interest is an interest that a person has in a matter because of a reasonable likelihood or expectation of appreciable financial gain or loss to the person in exercising their duties or functions in local government. Generally, a complaint is made first to the Director- General of the New South Wales Department of Local Government. The director- general may then refer the complaint to the tribunal for hearing. From 1 January 2005, the tribunal received the additional jurisdiction to decide allegations of misconduct referred by the director-general. The director- general may investigate the allegations, and either deal with the matter him or herself, or may refer the matter to the tribunal. The director-general in some cases may suspend a person. When this occurs, the person may appeal to the tribunal under section 440M. When the tribunal decides this appeal, there is no further appeal allowed. Hearings The tribunal has the power to hold public or private hearings. Generally, proceedings are to be open to the public. It has the power to issue notices requiring documents to be produced or for witnesses to attend before the tribunal. A person appearing before the tribunal may be legally represented. A person appearing before the tribunal may be required to answer questions even if they incriminate the person. Contempt of the tribunal may be referred to the Supreme Court for consideration. Decisions A person may be found in contravention of the Act on the balance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt. Where such a finding has been made, the tribunal may counsel the offender, reprimand them, suspend them or disqualified them. It may in certain circumstances, recommend other action be taken against the person. A person may appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales in respect of a finding.

They were constructed one each in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to the same basic design during the Second World War for service with the Royal Navy. Converted from merchant ships, they were only able to accommodate a composite squadron of about 15‚Äì20 aircraft. Their armaments were mainly anti-aircraft weapons, with one twin 4 inch Dual Purpose, Anti Aircraft gun. One of the class, Campania, was the first British carrier to be fitted with an Action Information Organisation (AIO) and a Type 277 radar able to detect low-level aircraft. Once completed the first carrier did not take part in active service until January 1944, but all three served as convoy escorts during the final year of the war. They had some success during their patrols, and anti-submarine Fairey Swordfish flying from their decks sank and damaged some German U-boats and their fighters succeeded in shooting down German long-range reconnaissance aircraft.

Their armaments concentrated on anti-aircraft (AA) defence and comprised two 4 inch Dual Purpose, AA guns on a twin mount, sixteen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons on eight twin mounts and sixteen 2 Pounder Pom Pom on four quadruple mounts. Aircraft assigned were either anti-submarine or fighter aircraft, which could be made up of a mixture of the Hawker Sea Hurricane, Grumman Wildcat, Fairey Fulmar or Fairey Swordfish.Cocker (2008), p.80. The exact composition of the embarked squadrons depended upon the mission. Some squadrons were composite squadrons for convoy defence and would be equipped with anti-submarine and fighter aircraft,Poolman(1972), p.98. while other squadrons working in a strike carrier role would only be equipped with fighter aircraft.Morison (2002), p.342. Service history =HMS Nairana= Three Fairey Swordfish armed with RP-3 rockets. Vindex and Nairana were both commissioned within days of each other in December 1943, and moved to Gourock for working up.Poolman (1972), p.114. Nairana with 835 Naval Air Squadron Fleet Air Arm on board commenced flying exercises with HMS Activity on 27 January 1944. Both carriers left the River Clyde on 29 January with the 2nd Escort Group under the command of Captain Frederic John Walker. They were to form a \\"hunter killer group\\" in the waters west of Ireland, providing cover for two southbound convoys OS 66 and KMS 70. Weather conditions had prohibited flying until 31 January. With clearer weather Nairana turned into the wind to send off her first anti-submarine patrol. At the same time Wild Goose reported contact with a submerged U-boat on her ASDIC. Warning Nairana that she had just turned into danger, the carrier took avoiding action. The U-boat U-592 was sunk by Wild Goose and Walker's own ship Starling, while a Fairey Swordfish from Nairana circled the area.Poolman (1972), p.115. By this stage of the war the Royal Navy had enough escort carriers available not only to double them up on a convoy escort but to permanently detach one to work with a \\"hunter killer group\\" operating outside the convoy system. The 2nd Escort Group still under the command of Walker was the group chosen with Vindex as the carrier. As she would not be supported by another carrier Vindexs air group was formed from the experienced 825 Naval Air Squadron, with a complement of 12 Fairey Swordfish Mk IIs and six Sea Hurricanes IICs. Even though there were 12 Swordfish on board they had only eight crews so the Sea Hurricanes carried out some of the daylight anti-submarine patrols. The Sea Hurricanes had been fitted with four racks for the same RP-3 rockets used by the Swordfish to attack submarines.Poolman (1972), p.120. Leaving Northern Ireland on 9 March 1944, 2nd Escort Group moved to the area believed to hold the highest concentration of U-boats. Over the night of 12 March Swordfish on patrol had 28 contacts on their airborne to surface vessel radar (ASV). Their first attack was unsuccessful dropping two depth charges that failed to explode believed to be caused by faulty safety clips, during the attack the rear gunner in the Swordfish was killed by the U-boats anti-aircraft guns. The depth charges dropped short on a second attack and failed to explode on a third attack during the same night.Poolman (1972), pp.120‚Äì121. On the night of 15 March two Swordfish got an ASV contact ahead of the escort group. Unable to see anything in the darkness they dropped flares and sea markers over the location. When the escort group arrived they picked up a contact on their ASDIC and the U-653 was sunk.Poolman (1972). p.121. Weather conditions were still not perfect for flying and in the following days, one Swordfish returning from a night patrol landed in the sea alongside the carrier, the crew were reported missing believed killed. A pitching deck caused one Swordfish to crash into the sea on take-off and another Swordfish crashed into the sea on take-off when its engine failed. One Swordfish taking off clipped the island superstructure losing off both wing tips. The pilot managed to get the aircraft into the air circled around jettisoning his depth charges and landed again without mishap. Landing on the heaving deck was just as dangerous, two Sea Hurricanes and two Swordfish missed the arrestor wires and ended up crashing into the safety barriers. On 24 March 1944 a Swordfish with its engine shot up and crew injured attempted to land back on Vindex. It crash landed onto the flight deck coming to a stop from the end of the flight deck. Leaking petrol set the wreckage on fire, the crew were rescued but the fire exploded one of two depth charges stuck on their racks. A hole by was blown in the flight deck. After 16 days at sea Vindex returned to port. With two days flying lost because of the weather conditions, the Swordfish had amassed a creditable 275 flying hours and 122 deck landings by day and night. The Sea Hurricanes contributed another 47 hours flying and 39 deck landings.Poolman (1972), p.122. At the end of May 1944 Nairana sailed with the 15th Escort Group. On board was 835 Naval Air Squadron equipped with nine Swordfish and six Sea Hurricanes. The Swordfish patrolled day and night and some contacts were made on the ASV. All the contact come to nothing, it is now known the older model ASV in Nairanas Swordfish could be detected by receivers on board U-boats. In May they escorted convoys SL 157 (Freetown to United Kingdom) with MKS 48 (Mediterranean to United Kingdom) and the next group SL 158 with MKS 49. From 25 May the convoys were located by German Junkers Ju 290 reconnaissance aircraft. On the 25 and the morning of 26 May they were driven off undamaged but one Sea Hurricane failed to pull out of a dive killing the pilot. Later the same day another two Ju 290s appeared one was shot down and the other was probably shot down.Poolman (1972), p.141‚Äì142. =HMS Vindex= 825 Naval Air Squadron Sea Hurricane takes off from HMS Vindex. With Vindex damaged and needing a refit and Campania still not commissioned, Nairana was the only ship of her class fit for sea on 1 April 1944. She left in the first week of April with the outbound convoys OS 72 (West Africa) and KMS 46 (Gibraltar).Poolman (1972), p.137. She still had 825 Naval Air Squadron on board but this time she was overloaded with 18 aircraft: 12 Swordfish Mk IIs and six Sea Hurricanes IIcs. At the end of the month Vindex joined the 5th Escort Group. On 6 May a patrolling Swordfish was contacted by two of the escort frigates, who reported they were in contact with a submerged U-boat. The frigates carried out a depth charge attack and forced U-765 to the surface. The Swordfish despite the anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat dropped two of its depth charges which broke the submarine in half.Poolman (1972), p.138. Flying became dangerous in the heavy seas and poor visibility. One Sea Hurricane was damaged beyond repair after a serious crash into the safety barrier and another crashed into the sea with the loss of the pilot. The Swordfish crews fared little better. Three aircraft and one crew were lost during the same period. On 9 May Vindexs aircraft lift broke down with a burnt out motor. The crew had to resort to manually cranking the lift up and down, taking an hour to go each way. They eventually repaired the lift by moving the capstan motor through holes burned into the bulkheads.Poolman (1972), pp.139‚Äì140. During the second deployment by Vindex her aircraft flew over 400 sorties in 13 days. The strain on the aircrews began to show and only 35 per cent of the original Swordfish crews were still with the ship when they returned to port. It was during this second deployment that one of the ships officers, Sub-Lieutenant J.M. Morrison invented a blind landing system soon to be used on all the Royal Navy carriers. He modified an ASV radar set which was placed on the flight deck. The system employed the Air Directing Officer guiding aircraft to within of the ship. They could then be picked up on the ASV and brought in astern of the carrier at a height of .Poolman (1972), p.140. On 15 August 1944, Vindex and HMS Striker joined convoy JW 59 the first Arctic convoy to Russia of the year. Vindex still had 825 Naval Air Squadron on board but they were now equipped with the Swordfish Mk III. This version of the biplane had a Rocket-assisted take off system (RATOG) and a new ASV radar in a dome on the underside of the aircraft. The extra weight reduced the crew to two, doing away with the Telegraphist-Air-Gunner. There was a full complement of 12 Swordfish and eight Sea Hurricanes (two unassembled spares) on board. The larger Striker had 12 Swordfish and 12 Grumman Wildcats. The Swordfish claimed their first success on 22 August sinking U-354 and claimed another as possibly sunk. Her rocket armed Sea Hurricanes also claimed a U-boat damaged. Neither convoy JW 59 or the returning RA 59A lost any ships.Poolman (1972), p.143. Fleet Air Arm Grumman Wildcat Russian convoy JW 61 which sailed on 20 October had for the first time three escort carriers, Vindex, Nairana and HMS Tracker. This was a large convoy of 62 merchant ships with a large escort group. Vice-Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton was in command with Vindex as his flagship. Nairana had 835 Naval Air Squadron with 14 Swordfish IIIs and six Wildcat VIs on board for what would be their first Arctic convoy. Vindex had a re-formed 811 Naval Air Squadron with the same aircraft types and numbers. The third carrier was HMS Tracker with 10 Grumman Avengers and six Wildcats. The short Arctic days meant that most flying would be at night. The three carriers worked a system of eight-hour watches. One would be the duty carrier with its aircraft aloft, the second would be on standby with its aircraft arranged on deck ready to scramble and the third resting. The two Swordfish equipped squadrons because of their better night flying equipment shared the night time hours while Trackers Avengers worked the daylight hours.Poolman (1972), p.144. The strength of the convoys escort may have deterred the Germans and no U-boats or reconnaissance aircraft were detected until the convoy approached the Kola Inlet. Even then the heavy escort prevented any attack and the convoy reached port safely.Poolman (1972), p.145. The return convoy RA 61 was equally successful with only one frigate damaged by a torpedo just after leaving Kola. Vindex had to take avoiding action after detecting a torpedo coming towards her. Vindexs inexperienced squadron lost a Wildcat pilot when his plane crashed into the sea attempting to land back on board. A Swordfish crashed into the sea following a rocket assisted take off with the loss of the two man crew. Another Swordfish crashed on landing with the aircraft initially hung over the ship's side from its tail hook. When the hook gave way it crashed into the sea and only the pilot was rescued. The squadron in total lost or so severely damaged eight Swordfish and two Wildcats that they could not fly again.Poolman (1972), p.146 =HMS Campania= HMS Campania Campania was commissioned in February 1944, her delay in construction meant she was the first British carrier to be fitted with Action Information Organisation (AIO) and a Type 277 Radar able to detect low- level aircraft. She had 813 Naval Air Squadron on board, equipped with 12 Swordfish Mk III, four Grumman Wildcats and three Fairey Fulmars. Her first convoy supported by the escort carrier Striker was the uneventful JW 60 to Russia. The return convoy RA 60 did have two merchant ships torpedoed for the loss of U-921. Between the two carriers five Swordfish and two Wildcats were lost. On 1 November 1944, Campania took part in Operation Golden convoys JW and RA 61A this was a small convoy with only the escorts and two passenger liners repatriating 11,000 Russians who were released prisoners of war. They left Russia 10 November with the liners bringing back Russian sailors, crews for ships being loaned to the Russian navy. Both journeys were relatively uneventful no U-boats interfered with their progress and the only action was the shooting down of two Blohm and Voss 138s by the Wildcats of 813 Naval Air Squadron. One Wildcat was lost when it crashed on take-off. The normal Arctic convoys restarted at the end of November, Campania and Nairana were paired as part of the escort. Both ships still had their established squadrons on board 813 and 835, with Swordfish IIIs and Wildcat VIs. The first convoy JW and RA 62 were subjected to the first joint U-boat and torpedo bomber attacks since convoy PQ 18 two years previously. No ships in the convoy were lost but they did sink U-365 and shot down two Junkers Ju 88s and one Blohm and Voss 138. Two Swordfish and one Wildcat with the pilot were lost. Fairey Fulmar On 6 February 1945, Campania, Nairana, the cruiser HMS Bellona and eight fleet destroyers joined 26 merchant ships in convoy JW64. This time the squadrons had spare aircrews for their aircraft and Campanias squadron included a Fairey Fulmar fitted with a Royal Air Force AI air-to-air interception radar, for use as a dedicated night fighter.Poolman (1972), p.147. Shortly after the escorts and convoy came together Campanias radar operator reported a target approaching. Both carriers scrambled two Wildcats, to intercept the intruder. Campanias Wildcats got there first and shot down a Junkers Ju 88, one of the Wildcats was also shot down with the loss of the pilot. The next morning as 07:45 Campanias radar detected aircraft approaching. Two groups of Junkers Ju 88 torpedo bombers appeared and the convoys escorts opened fire. The ships manoeuvred to avoid the torpedo attack and Nairanas Wildcats were airborne by 08:10. No ships were hit during the attacks and the bombers evaded the fighters in the heavy cloud cover. Campanias Swordfish were flying the daylight anti-submarine patrols, with a mixed armament of four RP-3 rockets and two depth charges. On 7 November 835 Squadron claimed a Junkers Ju 88 damaged.Poolman (1972), pp.147‚Äì148. The long Arctic night with only four hours of light a day together with heavy seas and low visibility hampered any operations by the Wildcats. During darkness the ships could hear the engines of the shadowing German aircraft closing in. Campanias night fighting Fulmar took off at 17:30, but its electrics failed as it was approaching the German aircraft and it was forced to return to the carrier. The Fulmar landed off centre crashed into the safety barrier putting itself and the carrier out of action. On 10 November a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol reported 30 Junkers Ju 88s approaching the convoy. The Wildcats took off to intercept the torpedo bombers and the escorts opened fire on them. The combined fire from the escorts and the Wildcats shot down four Ju 88s, two more were claimed as probably shot down by the Wildcats and another was severely damaged. Those Ju 88s that did release their torpedoes failed to hit any of the ships and a number of the torpedoes were seen to detonate in the ships wakes, as they turned away from the attack. Two of the Wildcats were also shot down by the barrage from the escorts.Poolman (1972), pp.148‚Äì149 The combined losses had reduced the escorts fighter cover three aircraft, one on Campania and two on Nairana at 11:30 another group of Junkers Ju 88 torpedo bombers were discovered approaching. Nairanas Wildcats took off and shot one down the others under fire from the escorts dropped their torpedoes too soon and they all missed.Poolman (1972), p.149. The return convoy RA 64 left Kola Inlet on the morning of 17 February, one of the escorts and a merchant ship were torpedoed almost immediately. Another merchant ship was torpedoed that afternoon. Terrible weather conditions kept all aircraft grounded until 20 November, when it began to clear the Luftwaffe also appeared and the Wildcats were scrambled to intercept them. Two Ju 88s were shot down by the fighters another two by the escorts and three were damaged.Poolman (1972), pp.151‚Äì152. The convoys had lost to enemy action two fighters, two escorts and two merchant ships. In return they claimed 15 aircraft destroyed, seven aircraft probably destroyed and one U-boat sunk.Poolman (1972), p.154. Campania did one more Russian convoy JW 65 in March 1945, which had two merchant ships torpedoed and sunk on their approach to Kola Inlet. These were the last losses on a Russian convoy. =Later careers= With the war over there was no further need for escort carriers. HMS Nairana was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy in 1946. In Dutch service she was renamed the HNLMS Karel Doorman until 1948 when she was converted back into a merchantman named the Port Victor. HMS Vindex was sent out to the Far East as the flagship for Rear Admiral Cunninghame Graham. On her return she was placed in reserve and bought back by her original owner the Port Line. She was renamed Port Vindex and converted into a refrigerated cargo ship on the United Kingdom to Australia route. HMS Campania, still in escort carrier configuration, toured around the ports of Europe as the Festival of Britain ship in 1951.Poolman (1972), pp.155‚Äì156. In October 1952, she carried the equipment to the Montebello Islands for Operation Hurricane, the first British nuclear weapons test on 3 October 1952. She returned to Britain in December 1952, and was broken up at Blyth in November 1955.

Covering 346.562 miles (557.737 km), it travels the length of the state between US 90 in Mobile and SR 13 at the Tennessee state line, north of Zip City. Between Mobile and Deer Park in Washington County, SR 17 is the unsigned partner route assigned to U.S. Route 45 (US 45), and from Hamilton to Florence, it serves as the signed partner route assigned to US 43\\\\. It is the longest state route in Alabama that is not entirely the unsigned partner of a U.S. Route. Route description The southern terminus of US 45 and SR 17 is at their intersection with US 98 and unsigned SR 42 in Mobile. US 45 and SR 17 assume a northwestward trajectory as they leave Mobile heading towards the Mississippi state line. Approximately north of an interchange with Interstate 65 (I-65) northwest of downtown Mobile, the routes quickly enter rural areas of Mobile County via a two-lane highway. Near the small community of Deer Park in southern Washington County, SR 17 diverts from US 45 and becomes a signed route. After the split from US 45, SR 17 assumes a general northerly orientation as it passes through rural areas and small towns in western Alabama. The route passes through the Black Belt, historically one of the poorer areas of the state. After leaving Mobile, the route does not pass through any towns whose population exceeds 5,000 until it approaches Hamilton in Marion County. At Hamilton, SR 17 once again becomes an unsigned route upon the second junction it has with US 43; US 45 and SR 17 are the southern terminus of US 43 in Mobile. Between Hamilton and Muscle Shoals, SR 17 is a signed route. At Muscle Shoals, US 43, SR 17 and SR 13 intersect US 72 and several other state routes. At this point, SR 17 once again becomes a signed route as it leads through Muscle Shoals and Florence as it heads towards its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, where it becomes Tennessee State Route 13\\\\. History SR 17 was designated in 1940 between Kennedy and York. In 1952, the route was extended south to Mobile; from York to Deer Park, SR 29 was renumbered as part of SR 17, and from Deer Park to Mobile the route traveled concurrently with US 45\\\\. SR 17 was extended north to the Tennessee state line in 1956. To accomplish this, SR 17 replaced old SR 19 up to Hamilton, was concurrent with US 43 up to Florence, and replaced old SR 34 the rest of the way to the Tennessee state line.

PMX consists of computers, typically installed at a cable headend, that takes data fed to it (the video feed of The Weather Network, forecast information, and triggers to run said forecasts) and packages it for broadcast. Unlike the Weather Star systems, it does not generate full graphical or video segments, rather the information is super- imposed over the main video feed. History PMX was developed by Pelmorex in 1995 as a standard localization system that would replace the Weather Star 4000 units and the text based Weather Star IIIs that were still used in smaller communities. The PMX technology quickly rolled out starting 1996, with all communities receiving the new units by the end of 1997.

Products PMX is primarily used on segments that involve local weather information, notably during regular Local forecasts. Over the years PMX has been used for local tagging with advertisements, usually with listings of local dealers, and with \\"weather-triggered\\" advertising. PMX units at major satellite TV providers display forecasts for a list of major Canadian centres. However few smaller satellite providers in certain regions (e.g. SaskTel) use customized PMX units that cover its geographical area. Conditions are shown for multiple cities at one time and box areas intended for different forecast products on normal PMX systems are repurposed: the 4x2 grid used for the 7-Day Outlook displays precipitation forecasts for the next 24 hours for 14 cities in Saskatchewan. The technology has also been used for the MTS TV Weather Channel in Manitoba. PMX would be used to display warnings and alerts with the proposed \\"All Channel Alert\\" system.

Shias adhere to the teachings of Muhammad and the religious guidance of his family (who are referred to as the Ahl al- Bayt) or his descendants known as Shia Imams. Muhammad's bloodline continues only through his daughter Fatima Zahra and cousin Ali who alongside Muhammad's grandsons comprise the Ahl al-Bayt. Thus, Shias consider Muhammad's descendants as the true source of guidance. Shia Islam, like Sunni Islam, has at times been divided into many branches; however, only three of these currently have a significant number of followers, and each of them has a separate trajectory. From a political viewpoint the history of the Shia was in several stages. The first part was the emergence of the Shia, which starts after Muhammad's death in 632 and lasts until Battle of Karbala in 680. This part coincides with the Imamah of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussain. The second part is the differentiation and distinction of the Shia as a separate sect within the Muslim community, and the opposition of the Sunni caliphs. This part starts after the Battle of Karbala and lasts until the formation of the Shia states about 900. During this section Shi'ism divided into several branches. The third section is the period of Shia states. The first Shia state was the Idrisid dynasty (780‚Äì974) in Maghreb. Next was the Alavid dynasty (864‚Äì928) established in Mazandaran (Tabaristan), north of Iran. These dynasties were local, but they were followed by two great and powerful dynasties. The Fatimid Dynasty formed in Ifriqiya in 909, and ruled over varying areas of the Maghreb, Egypt and the Levant until 1171. The Buyid dynasty emerged in Daylaman, north of Iran, about 930 and then ruled over central and western parts of Iran and Iraq until 1048. In Yemen, Imams of various dynasties usually of the Zaidi sect established a theocratic political structure that survived from 897 until 1962. From Saqifa to Karbala Muhammad began preaching Islam at Mecca before migrating to Medina, from where he united the tribes of Arabia into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. While Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, the tribal leaders of Mecca and Medina held a secret gathering at Saqifah to decide who would succeed Muhammad as head of the Muslim state, disregarding what the earliest Muslims, the Muhajirun, regarded as Muhammad's appointment of Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad and was first person to congratulate Ali on event of Ghadeer, nominated Abu Bakr. Others, after initial refusal and bickering, settled on Abu Bakr who was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by Muhammad's earliest companions, who held that Ali had been designated his successor. According to Sunni accounts, Muhammad died without having appointed a successor, and with a need for leadership, they gathered and voted for the position of caliph. Shi'a accounts differ by asserting that Muhammad had designated Ali as his successor on a number of occasions, including on his death bed. Ali was supported by Muhammad's family and the majority of the Muhajirun, the initial Muslims, and was opposed by the tribal leaders of Arabia who included Muhammad's initial enemies, including, naturally, the Banu Umayya. Abu Bakr's election was followed by a raid on Ali's house led by Umar and Khalid ibn al-Walid (see Umar at Fatimah's house). See: * Holt (1977a), p.57 * Lapidus (2002), p.32 * Madelung (1996), p.43 * Tabatabaei (1979), p.30‚Äì50 The succession to Muhammad is an extremely contentious issue. Muslims ultimately divided into two branches based on their political attitude towards this issue, which forms the primary theological barrier between the two major divisions of Muslims: Sunni and Shi'a, with the latter following Ali as the successor to Muhammad. The two groups also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr, and the two caliphs who succeeded him: Umar (or \`Umar ibn al- KhattƒÅb) and Uthman or (‚ÄòUthmƒÅn ibn ‚ÄòAffƒÅn). Sunnis tend to stress Ali's acceptance and support of their rule, while the Shi'a claims that he distanced himself from them, and that he was being kept from fulfilling the religious duty that Muhammad had appointed to him. The Sunni Muslims say that if Ali was the rightful successor as ordained by God Himself, then it would have been his duty as the leader of the Muslim nation to make war with these people (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman) until Ali established the decree. Shia claim, however, that Ali did not fight Abu Bakr, Umar or Uthman, because firstly he did not have the military strength and if he decided to, it would have caused a civil war amongst the Muslims, which was still a nascent community throughout the Arab world.Sahih Bukhari Differentiation and distinction Diagram showing three of Shia and other branches. Shia Islam and Sunnism split in the aftermath of the death of Muhammad based on the politics of the early caliphs. Due to the Shi'a belief that Ali should have been the first caliph, the three caliphs that preceded him, Abu Bakr, Umar, and Usman, were considered illegitimate usurpers. Because of this, any hadith that were narrated by these three caliphs (or any of their supporters) were not accepted by Shi'a hadith collectors. Due to this, the number of hadith accepted by Shi'a is far less than the hadith accepted by Sunnis, with many of the non-accepted hadith being ones that had to deal with integral aspects of Islam, such as prayer and marriage. In the absence of a clear hadith for a situation, the Shi'a prefer the sayings and actions of the Imams (Prophet's family members) on the similar level as the hadith of the Prophet himself over other ways, which in turn led to the theological elevation of the Imams as being infallible. Division into branches = Ancestors and the family tree = =Divisions and madh'habs= Twelvers history =Imams era= =Occultation era= Ismaili history ( Note: Kaysani's Imam Hanafiyyah is descendant of Ali from his another wife not Fatimah) Branches of IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ Shia Islam and its subdivisions: Nearly %1 of the overall population within the Dƒ´n of Islam today is IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ Shia Islam (14-18 million). Approximately 10% of the entire population of Shia Islam is made out of the IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ madh'hab. IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´-Mustaali branches are less than 0.1% of the whole Dƒ´n of Islam and constitutes approximately 5% of the entire IsmƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ population. (Mustaali-Taiyabi branches are Dawoodi Bohra, Ja'farƒ´ Bohra, Makrami, Alavi Bohra, Hebtiahs Bohra, Atba-i-Malak Bohra (Atba-e-Malak Badar - Atba-i-Malak Vakil), Progressive Dawoodi).

From 1863 to 1869 he worked as an assistant at Richard Liebreich's ophthalmological hospital in Paris. In 1872 he became an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg, where in 1877 he was appointed a full professor of ophthalmology. Among his assistants at Strasbourg was Paul Silex (1858-1929). Laqueur is remembered for his research of physostigmine, a chemical substance found in the Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosa) of West Africa. In 1876 he published Ueber eine neue therapeutische Verwendung des Physostigmin, suggesting the use of physostigmine for the treatment of glaucoma . Laqueur noticed that extracts of the Calabar bean significantly lowered intraocular pressure. He could attest to these results first-hand, because Laqueur suffered from glaucoma, a fact that was kept secret from his medical colleagues until after his death.

Career Rhodes played college basketball at Western Kentucky University. While Rhodes was a player, WKU won the Ohio Valley Conference championship in 1949, 1950 and 1951, playing in the National Invitational Tournament in each of those seasons. Rhodes played in the NBA for the Indianapolis Olympians. Rhodes was later head basketball coach at St. Xavier High School, leading that team to the 1958 Kentucky state championship. In 1964, Rhodes later returned to WKU as an assistant coach under John Oldham, to 1968. In that time the team went to two NCAA tournaments and appeared once in the National Invitational Tournament. During the inaugural season of the American Basketball Association the Kentucky Colonels started out with a record of 5-12, which led to the firing of head coach John Givens. Rhodes replaced Givens and guided the Colonels to fourth place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels lost the 1968 Eastern Division semifinals to the Minnesota Muskies 3 games to two. In the 1968‚Äì69 season Rhodes led the Colonels to a record of 42-36 which was good for third place in the Eastern Division. Rhodes also coached the East team in the ABA All Star game. The Colonels made history this season as Penny Early became the first female player in the history of professional basketball. In the playoffs, the Colonels lost a close series, 4 games to 3, to the Indiana Pacers. During the 1969‚Äì70 season the Colonels posted a record of 45 wins and 39 losses, claiming second place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels beat the New York Nets 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division semifinals bust lost the Eastern Division finals to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 1. Rhodes began the 1970‚Äì71 season with a 10-5 record with the Colonels but was fired at that point. Alex Groza was briefly the Colonels' head coach for two games (winning both) and Frank Ramsey assumed the reins for the remainder of the season as the Colonels defeated the Miami Floridians 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division semifinals, defeated the Virginia Squires 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division finals but then lost a very close ABA Championship series, 4 games to 3, to the Utah Stars. In 1973, Rhodes became general manager of the Kentucky Colonels. Death Rhodes died on March 10, 2018 aged 90 in his hometown in Louisville, Kentucky.

The South Florida native was 15 years old at the time of the first offense and 16 years old on the date of his sentencing. He died at his Pinecrest, Florida home on May 18, 2008, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Initial Department of Defense intrusion Between August 23, 1999, and October 27, 1999, James committed a series of intrusions into various systems, including those of BellSouth and the Miami-Dade school system.Grossman, M. \\"Computer crime: Changing the pub s perception\\" . The Miami Herald, October 12, 2000. What brought him to the attention of federal authorities, however, was his intrusion into the computers of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), a division of the United States Department of Defense, the primary function of which is to analyze potential threats to the United States of America, both at home and abroad. James later admitted to authorities that he had installed an unauthorized backdoor in a computer server in Dulles, Virginia, which he used to install a sniffer that allowed him to intercept over three thousand messages passing to and from DTRA employees, along with numerous usernames and passwords of other DTRA employees, including at least 10 on official military computers. It was later revealed that the precise software obtained was the International Space Station's source code controlling critical life-sustaining elements. According to NASA, \\"the software supported the International Space Station's physical environment, including control of the temperature and humidity within the living space.\\"Top 10 Most Famous Hackers of All Time.

Arrest, conviction and sentencing James's house was raided on January 26, 2000, by agents from the Department of Defense, NASA and the Pinecrest Police Dept. James was formally indicted six months later. On September 21, 2000, he entered into an agreement with U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis: he would plead guilty to two counts of juvenile delinquency in exchange for a lenient sentence. James was sentenced to seven months' house arrest and probation until the age of eighteen, and was required to write letters of apology to NASA and the Department of Defense. He was also banned from using computers with MODS for recreational purposes.Lynch, I. . Information World Review, November 21, 2000. Retrieved March 4, 2007. James later violated that probation when he tested positive for drug use and was then subsequently taken into custody by the United States Marshals Service and flown to an Alabama federal correctional facility where he ultimately served six months. Legal experts have suggested that, given the extent of his intrusions, he could have served at least ten years for his crimes if he had been an adult. Both Attorney General Janet Reno and prosecuting attorney Guy Lewis issued statements claiming the James case was proof the Justice Department was willing to get tough with juvenile offenders accused of cybercrime.Stout, D. (2000). \\"Youth Sentenced in Government Hacking Case\\". The New York Times, September 23, 2000. Retrieved March 4, 2007. Death On January 17, 2007, department store chain TJX was the victim of a massive computer systems intrusion that compromised the personal and credit information of millions of customers. The same ring of hackers also committed intrusions on BJ's Wholesale Club, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, DSW, OfficeMax, and Dave & Buster's, and reportedly made a millionaire out of the group's ringleader, Albert Gonzalez. Though he denied having done anything, James‚Äîwho was friends with some of the hackers involved‚Äîwas investigated by the Secret Service, who raided James', his brother's, and his girlfriend's houses. Although they apparently discovered no connection to the intrusion, they did discover a legally registered firearm, which they did not take, and notes indicating he had considered killing himself; James's father would later say that his son had been prone to depression. The criminal complaint filed against the TJX hackers mention an additional, unnamed conspirator who was not indicted, who is identified only by the initials \\"J.J.\\". In 2004, this co-conspirator assisted one of the hackers in stealing credit card numbers, account numbers, and encrypted PINs from an OfficeMax store via Wi-Fi. These numbers were later allegedly provided to Albert Gonzalez, for whom \\"J.J.\\" also opened a mail drop. James's father believes \\"J.J.\\" to have been his son. However, it is plausible that the initials \\"J.J.\\" may in fact have been referring to \\"Jim Jones\\", a (hacker) alias believed to be used by Stephen Watt who was a close friend of computer hacker and criminal Albert Gonzalez. On May 18, 2008, Jonathan James was found dead in his shower with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His suicide was allegedly motivated by the belief that he would be prosecuted for crimes he had not committed. \\"I honestly, honestly had nothing to do with TJX,\\" James wrote in his suicide note, \\"I have no faith in the 'justice' system. Perhaps my actions today, and this letter, will send a stronger message to the public.

Tabrizi was another prominent student of the late grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, and one of the leading religious authorities that came to light after the death of al-Khoei. Early life and education Tabrizi was born in Tabriz, to Ali Kubar, a merchant, and Fatima Sultan. He claimed descent to the Prophet Muhammad through his mother, who was a Sayyida. = Education = He began his academic education in school, and completed his matriculation in Tabriz. However, he did ended up changing his mind, and going to the Islamic seminary. His family were not encouraging, since at that time, the government of Pahlavi dynasty was continuously pressuring the clerical class of the country. However, his family eventually accepted his fact, and Tabrizi began his Islamic education. He travelled to Qom in 1948, and studied under the thriving seminary under the spiritual guidance of grand Ayatollah Hossein Borujerdi. He studied under Sayyid Muhammad Hujjat Kuh-Kamari for four years, and under Borujerdi for seven years. He was also eventually reaching in Qom, however he decided to move to Najaf, to pursue further education. He entered Najaf in 1953, and attended the lectures of prominent scholars like Sayyid Muhsin al-Hakim, Sayyid Abd al-Hadi al-Shirazi and Sayyid Abu Al-Qasim al-Khoei. He became a close student of al- Khoei, and was appointed as a member in his fatwa office. He attended al- Khoei's lectures and taught intermediate and advanced courses for just under twenty years. He obtained attained the level of ijtihad and began to specialise in philosophy, Quranic exegesis and rijal. He was a contemporary of fellow classmates, Sayyid Muhammad-Baqir al-Sadr, Sheikh Hossein Wahid Khorasani and Sayyid Ali al-Sistani. Return to Iran  In 1976, the Baathist regime increased its pressures against Iranians as well as Iraqis of Iranian descent, and began to deport them. Among the deported was Tabrizi. His compulsory exile saddened al-Khoei at the time. Upon his return to Iran, he settled in Qom, and resumed his religious activities, teaching in its seminary. His classes were significantly influenced by those of Najaf, due to the time Tabrizi spent in Najaf.  Religious career  After the death of al- Khoei in 1992, many followers returned to follow him as their marja'. = Napkin of grief = Tabrizi was an avid champion for the mourning symbols of the Ahl al-Bayt. He would be seen attending public gatherings, and weeping excessively, as to filling his napkin with tears. To highlight the importance of these mourning rituals, Tabrizi put in his will that his two napkins be buried with him in his grave, so that they may intercede for him on the day of judgement. In part of the will he wrote directed at his students, he said in regards to mourning: > \\"Do not provide anyone the space to cast doubt and suspicion in the minds of > people with the symbols of Imam Husayn. For the preservation of the creed > [Jafari madhhab] depends on the preservation of the symbols of Imam Husayn.\\" = Fatimah's death = Khorasani (right) during the Fatimiyyah procession. Qom, 2005. Tabrizi believes the attack of Fatimah's house holds a very high religious significance in the Shi'i creed. He would specifically attend mourning gatherings dedicated to Fatimah, and be seen weeping. He led a large mourning procession in Qom, on the anniversary of her death‚Äìin accordance to the third narration‚Äì annually, that saw hundreds of thousands of people participating in it, and the attendance of other grand Ayatollahs like Hossein Wahid Khorasani. When the controversial marja' Sayyid Muhammad-Husayn Fadhlallah declared his opinion that the attack of the door was a myth, and deemed most stories as fiction, Tabrizi along with Khorasani and Sayyid Muhammad-Sadiq Rohani deemed him a \\"deviant\\". Tabrizi is dubbed nasir al-zahra (Victor of Zahra [Fatimah]) because of his no-compromise policy towards the case of the events that lead to the death of Fatimah. = Responses to Europe = Tabrizi issued a strong statement condemning the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, deeming it an infidelity, and that freedom of speech should not mean the freedom to instigate offense to other races and religions. He also condemned the Islamic scarf controversy in France, especially the suspensions and expulsions of Muslim female students from middle and high schools for wearing the scarf in class, stating that it was rich of these countries to claim to implement democracy, yet restrict personal fundamental religious practices.  Personal life  Tabriza married whilst he was in Najaf and had seven children, four daughters and three sons.  Death  Tabrizi died on Monday, November 20, 2006 due to illness. He was buried in the Fatima Masumeh Shrine, and al-Khorasani led his funeral prayer. Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, issued a message of condolences in which he characterized Tabrizi as one of the most prominent teachers of the Islamic seminary of Qom.  Works  Tabrizi auhtored numerous volumes in jurisprudence and principles of jurisprudence.

The monks translated texts from Ancient Greek, wrote histories, and copied manuscripts (the most famous scriptorium was in Raƒça, known as the School of Raƒça, which flourished from the sixteenth- to the eighteenth-century); they translated and copied not only liturgical but scientific and literary works of the period. History of Serbian literature owes most of the creativity to the Raƒçanska ≈°kola (School of Raƒça) and its alumni, Kiprijan, Jerotej, ƒåirjak, Simeon, Teodor, Hristifor, Gavrilo Stefanoviƒá Vencloviƒá, etc. Like the monks of Raƒça, it not uncommon for anonymous writers to be referred to by their first name and the name of the place with which their life or work is connected. Turkish travel writer, dervish Zulih, also known as Evliya √áelebi noted in his travelogue of 1630 that in Raƒça Monastery there were 300 monk scribes, who were served by 400 shepherds, blacksmiths, and other staff. The security guard included 200 armed men. During the Great Turkish War in 1689 the monastery was partially destroyed by the invading Turks. In 1826 it was reconstructed after being burned down several times while Serbia was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.

Upon nomination by their local Scout council and with the approval of the National Court of Honor, recipients of this award are registered adult leaders who have made an impact on the lives of youth through service given to the council. The Silver Beaver is an award given to those who implement the Scouting program and perform community service through hard work, self-sacrifice, dedication, and many years of service. It is given to those who do not seek it. Award The medal consists of a silver beaver pendant suspended from a blue and white ribbon worn around the neck. Recipients may wear the corresponding square knot, with a white strand over a blue strand, on the BSA uniform. There is also a lapel pin authorized and available for civilian wear. Using the United States Military as the model, silver awards are the highest awards in the BSA. History The Silver Beaver was introduced in 1931 as a pin-on medal, but due to the heavy weight of the medallion it was switched over to a neck ribbon in mid-1932. A blue-white-blue ribbon bar was introduced in 1934 for informal uniform wear. In 1946, ribbon bars were replaced by the current knot insignia. The Silver Beaver was initially awarded only to men. The Silver Fawn Award, an equivalent for women, was awarded starting in 1971. It used the same knot insignia, but on a blue background, as women were mostly involved in Cub Scouting during this period. The Silver Fawn was discontinued and the Silver Beaver began to be awarded to women in 1974. A total of 2,455 Silver Fawns were awarded to outstanding women for support of Cub Scouting before the award was discontinued in 1974. As this is a council BSA award, it is conceivably possible for a person to receive this award multiple times from different councils. It is believed that 12-16 people are double-recipients of the Silver Beaver in this manner. There is no record of a triple-recipient.

It is near the mouth of the Kah Bpow river in Smach Mean Chey District on the Gulf of Thailand. The city lies only 10 kilometres from the Thai border. It is 138 kilometres by Highway 48 to National Highway 4 at Sre Ambel and a further 133 kilometres to Phnom Penh. After completion of the bridges on Highway 48 in 2010 the land link to Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville has significantly improved.  Frontier town  Cambodian fishing boats, Gulf of Thailand Koh Kong has long had a reputation as a \\"wild west\\" frontier town. Until recently, access to the town from Cambodia was mostly by sea or air due to the poor road conditions. In this relative isolation, illegal logging, wild animal smuggling, banditry, gambling, prostitution, and a soaring rate of HIV AIDS infection have given Koh Kong its frontier town reputation. However, with the building of the Thai- Cambodian bridge across the river and the upgrading of the road to the national highway, industry and investment have increased and the town is becoming a modest tourist destination.  Location  Koh Kong town is accessible by land, sea, and air. From Bangkok it is 450 kilometres by road to Hat Lek in Khlong Yai District in Thailand and a short trip from there to the Cham Yeam international border crossing. From the border it is 10 kilometres to the town. Travelling from the capital Phnom Penh, it is 133 kilometres west along National Highway 4 to the town of Sre Ambel. From Sre Ambel a narrow road winds 138 kilometres through the lower Cardamom Mountains before reaching Koh Kong. The road crosses four large rivers where bridges have recently been built. In 2002, the Koh Kong Bridge was completed linking the town of Koh Kong with the border crossing to Thailand. The bridge was completed at a cost of US$7.2 million and is 1900 metres long, making it the longest bridge in Cambodia.  Recent history  Until the end of the 1990s, Koh Kong was one of the least secure parts of the country. Elements of the Khmer Rouge based in the lower Cardamoms still posed a serious threat to locals and travellers. The area was the scene of intermittent fighting between the government and Democratic Kampuchea forces until 1998. On 21 April 1984, the Khmer Rouge captured the town of Koh Kong and held it for a night and day. They claimed via Khmer Rouge Radio to have killed 1,107 Vietnamese troops and injured 125 more during the battle. On 6 June 1985 Khmer Rouge troops attacked an outpost near the provincial town. Khmer Rouge Radio reported that they had killed 28 Vietnamese soldiers and injured 34 others. They attacked the Koh Kong Casino with rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. As late as 1998, the Khmer Rouge were still active in the area. In November of that year, one of the last recorded incidents before the surrender of the remaining Khmer Rouge forces to the government occurred near the international border crossing outside of Koh Kong city. On Monday night at 18:10, the casino attached to the Koh Kong International Resort was attacked by elements of the Khmer Rouge. One Thai gambler was injured in the attack which involved rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and conventional rifles. The Trat police chief later stated that the attack was prompted by the casino failing to make a protection payment to the rebel group.  Environment  illegal logging camp, Cardamom Mountains, Koh Kong Province Koh Kong town is just below the southern end of the Cardamom Mountains. The Kah Bpow river which runs through the town begins in the Cardamoms and runs down to join the Gulf of Thailand. The town's relatively remote location, close to the Cardamoms and the Thai border, has made it the centre of an active wildlife smuggling trade. Much wildlife captured in the Central Cardamoms goes to supply the restaurants and fresh markets in Koh Kong town. Wild meat is usually for local consumption but various animals parts, bones, and hides are sold to wildlife traders. In 2000, wildlife traders from Thailand were reported to come to Koh Kong town each month to purchase wildlife products. Some trophies are also reported to be sold to Trat Province in Thailand.Conservation Status of the Cardamom Mountains in Southwestern Cambodia, Preliminary Studies, Frank Momberg and Hunter Weiler (eds.) retrieved 4/1/2009 In 2005, Cambodia's infamous tiger hunter Yor Ngun was finally captured in Koh Kong town. He was eventually charged with having killed and sold at least 19 tigers, 40 leopards, 30 elephants, 500 gaur, banteng and sambar, 40 Sun bears and three Asian black bears. Ngun, who was 57 at the time of his arrest, is reported to have been trapping and snaring animals in the Cambodian jungle since the 1970s. The organisation Wildlife Alliance (known at the time as WildAid) had Ngun on their \\"top wanted hunters list\\" since 2001 due to his reputation as a \\"notorious tiger hunter\\". Authorities captured him once in 2004, but he was released after signing an agreement to stop poaching. At the time of his arrest in Koh Kong, he was carrying animal parts, including 25 bear jaws and 82 bear nails. In August 2005, he was sentenced at the Koh Kong provincial court to seven years in prison. Koh Kong township and the area nearby was also the centre of widespread illegal logging of broad leaf deciduous forests in the Cardamoms. According to environmental agencies, the government logging ban in 2001 has slowed, but not halted, the logging trade.

The McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific Sacramento Campus, Sacramento High School, and Christian Brothers High School are located in this neighborhood. Oak Park is informally bounded by U.S. Route 50 to the north, Stockton Boulevard to the east, the South Sacramento (99) Freeway to the west and Fruitridge Road to the south. It is situated within the city limits and provides easy access to Downtown Sacramento. Numbered streets intersect with numbered avenues, with Broadway and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (formerly known as Sacramento Boulevard) comprising the main thoroughfares. History The early 1900s saw Oak Park as a culturally thriving and economically vibrant, destination neighborhood, due in part to its strong sense of community and its ties with and proximity to the Historic site of the California State Fair grounds. The 1960s Interstate freeway expansion program physically divided many historic Sacramento neighborhoods like Oak Park creating isolated areas of poverty or relative prosperity. Oak Park's sense of community started to decline in the early 1960s as a result of the freeway expansion, declining property values and families moving out to the suburb communities now made easily accessible by the freeway expansion programs. During the 1980s / 90's further deterioration of the living standards were exacerbated by frequent occurrences of petty theft, street crime, drug activities, and gang-related violence. Recently, the early 2000s saw a slew of real estate speculators and building contractors buying up low-priced homes in some parts of Oak Park that were either abandoned or sold off as unmanageable, and turning them around and reselling them as reasonably priced starter homes, often with financial government assistance. At the same time many new high-paying jobs moved into the area in connection with the expansion of the University of California Davis Medical Center located to the north of Oak Park, the revitalization of Broadway and Stockton Boulevard, and the expansion of the McGeorge Law School campus. A permanent sign at the southeast corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and 14th Ave. displaying a famous quote from Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs I Have a Dream speech =Oak Park's downtown= In addition to being Sacramento's first suburb, Oak Park also developed a second \\"downtown\\" retail and entertainment district, distinct from Sacramento's downtown, running along 35th Street between Sacramento Blvd (Martin Luther King) to the north and 5th Ave and the park to the South. The street was home to the Piggly-Wiggly, Park Meat Market, and Arata Bros markets; Steen's Corner Saloon; Azevedo's Women's Apparel; Janek and Scurfield canvass goods, Citizens Bank of Oak Park; the Ben Franklin variety store; and many others. The street's arts and entertainment could be found at the Victor Theater (Guild Theater), the California Theater, the Belmonte Gallery or the outdoor theater and pavilion at the park. 35th Street area also played host to the annual July 4th parade. =Oak park's streetcars= Four of Sacramento's seven downtown streetcar lines terminated in Oak Park. The original line, the Central Street Railway, was founded in 1890 by real estate investor Edwin K. Alsip in hopes of motivating people to move to Oak Park and Highland Park. The horse-drawn streetcars were replaced by cable cars, and shortly after, electric trolley cars. Originating at Second and H streets, it followed J Street to 28th St, then south to Sacramento Boulevard (now called Broadway), where it turned east into the new suburbs of Oak Park. The eastern terminus was a public park, then known as Oak Park (now McClatchy Park), on 35th Street and Fifth Avenue. Sacramento Electric, Gas & Railway Company (later Pacific Gas and Electric Company) would acquire this route and expand to include Route 6 which ran to the Oak Park terminus via Fifth Avenue. Meanwhile, a short Route 5 would run east from the Oak Park terminus and end at the Historic site of the California State Fair grounds on Stockton Boulevard. The Central California Traction Company also ran an interurban rail line from Downtown Sacramento to Stockton. The line headed through Oak Park along Sacramento Boulevard, then Second Avenue, and finally turned south at Stockton Boulevard, running down the eastern edge of Oak Park towards Stockton. =Joyland= In 1895, Oak Park (McClatchy Park) featured acres of shady oak trees, a zoo, carousel, and ballpark. When Sacramento Electric, Gas & Railway Company acquired the Oak Park terminus in 1903, they added a wooden roller coaster, a roller skating rink, an outdoor theater, and a scenic miniature railway. Joyland was born when the park was renovated to include an amusement park, electric lights, and swimming pool. In addition to local amusement, Joyland was intended to showcase the abilities of electric power and increase ridership on the new electric streetcars. Joyland caught fire in 1920 and never reopened. In 1927, Valentine McClatchy purchased the land and gave it to the city to become a city park, named in honor of his father James McClatchy, the founder of the Sacramento Bee. Recent past As of 2008, Oak Park faced a variety of challenges sustaining the beginnings of its comeback due in part to an increase in foreclosures and an area-wide decline in property values. Community groups like the Oak Park Neighborhood Association, the South Oak Park Community Association (SOPCA) established in 2014, Community policing efforts, the demand for affordable housing close to the University of California Davis Medical Center and the overall impact that the real estate market will play in the future.

British immigration to Latin America occurred mostly in the 19th and 20th centuries and went primarily to Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Argentina Most of the English Argentine population consists of Anglo-Argentines in the Buenos Aires area. In the mid-1980s English Argentines were estimated at 100,000. Famous Argentines of significant or full English ancestry include Jorge Luis Borges and Olivia Hussey, the latter famous for playing Juliet in the movie Romeo and Juliet. Carlos Pellegrini, who was President of Argentina (1890‚Äì92), was of English ancestry through his mother and Franco-Italian through his father. El origen de Pellegrini The country has had a Welsh community in the Patagonia since their arrival from Liverpool in 1865. Its creation was an effort by nonconformists to build a \\"little Wales\\" away from English speakers. Welsh Argentines number around 50,000 - 72,685. The Scottish diaspora in Argentina is estimated in 100,000. The first Argentine woman to earn a Doctor of Medicine degree was Cecilia Grierson, of Scottish ancestry. There are about 300,000 people of British descent in Argentina. Brazil The Gracie family, famous for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, was founded by George Gracie, a 19th-century Scottish immigrant. Oscar Cox, son of a British diplomat, introduced football to his native city, Rio de Janeiro, a century ago. He founded one of the top teams in Brazil, Fluminense Football Club. The Brazilian Bawden family branch was initiated by Thomas Bawden, an early 19th-century Cornish immigrant, who was very successful in gold prospection in the region of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais province, in the then Brazilian Empire. Following his goldmining enrichment, his daughter Mary Angel Bawden was married to a Brazilian nobleman, the Second Baron of Camargos, whose father, the first Baron of Camargos, was a prominent political figure in the aforementioned province. Chile Chile currently has the largest population of British descendants in Latin America. These descendants, according to some estimates, would be between 700,000 and 800,000 people. Chile, facing the Pacific Ocean, had an important British presence.Inmigrantes brit√°nicos. Over 50,000 Noticias LA EMIGRACI√ìN DE CHILENOS AL EXTERIOR E INMIGRACI√ìN A CHILE. British immigrants settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914, an important number of them settled in Magallanes, especially the city of Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing the Strait of Magellan from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Also, around 32,000 English people settled in Valpara√≠so. That significantly influenced the port city, which became practically a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the First World War took many of them away from the city. Some British Chileans are of Scottish and Scots-Irish origins. Some Scots settled in the country's temperate climate and forested landscape with glaciers and islands, which reminded them of their homeland (the Highlands and Northern Scotland), while English and Welsh made up the rest. The Irish immigrants were frequently confused with the British, and arrived as merchants, tradesmen and sailors, settling along with the British in the main trading cities and ports. The British founded the first football club in Valpara√≠so, and in Santiago sometime later, such as Santiago Wanderers, Everton and Prince of Wales Country Club, among others.Clubes de sello britanico. Chileans of British descent include: former president Patricio Aylwin; Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna, writer and politician; Alejandro Foxley, Pedro Dartnell, Claudio Bunster, Bernardo Leighton, Vivianne Blanlot, Agust√≠n Edwards Mac Clure; Minister of Foreign Affairs; Jorge Edwards; former Minister of Foreign Affairs; Gustavo Leigh; member of the former Government Junta of Chile Roberto Elphick; Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church; Juan Williams; commander-in-chief of the Chilean Navy at the beginning of the War of the Pacific; Patricio Lynch, William Thayer, Robert Winthrop Simpson, Juan Pablo Bennett, Alberto Blest Gana; writer members of the Edwards family; Hern√°n Somerville, banker Harold Mayne-Nicholls, president of ANFP and Chilean Football Federation; Mary Rose McGill, socialite, etc. Colombia Famous Colombians of British descent include Jorge Isaacs, the author of Mar√≠a, who was born to the daughter of a Spanish naval officer and an English Jew. Mexico During the Colonial era, the Spanish restricted the entrance of other Europeans, however, some non- Spanish Europeans were present. In 1556, the English adventurer Robert Thomson encountered the Scotsman Thomas Blake (Tom√°s Blaque), who had been living in Mexico City for more than twenty years. Blake is the first known Briton to have settled in what would become Mexico. During his third voyage, the ship commanded by John Hawkins escaped destruction at the Battle of San Juan de Ul√∫a (1568). However, after becoming lost in the Gulf of Mexico and with a bloated crew, Hawkins abandoned more than one hundred men near Tampico. A group of the men went north (including David Ingram), while the rest went south and were captured by the Spanish. Notable among this group was Miles Philips who wrote a narrative detailing his and the other Englishmen's struggles. They were taken to Mexico City, given care at a hospital and imprisoned. After attempting to escape, they were sold as servants or slaves. Some were able to accumulate wealth by rising to the position of overseers at mines and other operations. However, after the establishment of the Mexican Inquisition, the men were stripped of any wealth and imprisoned as Lutheran heretics. Three of the men were burned, while some sixty were given penance. Various British privateers and pirates repeatedly attacked the coastal cities of New Spain, most famously in Campeche. In southern Baja California Sur, a few families retain the English surname \\"Green\\". This surname is sometimes cited as a legacy of the British pirates who frequented the Cape region. However, the founder was established to be Esteban Green, an English whaler that settled in the region in 1834. The first great power that recognized the independence of Mexico was the United Kingdom in 1824, shortly after the sale of mines from Pachuca and Real del Monte occurred. The majority of migrants to this region came from what is now termed the Cornish \\"central mining district\\" of Camborne and Redruth. Real del Monte's steep streets, stairways and small squares are lined with low buildings and many houses with high sloping roofs and chimneys which indicate a Cornish influence. Mexican remittances from these miners helped to build the Wesleyan Chapel in Redruth. The Pante√≥n de Dolores, which became the largest cemetery in Mexico, was founded in 1875 by Juan Manuel Benfield, the son of Anglican immigrants. Benfield fulfilled his father's goal of creating a cemetery after his sister was refused burial in Catholic cemeteries and had to be interred at a beach. According to the 1895 National Census, 3,263 residents were from the United Kingdom. The twin silver mining settlements of Pachuca and Real del Monte are being marketed as of 2007 as 'Mexico's Little Cornwall' by the Mexican Embassy in London and represent the first attempt by the Spanish speaking part of the Cornish diaspora to establish formal links with Cornwall. The Mexican Embassy in London is also trying to establish a town twinning arrangement with Cornwall. In 2008 thirty members of the Cornish Mexican Cultural Society travelled to Mexico to try and re-trace the path of their ancestors who set off from Cornwall to start a new life in Mexico. Peru A British Peruvian is a Peruvian citizen of British descent. The phrase may refer to someone born in Peru of British descent or to someone who has immigrated to Peru from Britain. Among European Peruvians, the British were the fifth largest group of immigrants to settle in the country, after the Spanish, Italians, Germans and French. Between 1860 and 1950 it is estimated that around 900 British settled in Peru, although many of them returned to Europe or emigrated to countries like Argentina and Chile. The regions from which most of the British immigrants originated were Southampton and London and Birmingham. There are an estimated 8,000 Peruvians of British descent.Harriman, Brenda. \\"Los brit√°nicos en el Peru\\" (lit. \\"The British in Peru\\") Other countries See also *English Argentines *Britons in Mexico References *Carlos Pellegrini and the Crisis of the Argentine Elites, 1880-1916 by Douglas W.

The program was formally criticised by Ofcom, the UK broadcasting regulatory agency, which upheld complaints of misrepresentation made by David King. The film, made by British television producer Martin Durkin, presents scientists, economists, politicians, writers, and others who dispute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. The programme's publicity materials assert that man-made global warming is \\"a lie\\" and \\"the biggest scam of modern times.\\" Its original working title was \\"Apocalypse my arse\\", but the title The Great Global Warming Swindle was later adopted as an allusion to the 1980 mockumentary The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle about British punk band the Sex Pistols.'Apocalypse my arse', Spiked Online, 9 March 2007 The UK's Channel 4 premiered the documentary on 8 March 2007. The channel described the film as \\"a polemic that drew together the well-documented views of a number of respected scientists to reach the same conclusions. This is a controversial film but we feel that it is important that all sides of the debate are aired.\\" According to Hamish Mykura, Channel 4's head of documentaries, the film was commissioned \\"to present the viewpoint of the small minority of scientists who do not believe global warming is caused by anthropogenic production of carbon dioxide.\\"Sweney, Mark. \\"Channel 4 ruled 'unjust and unfair' in climate change documentary\\". The Guardian, 21 July 2008 Although the documentary was welcomed by global warming deniers, it was criticised by scientific organisations and individual scientists (including one of the scientists interviewed in the film and one whose research was used to support the film's claims). The film's critics argued that it had misused and fabricated data, relied on out-of-date research, employed misleading arguments, and misrepresented the position of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Later broadcasts corrected three errors in the original film. Viewpoints expressed in the film The film's basic premise is that the current scientific opinion on the anthropogenic causes of global warming has numerous scientific flaws, and that vested monetary interests in the scientific establishment and the media discourage the public and the scientific community from acknowledging or even debating this. The film asserts that the publicised scientific consensus is the product of a \\"global warming activist industry\\" driven by a desire for research funding. Other culprits, according to the film, are Western environmentalists promoting expensive solar and wind power over cheap fossil fuels in Africa, resulting in African countries being held back from industrialising. The film won best documentary award at the 2007 Io Isabella International Film Week. A number of academics, environmentalists, think-tank consultants and writers are interviewed in the film in support of its various assertions. They include Patrick Moore, former member of Greenpeace but later became a critic of the organisation; Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Patrick Michaels, Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia; Nigel Calder, editor of New Scientist from 1962 to 1966; John Christy, professor and director of the Earth System Science Center at University of Alabama; Paul Reiter of the Pasteur Institute; former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson; and Piers Corbyn, a British weather forecaster. Carl Wunsch, professor of oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was also interviewed but has since said that he strongly disagrees with the film's conclusions and the way his interview material was used. Assertions made in the film The film takes a view strongly opposed to current scientific thinking on climate change. It argues that the consensus on climate change is the product of \\"a multibillion-dollar worldwide industry: created by fanatically anti-industrial environmentalists; supported by scientists peddling scare stories to chase funding; and propped up by complicit politicians and the media\\". Using a series of interviews and graphics, the film sets out to challenge the scientific consensus by focusing on what it says are inconsistencies in the evidence, and the role said to have been played by ideology and politics. =Evidential issues= The film highlights what it asserts are a number of contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence supporting man-made global warming. * Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and temperature change since 1940. The film asserts that records of atmospheric levels since 1940 show a continuing increase, but during this period, global temperature decreased until 1975, and has after that increased until 1997. * Variations in warming rate. The programme states that all models of greenhouse effect-derived temperature increase predict that the warming will be at its greatest for a given location in the troposphere and at its lowest near the surface of the earth. The programme asserts that current satellite and weather balloon data do not support this model, and instead show that the surface warming rate is greater than or equal to the rate in the lower troposphere. * Increases in and temperatures following the end of ice ages. According to the film, increases in levels lagged (by over 100 years) behind temperature increases during glacial terminations.EPICA and Vostok ice cores display the relationship between temperature and level of for the last 650,000 years. (\\"Current CO2 level\\" is as of 2006.) * Relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and temperature change. The film asserts that carbon dioxide levels increase or decrease as a result of temperatures increasing or decreasing rather than temperatures following carbon dioxide levels, because as the global climate cools the Earth's oceans absorb carbon dioxide, and as the climate warms the oceans release carbon dioxide. * Influence of oceanic mass on temperature changes. The programme argues that due to the very large mass of the world's oceans, it takes hundreds of years for global temperature changes to register in oceanic mass, which is why analysis of the Vostok Station and other ice cores shows that changes in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide follow changes in global temperature by 800 years. * Influence of water vapour on climate change. According to the film, water vapour makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases and has the largest impact on the planet's temperature. Water particles in the form of clouds act to reflect incoming solar heat, but the film argues that the effects of clouds cannot be accurately simulated by scientists attempting to predict future weather patterns and their effects on global warming. * Influence of carbon dioxide on climate change. The film states that carbon dioxide comprises only a very minuscule amount‚Äîjust 0.054% of the Earth's atmosphere. According to the film, human activity contributes much less than 1% of that, while volcanoes produce significantly more per year than humans, while plants and animals produce 150 gigatons of each year. Dying leaves produce even more , and the oceans are \\"the biggest source of by far.\\" Human activity produces a mere 6.5 gigatons of each year. The film concludes that man-made emissions alone cannot be causing global warming. (Durkin subsequently acknowledged that the claim about volcanic emissions was wrong, and removed the claim from later versions.NBC News (25 April 2007). \\"Scientists want edits to warming skeptic's film.\\". Retrieved 2007-25-04.) * Influence of the sun on climate change. The film highlights the solar variation theory of global warming, asserting that solar activity is currently at an extremely high level, and that this is directly linked to changes in global temperature. The posited mechanism involves cosmic rays as well as heat from the sun aiding cloud formation. The film argues that the activity of the sun is far more influential on global warming and cooling than any other man-made or natural activity on Earth. * Previous episodes of warming. The programme asserts that the current episode of global warming is nothing unusual and temperatures were even more extreme during the Medieval Warm Period, a time of great prosperity in western Europe. =Political issues= The programme makes a number of assertions arguing that the integrity of climate research has been compromised by financial, ideological and political interests: * Increased funding of climate science. According to the film, there has been an increase in funds available for any research related to global warming \\"and it is now one of the best funded areas of science.\\" * Increased availability of funding for global warming research. The film asserts that scientists seeking a research grant award have a much more likely chance of successfully obtaining funding if the grant is linked to global warming research. * Influence of vested interests. The programme argues that vested interests have a bigger impact on the proponents (rather than the detractors) of arguments supporting the occurrence of man-made global warming because hundreds of thousands of jobs in science, media, and government have been created and are subsidised as a result. * Suppression of dissenting views. According to the programme, scientists who speak out (against the view that global warming is man-made) risk persecution, death threats, loss of funding, personal attacks, and damage to their reputations. * Role of ideology. The film proposes that some supporters of the finding that global warming is man-made do so because it supports their emotional and ideological beliefs against capitalism, economic development, globalisation, industrialisation, and the United States. * Role of politics. The programme asserts that the view that global warming is man-made was promoted by the British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as a means of promoting nuclear power and reducing the impact of strike action in the state-owned coal industry by the National Union of Mineworkers. * Role of industry. The film argues that the assertion that global warming denialists are funded by private industry (such as oil, gas, and coal industries) are false and have no basis in fact. =Disputing the global warming consensus= The film argues that the consensus among climate scientists about global warming does not exist. * Status of IPCC contributors. The programme asserts that it is falsely stated that \\"2,500 top scientists\\" support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s reports on global warming. In fact, according to the programme, the report includes many politicians and non-scientists, and even dissenters who demanded that their names be removed from the report but were refused. * Accuracy of representation of IPCC contributors. The film argues that IPCC reports misrepresent the views of scientists who contribute to them through selective editorialising. The film highlights the case of Paul Reiter of the Pasteur Institute who complained that the IPCC did not take his professional opinion under greater consideration. It states that the IPCC kept his name on the report as a contributor and did not remove his name until he threatened legal action. * Suppression of dissenting views. According to the programme, the concept of man-made global warming is promoted with a ferocity and intensity that is similar to a religious fervour. Denialists are treated as heretics and equated with holocaust deniers. Retired university professor Tim Ball states in the film (and in subsequent press publicity) that he has received death threats because of sceptical statements he has made about global warming. =Killing the African dream of development= * Author and economist James Shikwati says in the programme that environmentalists campaign against Africa using its fossil fuels: \\"there's somebody keen to kill the African dream. And the African dream is to develop.\\" He describes renewable power as \\"luxurious experimentation\\" that might work for rich countries but will never work for Africa: \\"I don't see how a solar panel is going to power a steel industry ‚Äì rather a transistor radio.\\" We are being told, 'Don't touch your resources. Don't touch your oil. Don't touch your coal.' That is suicide.\\" * The film describes a Kenyan health clinic that is powered by two solar panels that do not provide enough electricity for both the medical refrigerator and the lights at the same time. The programme describes the idea of restricting the world's poorest people to alternative energy sources as \\"the most morally repugnant aspect of the Global Warming campaign.\\" Reception and criticism The show attracted 2.5 million viewers and an audience share of 11.5%. Channel 4 stated that it had received 758 calls and emails about the programme, with those in favour outnumbering complaints by six to one. Following criticism from scientists the film has been changed since it was first broadcast on Channel 4. One graph had its time axis relabelled, the claim that volcanoes produce more than humans was removed, and following objections about how his interview had been used, the interview with Carl Wunsch was removed for the international and DVD releases of the programme. Other scientific arguments used in the film have been described as refuted or misleading by scientists working in the relevant fields. Critics have also argued that the programme is one-sided and that the mainstream position on global warming, as supported by the scientific academies of the major industrialised nations and other scientific organisations, is incorrectly represented. =Complaints received by Ofcom= The British broadcasting regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), received 265 complaints about the programme, one of which was a 176-page detailed complaint co-written by a group of scientists.Complaint to OfcomDave Rado A reluctant whistle-blower BBC News, 21 July 2008 Ofcom ruled on 21 July 2008 that the programme had unfairly treated Sir David King, the IPCC and Carl Wunsch. Ofcom also found that part 5 of the programme (the 'political' part) had breached several parts of the Broadcasting Code regarding impartiality; however, the Code rules on impartiality did not apply to the scientific arguments in parts 1‚Äì4, because the link between human activity and global warming had largely been settled before March 2007. OfCom did not rule on the programme's accuracy, but did rule that: \\"On balance it did not materially mislead the audience so as to cause harm or offence.\\"Ofcom Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin 114 On 4 and 5 August 2008, Channel 4 and More 4 broadcast a summary of Ofcom's findings,Ofcom Summary of adjudication though it will not face sanctions.Black, Richard. \\"Climate documentary 'broke rules'. BBC News, 21 July 2008 =Reactions from scientists= Sulfate aerosol and greenhouse gases effect on climate change based on Meehl et al. (2004) in Journal of Climate * The IPCC was one of the main targets of the documentary. In response to the programme's broadcast, John T. Houghton (co-chair IPCC Scientific Assessment working group 1988‚Äì2002) assessed some of its main assertions and conclusions. According to Houghton the programme was \\"a mixture of truth, half truth and falsehood put together with the sole purpose of discrediting the science of global warming,\\" which he noted had been endorsed by the scientific community, including the Academies of Science of the major industrialised countries and China, India and Brazil. Houghton rejected claims that observed changes in global average temperature are within the range of natural climate variability or that solar influences are the main driver; that the troposphere is warming less than the surface; that volcanic eruptions emit more carbon dioxide than fossil fuel burning; that climate models are too complex and uncertain to provide useful projections of climate change; and that IPCC processes were biased. Houghton acknowledges that ice core samples show driven by temperature, but then writes that the programme's assertion that \\"this correlation has been presented as the main evidence for global warming by the IPCC [is] NOT TRUE. For instance, I often show that diagram in my lectures on climate change but always make the point that it gives no proof of global warming due to increased carbon dioxide.\\" * The British Antarctic Survey released a statement about The Great Global Warming Swindle. It is highly critical of the programme, singling out the use of a graph with the incorrect time axis, and also the statements made about solar activity: \\"A comparison of the distorted and undistorted contemporary data reveal that the plot of solar activity bears no resemblance to the temperature curve, especially in the last 20 years.\\" Comparing scientific methods with Channel 4's editorial standards, the statement says: \\"Any scientist found to have falsified data in the manner of the Channel 4 programme would be guilty of serious professional misconduct.\\" It uses the feedback argument to explain temperatures rising before . On the issue of volcanic emissions, it says: : > A second issue was the claim that human emissions of are small compared to > natural emissions from volcanoes. This is untrue: current annual emissions > from fossil fuel burning and cement production are estimated to be around > 100 times greater than average annual volcanic emissions of . That large > volcanoes cannot significantly perturb the concentration of the atmosphere > is apparent from the ice core and atmospheric record of concentrations, > which shows a steady rise during the industrial period, with no unusual > changes after large eruptions. * Alan Thorpe, professor of meteorology at the University of Reading and Chief Executive of the UK Natural Environment Research Council, commented on the film in New Scientist: \\"First, let's deal with the main thesis: that the presence or absence of cosmic rays in Earth's atmosphere is a better explanation for temperature variation than the concentration of and other gases. This is not a new assertion and it is patently wrong: there is no credible evidence that cosmic rays play a significant role...Let scepticism reign, but let's not play games with the evidence.\\" * The Royal Society has issued a press release in reaction to the film. In it, Martin Rees, the president of the Royal Society, briefly restates the predominant scientific opinion on climate change and adds: : > Scientists will continue to monitor the global climate and the factors which > influence it. It is important that all legitimate potential scientific > explanations continue to be considered and investigated. Debate will > continue, and the Royal Society has just hosted a two-day discussion meeting > attended by over 300 scientists, but it must not be at the expense of > action. Those who promote fringe scientific views but ignore the weight of > evidence are playing a dangerous game. They run the risk of diverting > attention from what we can do to ensure the world's population has the best > possible future. * Thirty-seven British scientists signed a letter of complaint, saying that they \\"believe that the misrepresentations of facts and views, both of which occur in your programme, are so serious that repeat broadcasts of the programme, without amendment, are not in the public interest. In view of the seriousness of climate change as an issue, it is crucial that public debate about it is balanced and well-informed\\". * According to the Guardian in 2007, a study published by, among others, Mike Lockwood, a solar physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was partially inspired in response to The Great Global Warming Swindle. Lockwood then had co-authored a paper about solar data from the past 40 years. He found that between 1985 and 1987, the solar factors that should affect climate performed an \\"U-turn in every possible way\\", therefore 2007 cooling would have to be expected, which was not the case then. Lockwood therefore was quoted several times as critical evidence against various claims made in the film. * Volume 20 of the Bulletin of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society presented a critique by David Jones, Andrew Watkins, Karl Braganza and Michael Coughlan. > The Great Global Warming Swindle does not represent the current state of > knowledge in climate science‚Ä¶ Many of the hypotheses presented in the Great > Global Warming Swindle have been considered and rejected by due scientific > process. This documentary is far from an objective, critical examination of > climate science. Instead the Great Global Warming Swindle goes to great > lengths to present outdated, incorrect or ambiguous data in such a way as to > grossly distort the true understanding of climate change science, and to > support a set of extremely controversial views. * A public forum entitled \\"Debunking \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\"\\" was held at the Australian National University in Canberra on 13 July 2007, at which scientists from the Australian National University, Stanford University, USA, and ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies exposed what they described \\"as the scientific flaws and half-truths in the claims of climate change skeptics\\" =Criticism from two scientists featured in the programme= Carl Wunsch Carl Wunsch, professor of Physical Oceanography at MIT, is featured in the Channel 4 version of the programme. Afterwards he said that he was \\"completely misrepresented\\" in the film and had been \\"totally misled\\" when he agreed to be interviewed. He called the film \\"grossly distorted\\" and \\"as close to pure propaganda as anything since World War Two\\", and he lodged a complaint with Ofcom. He particularly objected to how his interview material was used: > In the part of The Great Climate Change Swindle where I am describing the > fact that the ocean tends to expel carbon dioxide where it is warm, and to > absorb it where it is cold, my intent was to explain that warming the ocean > could be dangerous‚Äîbecause it is such a gigantic reservoir of carbon. By its > placement in the film, it appears that I am saying that since carbon dioxide > exists in the ocean in such large quantities, human influence must not be > very important‚Äîdiametrically opposite to the point I was making‚Äîwhich is > that global warming is both real and threatening. Filmmaker Durkin responded: > Carl Wunsch was most certainly not 'duped' into appearing in the film, as is > perfectly clear from our correspondence with him. Nor are his comments taken > out of context. His interview, as used in the programme, perfectly > accurately represents what he said. Wunsch has stated that he finds the statements at both extremes of the global climate change debate distasteful he wrote in a letter dated 15 March 2007 that he believes climate change is \\"real, a major threat, and almost surely has a major human-induced component. But I have tried to stay out of the 'climate wars' because all nuance tends to be lost, and the distinction between what we know firmly, as scientists, and what we suspect is happening, is so difficult to maintain in the presence of rhetorical excess.\\" He further cautiously states that \\"The science of climate change remains incomplete. Some elements are so firmly based on well-understood principles, or for which the observational record is so clear, that most scientists would agree that they are almost surely true (adding to the atmosphere is dangerous; sea level will continue to rise, ...). Other elements remain more uncertain, but we as scientists in our roles as informed citizens believe society should be deeply concerned about their possibility: failure of US midwestern (sic) precipitation in 100 years in a mega-drought; melting of a large part of the Greenland ice sheet, among many other examples.\\" Wunsch has said that he received a letter from the production company, Wag TV, threatening to sue him for defamation unless he agreed to make a public statement that he was neither misrepresented nor misled. Wunsch refused, although he states he was forced to hire a solicitor in the UK.\\"Further comments on The Great Global Warming Swindle\\", Carl Wunsch, 20 July 2007 Following Wunsch's complaints, his interview material was removed from the international and DVD versions of the film. On 7 December 2007, Wunsch restated his critique on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Lateline programme after the film was screened, saying: \\"It's not a science film at all. It's a political statement.\\" In the same interview, reacting to what he claimed were new and further distortions by Durkin, Wunsch said: > Durkin says that I reacted to the way the film portrayed me because of > pressure from my colleagues. This is completely false. I did hear almost > immediately from colleagues in the UK who saw the film who didn't berate me. > They simply said, \\"This doesn't sound like you, this seems to be distorting > your views, you better have a look at this,\\" =Ofcom ruling on Wunsch complaint= Ofcom divided Wunsch's complaint into three parts, ruling in his favour on two parts and against him on one part. * Ofcom agreed with Wunsch that he was misled as to the programme's intent, ruling that he wasn't given sufficient information about the polemical nature and tone of the programme to allow him to give informed consent for his participation. * Ofcom also found that Wunsch's general views were misrepresented: : > The Committee did not consider that the editing of the programme presented > Professor Wunsch as denying that global warming is taking place. However it > noted that the programme included his edited interview in the context of a > range of scientists who denied the scientific consensus about the > anthropogenic causes of global warming. In the Committee's view Professor > Wunsch made clear in his full unedited interview that he largely accepted > this consensus and the seriousness of the threat of global warming (albeit > with caveats about proof) and therefore found that the presentation of > Professor Wunsch's views, within the wider context of the programme, > resulted in unfairness to him. * However, Ofcom did not uphold Wunsch's complaint that the programme misrepresented his views in relation to the oceans and : : > The Committee noted from the unedited interview that Professor Wunsch had > referred to the greenhouse effect on a couple of occasions. However, in the > Committee‚Äôs opinion Professor Wunsch's comments in this respect had not been > primarily to warn of the dangers of warming the ocean (as Professor Wunsch > had suggested in his complaint). Rather the references had been used to make > the point that the relationship between carbon dioxide and atmospheric > temperature is complicated. In the Committee‚Äôs view, it was entirely at the > programme maker's editorial discretion to decide whether to include these > comments in the programme. Eigil Friis-Christensen Eigil Friis-Christensen's research was used to support claims about the influence of solar activity on climate, both in the programme and Durkin's subsequent defence of it. Friis-Christensen, with environmental Research Fellow Nathan Rive, criticised the way the solar data were used: > We have concerns regarding the use of a graph featured in the documentary > titled 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years'. Firstly, we have reason to believe > that parts of the graph were made up of fabricated data that were presented > as genuine. The inclusion of the artificial data is both misleading and > pointless. Secondly, although the narrator commentary during the > presentation of the graph is consistent with the conclusions of the paper > from which the figure originates, it incorrectly rules out a contribution by > anthropogenic greenhouse gases to 20th century global warming. In response to a question from The Independent as to whether the programme was scientifically accurate, Friis-Christensen said: \\"No, I think several points were not explained in the way that I, as a scientist, would have explained them ... it is obvious it's not accurate.\\" Following Eigil Friis-Christensen's criticism of the 'Temp & Solar Activity 400 Years' graph used in the programme (for perfectly matching the lines in the 100 years 1610‚Äì1710 where data did not in fact exist in the original), Durkin emailed Friis-Christensen to thank him for highlighting the error: \\"it is an annoying mistake which all of us missed and is being fixed for all future transmissions of the film. It doesn't alter our argument\\". =Reaction in the British media= The documentary received substantial coverage in the British press, both before and after it was broadcast. Environmentalist and political activist George Monbiot, writing for The Guardian before the programme was shown, discussed the arguments for and against the \\"hockey stick graph\\" used in An Inconvenient Truth, saying that the criticism of it has been \\"debunked\\". He also highlighted Durkin's previous documentary Against Nature, where the Independent Television Commission found that four complainants had been \\"misled\\" and their views were \\"distorted by selective editing\\". After the programme was shown, Monbiot wrote another article arguing that it was based on already debunked science, and he accused Channel 4 of being more interested in generating controversy than in producing credible science programmes. Robin McKie, science editor of The Guardian, said the documentary opted \\"for dishonest rhetoric when a little effort could have produced an important contribution to a critical social problem\\". Dominic Lawson, writing in The Independent, was favourable toward the programme, echoing many of its claims and recommending it to the public. He largely focused his attention on the reactions of the environmental community, first at Durkin's earlier production, Against Nature, and now at The Great Global Warming Swindle. Lawson characterised the programme's opponents as being quick to leap to ad hominem attacks about the director's qualifications and political affiliations rather than the merits of his factual claims. Lawson summarised examples from the production of how dissenting scientists are pushed into the background and effectively censored by organisations such as the IPCC. Lawson described the correlation between sunspots and temperature as \\"striking.\\" Geoffrey Lean, The Independent's environment editor, was critical of the programme. He noted that Dominic Lawson is the son and brother-in-law, respectively, of two prominent global warming deniers (Nigel Lawson, who is also featured in the programme, and Christopher Monckton), implying that Lawson was not a neutral observer. The Independent mostly disagreed with three of the programme's major claims, for example stating that \\"recent solar increases are too small to have produced the present warming, and have been much less important than greenhouse gases since about 1850\\". In a later Independent article, Steve Connor attacked the programme, saying that its makers had selectively used data that was sometimes decades old, and had introduced other serious errors of their own: The original, and corrected versions of Temperature data from TGGWS, along with NASA GISS data > Mr Durkin admitted that his graphics team had extended the time axis along > the bottom of the graph to the year 2000. 'There was a fluff there,' he > said. If Mr Durkin had gone directly to the NASA website he could have got > the most up-to-date data. This would have demonstrated that the amount of > global warming since 1975, as monitored by terrestrial weather stations > around the world, has been greater than that between 1900 and 1940‚Äîalthough > that would have undermined his argument. 'The original NASA data was very > wiggly-lined and we wanted the simplest line we could find,' Mr Durkin said. Connor also wrote that although the graph in question was attributed to NASA in the film, when he asked Wag TV where the graph really came from, they told him that it had been taken from a paper published in Medical Sentinel. Connor noted that \\"The authors of the paper are well-known climate sceptics who were funded by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine and the George C. Marshall Institute, a right-wing Washington think-tank.\\" The online magazine Spiked published an interview with Durkin, in which the director complained of how Ofcom censures \\"seriously controversial work\\", and that the end result is \\"phoney controversialism on TV but not much real controversialism\\". Spiked described the programme's \\"all-encompassing cosmic ray theory\\" as \\"a little unconvincing\\", but said that \\"the film poked some very big holes in the global warming consensus\\", and argued \\"we could do with more anti-conformist films from 'mavericks' like Durkin\\". The Times's science editor Mark Henderson listed a number of points where, in his opinion, \\"Channel 4 got it wrong over climate change\\". He highlighted the feedback argument for the ice core data, the measurement error explanation for temperatures in the troposphere, and the sulphate cooling argument for mid-20th century cooling. Janet Daley, writing in The Daily Telegraph in a column headlined \\"The Green Lobby Must Not Stifle The Debate\\", noted that \\"Among those who attempted to prevent the film being shown at all was the Liberal Democrat spokesman on the environment, Chris Huhne, who, without having seen the programme, wrote to Channel 4 executives advising them in the gravest terms to reconsider their decision to broadcast it\\". In response, Huhne sent a letter to The Daily Telegraph about Daley's column, writing \\"Janet Daley is simply wrong to state that I wrote to Channel 4 'advising them in the gravest terms to reconsider their decision to broadcast' Martin Durkin‚Äôs The Great Global Warming Swindle. I wrote asking for Channel 4's comments on the fact‚Äînot in dispute‚Äîthat the last time Mr Durkin ventured onto this territory he suffered serious complaints for sloppy journalism‚Äîupheld by the Independent Television Commission‚Äîand had to apologise.\\"Huhne letter to Telegraph, reproduced on Iain Dale's blog. Retrieved 6 April 2007. The Daily Telegraph apologised, saying they were happy to accept that \\"Mr Huhne's letter was not an attempt to prevent the film being shown or suppress debate on the issue\\".Telegraph correction about Huhne comments. Retrieved 6 April 2007. The Christopher Booker book The Real Global Warming Disaster provides a detailed synopsis of the programme, as well as an account of the subsequent complaints and Ofcom verdict. =Other reactions= David Miliband, at the time the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, presented a rebuttal of the main points of the film on his blog and stated that \\"there will always be people with conspiracy theories trying to do down the scientific consensus, and that is part of scientific and democratic debate, but the science of climate change looks like fact to me.\\" Steven Milloy, who runs the website Junkscience.com, endorsed the documentary on 18 March 2007. The programme has been discussed extensively in Australia, including favourable mentions in an editorial in The Australian and the Counterpoint radio programme presented by Michael Duffy.Duffy, Michael, \\"Who is Policing Carbon Cops?\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 28 July 2007 The Australian stated the film \\"presents a coherent argument for why governments must hasten slowly in responding\\". Duffy noted the program's claims regarding Margaret Thatcher. In response, writing in an opinion piece for the Australian Financial Review, John Quiggin criticised the programme for putting forward \\"conspiracy theories\\". According to The Australian, scientist Tim Flannery had wondered at a conference whether the programme should be classified as fiction rather than a documentary. In a critical review of the documentary, Barry Brook stated \\"Amongst the selected contrarian 'experts' Durkin has rallied to his cause, there are Tim Ball and Patrick Michaels (who also happen to deny that CFCs cause damage to the ozone layer), and Fred Singer and Richard Lindzen (who, in earlier incarnations, had been active denialists of the link between passive smoking and lung cancer, despite neither having any medical expertise).\\" In the Czech Republic, President V√°clav Klaus addressed the audience of the first local release of the movie on 28 June 2007. He called the premiere a \\"meeting of supporters of reason against irrationality\\" and compared the warnings of scientists against global warming to Communist propaganda. According to Czech news, Klaus‚Äîan outspoken critic of scientific consensus on global warming‚Äîhas been the first head of state to endorse this movie. In September 2008, Iain Stewart presented a documentary series The Climate Wars covering the climate change debate, in which a clip from Durkin's film showing the link between solar activity and temperature was shown, noting 'it seems a convincing argument!'. Stewart's documentary then showed that the correlation didn't hold if more recent data (available at the time but not used in The Great Global Warming Swindle) was included. =Reaction to DVD release= Thirty-seven climate scientists wrote a letter urging Martin Durkin to drop plans to release a DVD of the film. In the letter they say Durkin \\"misrepresented both the scientific evidence and the interpretations of researchers.\\" Durkin said in response: \\"The reason they want to suppress The Great Global Warming Swindle is because the science has stung them\\". He acknowledged two of the errors mentioned by the scientists‚Äîincluding the claim about volcanic emissions‚Äîbut he described those changes as minor and said they would be corrected in the expanded DVD release. In response to the call by these scientists not to market a DVD of the film, Times columnist Mick Hume, described environmentalism as a \\"new religion\\", saying \\"Scientists have become the equivalent of high priests in white coats, summoned to condemn heretics\\". The DVD was released in the UK on 30 September 2007. Christopher Monckton, a prominent British global warming sceptic, is funding the distribution of the documentary in English schools as a riposte to Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, which is also being shown in schools.Leake, Jonathan. \\"Please, sir ‚Äì Gore's got warming wrong\\". The Times, 14 October 2007. =Durkin's response to his critics= On 17 March 2007, The Daily Telegraph published a response by Durkin, \\"The global-warmers were bound to attack, but why are they so feeble?\\" In it, he rejected any criticism of the close correlation between solar variation and temperature change, saying that Friis-Christensen stood by his work, and that \\"No one any longer seriously disputes the link between solar activity and temperature in earth's climate history.\\" He accepted that the time axis of one graph was incorrectly labelled when the programme was first transmitted, but said that this does not change his conclusions. Regarding the Carl Wunsch controversy (see above), he repeated that Wunsch was not duped into taking part in the programme. (Ofcom later ruled against Durkin on this point.) Durkin went on to reject his opponents' position that the cooling period observed post Second World War was caused by sulfate aerosol cooling: \\"Thanks to China and the rest, SO2 levels are far, far higher now than they were back then. Why isn't it perishing cold?\\" He concluded by saying that the \\"global warming alarm...is wrong, wrong, wrong.\\" Commenting at a Cannes film festival press conference on 17 April 2007, Durkin noted: \\"My name is absolute mud on the Internet; it's really vicious,\\" adding \\"There is no good scientific basis for it but the theory continues to hold sway because so many people have built their careers and reputations on it.\\" =The Armand Leroi correspondence= The Times reported that Durkin had seriously fallen out with a scientist who had been considering working with him. Armand Leroi, a geneticist, was concerned that Durkin had used data about a correlation between solar activity and global temperatures that was subsequently found to be flawed. Leroi sent Durkin an e-mail in which he said that he thought the programme \\"made some good points (the politics of the IPCC) and some bad points (anthropogenic global warming is a conspiracy to keep Africa underdeveloped),\\" but said what had most interested him were some of the scientific claims about solar activity and global temperature. He said he looked for citations of the 1991 Friis-Christensen scientific paper used in the programme. While Leroi acknowledged \\"I am no climate scientist,\\" he said that after reviewing criticisms of the paper, he had become convinced that: \\"To put this bluntly: the data that you showed in your programme were wrong‚Äìand may have been deliberately faked... it does show what abundant experience has already taught me‚Äìthat, left to their own devices, TV producers simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth.\\" Leroi copied the e-mail to other parties including The Guardian journalist and Bad Science columnist Ben Goldacre and science writer and mathematics expert Simon Singh. Durkin replied to all with the single sentence: \\"You‚Äôre a big daft cock\\". Singh then sent an email to Durkin that said: \\"I have not paid the same attention to your programme as Armand has done, but from what I did see it is an irresponsible piece of film-making. If you can send me a copy of the programme then I will examine it in more detail and give you a more considered response...it would be great if you could engage in the debate rather just resorting to one line replies\\". Durkin responded: \\"The IPCC's own figures show the hottest year in the past ten was 1998, and the temp has been flat-lining now for five years. If it's greenhouse gas causing the warming the rate of warming should be higher in the troposphere than on the surface. The opposite is the case. The ice core data shows that temperature change causes the level of atmospheric to change ‚Äî not the other way round. Why have we not heard this in the hours and hours of shit programming on global warming shoved down our throats by the BBC?\\", and concluded with, \\"Never mind a bit of irresponsible film-making. Go and fuck yourself\\". Durkin later apologised for his language, saying that he had sent the e-mails when tired and had just finished making the programme, and that he was \\"eager to have all the science properly debated with scientists qualified in the right areas\\". Ofcom investigation of complaints =Ruling= In an 8400-word official judgement issued on 21 July 2008 the British media regulator Ofcom declared that the final part of the film dealing with the politics of climate change had broken rules on \\"due impartiality on matters of major political and industrial controversy and major matters relating to current public policy\\". Ofcom also backed complaints by Sir David King, stating that his views were misrepresented, and Carl Wunsch, on the points that he had been misled as to its intent, and that the impression had been given that he agreed with the programme's position on climate change. Ofcom further ruled that the IPCC had not been given an adequate chance to respond to adverse claims that its work was politicised and that it had made misleading claims about malaria. However, the regulator said that because \\"the link between human activity and global warming... became settled before March 2007\\", in parts 1‚Äì4 the audience was not \\"materially misled so as to cause harm or offence\\".Climate documentary 'broke rules' BBC News, 21 July 2008 According to Ofcom the program caused no harm because \\"the discussion about the causes of global warming was to a very great extent settled by the date of broadcast\\", meaning that climate change was no longer a matter of political controversy.Monbiot article Channel 4 said in its defence against the complaints that The Great Global Warming Swindle \\"was clearly identified as an authored polemic of the kind that is characteristic of some of Channel 4‚Äôs output\\", and Ofcom said in its decision that it was \\"of paramount importance that broadcasters, such as Channel 4, continue to explore controversial subject matter\\". Ofcom declined to rule on the accuracy of the programme, saying: \\"It is not within Ofcom's remit or ability in this case as the regulator of the 'communications industry' to establish or seek to adjudicate on 'facts' such as whether global warming is a man-made phenomenon.\\" It noted that it only regulates \\"misleading material where that material is likely to cause harm or offence\\" and \\"as a consequence, the requirement that content must not materially mislead the audience is necessarily a high test.\\" The regulator ruled that the parts of the programme about the scientific debate \\"were not matters of political or industrial controversy or matters relating to public policy and therefore the rules on due impartiality did not apply.\\" In the fifth segment of the programme concerning the political controversy and public policy, however, Ofcom ruled that the programme-makers were \\"required to include an appropriate wide range of the significant views\\" but \\"failed to do this.\\" Channel 4 was required to broadcast a summary of the Ofcom ruling but was given no further sanctions. =General responses= Robert Watson, a former chair of the IPCC, also welcomed Ofcom's ruling that the film had committed a number of breaches of the broadcasting code but expressed disappointment \\"that Ofcom did not find that the programme materially misled the audience as to cause harm or offence.\\" He characterised the film as inaccurate, not impartial, unbalanced and misrepresentative of the scientific consensus on climate change.Watson, Robert. \\"The public has been swindled\\". The Guardian, 28 July 2008 Another former IPCC chair, Sir John Houghton, likewise commented that \\"it's very disappointing that Ofcom hasn't come up with a stronger statement about being misled.\\" Bob Ward, the former head of media at the Royal Society, who played a major role in coordinating objections to the film, asserted that \\"the programme has been let off the hook on a highly questionable technicality\\", noting that although the ruling acknowledged that \\"Channel 4 had admitted errors in the graphs and data used in the programme\\", the regulator had nonetheless \\"...decided that this did not cause harm or offence to the audience.\\" Rajendra K. Pachauri, the former chair of the IPCC, welcomed the ruling as \\"a vindication of the credibility and standing of the IPCC and the manner in which we function, and [it] clearly brings out the distortion in whatever Channel 4 was trying to project.\\" The Royal Society's head, Lord Rees, issued a statement in response to the ruling, commenting: \\"TV companies occasionally commission programmes just to court controversy, but to misrepresent the evidence on an issue as important as global warming was surely irresponsible. 'The Great Global Warming Swindle' was itself a swindle. The programme makers misrepresented the science, the views of some of the scientists featured in the programme and the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\"Rees, Martin. \\"Royal Society response to OFCOM decision on 'The Great Global Warming Swindle'\\". Royal Society, 21 July 2008 =Channel Four's response= The ruling was welcomed by Channel 4's Head of Documentaries, Hamish Mykura who commissioned the film stating the channel was \\"pleased\\" that Ofcom found the film did not \\"materially mislead the audience.\\" When questioned by television industry e-zine C21 about Ofcom's finding against the channel Mykura said: > It has scrutinised the documentary in great detail over 16 months. Any film > scrutinised for that long would have revealed some factual inaccuracies, but > crucially, it's said that what it found was not of a significant magnitude > to materially mislead the viewer. It said that there were some things that > weren't right, but ultimately it has exonerated us. While he said that he regretted that 'there were some breaches of the code' he said there was \\"a degree\\" to which he disagreed with the complaints they upheld: > On the complaint from Sir David King, there was a quote by a contributor in > the film that was wrong, which he had wrongly picked up from someone else > and was quoting. On the second point regarding the IPCC, Ofcom decided that > we didn't give it enough time to respond to the allegations presented. We > gave them 10 days, so you can decide as to whether you feel that's enough > time. And on the complaint from Carl Wunsch, he complained that we hadn't > made it significantly clear he would be appearing on a polemic climate > change programme. But we told him we were going to explore the issues of the > counter argument to global warming and he got the same letter as everyone > else, and no-one else claimed they didn't know what they'd be appearing on.

Many interviewees from The Great Global Warming Swindle appeared in‚Äîand were the subject of‚Äîthis film. * Doomsday Called Off: A 2005 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation expose raising many of the same criticisms of anthropogenic global warming. It includes interviews with several sources of information used, but not interviewed, in The Great Global Warming Swindle (among whom are Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas). International distribution The documentary has been sold to Sweden's TV4, (who aired it in April 2007TV4, 2007-04-26, Swedish Media database, SLBA) Denmark's DR2, Germany's RTL (on 11 June 2007) and n-TV (on 7 July 2007), Finland's MTV3 (on 7 October 2007) and Hong Kong's TVB Pearl (on 16 November 2007). Negotiations are underway with the United States network ABC and France's TF1. A modified version (running time 55 minutes) of the documentary was shown in Germany. Many interviews were cut out, with others replaced by German speaking interview partners, and some claims were abandoned or changed. For example, the reference to Margaret Thatcher was replaced by the claim that Helmut Schmidt promoted climate change to justify the construction of nuclear power plants in Germany. The programme on RTL was followed by a discussion roundtable. A shortened version, excluding the interview with Carl Wunsch and claims about volcanoes, among other material, was shown by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 12 July 2007. The Australian reported that this was \\"against the advice of ABC science journalist Robyn Williams, who instructed the ABC Television not to buy the program.\\" Williams described the programme as \\"demonstrably wrong\\", and claimed that the ABC board had put pressure on ABC TV director Kim Dalton to show the programme. Dalton defended the decision, saying \\"[Durkin's] thesis is way outside the scientific mainstream. But that's no reason to keep his views away from audiences\\" The broadcast was followed by an interview between Durkin and ABC reporter Tony Jones, in which Jones challenged Durkin on a number of points, including the accuracy of graphs used in the program, criticism of the program's claims by climate scientists, its allegation of a conspiracy theory and the claims of misrepresentation by Carl Wunsch. This was followed by a panel discussion, including participation from a studio audience. Lateline, which followed, included an interview with Wunsch. (See Carl Wunsch section for full details.) =New Zealand broadcast= A version of The Great Global Warming Swindle (edited by Durkin to remove errors) was broadcast in New Zealand on Prime TV, 8:40 pm, 1 June 2008. Following the program there was an hour-long panel discussion, moderated by Prime presenter Eric Young, including the following people: * David Wratt‚ÄîNIWA General Manager * Leighton Smith‚Äîclimate change sceptic and radio talkshow host * Willem De Lange‚ÄîSenior Lecturer, Department of Earth & Ocean Sciences ‚Äì University of Waikato * Cindy Baxter‚ÄîGreenpeace Climate change consultant * Martin Manning‚ÄîProfessor and Research Fellow in Climate Change at the Victoria University, Climate Change Research Institute Manning and Wratt stated that the IPCC reports represented the well documented consensus amongst the scientific community that climate change was a real phenomenon and that human activities, including emissions, were the most likely cause. Smith disputed that there was evidence that caused temperature rises. He referred further science issues to de Lange. Smith made several references to the many scientists whose research and publications refuted the human causes of climate change, however no details were provided. Baxter was supportive of the IPCC consensus. She reminded the group on several occasions that there were several known funding connections between the groups most vocal in raising doubts about and large industrial companies (such as ExxonMobil). At the end of the session, two different graphs were shown with more recent data than that used in The Great Global Warming Swindle.

History =Settlement= The initial settlers of Rosewood were both black and white. When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890, the pencil mills closed, and many white residents moved to Sumner. By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black. The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable.Colburn, David R. (Fall 1997) \\"Rosewood and America in the Early Twentieth Century\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, 76 (2), pp. 175‚Äì192. The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people. Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most influential. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks, were the second largest landowners in Levy County.Jones, et al. \\"Appendices\\", p. 135. To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly. The Carriers were also a large family, responsible for logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other.Jones, et al. \\"Appendices\\", p. 163. Although residents of Rosewood probably did not vote because voter registration requirements in Florida had effectively disfranchised blacks since the turn of the century, both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the U.S. Census. In 1920, the combined population of both towns was 344 blacks and 294 whites.Jones et al., p. 20. =Before the Massacre= As was common in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial segregation under Jim Crow laws, requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation.Pildes, Richard H. \\"Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon\\", Constitutional Commentary (2000), 17, p 12‚Äì13. Blacks and whites created their own community centers: in 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient. They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, one of which was white-owned. The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures. Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of the Rosewood Massacre remember it as a happy place. In 1995 survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79, \\"Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted. There were roses everywhere you walked. Lovely.\\"Jerome, Richard (January 16, 1995). \\"A Measure of Justice\\", People, 43 (2), pp. 46‚Äì49 Etymology The name \\"Rosewood\\" refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood. Economy =Before 1923= This pencil mill in Cedar Key was an integral part of local industry. Rosewood was settled in 1845, east of Cedar Key, near the Gulf of Mexico. The local industry was centered on timber. Two pencil mills were nearby in Cedar Key; several turpentine mills and a sawmill away in Sumner helped support local residents, as did farming of citrus and cotton. The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the Florida Railroad in 1870, but it was never incorporated as a town. =Decline of Rosewood's economy (1923‚Äì1950)= In 1923, during the infamous Rosewood Massacre, the entire town of Rosewood was razed except for John Wright's General Store. After the majority of the population fled Rosewood, the once profitable turpentine industry began to fade as newer, alternative synthetic products were being produced. By 1950, the turpentine industry practically no longer existed. =Since 1950= Since the 1950s, several businesses were established in Rosewood, including a general store; fisheries; charter tours; clam, oysters and other types of Mollusca farmers; agricultural farms; restaurants; storage facilities and a small airfield. Several neighborhoods have been developed around these businesses. Rosewood Massacre In January 1923, white men from nearby towns lynched a Rosewood resident allegedly in response to a lie that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. The woman was actually beaten up by her lover while her husband was at work. When black citizens defended themselves against further attack, several hundred whites organized to comb the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors hid for several days in nearby swamps and were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities were aware of the violence, they made no arrests for the activities in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by black residents during the attacks. None ever returned. =Massacre reparations= In the spring of 1994, the Florida state legislature voted to give $2 million in compensation for the nine surviving family members (equaling $150,000 each). In December 2010, a state scholarship was established for descendants of families that survived the massacre. http://www.floridastudentfinancialaid.org/SSFAD/factsheets/Rosewood.htm Governor Jeb Bush in 2004 placed a plaque commemorating the massacre in front of John Wright's general store, the only remaining structure from the Rosewood Massacre. This plaque was vandalized on at least one occasion when it was shot at from a passing car. Community services In 1980, the Rosewood Volunteer Fire Department was officially established and the station number was designated as 80 in District 4.

A new grant was issued confirming the English acquisition of Madras. Copies of this new grant which were presented to factor Greenhill by the new Raya in October/November 1645 have survived to the present day.About the agency of Thomas Ivie, From Corporation of Chennai website As per the new grant, the village of Narikamedu to the west of Madraspatnam was added to the East India Company's dominions. It was in 1646 that the first Hindu temple was constructed in Madras since the English acquisition. It was dedicated to Chenna Kesava Perumal and built on part of the grounds of the present High Court. The endowments were made by Naga Bhattan, the Company's powder-maker and Beri Timanna. A few years from the English acquisition of Madras, the Sultan of Golconda attacked the region around Madras and the Raja of Chandragiri was forced to flee. The English, however, were diplomatic enough to establish cordial relations with the emerging Muslim power and offered the Sultan the services of their gunner when he blockaded Santhome in 1646.  EARLY DAYS  Thomas Ivie (1603‚Äì73) was the third son (of 20 siblings) to Colonel Thomas Ivie of Abbey House in Malmesbury. His ancestors had made their fortunes as clothiers and they were settled in the area from Kington to Hullavington. In his youth he had been apprenticed to Edmund Winn of Canning Street London in 1618 and gained his freedom from the Merchant Taylors Company in 1627.Lady Ivie: Queen of Wapping, Karen Proudler, 2018 In 1629 he was acting as a shipping agent, carrying merchandise to the Barbary Coast in North Africa on the vessels ‚ÄòConsul of London‚Äô and ‚ÄòLydia of London‚Äô. Merchants who consigned goods to Ivie‚Äôs vessels complained of irregularities and that Ivie had ‚Äúsiphoned off much of the profits to himself‚Äù. A special warrant was issued by the High Court of the Admiralty of England calling for Thomas Ivie to be arrested. It was to escape the prospect of bankruptcy and imprisonment that Ivie fled overseas.Lady Ivie: Queen of Wapping, Karen Proudler, 2018, p186 He married his first wife, Miss Stump (the Stump family being of Malmesbury), in 1630 and travelled to Guiana in 1633 with his wife‚Äôs nephew.John Aubrey: My Own Life‚Äô by Ruth Scurr, 2015 gives an account of what happened to them on this journey in Guiana Thomas joined the East India Company from 5th September 1639 ‚Äì being in Madras from 1644-48.

To everyone‚Äôs mortification, the document was widely read; the antiquarian John Aubrey who knew the Ivies and Stumps, being educated at Malmesbury himself, read a copy of Ivie‚Äôs appeal and thought it contained ‚Äúas much baudry and beastliness as can be imagined‚Äù.Bodleian Library: Aubrey 12, pp238-239 Despite this background, Thomas and Theodosia Ivie later reunited briefly and went on to have a daughter, Theodosia Ivie 1660-68.

The death of their young daughter in 1668 prompted the couple to separate again ‚Äì this time for good. The marriage ended in a veritable explosion of litigation between them as Thomas repeatedly tried, and failed, to get control of the estate his wife had inherited in Wapping. Yet again, Lady Ivie made a petition for alimony and also appealed to the Ecclesiastical Court for aid. Then there were complaints in the Court of Chancery and litigation at the King‚Äôs Bench as well as cases at the Court of Equity and the Court of Arches. Thomas Ivie was sued for alimony, libel, cruelty and desertion. As Thomas neared the end of his life, he tried to prevent his wife triumphing over him by making his Will on 17th November 1671, making bequests to his numerous nephews and nieces and making sure his estranged wife received nothing. He failed in this as litigation was ongoing at his death and court records showed awards against his estate which his executors were obliged to fulfil.Lady Ivie: Queen of Wapping, Karen Proudler, 2018, p204 Lady Ivie remarried within just a few hours of Thomas Ivie‚Äôs death to an Irishman called James Bryan, but it was her penchant for forging documents that was to be her legacy.Six Criminal Women by Elizabeth Jenkins, 1949 The pinnacle of her forging career was her 1684 trialThe Lady Ivie‚Äôs Trial, for the great part of Shadwell in the county of Middlesex before Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys in 1684 by Sir John Fox, 1929 where she challenged Thomas Neale for his land in East London.

The fourth and current constitution was promulgated on 8 October 1995. It sanctions a republican form of government with a powerful President.  First constitution (1962‚Äì1966)  The first constitution of Uganda was the product of the Ugandan Constitutional Conference and took effect at the moment of independence (9 October 1962). It provided for a system of Parliamentary democracy underpinned by constitutional supremacy. It provided for a complex system of devolution within Uganda: the Kingdom of Buganda gained particularly strong powers of self-government; the Kingdoms of Bunyoro, Tooro and Ankole, and the Territory of Busoga also gained the status of \\"federal states\\" and were permitted to retain their own legislatures; while the remaining districts and the territory of Mbale were controlled directly by the central government. The 1962 constitution provided for most members of Parliament to be elected directly. The sole exception to this rule was Buganda, where MPs were selected by an electoral college made up of members of the Lukiiko (Buganda's own sub- national Parliament). The 1962 constitution was amended three times: first, and most importantly, it was amended in 1963 to replace Queen Elizabeth II (represented by the Governor-General of Uganda, Sir Walter Coutts) as the head of state with the largely ceremonial positions of President and Vice- President, making Uganda a de-facto republic; in 1964 it was amended to make minor changes to the date on which the Legislative Assembly of the Kingdom of Tooro should stand dissolved; and in January 1965 it was amended for a third and final time to give effect to the outcome of the lost counties referendum. From 1963 to 1966, Uganda was referred to as the 'Sovereign State of Uganda', because of the strong monarchical element in the Ugandan constitutional set- up.  Second constitution (1966‚Äì1967)  In February 1966, during the political crisis that surrounded the gold scandal, the then Prime Minister (and Head of Government) Milton Obote suspended the first constitution, making himself both Head of State and Head of Government shortly after. On 15 April a new constitution was promulgated. This \\"pigeonhole constitution\\" (so named because copies of it were posted in the pigeonholes of Members of Parliament) was overtly intended as a temporary measure \\"until such time as a Constituent Assembly established by Parliament enacts a Constitution in place of this Constitution\\". While repeating verbatim many aspects of the 1962 constitution, the 1966 constitution relabelled the position of leader of the party having the greatest numerical strength in the National Assembly as the \\"President\\". The 1966 constitution also downgraded the status of Buganda to bring it into line with the status of the other historic kingdoms, for example by retracting Buganda's previous privilege of indirectly, rather than directly, electing members to the Ugandan Parliament and abolishing the High Court of Buganda. Buganda refused to accept the new constitution, resulting in the exile of the Kabaka Mutesa II (who until the crisis had been serving as Uganda's first President) and the postponement of national elections under 1971. The first amendment to the 1966 constitution came into force on 3 June 1966, bringing Buganda into even closer alignment with the kingdoms of Bunyoro, Tooro and Ankole, but downgrading Busoga to the status of a district.  Third constitution (1967‚Äì1995)  This constitution renamed Uganda as the 'Republic of Uganda'. The third constitution was promulgated on 8 September 1967 following three months of debate by a Constituent Assembly formed of members of the National Assembly. It was, in real terms, an amended version of the 1966 constitution but abolished all traditional rulers and all local legislatures and considerably expanded the power of the executive (at that time headed by Obote) at the expense of the legislature. Although the constitution notionally gave rise to a Parliamentary democracy, in practice the National Assembly had little influence. In 1969, the UPC was formally declared to be Uganda's only official party to create a one-party state. The third constitution was partially suspended under Idi Amin by virtue of Legal Notice No. 1 of 1971 and largely ignored during his Presidency. In particular, since the notice suspended Article 1 (supremacy of the constitution), it paved for the way for Amin to rule by decree. Further constitutional changes by made by the Constitution (Modification) Decree No. 5 of 1971, which provided that all executive powers were to be exercisable by Chairman of the Defence Council (a title Amin himself held) and the Parliament (Vesting of Powers) Decree No. 8 of 1971, which vested legislative powers in Amin and his council of Ministers. The legal status of the 1967 constitution following Amin's overthrow in 1979 was not clear. Legal Notice No. 1 of 1979 nullified Legal Notice No. 1 of 1971, and fundamentally recognised the 1967 Constitution as once again supreme, but also suspended parts of it and transferred numerous executive powers to incoming President Yusuf Lule. All legislative powers referred to in the Constitution were to be vested in the National Consultative Council (NCC) until such a time as a Legislative Assembly could be elected. Despite this, the NCC favoured going further and abandoning the 1967 Constitution altogether. This disagreement contributed to the NCC replacing Lule with Godfrey Binaisa in June 1979. Shortly after, Legal Notice No. 5 of 1980 provided for the establishment of a Presidential Commission. It expressly provided that \\"where any conflict arises between the provisions of this Proclamation and the provisions of the Constitution of Uganda or any other written law, the provisions of this Proclamation shall prevail\\". The 1967 Constitution was formally revived by Obote on his return to power in late 1980, but following his overthrow by Bazilio Olara-Okello in July 1985, the constitution was suspended once more. On seizing power in 1986, the National Resistance Army, under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni, confirmed that the 1967 constitution was supreme but partially suspended. In particular, the provisions in the constitution relating to the existence of a national Parliament and the election of the President were suspended for four years (later extended to eight). The detail of this suspension was set out in Legal Notice No. 1 of 1986, which nullified Legal Notice No. 1 of 1979 and invested executive powers in Museveni directly.  Fourth constitution (1995‚Äìpresent)  In 1988 the National Resistance Council established the Uganda Constitutional Commission and tasked it with reviewing the 1967 constitution and developing a new constitution. The mandate of the Commission was to consult the people and make proposals for a democratic permanent constitution based on national consensus. In its final report of December 1992, the Commission recommended that the new constitution be agreed by a mostly-elected Constituent Assembly. Elections to the Constituent Assembly took place in March 1994. The output of that process, Uganda's fourth constitution, dated 22 September 1995, was adopted by the Assembly on 27 September and promulgated on 8 October. Much more detailed than the previous constitutions, it sanctions a republican form of government with a powerful President. Compared to the 1967 constitution, however, the 1995 constitution more overtly attempts to achieve a balance of power between the executive, legislature, and other bodies whose independence is guaranteed by the constitution. For example, under the latter, ministerial appointments and government borrowing must be approved by Parliament; and the civil service is appointed by the independent Public Services Commission and Judicial Service Commission. The President no longer has the power to dissolve Parliament and Parliament can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority. The 1995 constitution stresses the notion of an independent judiciary, with the Supreme Court as the final court of appeal. The 1995 Constitution of Uganda has restored all the traditional monarchies, except for the Kingdom of Ankole, but limits the Ugandan monarchs' powers to cultural matters only. Amendments in 2005 removed presidential term limits and legalized a multi-party political system. However, amendments were made and the new Presidential term limits were removed in 2018.

Ringo (born March 2, 1955) is an environmental justice, clean energy, and quality jobs advocate who founded and chairs renewable energy developer Zoetic Energy.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/cyril-ramaphosa-elected-as-president- of-south-africa-after-zuma-departure.html Ringo previously chaired the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), becoming the first African American to hold the position for any major conservation organizationhttps://www.treehugger.com/culture/the-treehugger-interview- jerome-ringo-chairman-of-the-national-wildlife-federation-and-founder-of-the- apollo-alliance.html, and was an associate research scholar and McCluskey Fellow for Conservation at Yale Universityhttps://reflections.yale.edu/article/gods-green-earth/environmental- justice-and-new-american-dream. He was also president of the Apollo Alliance, a coalition of organized labor, environmentalist, business, and civil rights leaders dedicated to freeing the United States of dependence on foreign oil. Early life Jerome Ringo was the third of six children born to Earl Ringo, a retired postal worker, and Nellie Ringo, a nurse. Ringo grew up in Bayous of Southern Louisiana during the height of the American civil rights movement, during which time Earl worked to racially integrate public schools in Louisiana. His father would often play recordings of speeches by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. When he was thirteen, he and his brothers prepared to become the first black students to enroll in previously segregated schools in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In the middle of the night, their father awakened the boys, telling them to crawl up to the front window. When the boys looked out, they witnessed a posse of Ku Klux Klansmen, who were burning a cross in their front yard. He was the only African-American working as ranger at the world's largest Scout camp, in Cimarron, New Mexico. Ringo attended college, planning to major in education at both Louisiana Tech University and McNeese State University. Before earning a degree, however, he decided to take a job in the petrochemical industry in 1975, lured by a high salary. Career After college, Ringo worked in the petrochemical industry for 22 years, over half of that time as a union leader. Many of his relatives lived just beyond the fence from these industries, so he saw the impacts of pollution from refineries first hand. He noted that employees at the refinery wore masks and protective clothing, but that the neighbors across the fence, who were predominantly poor and black, received no such protection, and suffered disproportionately high levels of cancers and respiratory diseases. Eventually, Ringo decided to help educate the people in communities affected by petrochemical pollution, teaching them how to effectively stop the discharge of chemicals into neighborhoods around refineries, leading to the beginning of his environmental activism. Ringo began his environmental activism in 1991, by becoming member of the Calcasieu League for Environmental Action Now (CLEAN), an affiliate of the Louisiana Wildlife Federation. Among the 20,000 members of the statewide group, he was the first African American ever to join. Rather than trying to shut refineries and chemical plants down, he advocated the lobbying of state legislators on environmental laws, and encouraged citizens to show up at public hearings, where, as a community, they could express their fears and concerns and speak truth to power. Ringo was transferred to Malaysia, and during one of his return trips to the United States in 1994, he was offered early retirement. After accepting the offer, he committed his life to full- time work on behalf of people beyond the refinery fences lines. In 1998, he was the sole African-American delegate at the Global Warming Treaty negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, where he delivered an address. He also has spoken at the Central American conference on sustainable development in Belize City, Belize. He has addressed many historically-Black colleges and other universities, including the University of Michigan School of Natural Resources and Environment and at the University of Oregon's Public Interest Environmental Law Conference. =Apollo Alliance= As president of the Apollo Alliance, Ringo is working to educate the public and lobby in Washington, D.C. about the need to invest in alternative clean-energy sources, energy-efficient technology and jobs by building diverse coalitions. The Apollo Alliance seeks to reinvest in the competitiveness of American industry, rebuild cities, create good jobs, and ensure good stewardship of the economy and natural environment. \\"We are an organization that looks like the face of America,\\" Ringo has said. The name of the alliance was chosen to pay homage to John F. Kennedy's Apollo program, which successfully put a man on the moon in 1969. The Apollo Alliance has been endorsed by leaders of the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace USA, the National Wildlife Federation, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the NAACP and other activist groups. =National Wildlife Federation= In 1996, Ringo was elected to serve on the board of directors of the National Wildlife Federation, a seventy-year-old conservation organization which comprising 4.5 million members and over 700 employees. Since becoming chairman of the board the in 2005, Ringo has sought to further the NWF's partnerships with other organizations, particularly those involved with combating ecologocial dangers in poor and minority neighborhoods. He spearheads programs that reach into urban and minority communities, including schoolyard habitat programs such as Earth Tomorrow, which focuses on minority kids in elementary, middle, and high schools. \\"The single greatest issue for me as an environmentalist is climate change,\\" Ringo told Mother Jones in 2005. Ringo envisions a new movement in environmentalism, where everyone becomes involved in planning for the future together. He believes that real success, in energy security, public health, environmental protection and social justice, will come when environmentalists are united and empowered to meet as equals with corporate interests. =Zoetic Energy= Mr. Ringo founded Zoetic Energy to address issues such as energy security in the developing world. Zoetic secured a Power Purchase Agreement with Ghana in January 2016. He has promoted hydrokinetic technology to ministers and leaders of countries throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America.http://zoeticglobal.com/leadership/ References External links * HuffingtonPost.com - Jerome Ringo blog, Huffington Post * MotherJones.com - 'The Pioneer: The new head of the National Wildlife Federation has always been a pathbreaker.'

It is played upside-down underneath frozen pools or ponds. Participants wear diving masks, fins and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area or rink for a floating puck. Competitors do not use any breathing apparatus, but instead surface for air every 30 seconds or so. It is not to be confused with underwater hockey, in which the floor of a swimming pool and a sinking puck are used. Origins The idea for the sport is attributed to Christian Redl, an Austrian freediver who is notable for various world free-diving depth records under ice. Competition The first Underwater Ice Hockey World Cup was held at Weissensee, Austria in February 2007. Finland finished first, followed by Austria and Slovakia. The other playing nations were Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Slovenia. The second Underwater Ice Hockey World Cup was held in February 2013 at Weissensee, Austria with Austria winning the championship. The first match took place in 2005 and consisted of 2 teams. The first teams were Austria; founders Christian Redl and Jaromir Foukal, versus the German team of Philipp Von Heydebreck and Knut Stender. This match resulted in an 8‚Äì8 tie. The second match took place in 2006 and also consisted of 2 teams. The first team was again the Austrian team consisting of Christian Redl and Jaromir Foukal and the Slovakian team of Erik Tocek and Juraj Karpis. The game ended in a 9:8 victory for Austria. The next match took place in 2007 and was the first world championship. This game consisted of 8 teams: Austria, Germany, Finland, Holland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. The winner of the match was Finland and the runner-up was Austria. In 2013 the second Underwater Ice Hockey World Championships took place. This game consisted of 2 men's teams (Austria, Germany) and 2 mixed teams (Austria B and Germany B). The winner of the tournament was Austria and the runner-up was Germany. Austria B finished 3rd. The title decider ended in a 9:6 redemption victory for Austria. The rink Underwater ice hockey is played upside down underneath a 6-meter-wide by 8-meter-long rink in a frozen lake, pond, or swimming pool. Most rinks are 3 √ó 6 meters, each side fronted by a goal that is fastened to the ice underneath the surface. Some rinks are 6 √ó 8 meters. The air temperature is generally around . The water is around . As long as the ice is frozen, natural or unnatural, it is ok for the players to play. The rink is completed with side hoardings as well, including sponsor names much like any typical sport, to support the funding for the event. The hoardings are long enough where the puck generally will not go out of bounds. The depth of the water varies, but it is at least over 3 meters, much like a regular pool. The air holes ‚ÄúSafety precautions are a big part of underwater hockey. Before each game starts, one of the rescue divers uses a chainsaw to cut holes in the rink so the players can get in and can get out‚Äù. ‚ÄúBecause divers can easily get disoriented during a game, in case one of them is too exhausted to reach the hole, or can‚Äôt find it, four divers equipped with oxygen tanks supervise every match‚Äù. Several large holes, 2 x 1 meters, are cut in the ice next to the rink so that players could easily rise to the surface for air. ‚ÄúEach hole marked with a big national flag to avoid confusion‚Äù (deeperblue). The holes are located perpendicular to the nets (on the long side of the rink where a bench would be located in any sport), where players in hockey would typically sub in and out. The holes are large enough to fit the divers and support divers who could quickly dive in and get to anybody who needs help. Some rinks even have holes in the ice located within the nets in case a diver is not able to swim over to the side of the rink. ‚ÄúThe players should have good breath-holding skills‚Äù (Topendsports). Players typically stay underwater for 30‚Äì60 seconds before swapping with a teammate, much like they do in hockey when switching from offense to defense. With each breath of a player is to swap with a teammate. Players do not typically come up for air then go back down. Instead, they swap with their teammate every 30 to 60 seconds to allow them to recover. Both teams will generally swap players at the same time in order to keep the game competitive. A well-trained team would know when their teammate needs to switch out. ‚ÄúDetermining the optimum stick ‚Äì switching interval is quite tricky. A shorter interval assures the player enough air for a power play, on the one hand, but on the other hand it increases the time during which both players are under ice, since the stick shift is done during play and in extreme cases, far away from the breathing hole‚Äù (deeperblue). They are not allowed to play with any kind of breathing apparatus during competitive play. However, some practice with scuba tanks. Majority of the players, who are called apnea divers, freedive often and have prepared accordingly. Equipment ‚ÄúParticipants wear diving masks, fins and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area for a floating puck‚Äù they guide with hockey sticks. They wear the masks to see underwater and have them as tight as they can keep it so it will not get knocked off during play. The fins help propel them to move quicker through the water. The wetsuits help keep them warm in almost freezing temperatures. The hockey sticks are like normal ice hockey sticks. They float in the water (because they are wooden) in case a player may drop it with contact. The puck is usually a 10-inch Styrofoam puck. Because it is Styrofoam, it floats underneath the surface of the ice so players are literally playing hockey upside down. There have even been instances of the puck being made of a lightwood as well. As long as the puck floats, they are able to play. How to play ‚ÄúWith a start signal from the (Austrian, but fair) referee you would instantly turn belly up under the ice and zoom towards the centre of the field, seeking the advantage accruing to the first to reach the puck‚Äù (deeperblue). Underwater ice hockey is played one on one with teams of two. Both men and women play together and against each other. However, there are four teams that play during each event. ‚ÄúEach match lasts for three ten minute periods, like regular ice hockey, and the play is extremely fast paced as the divers try to keep warm‚Äù (dailymail). ‚ÄúWhile they're not competing under the ice, they're warming up in the sauna and tents as the climate is freezing even in wetsuits. Fortunately there are four teams, so each team had a chance to warm up for a bit as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúConsidering matches can get pretty physical, players need to surface about every 30 seconds, for a breath of fresh air. Underwater ice Hockey periods last 10 minutes, and players are allowed 10-minute breaks to warm up‚Äù (hockeygods). ‚ÄúJust like ice hockey, they guide a puck into the opposing team‚Äôs goal, but diving underwater‚Äù (topendsports). There are four referees that are equipped with scuba gear that watch over the game, monitoring aggression levels and if the players are safe. The game is played like regular hockey except with fewer players. The game can get aggressive so players constantly have to surface for air. History Underwater ice hockey, not to be confused with underwater hockey, is an extreme sport that requires a considerable about of breath-holding skills, training, and patience in order to finish unscathed. The sport, UIC, originated in Austria in 2005 when an apnea diver, also known as breath-hold diving, skin diving, or freediving, named Christian Redl from Austria came up with the sport. The idea behind the sport was to take the enjoyment of hockey and turn it into an extreme sport that most divers would be fond of. The first world championship game took place in Weissensee, Austria, in 2007 where teams competed below 12 inches of ice in 35.6 ¬∞F or 2 ¬∞C water. To think about this critically, water freezes at 32 ¬∞F, or 2 ¬∞C. At these temperatures the ice will be thick enough to support the weight of spectators, equipment, and tents to keep people warm while also providing a safe under-ice rink for competitors. This means that finding a location for the matches proved difficult because officials and organizers are required to find an area of ice that was thick enough to hold the weight of all the spectators and safety officials for the free divers was needed. This 2007 match was the first recorded Underwater Ice Hockey World Championship game; however, this match was not the first ever match to be played. There were 2 matches before this, one in 2005 and one in 2006 where founder and organizer Christian Redl mobilized teams from around Europe to participate. The first match in 2005 was between Austria and Germany, which ended in an 8‚Äì8 tie. The second match in 2006 was between Austria and Slovakia, which ended in a 9‚Äì8 victory for Austria. Since then one other world championship game was held in 2013 also at Weissensee, Austria. Both of these matches were organized by founder Christian Redl in hopes to further the sport and over the last 12 years Redl has been successful in bringing this minor extreme sport to the world; however, due to the nature of the activity, it is still limited to extreme sport enthusiasts and apnea divers. Historically, the aspect of the game that has drawn a lot of apnea divers, especially apnea divers under ice, is the conditions in which the sport is played. It involves a lot of skills that come with free diving such as holding breath for a prolonged period of time, ability to disorient between up and down, and the sheer excitement of playing a high risk sport. Founder The sport was created by free diver Christian Redl with help from his friend and training partner Jaromir Foukal. Redl started his career in apnea diving after watching the movie The Big Blue, released in 1988, starring Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno, and Rosanna Arquette and directed by Luc Besson. This movie inspired Redl to take his love for diving to another level and in later that year, in 1996, he attended the first world apnea diving championships in Nice, France. In 1998 Redl formed his own team to take part in the second world championships in free diving. In 2003 Christian Redl set his first freediving world record, but this was not the end of his record-breaking career. Over the course of the next decade, Redl would go on to break multiple world records paving the way for others to follow in his footsteps and break his own records. Some of his world records include in line diving under ice with a distance of 200 meter, which he achieved in 2016, and in deep dives under ice with a depth of 61 meters with a weight lasting 1 minute and 51 seconds, which was achieved in 2011. After his experience in apnea diving Redl took his love for underwater sports to the next level by creating underwater ice hockey while also starting a school to teach people how to properly free dive. Organizer Christian Redl said: 'After diving a lot under ice, I wondered which sports had the potential to be played underneath ice and that's when the hockey game was born. The matches are very fast-paced, so the amount of time that divers are under the water is not that long - plus the water is extremely cold and you can get disorientated very easily.' Furthermore, Christian Redl has seen some success in television and film with being a stuntman in television broadcasts like Medicopter 117 and Coast Guard and appearing on the TV total late night show with Stefan Raab in 1999. Redl's activities in apnea diving and Underwater Ice Hockey has put him in a good position to be a stuntman. Another thing he has done in his film career was a little known music video called ‚ÄúOn My Way‚Äù by DJ Friction, which involves underwater ice diving. Also, in 2002 Redl went to Roatan Island to film an advertising film for Seimens medical, which also involves diving. On top of his film career, Redl has also written some book about his life, projects, and free diving. A couple of these books are called ‚ÄúFree diving - My World in Pictures‚Äù in 2006 and ‚ÄúMastering Boundaries through Mental Strength - Safe Diving‚Äù in 2010. One of the last achievements that stands Redl out from the crowd is that he does not confine himself to one location or hemisphere to do what he loves. He takes his love all over the world, from the North Pole: Greenland and Iceland to Antarctica where he continues to push the limits of the human body. All of these achievements are proof that anyone can take a childhood dream and make a successful career out of it. Risks While there have been no serious injuries documented in underwater ice hockey, the game does pose serious health risks. Medical teams are prepared on the surface to treat apnea divers the minute they surface in case of any serious problem or emergency. Ideally, in case of an emergency, the apnea diver would swim back to the entrance in the ice they came from, or the closest one available. If the diver cannot make it to the surface of the water in time, people equipped with oxygen tanks who supervise the game can make sure they make it above water. The rescue/safety squad from there can give medical attention to the player. Players of Underwater Ice Hockey are expected to understand the risks and know how to act accordingly to the given situation. Although there are expert divers and safety divers available to monitor the sport the entire match. Apnea divers are also drilled on safety procedures to minimize incidents. Since the game is slower in comparison to Underwater Hockey or Ice Hockey, there is a lower risk of puck and hockey stick related injuries. In Underwater Hockey there is a higher risk of breaking fingers due to a fast moving puck because players are lower to the ground and, therefore, physically closer to the puck. Underwater Ice Hockey, however, is played with Ice Hockey sticks and moves at a much slower pace than both games. Given the freezing temperatures, apnea divers of the sport are at high risk for: Hypothermia: While usual symptoms are obvious, such as shivering and fast breathing, support divers have to look out for less obvious signs such as dizziness and lack of coordination. Particular dangers of serious hypothermia must be watched out for the signs so they can make it in time in order to pull the player out of the water, as signs of severe hypothermia cannot be seen underwater. Slurred speech, confusion, no concern of the condition from the player, a weak pulse, and shallow breathing must be closely monitored and treated immediately. Asphyxiation: Underwater Ice Hockey is typically played without a breathing apparatuses. Only supervising divers wear oxygen tanks while playing; apnea divers wear diving masks for visibility. To prevent loss of consciousness due to lack of oxygen, players are switched every thirty to sixty seconds. Supervising safety divers can assist an apnea diver if they are unable to reach the surface before losing consciousness. So far the safety teams have been able to retrieve everyone. Frostbite: With the frozen temperatures, medical teams must be on alert for any signs of frostbite. While there have been no recorded incidents, risk of frostbite is very high. Most are not fully aware of the signs of frostbite as they could come off as typical discomforts. Frost-nip is the earliest of frostbite, where skin may get irritated and turn red. Other signs include itchiness or a burning feeling in the afflicted area. Affected skin may turn shiny or hard before going into the final stages of frostbite. Most are unaware of when they are at risk for frostbite because the affected area eventually loses feeling and people suffering from frostbite may feel warm even though their skin is cold to the touch. Medical teams must be wary of early signs of frostbite before the final stage where skin turns blue and nerve damage occurs. Treatment for frostbite is to immediately choose means that increase blood flow in those areas to minimize damage. Dead skin must be removed and the subject must be warmed. Pain medication is typically administered for nerve pain that can occur during the warming process. For minor frostbitten conditions, ibuprofen pain relievers may be used to reduce inflammation. Blood thinners may also be taken to help prevent damage to nerves. First response treatment of frostbite is to dry skin off and take the patient indoors to warm up. Most risks are preventable with the use of exposure suits. Wet-suits are typically pre-warmed with warm water in order to keep divers warm throughout a frozen competition. Three finger mitts are usually recommended. Smaller body parts such as fingers, toes, ears, and the nose are at the highest risk for frostbite and are the most vital to keep covered and warmed. Divers are also warned against heavy exercise after resurfacing from the ice. Decompression sickness has not been studied enough for extreme cold and any measures taken to prevent causing sickness is recommended. Sponsors Sponsors, such as Omega, sponsored the tournament in Austria at Weissensee in 2007; furthermore, any organization, company, or individual may sponsor the matches or a championship game. However, Unlike in Ice Hockey where sponsor banners are plastered on the walls of the rink, in Underwater Ice Hockey banners are attached under the ice on either side of the goal posts so that they may be seen while the game is recorded underwater. Spectators Because the game is not played in an arena where spectators can see apnea divers through a monitor, which is set on top of the ice, the spectators have to sit on top of the surface of the ice to watch the game being played underwater. This is done by a cameraman that follows the game underwater recording the action while apnea divers compete under the ice, making it possible for others to watch the game above the ice. Unlike most professional games, the monitor watched on is not a large screen that is visible to a large audience. Instead it is an average-sized monitor (about 27 inches diagonally) which is then protected from the elements with a tarp. Resurfaced players are also able to view the game on the monitor before switching out with their teammate. Also, while spectating a match it is advised to bring heavy winter clothes and multiple layers due to the freezing conditions and proper shoes to allow proper traction on top of the ice. The safety teams are there for the benefits of the spectators and players alike.

Life Philippot was born in Verzy. His studies of mathematics were interrupted by World War II, after which he decided instead to study music, first at the Conservatory of Reims, and then at the Paris Conservatoire (1945‚Äì48), where he studied harmony with Georges Dandelot. He also took private composition lessons from 1946 to 1950 with Ren√© Leibowitz, who introduced him to the music of the Second Viennese School. In 1949 he began a career at ORTF in a position as a music producer. In 1959 he became assistant to Pierre Schaeffer in the Groupe de Recherches Musicales, and later worked under Henri Barraud at France-Culture. From 1964 to 1972 he was in charge of music programs, then became a technical adviser to the Director General of Radio France and to the President of the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel. From 1969 to 1976 he also taught musicology and aesthetics at the Universities of Paris I and IV, and from 1970 was Professor of Composition at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique de Paris. In 1976 he moved to Brazil in order to create the department of music at the University of the State of S√£o Paulo, as well as to take up a position as Professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro . Upon returning to France in 1983, he resumed his occupation as technical advisor to INA (until 1989) and his professorship at the Paris Conservatory (until 1990). He died at the age of 71 in Vincennes. Music Philippot's compositions are almost exclusively instrumental and forego literary titles. From the outset his works were marked by the discipline of the twelve-tone technique. The austerity of his earlier compositions gave way after the 1950s to a more fluid style indebted in part to Debussy and in part to Schoenberg, particularly to his Variations, Op. 31 . His essentially contrapuntal textures adhere to the Schoenbergian principle of continuous variation. His honors include the Grand Prix national de la musique (1987), and the presidency of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros.

Function Nicastrin (abbreviated NCT) is a protein that is part of the gamma secretase protein complex, which is one of the proteases involved in processing amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the short Alzheimer's disease-associated peptide amyloid beta. The other proteins in the complex are PSEN1 (presenilin-1), which is the catalytically active component of the complex, APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1), and PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer 2). Nicastrin itself is not catalytically active, but instead promotes the maturation and proper trafficking of the other proteins in the complex, all of which undergo significant post-translational modification before becoming active in the cell. Nicastrin has also been identified as a regulator of neprilysin, an enzyme involved in the degradation of amyloid beta fragment. History The protein was named after the Italian village Nicastro, reflecting the fact that Alzheimer's disease was described in 1963 after studying descendants of an extended family originating in the village of Nicastro that had familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD).  Interactions  Nicastrin has been shown to interact with PSEN1 and PSEN2.

FGFR2 is a receptor for fibroblast growth factor. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, where amino acid sequence is highly conserved between members and throughout evolution. FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein consists of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. This particular family member is a high-affinity receptor for acidic, basic and/or keratinocyte growth factor, depending on the isoform.  Function  FGFR2 has important roles in embryonic development and tissue repair, especially bone and blood vessels. Like the other members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, these receptors signal by binding to their ligand and dimerisation (pairing of receptors), which causes the tyrosine kinase domains to initiate a cascade of intracellular signals. On a molecular level these signals mediate cell division, growth and differentiation.  Isoforms  FGFR2 has two naturally occurring isoforms, FGFR2IIIb and FGFR2IIIc, created by splicing of the third immunoglobulin-like domain. FGFR2IIIb is predominantly found in ectoderm derived tissues and endothelial organ lining, i.e. skin and internal organs. FGFR2IIIc is found in mesenchyme, which includes craniofacial bone and for this reason the mutations of this gene and isoform are associated with craniosynostosis.  Interactions  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 has been shown to interact with FGF1. The spliced isoforms, however differ in binding: * FGFR2IIIb binds to FGF-1, -3, -7, -10, -22 * FGFR2IIIc binds to FGF-1, -2, -4, -6, -8, -9, -17 and -18 These differences in binding are not surprising, since FGF ligand is known to bind to the second and third immunoglobulin domain of the receptor.  Clinical significance  Mutations (changes) are associated with numerous medical conditions that include abnormal bone development (e.g. craniosynostosis syndromes) and cancer. = Craniosynostosis syndromes = * Apert syndrome, the best-known type of acrocephalosyndactyly, characterized by abnormalities of the skull and face, such as a cleft palate, and of the hands and feet. * Antley-Bixler syndrome, characterized by trapezoidal, craniofacial and skeletal synostosis, plus camptodactyly), inherited as a recessive trait. * Pfeiffer syndrome, another type of acrocephalosyndactyly, includes broad thumbs and large toes, inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. * Crouzon syndrome, a craniofacial disorder with no hand or foot problems. and potential cleft palate, inherited as a dominant trait. * Jackson‚ÄìWeiss syndrome = Cancer = * Breast cancer, a mutation or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 2 of the FGFR2 gene is associated with a higher breast cancer risk; however the risk is only mildly increased from about 10% lifetime breast cancer risk in the average woman in the industrialized world, to 12-14% risk in carriers of the SNP. Missense mutations of FGFR2 have been found in endometrial cancer and melanoma. As a drug target AZD4547 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets FGFR1-3. It has demonstrated early evidence of efficacy in gastric cancer patients with high level FGFR2 amplification (Cancer Discovery 2016). FPA144 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to FGFR2b (a form of FGFR2) and preventing binding of certain FGFs. In 2014, a clinical trial began to treat gastric tumours that overexpress FGFR2b.Open-Label, Dose- Finding Study Evaluating Safety and PK of FPA144 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Another approach of FGFR2 targeting is use of allosteric inhibitors. Alofanib is a novel first-in-class allosteric small-molecular inhibitor of FGFR2. It binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and has an inhibitory effect on FGF2-induced phosphorylation. Principal benefits of allosteric inhibitors are high selectivity and low toxicity [Tsimafeyeu et al. ESMO Asia 2016]. A phase Ib clinical study protocol has been selected for ECCO-AACR-EORTC-ESMO Workshop on Methods in Clinical Cancer Research, better known as the ‚ÄòFlims‚Äô Workshop and clinical study of safety and preliminary efficacy of alofanib will be initiated at the beginning of 2017.  Mutations  FGFR2 mutations are associated with craniosynostosis syndromes, which are skull malformations caused by premature fusion of cranial sutures and other disease features according to the mutation itself. Analysis of chromosomal anomalies in patients led to the identification and confirmation of FGFR2 as a cleft lip and/or palate locus.Dixon MJ, Marazita ML, Beaty TH, Murray JC (2011). \\"Cleft lip and palate: understanding genetic and environmental influences\\". Nature Review Genetics (12): 167-178. On a molecular level, mutations that affect FGFR2IIIc are associated with marked changes in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Alteration in FGFR2 signalling is thought to underlie the craniosynostosis syndromes. To date, there are two mechanisms of altered FGFR2 signalling. The first is associated with constitutive activation of FGFR, where the FGFR2 receptor is always signalling, regardless of the amount of FGF ligand. This mechanism is found in patients with Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndrome. The second, which is associated with Apert syndrome is a loss of specificity of the FGFR2 isoform, resulting in the receptor binding to FGFs that it does not normally bind.

Prior to commencing at the ABC, Scott had previously held a senior role at Fairfax Media, responsible for the editorial content of the group's major newspapers including The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Sun-Herald and The Sunday Age. In June 2016, Scott was appointed Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education. Career and background Scott was born in 1962 in Los Angeles. He holds dual Australian and United States citizenship. Educated at Knox Grammar School, Scott worked for the New South Wales Greiner Liberal government, as chief of staff to the Education Minister, Virginia Chadwick, and as a senior adviser to education minister, Terry Metherell. In 2010 he was appointed to a second five-year term as the ABC's managing director. His time at the ABC was marked by extensive change, including the creation of ABC3, a digital TV channel for children, and the 24-hour news channel ABC News 24, as well as a major expansion into digital and on-line technology and an expansion of quality drama. Scott has been a strong defender of the value of social media in journalism and skeptical on the capacity of news organisations to charge for content they have previously provided free of charge. In September 2015, Scott announced he would be retiring as managing director and would be leaving the ABC. In December 2015, Michelle Guthrie was announced as Scott's replacement, and took over the role on 2 May 2016. In June 2016, Scott was appointed secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education. He is responsible for more than 2000 schools and around 49,000 teachers in the state.. Scott is the author of On Us, one of a series of short books produced by Melbourne University Press. He writes it may be time to Marie Kondo our digital lives. ‚ÄúSo much on my screens isn‚Äôt sparking much joy...there‚Äôs just too much and it doesn‚Äôt energise me...often, when we stare at our screens, we know we are not our best selves.‚Äù Cuts to the ABC In November 2014, as Managing Director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Scott announced that after 55 years, the Collinswood ABC television studios in South Australia would be closed. The announcement, following the 2011 demolition of the ABC TV facility in Perth and the 2012 closure of Tasmania's TV production unit also revealed the end of state based current affairs show 7.30 Report (state editions) - formally Stateline. Responding to 2014 Liberal Government budget cuts of $254 million over 5 years, Mark Scott axed ABC Radio National program Bush Telegraph and five regional radio outposts. In a senate inquiry about the cuts, Scott rejected claims that ABC management was using the Abbott Government's cuts as an excuse to pursue unpopular cost-saving initiatives. Awards and honours On 13 June 2011, Scott was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to media and communications, and to the community through advisory and governance roles with a range of social justice and educational bodies. Personal life Scott is married to Briony Scott, the principal of Wenona School, a private day and boarding school for girls. He is a grandson of Sir Walter Scott AC who was responsible for the introduction of decimal currency in Australia. His father Brian reviewed the NSW Department of Education in the 1980s.Scott of the ABC: a family affair of service Retrieved 14 April 2019.

The plot is a reference to current events at the time of the film's creation. The response of a Parti Qu√©b√©cois government under Ren√© L√©vesque to the recession of the early 1980s included harsh cutbacks to civil service pay which angered labour union members, a core part of the constituency of the PQ and sovereignty movement. In real life, the move would cost the party the next election. In the film, a band of government workers affected by budget cutbacks at the Ministry of Culture decide to make some fast bucks by making a blue movie in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. Their finished product is unexpectedly entered into competition at the Cannes Film Festival in order to showcase Qu√©bec's culture, shocking government officials. Pornobec scandal The \\"Pornobec\\" movie production depicted within this film is a reference to a then-current political event known as the \\"Pornobec scandal\\". In November 1981, members of Claude Charron's staff had been exposed by a television network for using the Legislative Assembly's video equipment to view and to duplicate pornographic films. The initial reports contained allegations that the Assembly's video equipment was used to make a pornographic video, presumably at the legislature building itself, causing the incident to be quickly ridiculed by the opposition Liberal Party of Quebec. One example of Liberal derision (reported in a November 1981 Montreal Gazette column) claimed the scandal \\"gives a whole new meaning to the term 'intra-provincial relations'\\". As the film was a parody of a current event, it was hastily written and produced for release on a tight schedule. The script was complete by December 11 with pre-production in December 1981 and the movie itself shot on 16 mm film between January 11 and February 2, 1982 on a modest $450 000 budget for theatrical release on May 7, 1982. To meet scheduling constraints, filming often took place both day and night. While the allegations of viewing and duplication of pornography on legislative assembly video equipment would stand, the claim that an explicit film had actually been produced by civil servants in the assembly building was ultimately debunked. The political damage, however, was already done, with \\"Pornobec\\" as the title of pornographic video having found its way into a real film. Initial reception by critics was harsh, largely because the film had been hastily constructed as a low-budget montage which interleaved mainstream cinema and low-brow humour with footage which (while moderate by modern standards) would have been considered crudely pornographic in the era this movie was made. The film, originally intended for audiences in Qu√©bec, was initially released to cinemas in French with no subtitles. A version was released on VHS and the movie was dubbed to English for national broadcast on various fledgling Canadian pay television premium channels which began operation in 1983. As the movie is topical to 1981 and therefore now out of print, there is no DVD release.

In June 2004, he was appointed a Director of the Queensland Investment Corporation. He retired as Chairman of ASX Limited on 24 September 2008. Political views =Conservatism= Newman helped establish the Centre for Independent Studies, a conservative Australian political think-tank. He was a member of the first CIS Board which also included Neville Kennard and Ross Graham-Taylor. Newman was associated with, and spoke at, a CIS event in December 2007 given in honour of conservative economist Milton Friedman. Newman is said to have been a close friend of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Interviewed in 2010 about their friendship by the Institute of Company Directors, Newman stated: \\"Much is made of my friendship with Howard, which is long standing. Little is made of my friendship with Bill Hayden, which is just as close and of longer standing. The truth is, I am not party political. I have voted on both sides of the fence, state and Federal, because I am driven not by labels, but by policies.\\" During Newman's tenure as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Rupert Murdoch delivered the 2008 Boyer Lectures, \\"A Golden Age of Freedom\\". On the subject of financial market regulation Newman is reported as having said: \\"Politicians are getting into regulation and Regulators want to get into business. Regulators should look at ways to ensure transparency, but should not end up killing the business.\\" =Climate change= In a speech to senior ABC staff on 10 March 2010 he said climate change was an example of \\"group-think\\". According to an ABC PM account of the speech: \\"Contrary views had not been tolerated, and those who expressed them had been labelled and mocked. Mr Newman has doubts about climate change himself and says he's waiting for proof either way.\\" Interviewed by Brendan Trembath he said: In answer to the question of whether he was a climate change denier he replied: In an opinion piece in September 2013 Newman said: \\"The CSIRO ‚Ä¶ and the weather bureau, continue to propagate the myth of climate change ‚Ä¶\\".Fran Kelly, Climate Commission axed ‚Äî Climate Change Authority next, Breakfast, ABC Radio National, 20 September 2013. More recently, he called climate change a delusion, stating that: \\"[The IPCC] progressively has applied mass psychology through a compliant media to spread the delusion that wicked Western industrialists are causing irreparable damage to the climate.\\" Newman wants the current Australian target for electricity generated by renewable sources dumped because he does not accept climate change science and says renewable energy is pushing up prices. In August 2014, Newman was widely criticised by leading scientists and newspaper journalists for stating that the earth is undergoing \\"cooling\\" rather than warming. Furthermore, he has suggested that climate change is propaganda aimed at bringing about a one world government controlled by the United Nations. =Wind farms= In January 2012 Newman had an article published in The Spectator in which he expressed views in opposition to wind energy. He wrote, \\"I am not a conspiracy theorist, but we have witnessed the birth of an extraordinary, universal and self- reinforcing movement among the political and executive arms of government, their academic consultants, the mainstream media and vested private sector interests (such as investment banks and the renewables industry), held together by the promise of unlimited government money. It may not be a conspiracy, but long-term, government-underwritten annuities have certainly created one gigantic and powerful oligopoly which must coerce taxpayers and penalise energy consumers to survive.\\" His article concluded, \\"But don‚Äôt expect help from academia, mainstream media or the public service. They are members of the same establishment and worship together at the altar of global warming. By ruthlessly perpetuating the illusion that wind farms can somehow save the planet, they keep the money flowing. All the while the poor become poorer, ever more dependent on welfare and colder in winter.\\" In July 2014, Newman was \\"kicked off\\" a wind farm committee after it was discovered he was attempting to restrict speakers from attending meetings.

Written in the autumn of 1920, it was not published in Kafka's lifetime. Overview The story of \\"Die Abweisung\\" involves the narration of a young boy living in a small town that is fairly distanced from its capital... The boy reflects on how the town's inhabitants humbly submit to orders issued by the capital and are led by the tax- collector, a man with the rank of colonel. The boy goes into great detail describing the soldiers that uphold the tax-collectors law, and how they appear inhuman to the public and seem unable to speak their language. In times of crisis, the town always appeals to the colonel for government aid, and if it is anything serious, it is always refused. The final paragraph describes the narrator's observation that it is due to this situation that '...young people roughly between seventeen and twenty,' begin to feel discontent and find revolutionary ideas because they are incapable of foreseeing the consequences. :/ References Further reading *Kafka, Franz.

Most numerous are the Old Charges or Constitutions. These documents outlined a \\"history\\" of masonry, tracing its origins to a biblical or classical root, followed by the regulations of the organisation, and the responsibilities of its different grades. More rare are old hand-written copies of ritual, affording a limited understanding of early masonic rites. All of those which pre-date the formation of Grand Lodges are found in Scotland and Ireland, and show such similarity that the Irish rituals are usually assumed to be of Scottish origin. The earliest Minutes of lodges formed before the first Grand Lodge are also located in Scotland. Early records of the first Grand Lodge in 1717 allow an elementary understanding of the immediate pre-Grand Lodge era and some insight into the personalities and events that shaped early-18th-century Freemasonry in Britain. Other early documentation is included in this article. The Kirkwall Scroll is a hand painted roll of linen, probably used as a floorcloth, now in the care of a lodge in Orkney. Its dating and the meaning of its symbols have generated considerable debate. Early operative documents and the later printed constitutions are briefly covered. Old Charges Introduction to Grand Lodge Manuscript no 1 The Old Charges of the masons' lodges were documents describing the duties of the members, to part of which (the charges) every mason had to swear on admission. For this reason, every lodge had a copy of its charges, occasionally written into the beginning of the minute book, but usually as a separate manuscript roll of parchment. With the coming of Grand Lodges, these were largely superseded by printed constitutions, but the Grand Lodge of All England at York, and the few lodges that remained independent in Scotland and Ireland, retained the hand-written charges as their authority to meet as a lodge. Woodford, Hughan, Speth and Gould, all founders of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and Dr Begemann, a German Freemason, produced much published work in the second half of the nineteenth century, collating, cataloguing, and classifying the available material. Since then, aside from the occasional rediscovery of another old document, little has been done to update the field. Andrew Prescott, The Old Charges Revisited, from Transactions of the Lodge of Research No. 2429 (Leicester), 2006, Pietre-Stones Masonic Papers, retrieved 21 April 2013 The oldest, the Regius poem, is unique in being set in verse. The rest, of which over a hundred survive, usually have a three part construction. They start with a prayer, invocation of God, or a general declaration, followed by a description of the Seven Liberal Arts (logic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), extolling Geometry above the others. There follows a history of the craft, and how it came to the British Isles, usually culminating in a general assembly of masons during the reign of King Athelstan. The last part consists of the charges or regulations of the lodge, and the craft of masonry in general, which the members are bound to maintain.A. F. A. Woodford, preface to William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872 =Evolution of the York Legend= The earliest masonic documents are those of their early employers, the church and the state. The first claimed by modern Freemasons as the lineal ancestors of their own Charges relate to the self-organisation of masons as a fraternity with mutual responsibilities. From the reign of Henry VI to the Elizabethan period, that is from about 1425 to 1550, surviving documents show the evolution of a legend of masonry, starting before the flood, and culminating in the re-establishment of the craft of masonry in York during the reign of King Athelstan. Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem Halliwell Manuscript The Halliwell Manuscript, also known as the Regius Poem, is the earliest of the Old Charges. It consists of 64 vellum pages of Middle English written in rhyming couplets. In this, it differs from the prose of all the later charges. The poem begins by describing how Euclid \\"counterfeited geometry\\" and called it masonry, for the employment of the children of the nobility in Ancient Egypt. It then recounts the spread of the art of geometry in \\"divers lands.\\" The document relates how the craft of masonry was brought to England during the reign of King Athelstan (924‚Äì939). It tells how all the masons of the land came to the King for direction as to their own good governance, and how Athelstan, together with the nobility and landed gentry, forged the fifteen articles and fifteen points for their rule. This is followed by fifteen articles for the master concerning both moral behaviour (do not harbour thieves, do not take bribes, attend church regularly, etc.) and the operation of work on a building site (do not make your masons labour at night, teach apprentices properly, do not take on jobs that you cannot do, etc.). There are then fifteen points for craftsmen which follow a similar pattern. Warnings of punishment for those breaking the ordinances are followed by provision for annual assemblies. There follows the legend of the Four Crowned Martyrs, a series of moral aphorisms, and finally a blessing.Pietre-Stones, The Regius Poem, Parallel text with introduction, retrieved 27 July 2012 \\"Fyftene artyculus √æey √æer sow»ùton, and fyftene poyntys √æer √æey wro»ùton.\\" (Fifteen articles they there sought and fifteen points there they wrought.) ‚ÄîRegius MS, ca. 1425‚Äì50. The origins of the Regius are obscure. The manuscript was recorded in various personal inventories as it changed hands until it came into possession of the Royal Library, which was donated to the British Museum in 1757 by King George II to form the nucleus of the present British Library.F. L. Quick, A Fantasy of the Regius Poem's Origin, Transactions of A. Douglas Smith, Jr. Lodge of Research #1949, Vol 3 (1993‚Äì1997), pp 11‚Äì15 It came to the attention of Freemasonry much later, this oversight being mainly due to the librarian David Casley, who described it as \\"a Poem of Moral Duties\\" when he catalogued it in 1734. It was in the 1838‚Äì39 session of the Royal Society that James Halliwell, who was not a Freemason, delivered a paper on \\"The early History of Freemasonry in England\\", based on the Regius, which was published in 1840. The manuscript was dated to 1390, and supported by such authorities as Woodford and Hughan; the dating of Edward Augustus Bond, the curator of manuscripts at the British Museum, to fifty years later was largely sidelined. Hughan also mentions that it was probably written by a priest.William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872, pp 2-3 Modern analysis has confirmed Bond's dating to the second quarter of the fifteenth century, and placed its composition in Shropshire. This dating leads to the hypothesis that the document's composition, and especially its narrative of a royal authority for annual assemblies, was intended as a counterblast to the statute of 1425 banning such meetings. Matthew Cooke Manuscript The Matthew Cooke Manuscript is the second oldest of the Old Charges or Gothic Constitutions of Freemasonry, and the oldest known set of charges to be written in prose. It contains some repetition, but compared to the Regius there is also much new material, much of which is repeated in later constitutions. After an opening thanksgiving prayer, the text enumerates the Seven Liberal Arts, giving precedence to geometry, which it equates with masonry. There follows the tale of the children of Lamech, expanded from the Book of Genesis. Jabal discovered geometry, and became Cain's Master Mason. Jubal discovered music, Tubal Cain discovered metallurgy and the art of the smith, while Lamech's daughter Naamah invented weaving. Discovering that the earth would be destroyed either by fire or by flood, they inscribed all their knowledge on two pillars of stone, one that would be impervious to fire, and one that would not sink. Generations after the flood both pillars were discovered, one by Pythagoras, the other by the philosopher Hermes. The seven sciences were then passed down through Nimrod, the architect of the Tower of Babel, to Abraham, who taught them to the Egyptians, including Euclid, who in turn taught masonry to the children of the nobility as an instructive discipline. The craft is then taught to the children of Israel, and from the Temple of Solomon finds its way to France, and thence to Saint Alban's England. Athelstan now became one of a line of kings actively supporting masonry. His youngest son, unnamed here, is introduced for the first time as leader and mentor of masons. There follow nine articles and nine points, and the document finishes in a similar manner to the Regius. Unlike the majority of the old constitutions, which are written on rolls, the Cooke manuscript is written on sheets of vellum, four and three- eighth inches high and three and three eighth inches broad (112mm x 86mm) bound into a book, still retaining its original oak covers. The manuscript was published by R. Spencer, London, in 1861 when it was edited by Mr. Matthew Cooke ‚Äî hence the name. In the British Museum's catalogue it is listed as \\"Additional M.S. 23,198\\", and is now dated to 1450 or thereabouts, although errors in Cooke's transcription caused it originally to be dated to after 1482. In line 140, And in policronico a cronycle p'yned, Cooke translated the last word as \\"printed\\", causing Hughan to give the earliest date as Caxton's Polychronicon of 1482. Later retranslation as \\"proved\\" justified the earlier dating. Obvious scribal errors indicate that the document is a copy, and repetition of part of the stories of Euclid and Athelstan seems to indicate two sources. Speth postulated, in 1890, that these sources were much older than the manuscript, a view that remained unchallenged for over a century.George William Speth, Commentary to Cooke Manuscript, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, vol II, part I.2 Recent analysis of the Middle English of the document date it to the same period as the writing, around 1450, implying that the source or sources from which it was copied were almost contemporary with the Cooke, and contemporary with, or only slightly later than the Regius poem. It was probably composed in the West Midlands, near to the origin of the Regius in Shropshire. The historian Andrew Prescott sees both the Regius and Cooke manuscripts as part of the struggle of mediaeval masons to determine their own pay, particularly after the statute of 1425 banning assemblies of masons. Masons sought to show that their assemblies had royal approval, and added the detail that the King's son had become a mason himself. At line 603 we find For of specculatyfe he was a master and he lovyd well masonry and masons. And he bicome a mason hym selfe. James Anderson had access to the Cooke manuscript when he produced his 1723 Constitutions. He quotes the final sixty lines in a footnote to his description of the York assembly. The Woodford manuscript, which is a copy of the Cooke, has a note explaining that it was made in 1728 by the Grand Secretary of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, William Reid, for William Cowper, Clerk of the Parliaments, who had also been Grand Secretary. Dowland Manuscript The Dowland Manuscript was first printed in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1815. The contributor, James Dowland, wrote \\"For the gratification of your readers, I send you a curious address respecting Freemasonry which not long since came into my possession. It is written on a long roll of parchment, in a very clear hand apparently in the 17th century, and probably was copied from a MS. of earlier date.\\" This earlier date is still estimated to be around 1550, making the Dowland the second oldest prose constitutions known. The wages mentioned in the text agree with other manuscripts known to originate in the second half of the sixteenth century. Unfortunately, the original is now lost.William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872, p 22 The history is similar to that of the Cooke manuscript. In this case we are told that the first charges proceeded from Euclid's instruction of the sons of the Egyptian Lords. The Master Mason at the construction of the Temple of Solomon is a son of King Hiram of Tyre called Avnon. Again masonry diffuses from the Temple and enters Saint Alban's England from France. The science suffers in the wars following Alban's death, but is restored under Athelstan. His son, now named as Edwinne, is the expert geometrician who obtains his father's charter for an annual assembly of masons, that should be \\"renewed from Kinge to Kinge\\". The assembly under Edwin is for the first time identified as having occurred at York. The articles and points are now replaced with a series of charges, in the form of an oath.William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872, p 25-30 The emergence of York, and the appearance of the more modern form of the charges after a century of silence in the documentary record, have been linked by Prescott to government policy in from the second half of the sixteenth century, which allowed wage increases for London masons, while attempting rigid wage control in the North of England. Grand Lodge No 1 This manuscript inexplicably appears in Hughan's Old Charges with a date of 1632, which Speth, the next editor, attributed to the terrible handwriting of Rev. Woodford, Hughan's collaborator. It is the first of the charges to bear a date, which is just discernible as 1583, on 25 December. The document is in the form of a roll of parchment nine feet long and five inches wide, being made up of four pieces pasted at the ends. The United Grand Lodge of England acquired it in 1839 for twenty-five pounds from a Miss Sidall, the great-granddaughter of Thomas Dunckerley's second wife. The handwriting is compatible with the date of 1583, although the language is older, leading Henry Jenner to propose that it was copied from an original up to a century older. The contents of Grand Lodge 1 tell the same tale as the Dowland manuscript, with only minor changes. Again, the charges take the form of an oath on a sacred book.G. W. Speth, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, vol IV, part 1.2 Within this manuscript and the Dowland we find a curious mason called Naymus Grecus (Dowland has Maymus or Mamus Grecus), who had been at the building of Solomon's Temple, and who taught masonry to Charles Martel before he became King of France, thus bringing masonry to Europe. This obvious absurdity has been interpreted by Neville Barker Cryer as a coded reference to Alcuin of York, possibly from a misunderstanding of one of his poems. In Carmen XXVI is the line, \\"Et Nemias Greco infundat sua poculo Baccho\\", expressing the wish that Nemias should fill Alcuin's cup with Greek wine. Nemias, or Nehemias, was Alcuin's code name for Eberhard, Charlemagne's cupbearer. Cryer presents the possibility that a misunderstanding allowed Nemias Greco to be assumed to refer to the Yorkshire saint and scholar.Revd Neville Barker Cryer, York Mysteries Revealed, Lewis Masonic, 2006, pp14-16 =Later manuscripts= At this point, the old charges had attained a standard form. What became known as the York Legend had emerged in a form that would survive into Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry, a work of 1772 which was still being reprinted in the mid nineteenth century. The requirement for every new admission to be sworn to the Old Charges on the bible now meant that every lodge should have its own manuscript charges, and over a hundred survive from the seventeenth century until the period in the eighteenth when their use died out. Describing them all is beyond the scope of a single article, and unnecessary since differences are only in details, such as occasional clumsy attempts to deal with the absence of Edwin, Athelstan's son, from any historical record. Differences also occur in the specifics of the charges and the manner of taking the oath. A very few manuscripts have a separate Apprentice Charge. Families of documents have been identified, and two systems of classification exist.G. W. Speth, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, vol I, part 3, p xi A few documents deserve special attention. Lansdowne This document was purchased by the British Government as part of a collection amassed by William Petty, Marquis of Lansdowne. It was bundled with papers from William Cecil, a prominent Elizabethan politician who died in 1598, and was assumed to belong to the same period. Analysis of the handwriting places it a hundred years later, and later papers have been found in Cecil's bundle. Lansdowne is still frequently cited as an Elizabethan document. York No 4 The group of masons calling themselves the Grand Lodge of All England meeting since Time Immemorial in the City of York continued to issue written constitutions to lodges, as their authority to meet, until the last quarter of the eighteenth century.Rev. Neville Barker Cryer, The Grand Lodge of All England at York Ritual, Cornerstone Society. Surviving are York manuscripts numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5 (3 missing), the Hope manuscript, and the Scarborough manuscript, which turned up in Canada. Of these, York 4 has been the subject of controversy since it was first described in print. It is dated 1693, and was the first of the Old Charges discovered to have a separate Apprentice Charge, or a set of oaths specially for apprentices. The controversy was caused by the short paragraph describing how the oath was to be taken. \\"The one of the elders takeing the Booke / and that hee or shee that is to be made mason / shall lay their hands thereon / and the charge shall bee given\\". Woodford and Hughan had no particular problem with this reading, believing it to be a copy of a much older document, and realising that women were admitted to the guilds of their deceased menfolk if they were in a position to carry on their trade. Other writers, starting with Hughan's contemporary David Murray Lyon, the Grand Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, insisted that the \\"shee\\" must be a scribal error for they, or a mistranslation of the Latin illi (they). Hughan failed to point out that the four lines in question are written in a competent hand in letters twice the size of the surrounding text, but riposted to Lyon that the Apprentice charge in York No 4, Harleian MS 1942, and the Hope manuscript outline the apprentice's duties to his master or Dame. Modern opinion seems resigned to letting York Manuscript number 4 remain a paradox.Karen Kidd, Haunted Chambers: the Lives of Early Women Freemasons, Cornerstone, 2009, pp 7-10William James Hughan, The Old Charges of British Freemasons, London, 1872, pp 15-16 Melrose No 2 The Lodge of Melrose successfully ignored the Grand Lodge of Scotland for a century and a half, finally joining in 1891 as the Lodge Of Melrose St. John No 1 bis. The original Melrose constitutions are lost, but a copy was made in 1674 by Andro Mein (Andrew Main). He appended a copy of a certificate issued to an apprentice by \\"his master frie Mason, in the Year of our Lord 1581, and in the raign of our Soveraign Lady Elizabeth the (22) year\\". Two other Scottish constitutions, the Kilwinning and the Aberdeen, declare that masons are liegemen of the King of England. This suggests an English origin of at least some of the Scottish Old Charges.William James Hughan, introduction to James Smith, History of the Old Lodge of Dumfries, Maxwell, 1892 =Printed constitutions= As the first Grand Lodge gathered momentum the Rev. James Anderson was commissioned to digest the \\"gothic constitutions\\" into a more palatable form. The result, in 1723, was the first printed constitutions. While manuscript constitutions continued to be used in unaffiliated lodges, their condensation into print saw them die out by the end of the century. Anderson's introduction advertised a history of Freemasonry from the beginning of the world.Anderson's Constitutions Franklin's reprint, retrieved 22 June 2012 The York legend was therefore still employed, and persisted through reprints, pocket editions, and Preston's Illustrations of Freemasonry. Anderson's regulations, the second part of the book, followed on a set of charges devised by George Payne during his second term as Grand Master. Both charges and regulations were geared to the needs of a Grand Lodge, necessarily moving away from the simplicity of the originals. When a new Grand Lodge sprang up to carry the older rite, which they saw as abandoned by the \\"Moderns\\", their constitutions had a different approach to history. Ahiman Rezon parodied the old history of the craft, and Anderson's research. The charges and regulations of the Antients were derived from Anderson by way of Pratt's Irish Constitutions.Ray Sheppard, Ahiman Rezon, Association of Atholl Lodges , retrieved 28 April 2013 Almost inevitably, the legendary history disappeared after the union of the two Grand Lodges in 1813.UGLE - Book of Constitutions retrieved 28 April 2013 Rituals While over 100 manuscript 'constitutions' exist, documents detailing actual ritual are much rarer. The earliest, dating from 1696, is the Scottish Edinburgh Register House manuscript [MS], which gives a catechism and a certain amount of ritual of the Entered Apprentice and a Fellow Craft ceremonies. It was named after the building in which it was discovered, which houses the Scottish National Archives. The Trinity College Manuscript, discovered in Dublin, Ireland, but which is clearly of Scottish origin, has been dated to c.1710, is substantially the same in content. The recently discovered Airlie MS dated 1705 is therefore the second oldest known Scottish stonemasons' rituals. Although referred to as rituals these manuscripts are also aide memoires, or 'prompt sheets'. They therefore have three functions but for ease of reference they are commonly described as 'rituals'. The significance of these three rituals lie in the fact that they are 1) of Scottish origin 2) are based on the ceremonies used by Scottish stonemasons and 3) that they pre-date the existence of any Grand Lodge (essentially a 'Head Office'). Collectively they are known as the 'Scottish School'. =Edinburgh Register House MS= Presumed to be from a lodge of operative masons, this document contains many features of speculative ritual. Hailed as the world's oldest masonic ritual, the Edinburgh Register House manuscript of 1696 starts with a catechism for proving a person who has the word is really a mason. Among other things, the person seeking entry is expected to name their lodge as Kilwinning, attributing the origin to Lodge Mother Kilwinning in Ayrshire. The first lodge is ascribed to the porchway of King Solomon's Temple, and the form of the lodge outlined in a question and answer session, the form of the answers often being highly allegorical. A fellow craft is further expected to know and explain a masonic embrace called the five points of fellowship. The second half of the document describes all or part of an initiation ritual as the \\"form of giveing the mason word\\".Robert L. D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemasons Code, Rider 2009, pp 55-70 =Airlie MS= The Airlie MS was discovered in 2000 by Dr Helen Dingwall whilst undertaking unrelated research in Edinburgh Register House (which gave its name to the MS ritual referred to above) in the National Archives of Scotland. Of all the MSS of the Scottish School only the origins of the Airlie MS (1705) are known with certainty. It is named after the family who owned it - the Earls of Airlie. Because the ownership and therefore the location of the MS is known it is of immense importance in understanding the origins of Freemasonry before the Grand Lodge era (from 1717). The Airlie MS has been analysed and discussed in considerable detail in Ars Quatuor Coronatorum (AQC), Vol.117. =Trinity College, Dublin= Other manuscripts from Scotland and Ireland give early ritual that largely confirm the text of the Edinburgh Register House manuscript. They differ mainly in having the giving of the Mason Word as the first part of the text, followed by the catechism of the first and second degrees in the form of questions and answers. These include the Chetwode Crawley, the Kevan, and the Trinity College manuscripts. In the Trinity college text the Mason Word is actually written down as \\"Matchpin\\", and appears to be part of an early Master Mason's degree.The Kevan Manuscript, The Masonic Trowel, retrieved 15 April 2013Harry Carr, 600 years of Craft Ritual, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum vol 81, 1961, Freemason Information, retrieved 15 April 2013 The Chetwode Crawley MS, although discovered in Dublin, Ireland, refers in its catechism to the Lodge of Kilwinning, clearly demonstrating that it is of Scottish origin and is therefore part of the Scottish School referred to above.Stevenson, David Prof. The Origins of Freemasonry - Scotland's Century 1590 - 1710, page 137W. J. Hughan, The Chetwode Crawlwy MS, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol XVII, 1904, pp91-92 =The Haughfoot fragment= Haughfoot was a hamlet, consisting mainly of a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders near the village of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this lodge lies in the fact that none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The minute book of the lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.Haughfoot Lodge, History of the Lodge at Haughfoot, accessed 1 August 2014 =Graham Manuscript= The Graham Manuscript, of about 1725, gives a version of the third degree legend at variance with that now transmitted to master masons, involving Noah instead of Hiram Abiff. The Graham Manuscript appears to have been written in 1726, and obvious scribal errors within it indicate that it was copied from another document. It turned up in Yorkshire during the 1930s, but its exact origin is unknown, Lancashire, Northumberland, and South Scotland all being suggested. The document is headed The whole Institution of free Masonry opened and proved by the best of tradition and still some reference to scripture, There follows an examination, in the form of the sort of question and answer catechism seen in the earlier rituals. In what appears to be the examination of a Master Mason, the responder relates what modern masons would recognise as that part of the legend of Hiram Abiff dealing with the recovery of his body, but in this instance the body is that of Noah, disinterred by his three sons in the hope of learning some secret, and the mason's word is cryptically derived from his rotting body. Hiram Abiff is mentioned, but only as Solomon's master craftsman, inspired by Bezalel, who performed the same function for Moses. The tradition of deriving freemasonry from Noah seems to be shared with Anderson (see Printed Constitutions above). Anderson also attributed primitive freemasonry to Noah in his 1738 constitutions.H. Poole, The Graham Manuscript, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 50, 1936, pp 5-17 Minutes The second Schaw Statutes of December 1599 having made it compulsory for Scottish lodges to have a secretary, early documentation there is rich in comparison with England, where actual minutes start in 1712 in York, and 1723 in London. Records for the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1 extend back to the sixteenth century. Minutes from the Premier Grand Lodge of England, the Antient Grand Lodge of England, and the Grand Lodge of All England meeting at York trace the organisational development and rivalries within eighteenth century English Freemasonry. =Aitchison's Haven= The oldest minute book discovered is that of Aitchison's Haven, a location just outside Musselburgh, in East Lothian. The first entry records Robert Widderspone being made Fellow of Craft on 9 January 1598.Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon R. E. Wallace-James, The Book of the Lodge of Aitchison's Haven, 1598-1764The Minute Books of this Lodge are now the property of the Grand Lodge of Scotland =Mary's Chapel= The records of the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No.1 extend back to 1598, making them an important historical source as the longest continuous masonic record. David Murray Lyon's history of the lodge, published in 1873, mined the records of Edinburgh's oldest lodge, and produced a history of Scottish Freemasonry. The first entry, on 28 December 1598, is a copy of the first Schaw statutes. The next year, on the last day of July, the first proper minute records disciplinary proceedings against a member who employed a cowan, or unqualified mason. The first entries are terse and not always helpful, expanding as successive secretaries became more conscientious. The records trace the development of the lodge from an operative to a speculative society.David Murray Lyon, History of the Lodge of Edinburgh, Blackwell, 1873 =York= The minutes of the old lodge at York, which later called itself the Grand Lodge of All England, give a glimpse of masonry outside the Grand Lodges of the period. The minutes are erratic, with spaces of some years between some entries. It is often impossible to tell if the minutes are lost, were never taken, or the lodge did not meet at all. They do, however, contain the full text of a speech by the antiquary Francis Drake in 1726, in which he discusses the contemplation of geometry, and the instructive lectures which ought to be occurring in lodges. He used the York legend to claim precedence of his own lodge over all others in England, and being a more careful historian than the compilers of the Old Charges, Edwin the son of Athelstan became Edwin of Northumbria, adding three centuries to his lodge's pedigree. Later minutes show the lodge adding ritual, and developing a five degree system from a single ceremony where a candidate was admitted and made a Fellow Craft in one evening. The York account of the split between the Premier Grand Lodge of England and the Lodge of Antiquity provides a balance to the charged prose of William Preston. The minutes cease for the final time in 1792.J. G. Findel, History of Freemasonry, Tr. from second German edition, Asher & Co, London, 1866, pp168-180 =London Grand Lodges= Minutes of both of the Grand Lodges which finally formed the United Grand Lodge of England are preserved in their archives. Plans by Quatuor Coronati Lodge to publish them all were interrupted by the First World War, and only one volume was published, covering the minutes of the Premier Grand Lodge of England from their first minutes in 1723 to 1739. The first of five volumes of Grand Lodge minutes contained three lists of subscribing lodges and their members, dating from 1723, 1725, and 1730. The lodges are first numbered in John Pine's engraved list of 1729. All three manuscript lists have had lodges added after their compilation, but in spite of this they still trace the development of the first Grand Lodge during a critical period in its development, as it moved from being an association of London lodges to a national institution. No further lists were included in the minutes. They start on 24 June 1723 with the approval of Anderson's constitutions, and the resolution that no alteration or innovation in the \\"Body of Masonry\\" could occur without the approval of Grand Lodge. The Earl of Dalkeith was then elected as the next Grand Master, but his chosen deputy, John Theophilus Desaguliers, was only approved by 43 votes to 42. After dinner the outgoing Grand Master, the Duke of Wharton, asked for a recount. This being refused, he walked out. Many such human touches are revealed in the minutes, together with the beginnings of masonic charities and discipline of masons and lodges. There are no minutes for the year 1813, and only rough notes from the Antients, leaving a gap in the run-up to union that must be spanned from other sources.Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, Vol 10, 1913 The first meetings of the Antients, as they came to be known, are also missing, but these span only a few months instead of the six years of silence from the older institution. On 5 February 1752 Laurence Dermott became Grand Secretary, and proper minutes ensued. Although these have still to be published, they have been extensively mined by masonic writers, particularly Bywater's biography of Dermott, which draws verbatim from the minutes. Dermott's style is quirky, occasionally obtuse, and often full of dry humour. Discipline is a frequent subject, collecting dues from delinquent lodges, and the \\"leg of mutton\\" masons who admitted men to the Holy Royal Arch for the price of such a meal without the least idea what the actual ritual was, and claimed to teach a masonic technique for becoming invisible. The conflict between the two Grand Lodges, while obvious from other contemporary sources, is largely absent from both sets of minutes.Witham Matthew Bywater, Notes on Laurence Dermott G.S. and his Work, London, 1884 Other Masonic documents = Fabric Rolls of York Minster = Records of the operative lodge at York Minster are included in the rolls relating to the 'fabric' (the building material) of the construction, starting with an undated entry from about 1350‚Äì1360, and ending in 1639. Written mainly in Latin until the Reformation, they comprise accounts, letters, and other documents relating to the building and maintenance of the church.James Raine (ed), The Fabric Rolls of York Minster, Surtees Society, 1859 = Statutes of Ratisbon = The Statutes de Ratisbon were first formulated on 25 April 1459 as the rules of the German stonemasons, when the masters of the operative lodges met at Ratisbon (now Regensburg). They elected the master of works of Strasbourg Cathedral as their perpetual presiding officer.Les Statuts de Ratisbonne. French translation of 1459 document retrieved 24 June 2012 Strasbourg was already recognised as the Haupth√ºtte, or Grand Lodge of German masons. The General Assembly was held again in 1464 and 1469, and the statutes and society were approved by the Emperor Maximilian in 1498. The final form of the statutes regulated the activity of master masons (Meister), with an appendix of rules for companions or fellows (Gesellen), and apprentices (Diener).Edition of Statutes of Ratisbon with appendices (French Translation) retrieved 23 June 2012 These regulations were used for over a century as the Strasbourg lodge operated as a court for the settlement of building disputes. This ended in abuse of power, and the Magistrates removed the privilege in 1620. Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681, and its rule over German operative lodges interdicted at the beginning of the 18th century. While there seems little likelihood that the code affected the emergence of German speculative lodges in the 18th century, they may have had some influence on a few of the English \\"charges\\".Albert Gallatin Mackey, History of Freemasonry, The Masonic History Company, 1906, vol 3, p 720-721 Other German ordinances are found in the Cologne records (1396-1800), the Torgau ordinances of 1462, and the Strasbourg Brother-book of 1563. The Cologne guild comprised both stonemasons and carpenters, and was repeatedly referred to as the Fraternity of St. John the Baptist.G. W. Speth, Quatuor Coronati Antigrapha, vol I, part 3, p xiii =Schaw Statutes= William Schaw was master of works to King James VI of Scotland, and was also the general warden of all the lodges of Scottish stonemasons. This meant he was in charge of the erection, repair and maintenance of all government buildings, and also the running of what was already a fraternity of masons, who ensured that all building work was undertaken by properly qualified persons, and also provided for their own sick and the widows of their members. Schaw formalised the working of the lodges in two sets of statutes, set down on 28 December 1598 and 1599. Many now see these as the beginnings of modern Freemasonry. Robert Cooper, the archivist and writer, goes so far as to call Schaw the Father of Freemasonry.Robert L. D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemason's Code, Rider, 2009, pp 18-27 & 207-214 The Schaw Statutes were issued from Edinburgh, where Schaw seems to have met with representatives of lodges from central and eastern Scotland to formulate these regulatory principles. The 1598 Statute enjoined masons to be true to one another, and live charitably together as becomes sworn brothers and companions of the craft. This shows that there was already an oath involved, and invoked the legal definition of a brother as one to whom another was bound by oath. There followed directives as to the regulation of the craft, and provisions for the masters of every lodge to elect a warden to have charge of the lodge every year, and that the choice be approved by the Warden General. An apprentice had to serve seven years before being received into a lodge, and a further seven before becoming a fellow in craft, unless by consent of the masters, deacons and wardens, and after examination. The term Entered Apprentice is used for an apprentice who has been admitted to the lodge. The document was circulated to every lodge in Scotland, which caused some degree of upset in Kilwinning. The lodge in Kilwinning claimed to be the oldest lodge in Scotland, and was insulted not to have been represented. They sent Archibald Barclay to a further meeting in 1599, from which issued the second Statute, again on 28 December. In an attempt to paper over the crack created by the first meeting, Edinburgh was declared the first and principle lodge, Kilwinning the second and head lodge. Stirling came third. Kilwinning was given charge of the West of Scotland, and charged to examine their masons in \\"the art of memory\\", with fines prescribed for failure. What is being remembered is unspecified, but evidently known to all the masons present. Schaw also insisted that each lodge employ a notary, which resulted in the Scottish lodges starting to keep minutes. The document ends by thanking Archibald Barclay, and looking forward to obtaining the King's warrant for the statutes. Kilwinning, far from being appeased, took no further part in the dealings of Schaw's lodges. =Kirkwall Scroll= The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which contains many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It hangs on the west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18 ft 6in long and 5 ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by a different set of symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.J. B. Craven, Kirkwall Kilwinning Lodge No 38(2) and its Remarkable Scroll, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, vol 10, 1897, pp79-81 (with notes by G. W. Speth) Lodge minutes of 27 December 1785 state; - \\"Bro.

Andrew Sinclair, a leading proponent of Freemasonry's descent from the Knights Templar, hailed it as a great mediaeval treasure, comparable with the Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral.A. Sinclair, The Secret Scroll, Sinclair- Stevenson, 2000 His claim arises from what opponents describe as an optimistic reading of radiocarbon dating, and creative interpretation of the panels. The Tabernacle is claimed to be King Solomon's Temple, with the tents removed in Sinclair's reproduction. Sinclair and his supporters also have trouble with lodge 128 of the Antients.

It is the oldest international relations graduate program in the United States. History CIR was founded in 1928 by a group of University of Chicago professors, including Hans Morgenthau and Quincy Wright. While CIR is known worldwide for one of the most distinguished programs in the study of international security, CIR faculty and students are also well known for academic work in international political economy, international institutions, globalization, international law, human rights, comparative politics, development and regional studies. Admissions Applicants from CIR come from around the world; about 25 percent of applications and accepted students are from outside the United States. Every year, CIR receives over 300 applicants for roughly 40-50 spots. In the admissions process, applicants are required to provide the standard CIR application, letters of recommendations, a personal statement, a 10-20 page writing sample, and their GRE scores. International applicants from non-English speaking countries also have to provide TOEFL or IELTS scores as all coursework is conducted in American English. Applicants typically have a GPA of 3.5 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher and must have a BA degree (or similar) from an accredited university. In addition to an applicant's academic background, relevant work experience and fit with the program are also taken into account. Applications are evaluated by an admissions committee which includes CIR preceptors and CIR faculty. The program The combination of intellectual diversity and analytical strength provide a stimulating environment for CIR students. The small size and intellectual rigor of the program ensure that students with differing perspectives will challenge each other and come to a more sophisticated understanding of the complicated interaction between the realities of international politics and international economics. The program provides excellent preparation for students, whether they choose to continue their graduate studies in leading doctoral programs, or decide to work in government or the private sector. Each CIR graduate student is assigned a preceptor based on their own disciplinary and research interests in international relations, such as war, regional studies, or international economics. =Coursework= Students take three credited courses per quarter, which constitutes a full- load at the University of Chicago. Of the nine total courses, two are required \\"Core\\" classes, including a course on international security and another on international political economy. CIR students also take three mandatory non- credit classes, including two MA thesis workshops in the Fall and Winter quarters and a class taught by the CIR preceptors called \\"Perspectives on International Relations\\" in the Fall quarter. With the remaining seven credited courses, students are allowed to take any graduate-level course, with the following three restrictions: (1) seven of the nine courses must be on the CIR-approved course list, (2) at least three courses must be within the Division of Social Sciences, and (3) three courses must be taken in two of the four possible fields of study. Fields of study * International Security, Conflict Studies, and Contentious Politics * International Political Economy and Development * Comparative Studies in Political Institutions and Identity * Human Rights, Environment, and International Law * Research Methods in the Social Sciences https://cir.uchicago.edu/ =MA thesis= CIR students must also complete a thesis under the guidance of their preceptor and a faculty adviser of their choosing. Students will be aided by the two required MA thesis workshop classes in the Fall and Winter quarters. Each thesis is expected to be between 35-45 pages in length and below 14,000 words. =MA with specialization= CIR students who wish to pursue a particular research topic in greater depth than is possible in one year may pursue the second-year specialization program. Specialization is best designed for students who plan to continue with graduate studies in a Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago or elsewhere. Specialization is competitive; on average 10-12 students apply, and 2-4 are accepted. Joint degrees CIR offers joint degrees with different programs and schools at the University of Chicago. * BA/MA - offered only to current University of Chicago undergraduates entering their senior year * MA/MA - with the Harris School of Public Policy Studies * MBA/MA - with the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business * JD/MA - with the University of Chicago Law School Notable faculty * Bruce Cumings * John Mearsheimer * Robert Pape * Eric Posner * Paul Staniland * Bernard Wasserstein * Charles Lipson * Dali Yang External links * CIR Website * AM/MA-CIR - Dual Degree Committee on International Relations (CIR) Category:University of Chicago Category:Schools of international relations in the United States Category:Realist think tanks Category:1928 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Committee on International Relations (University of Chicago)"},{"id":"9869861","text":"Iwan Serrurier (21 September 1878 in Leiden - 1953) was a Dutch-born electrical engineer notable for inventing the Moviola.

The device was hard to sell to home users since it cost $600 in 1920, a very large sum. An editor at Douglas Fairbanks Studios suggested that Serrurier should adapt the device for use by film editors; he did this and the Moviola as an editing device was born in 1924.

He is often referred to as a Flemish artist because this term was often used to designate people from the Spanish Netherlands. After training in Antwerp, he was active in Italy where he was part of the international Caravaggesque movement. His subjects include genre scenes with card players, fortune tellers, soldiers and concerts, religious scenes, saints, mythological and allegorical scenes, and portraits. He also painted a few scenes with carnivals. Life R√©gnier was born in Maubeuge. It was previously believed that his birth date was 6 December 1591. Review of his baptismal records has led to the conclusion that he may have been born at least a year earlier. He apprenticed in Antwerp with Abraham Janssens, a Flemish painter who had studied in Rome at the time of Caravaggio and was one of the first Flemish followers of Caravaggio. Vanity It is unclear when R√©gnier reached Rome. He travelled to Rome via Parma where he is present in 1616‚Äì1617. He is definitely in Rome by 1620 when he is registered sharing lodgings with the Dutch painters David de Haen and Dirk van Baburen, both part of the Northern Caravaggesque movement.Nicolas R√©gnier, The Death of Sophonisba at the Matthiesen Fine Art Gallery He became acquainted in Rome with the work of Bartolomeo Manfredi, an important Italian interpreter of Caravaggio. The German painter and biographer Joachim von Sandrart calls R√©gnier a follower of Manfredi. R√©gnier became a member of the household of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, a rich banker and prominent patron of Caravaggio. He was Giustiniani's official painter and resided during the period 1622‚Äì1623 at Giustiniani's palace on the Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi. His duties included the painting of religious and profane subjects. After marrying Cecilia Bezzi in 1623 he left Giustiniani's household. In Rome R√©gnier was also in close contact with Simon Vouet, whose interpretation of Caravaggio with its clear light and classical structure would influence him. Saint Matthew and the Angel By 1626, R√©gnier had moved to Venice, maybe after first stopping over in Bologna. He was enrolled in the Venetian Guild in 1626.Nicolas R√©gnier at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In Venice, he expanded his activities to dealing in antiquities and paintings. In 1634 he was recorded trying to sell paintings to the Duke of Hamilton through an English agent. It is not clear whether as an art dealer he was also selling any of the forgeries, which is son in law Pietro della Vecchia is known to have created. He was painter to the king of France, as a supplier of paintings purchased by Mazarin. He was often consulted in the period 1661-1667 as an expert to decide on whether artworks were forgeries, especially with respect to drawings. He also befriended the Italian painter Guido Cagnacci. Of his four daughters, Lucretia married the Flemish painter Daniel van den Dyck while Clorinda married the prominent Italian painter Pietro della Vecchia (1605-1678). His daughters were also painters in their own right and worked with their husbands on commissions.Nicola Ivanoff, Daniele van den Dyck, in: Emporium, CXVIII(1953), pp. 244-250 Regnier's only son, Giovanni Paolo, was baptised on 27 October 1639. R√©gnier's half-brother was Michele Desubleo, an artist working in a very similar style and whose work is often wrongly attributed to R√©gnier and vice versa. He died in Venice. Work His subjects include genre scenes with card players, fortune tellers, concerts, soldiers and carnival scenes, portraits, religious scenes, saints and mythological and allegorical subjects. Together with the French painter Valentin de Boulogne, R√©gnier is regarded as a follower of the Manfrediana Methodus, which refers to those artists who interpreted Caravaggio through the prism of Bartolomeo Manfredi's processing of the lessons of Caravaggio. Some of his works are so close to those of Manfredi that they have been wrongly attributed to Manfredi. Carnival Scene R√©gnier's style is characterised by its pursuit of refinement and elegance, in contrast with the Northern Caravaggisti such as Gerard van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen, whose art dwells on the more earthy aspects of genre scenes. After his move to Venice, his style became even more smooth under the influence of the Bolognese painters, such as Guido Reni. He painted Saint Sebastian Tended by Saint Irene three times, as well as a number of nearly-nude single figures of Saint Sebastian and John the Baptist. He painted Mary Magdalene numerous times.

Wirth was superintendent of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board from 1906 through 1935, when he retired, and he continued to serve as superintendent emeritus until his death in 1949. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The house was recognized for Wirth's status as an international figure in the field of park design, for its role in bringing Wirth to Minneapolis, and for the work he did in the offices where he designed or redesigned the Minneapolis parks. When Charles Loring originally approached Wirth to come to Minneapolis in 1905, Wirth was reluctant to accept the offer. His employer at the time, the city of Hartford, Connecticut, provided Wirth and his family a mansion in Elizabeth Park. Minneapolis did not have a home to provide, and as a civil servant, Wirth was unable to replace that benefit. During the process of negotiations, Loring agreed that the park board would build a home for Wirth. The home was to be located in Lyndale Farmstead Park. Wirth agreed to these terms and moved to Minneapolis in 1906. The house was designed by local architect Lowell Lamoreaux.

These investors also owned the Margaret, which, under Captain James Magee, frequently sailed in company with the Hope. Ingraham's intention was to return to the northwest coast to partake in the fur trade. Ingraham and his ship sailed around Cape Horn on January 26, 1791. Their next stop was at Madre de Dios Island in Chile on April 14. While in this Spanish port they took on some provisions before sailing north again. A few days later, on April 19, 1792, Ingraham discovered a small uncharted island group. These islands were situated roughly nine degrees south of the Equator. Captain Ingraham named the group Washington Islands, and named many of the individual islands: Washington Island for the president, Adams Island for the vice president, Federal Island, Franklin Island, Knox Island and Lincoln Island for a general.

The industries of the economy of Peru arose in response to the country's rich natural resources. During the regime of the Inca Empire, the economy was centrally planned, and labour was mandatory. Spanish explorers held the Incan system in much regard. Today, Peru has important mineral resources, which are found throughout its mountainous and coastal regions. The country is the world's second-largest producer of silver and copper. From 2016 to 2017, mining output increased, helping Peru attain one of the highest GDP growth rates in Latin America. Peru's prominent industries include mining, farming, fishing, and agriculture. Incan Empire (pre-16th century) The Incan economy was centered around the ayllu, a local group composed of neighboring families in the same village. Every ayllu specialized in a certain industry, such as agriculture, pottery, clothing, or jewellery. People did collective community work in a system known as the minka, which involved construction, cleaning, or attending to other needs of the society at large. Since there was no official currency, taxes were collected in the form of crops, cattle, and labor. Spanish colony (16th‚Äì18th centuries) While the Spanish Empire ruled the region, Peru's economy was dominated by minerals. The enslavement of indigenous peoples provided the initial labor force. Peru's precious mineral resources and large indigenous population placed it at the core of the South American colonies. According to Palmer, Peru could be ranked second on a scale that compares the degree to which colonies were exploited. Minerals from Peru and other South American colonies along with textiles and sugar were exported back to Europe. After the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century, Spain began to lose its monopoly in colonial trade. In the mid-18th century, liberal factions began to appear within the colonial elite; they questioned the legitimacy of Spanish rule in the Americas. Called \\"Creole patriots\\", the factions were originally marginalized to the periphery of the empire in places such as Venezuela; consequently, they experienced expanded trade opportunities. They provided the necessary conditions for successful economic development, however, during the late colonial period. The introduction of free trade led to explosive growth throughout the empire; by the end of the century, Spain received ten times more imports. Despite the overall growth of the colonies, Peru's economy stagnated in the period that lasted about 150 years after the Peruvian War of Independence. The regional socioeconomic hierarchy inverted itself because core territories where liberals were absent experienced much lower levels of economic development. Author James Mahoney writes: The Spanish crown, attempting to protect its colonial possessions and reverse its faltering role in colonial trade, implemented liberal reforms, hastening the removal of trade restrictions and weakening colonial monopolies. These actions continued the decay of the core regions, leaving them more exposed to the uncertainties of the free market. By the mid-19th century, the reversal of the socioeconomic hierarchy was complete. Peru has never recovered supremacy similar to that of the Viceroyalty era. 19th century After the country gained its independence, Peru embarked on a railroad building program. Entrepreneur Henry Meiggs built a standard gauge line from Callao, a seaside city, across the Andes to the Huancayo in the highlands. Aiming for Cusco in the Andes, he built the line but also bankrupted the country. In 1879, Peru entered the War of the Pacific, which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The Peruvian government tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on April 5, 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of Tarapac√° Province, and the provinces in the Atacama region of Tacna and Arica. Originally, Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later to self-determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and both countries could not determine the statutory framework. The USA decided that the plebiscite was impossible to take; direct negotiations between the parties led to the treaty Treaty of Lima in 1929, where Peru ceded Arica to Chile and Tacna remained in Peru. Tacna officially returned to Peru on August 29, 1929. The territorial loss, extensive looting of Peruvian cities by Chilean troops, and other effects of the war led to tense diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have not since fully subsided. After the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian government initiated social and economic reforms to recover from the damage of the war. The country finally attained political stability in the early 20th century. World War I Before the start of World War I, Peru had enjoyed years of economic growth bolstered by sugar, mining and cotton exports. With the start of the war Peru's export economy was severely impacted by disruption in international markets. Military rule (1948‚Äì1980) On October 29, 1948, General Manuel A. Odr√≠a became the new president after a military coup. Due to a thriving economy, Odr√≠a implemented expensive, populist social reconstruction, whose programs included housing projects, hospitals, and schools. His government was dictatorial, however, and civil rights were severely restricted. Corruption was rampant throughout his regime. Various military juntas continued to rule Peru over the next three decades. The economic policies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were based on the substitution of imports and had little effect on the size of the economy. General Francisco Morales Berm√∫dez replaced leftist General Juan Velasco Alvarado in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement among other reasons. The regime of Berm√∫dez was a more conservative period, beginning the task of restoring the country's economy. Bela√∫nde presidency (1980‚Äì1985) In 1980, after many years of military rule, Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry was elected president. After a strong beginning, his popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism. The government's attempt to liberalize the economy failed, partly because of the Latin American debt crisis. Per-capita income declined, and Peru's foreign debt grew. Violence by leftist insurgents, notably Shining Path, rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru. The first large insurgent activities began the day before Bela√∫nde's election. Bela√∫nde continued many of the projects that were planned during his 1963‚Äì1968 term, including the completion of the Carretera Marginal de la Selva, a roadway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with the then- isolated northern regions of Amazonas and San Mart√≠n. Over time, the economic problems left behind by the various junta governments persisted. The El Ni√±o weather phenomenon from 1982 to 1983 further eroded the economy, causing widespread flooding in some parts of the country and severe droughts in others, and decimating the schools of ocean fish that were one of the country's major resources. First Garc√≠a presidency (1985‚Äì1990) Bela√∫nde's successor, Alan Garc√≠a, was elected to office in 1985. His administration applied heterodox policies through the expansion of public expenditure and limitations on external debt payments.Carlos Parodi, Per√∫ 1960‚Äì2000. CIUP, 2000, pp. 206‚Äì208. With a parliamentary majority for the first time in the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance's history, Garc√≠a's administration showed economic promise, much as Bela√∫nde's had. However, despite his initial popularity, Garc√≠a's term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over his five-year term, and profoundly destabilized the Peruvian economy. As a result of chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the sol, was replaced by the inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991; the new currency had an equivalent value of one billion old soles. During Garc√≠a's administration, the per-capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720, which was below 1960 levels, and Peru's GDP dropped by 20%. By the end of his term, the national reserves cumulatively were $900 million in debt.Carlos Parodi, Per√∫ 1960‚Äì2000. CIUP, 2000, pp. 204-206. Garc√≠a's term was also characterized by heavy increases in poverty. According to studies by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the United Nations Development Programme, at the start of Garc√≠a's presidency, 41.6% of Peruvians lived in poverty. By 1991, this figure had increased to 55%. Garc√≠a also attempted to nationalize the banking and insurance industries. He angered the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the international financial community by unilaterally declaring a limit on debt repayment equal to 10% of the gross national product, thereby isolating Peru from international financial markets. One of his projects, a multimillion-dollar metro for Lima, was not completed until 2011 because its construction was paralyzed for over 20 years until it was resumed in 2010. =Fujimori= Critics of Garc√≠a's presidency claim that his many poor decisions in office created an environment that led to the rise of the authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, who came to power in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his efforts, he dissolved Congress in the auto-golpe (self-coup) of April 5, 1992. He then revised the constitution and called for new congressional elections. Undertaking a process of economic liberalization, he ended price controls, discarded protectionism, eliminated restrictions on foreign direct investment, and privatized most state companies.John Sheahan, La econom√≠a peruana desde 1950. IEP, 2001, p. 207. The reforms allowed sustained economic growth, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.Banco Central de Reserva, Producto bruto interno por sectores productivos 1951 ‚Äì 2006. . Modern era (1990‚Äìpresent) Positive results in Peru's economy have begun to appear after 15 years, reflecting an expanding global economy. According to figures provided by the INEI, in 2007, during Alan Garc√≠a's second presidency, the gross national product grew by 8.99%; exports grew by over 35% and reached US$27.8 billion; private and public investments accounted for 21% of the GDP, growing even further to 24.4% in 2008; net international reserves, including gold, reached US$35.1 billion; state income from taxation increased by 33%; national debt scaled to GNP was reduced from 50% in 2000 to 34% in 2006; and the national budget grew by 50% in the five years before 2007. Since 1990, the Peruvian economy has undergone free-market reforms, legalizing parts of the informal sector, and privatizing the mining, electricity, and telecommunications industries. Because of strong foreign investment, and cooperation between the Fujimori government and the IMR and World Bank, growth was strong in 1994‚Äì97, and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, El Ni√±o's impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. 1999 was another lean year for Peru due to the aftermath of El Ni√±o and the Asian financial crisis. Lima completed negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets. Peru's per-capita growth rates have diverged from overall growth rates over the last quarter-century. Peru's GDP per capita peaked in 1981 and is only recently on the path to return to that level. By the end of 2006, the government had enacted measures that allowed the economy to improve by increasing investments, and expanding production and exports. Raw materials and agroindustrial products represent the bulk of potential exports. By 2020, investment is expected to total US$25 billion for mining activities; US$20 billion in energy, especially petroleum; US$12 billion for commerce; US$8 billion for agricultural industries; and US$5 billion for tourism.

Guiraut Riquier, last of the Occitan troubadours, was employed by Aimery.Elizabeth Aubrey, The Music of the Troubadours, (Indiana University Press, 1996), 24. By 1289, Aimery had so distinguished himself that he was put in command of the Guelph troops massed to attack the Ghibellines of Arezzo. During that campaign, the two armies met at the Battle of Campaldino and Aimery won the victory on which his reputation rests.Marina Montesano, \\"Come l'orco della fiaba\\": Studi per Franco Cardini, (SISMEL, 2010), 578. He conquered most of the Aretine countryside, taking many castles by storm, from to the gates of Arezzo itself. This, however, he failed to take by siege, as the Aretines made several valiant sorties which successfully destroyed his siege engines. The campaign was nevertheless a success and Aimery was received triumphantly upon his return to Florence, where he was the representative of Charles II of Naples.

Youth and college David D‚ÄôErrico grew up playing soccer in Harrison, New Jersey with his three older brothers (Michael, Anthony and Thomas). Throughout his youth, he played for the local Kearny Scots. David was voted The MVP of the State of New Jersey and graduated from New Jersey‚Äôs Harrison High School in 1969.David D'Errico Interview , Goal Seattle.com. Accessed October 11, 2007. \\"My high school, Harrison High, had and still has an amazing tradition. We have won the most state championships in NJ history despite having a total of 700 plus kids.\\" In 1999, he was named by The Star-Ledger as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1940s-1960s. In 1970-72, David was an All- American at Mitchell College and earned an AA. in 1972, he entered Hartwick College where he played on the men's soccer team for the 1972 and 1973 seasons. He was a First-Team All-American in 1973, the year that Hartwick went to the NCAA tournament quarterfinals before losing to Brown University in double overtime. David D'Errico graduated from Hartwick in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in history having played twenty-seven games, scored six goals and assisted on six others. NASL In 1974, the expansion Seattle Sounders selected David, \\"The Original Seattle Sounder\\" as their first overall pick in the NASL College Draft. In the 1974-1975 NASL offseason, the Sounders loaned David to League of Ireland First Division club, Dundalk. After spending three seasons in Seattle, David broke his fibula in 2 places and tore ligaments during practice. David fully recovered. David played with Sounder‚Äôs greats, (Sir) Geoff Hurst, (World Cup Winner and scored a \\"Hat Trick\\" vs. Germany in the 1966 World Cup Final), Harry Redknapp, (West Ham United, teammates with Geoff Hurst and future Sounder and England World Cup Winning Captain (Sir) Bobby Moore), assistant coach for The Sounders and future manager of Tottenham Hotspur. Another beloved Sounders player was former Everton and Chelsea hard man and Sounder's assistant coach Jimmy Gabriel.

After a contract dispute David asked to be traded to the Minnesota Kicks. He spent only a single season in Minnesota before moving to the New England Tea Men for the 1978 season. In 1978, he was named as an NASL Honorable Mention All-Star. MISL and NASL At the end of the 1978 season, David began alternating between the outdoor NASL and the indoor Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). In 1978, he joined the Cincinnati Kids for its one season in the newly established MISL. The Kids played the first MISL game, against the New York Arrows. That year the Kids made the playoffs only to lose to the Arrows in the semifinals. In 1979, David played for the Rochester Lancers of the NASL. Once again he played only a single season with the Lancers, but his time with the team was significant in that the Lancers also entered the MISL as the New York Arrows. D'Errico was second-team All-Star for the 1979-1980 MISL season and a first-team All-Star for the 1980-1981 MISL season. The NY Arrows won 4 MISL Championships. David, his NY Arrows teammates, some of the best indoor players of all time, Steve Zungal,(The Lord of All Indoors), Branko, (The Laser), Segota, Shep Messing, Zolt√°n T√≥th, Luis Alberto, Fred Grgurev, Doc Lawson, won 3 of 4 of the first Major Indoor Soccer League Championships. David was the 1st player to score a short-handed goal with 2 men down in an MISL NY Arrows game and was the first player to have his number retired by the 4 Time MISL Champions. David played one more season in the NASL, this time with the San Diego Sockers in 1980. The Sockers were a team, much like the Lancers/Arrows, a solid outdoors team, but came to dominate the indoor league. USL In 1984, David played for the Charlotte Gold. The Gold were a part of the short lived outdoor United Soccer League which lasted only the 1984 and part of the 1985 season. David was the player- coach and led the team to an 11-13 record. The Gold folded at the end of the season. National team The US National Team The National Team went on tour to play South American powerhouses, Universitaria of Ecuador, Millonarios of Colombia, and Alianza of Peru, (Teofilo Cubillas, Peru's greatest player and Hugo Sotil, who went on to play and win the Spanish League title with Barcelona and Johan Cruyff). In 1978, the return leg, The National Team was coached by the American and Philadelphia native Walt Chyzowych at The Festival of the Americas, a round-robin tournament was held at Downing Stadium at Randall's island, New York, pitting the US National team against Universitaria of Ecuador, Millonarios of Colombia, and Alianza of Peru. Although these were club teams, they were quite strong. Seven Alianza players eventually qualified for Peru's 1978 World cup team. The Americans included David D'Errico, Bobby Smith, Al Trost, Arnie Mausser, Boris Bandov, Greg Villa, Gary Etherington, Tony Donlic and Ricky Davis. The US team turned in a stunning performance, shutting out Universitaria 3-0 and Millonarios 3-0, and beating Alianza 2-1 to take the tournament. More amazingly, the US outscored their opponents 8-1. Although their skills were rudimentary, the Americans showed a promising practicality, and particularly among the aggressive forwards, traditionally a weak spot, given the NASL's lack of opportunity for US strikers. Americans were generally relegated to defense and goalkeeping. The US then went on to play five games in Central America, losing two to Guatemala, being shut out by Mexico 3-0 and splitting a pair with El Salvador. The US team finished with a three-game series against China, David D'Errico, Captained The USMNT against China, a tie, 1-1 in Washington, winning 2-1 in San Francisco and 1-0 in Atlanta. David D'Errico also made his debut for the U.S. national team in 1974, playing the team's only two games of that year, both losses to Mexico. In 1975, he played two of the team's five games, one as a sub. However, in 1976, he became an integral member of the team and its eventual Captain as it began qualifications for the 1978 World Cup. He continued to play through the end of 1977 and experienced the disappointment of failing to qualify for the World Cup finals in 1978 in Argentina. David has a graduate degree from Seattle Pacific University in sports psychology and sociology. In 1995, Hartwick College inducted David D'Errico into its Athletic Hall of Fame.

He was for the duration of twenty years President of Bantam in the East Indies.Per inscription on his mural monument in Dunchideock Church He made a fortune in the East India trade. Origins Baker was born in the parish of Alphington, near Exeter, Devon, as is recorded on his mural monument in Dunchideock Church. Madras period Baker was the first President of Madras when the Presidency of Fort St George was created in the year 1652. He served as President from 1652 to 1655.List of Governors of Madras, from worldstatesmen.org In 1652-53, caste conflicts arose between \\"left-hand\\" and \\"right-hand castes\\" which was settled by the English, who reserved the eastern half of the Indian quarter of the city for the \\"left-hand\\" castes and the western half of the quarter for the \\"right-hand\\" castes. During this period the area around Madras was in great turmoil due to the rebellion of Mir Jumla against his overlord in Golconda. During this time Bala Rao, the chief of Poonamallee, raised the customs duties on English goods thereby causing a drastic increase in prices. Madras was besieged by Bala Rao and his colleague, Tupaki Krishnappa Naick. This blockade and the economic boycott of English trade by Bala Rao forced the English to reduce Fort St George from a Presidency to an Agency at the termination of Baker's term of office. Dismissal Private trade was eventually allowed while holding Presidency positions but had at first been frowned upon; both Aaron Baker and Sir Edward Winter were ultimately dismissed for engaging in it.403 Forbidden Retirement in England Baker retired to Bowhay in the parish of Exminster, Devon, England, with the fortunes he earned.Baker, H.

It is the second of two albums made by a line-up consisting of Gay Woods, Bob Johnson, Peter Knight and Tim Harries, and only the second album on which Maddy Prior did not make an appearance. The title refers not to a bedlam, but to Christ's birth in Bethlehem (which is occasionally corrupted to 'Bedlam'). \\"There is a child in Bedlam born\\" is a line from \\"Stephen\\".  Tracks and reception  Their previous album, Horkstow Grange was not well received by fans, many of whom complained that the album was too light on rock and too heavy on folk. For Bedlam Born the band emphasized the rock elements, producing tracks such as \\"Well Done Liar\\", \\"John of Ditchford\\", and \\"We Poor Laboring Men\\" that have a strong rock guitar line, driving bass, and comparatively heavy drumming, provided by the band's regular guest drummer Dave Mattacks. While Woods was the primary lead singer on Horkstow Grange, on this album she sings lead on only five songs, mostly quieter pieces that allowed her to demonstrate her high range. Two of these pieces, \\"Arbour\\" and \\"The White Cliffs of Dover\\" experiment with spoken-word sequences, something entirely new for the band. (\\"John of Ditchford\\", incidentally, is a fairly accurate retelling of an actual murder case that occurred in England in the early 14th century.) According to Woods, two tracks, \\"I See His Blood Upon the Rose\\" and \\"Stephen\\", attracted considerable complaint from fans. Both pieces are explicitly Christian, with \\"Stephen\\" being about a stable boy in Bethlehem at the time of the Massacre of the Innocents. Fans objected that the band had always stuck to secular music and felt uncomfortable about the religious sentiments of these two tracks. This complaint is to some extent unjustified since, although the majority of the band's repertoire is secular, the band has in fact performed a number of explicitly Christian pieces over the course of its history. Its second-highest charting song, \\"Gaudete\\" is a Latin chant celebrating Christ's birth. \\"Harvest Home\\", off Sails of Silver is a 19th- century Anglican hymn. Although Steeleye Span didn't get around to recording \\"Lyke-Wake Dirge\\" until 2002, this medieval song about purgatory was the introduction of their first American tour, while \\"Lanercost\\" from Back in Line uses the Kyrie Eleison as its chorus. In 2004, the band would release Winter, an album of Christmas songs, about half of which were traditional Christian pieces. Like the previous album, reactions to Bedlam were mixed. Many complained that the album was too rock-heavy, while others lamented Prior's continued absence. On the other hand, some celebrated the album as a return to the sound the band had during the mid-1970s.  Aftermath  The recording of this album was reportedly tumultuous, with Woods eventually quitting the band again, reportedly over money issues, and Harries also departing after the release of the album. Johnson, who had been the band's main guitarist for most of the band's history, chose to retire because of health trouble. This left a need for a lead guitarist for the band's tour, and Rick Kemp, who had been a member in the band's commercially successful middle period, returned and eventually rejoined the band on a full-time basis. During the tour, Kemp and Harries alternated playing lead guitar and bass. Track listing #\\"Well Done Liar!\\" (Traditional arr.

It was designed by the Belgian architect Paul Belau and built by Purdy and Henderson, Engineers in 1914 at the site of the former Teatro Tac√≥n. Its construction was paid for by the Galician immigrants of Havana to serve as a their community-social center. Located in the Paseo del Prado, its facilities include theatres, a concert hall, conference rooms, a video screening room, as well as an art gallery, a choral center and several rehearsal halls for dance companies. It hosts the International Ballet Festival of Havana every two years since 1960.http://www.balletcuba.cult.cu History Gran Teatro de la Habana, 1915. Since its inception in 1838, Teatro Tac√≥n had occupied the north-western part of the site bounded by Paseo del Prado and Calle Consulado and Calles San Rafael and San Jos√©. Its auditorium hosted such European artists as Enrico Caruso and Sarah Bernhardt. During the first years of Cuban independence when thousands of immigrants arrived in Cuba from Spain, a new building addition was constructed around the concert hall of Teatro Tac√≥n. Originally known as the Centro Gallego de La Habana, the building is decorated with sculptures by Giuseppe Moretti representing benevolence, education, music and theatre. Currently, the principal venue is the Garc√≠a Lorca Auditorium, with seats for 1,500 persons, it provides a home for the Cuban National Ballet Company, and for other dance companies and musical performances. During the 19th and 20th century, performances that took place on its stage include: Ole Bull, Enrico Caruso, Fanny Elssler, Jenny Lind, Anna Pavlova, Antonia Merc√©, Ruth Saint Denis, Ted Shawn, Teresa Carre√±o, Vicente Escudero, Maya Plisetskaya, Clorinda Corradi, Sarah Bernhardt, Carla Fracci and Alicia Alonso, as well as companies such as the American Ballet Theatre, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Antonio Gades ballet, the Ballet of the Col√≥n Theatre of Buenos Aires, the Ballet Folcl√≥rico of Mexico, plus other ballet companies. Architecture Teatro Tacon on Calle San Rafael. The Centro Gallego a Baroque Revival building, was built around the old concert hall of the Teatro Tac√≥n located at the corner of Calles of San Rafael and Consulado. Architect Paul Belau, architect of the Presidential Palace, and the U.S. firm Purdy and Henderson, Engineers, kept the original theatre and built the Centro Gallego, a Baroque Revival style building addition that enlarged the support functions of the concert hall and introduced an elaborate system of circulation. The exterior of the original Teatro Tac√≥n received a new stone facing to harmonize with the new exterior of the Centro Gallego. Sculpture There is a group of four sculptures in white marble, part of a group of ninety-seven, by Giuseppe Moretti and Geneva Mercer representing charity, education, music and theater. A bronze sculpture was revealed in 2018 by the Cuban sculptor Jos√© Villa Sober√≥nsculpture of Alicia Alonso in the lobby of the Gran Teatro. The sculpture is named Giselle after the romantic ballet that brought the legendary dancer to world fame. Giselle premiered in 1841 at the Paris Opera and is one of the main titles within the repertoire of the National Ballet of Cuba. It is therefore no coincidence that the artist chose this classic to represent the figure. Performance During the 19th and 20th century, performances that took place on its stage include: Ole Bull, Enrico Caruso, Fanny Elssler, Jenny Lind, Anna Pavlova, Antonia Merc√©, Ruth Saint Denis, Ted Shawn, Teresa Carre√±o, Vicente Escudero, Maya Plisetskaya, Clorinda Corradi, Sarah Bernhardt, Carla Fracci and Alicia Alonso, as well as companies such as the American Ballet Theatre, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Antonio Gades ballet, the Ballet of the Col√≥n Theatre of Buenos Aires, the Ballet Folcl√≥rico of Mexico, plus other ballet companies.

Vision (Jonas) The Vision (Jonas) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appears in Young Avengers #5, and is the third character and second android character published by Marvel with the superhero name Vision. He is a combination of the original android Vision's program files and the armor and brain patterns of Iron Lad. =Publication history= Vision first appeared in Young Avengers #5 (August 2005) and was created by Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung. The exact details of the character's personality and mental make-up vary from writer to writer. While some writers, such as Heinberg and Dan Slott, write him as an entirely new character, other writers like Brian Michael Bendis (during the \\"Collective\\" storyline) and Ed Brubaker (in Captain America: Reborn) write him as if he is the original Vision in a new body (or at least has access to the original Vision's memories). =Fictional character biography= The Vision is a fusion of the old Vision's operating systems and the armor of adventurer Iron Lad, a teenage version of Kang the Conqueror who arrives in the present. Through this merger, Iron Lad is able to access plans the Vision had created in the event of the Avengers' defeat. He uses these plans to assemble a new team of \\"Young Avengers\\". When Iron Lad is forced to remove his armor to stop Kang the Conqueror from tracking him, the Vision's operating system causes the armor to become a sentient being. When Iron Lad leaves the time period, he leaves the armor behind with the Vision's operating system activated. The new Vision opts to stay with the Young Avengers and serve as a mentor for them, though it is later revealed that (due to having Iron Lad's brainwave patterns as the basis for his personality) he is with the group due to his growing feelings of affection towards Cassie Lang, the superhero known as Stature.Young Avengers #11 (May 2006), Marvel Comics.

They opt to keep their dual memberships in the Avengers and the Young Avengers a secret, in order to hunt for the Scarlet Witch (really Loki in disguise), who arranged for the roster to form. They ultimately tell their teammates this when Loki reveals his impersonation of Wanda and confront him. When the group ultimately disbands following the events of the \\"Siege\\", both rejoin the Young Avengers full-time. In Avengers: Children's Crusade, Cassie is killed by Doctor Doom, and Iron Lad decides to take her body into the future to be revived. Jonas protests, reasoning that such an action is more in line with Kang's manipulation of time than what Cassie would want, and Iron Lad murders him in a fit of jealous anger. Although his teammates contemplate rebuilding him, they decide against it, both because they lack the 30th-century technology to do so and because, even with their access to his back-ups, the lack of a back-up immediately prior to his death would mean that they would have to tell him about Cassie's death all over again.

A number of Boyarin's students, including Christine Hayes, Charlotte Fonrobert, and Azzan Yadin, occupy Rabbinics posts at various American universities. A discussion of the merits of Boyarin's scholarship is featured in the opening scene of Joseph Cedar's Oscar-nominated film Footnote. Views and writings His first book, Sephardic Speculation (written in Hebrew), examines the Talmudic methodology of Isaac Canpanton (1360-1463, Spain). Boyarin's first English book, Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (1990), is often credited with introducing Literary Theory into the field of Rabbinics. . Carnal Israel: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture (1993) applies the methods of New Historicism to the subject of Rabbinic attitudes toward sexuality. A Radical Jew: Paul and the Politics of Identity (1994) argues that misreadings of Paul the Apostle's universalist philosophy eventually led to violent coercion. In Unheroic Conduct (1997), Boyarin‚Äôs interests mesh with those of others, such as Sander Gilman and Jay Geller, who have begun to explore the relationship between psychoanalysis and Judaism. For Boyarin, the Oedipus complex both incarnates and disavows a fear Sigmund Freud had of being classified as feminine in the context of the times in which he lived, times that were antisemitic and that ultimately culminated in the Holocaust. Boyarin holds that passivity is an essential feature of Judaism, and that because this is a quality that is held in common with homosexuality, it has the power to inspire panic among Jews who fear the censorious gaze of authority. Consequently, he claims, Freud conceived of the Oedipus complex as a way of deferring the charge of Jewish femininity by offering proof that Jews, no less than Gentiles, had within them the desire to kill. Boyarin supports his argument that passivity is essential to Judaism with the observation that Judaism worships a powerful male authority figure who demands obeisance, and with documentary evidence such as Haggadot, prayer guides for the Jewish Passover ritual of the Seder, that show the wise son as the retiring scholar, and the wicked son as the man of war. This leads Boyarin to oppose Zionism, as he feels that the necessary element of activity and war entailed in ruling over a land is at odds with what he identifies as the authentic and persistent current of scholarship that defines the tradition. Martha Nussbaum credits him with the insight that Jewish sensibilities \\"reshaped Roman norms of manliness, making the astonishing claim that the true man sits still all day with a book, and has the bodily shape of someone who does just that\\".Martha C. Nussbaum, Man Overboard, The New Republic, June 22nd, 2006. Border Lines (2004) examines the early stages of the partition of Judaism and Christianity into two separate and distinct religions. Socrates and the Fat Rabbis (2009) explores the dialogic structure in Plato and the Babylonian Talmud. The Jewish Gospels: The Story of the Jewish Christ (2012) carries on the line of exploration begun in Border Lines, developing the argument that \\"New Testament\\" ideas can be found in long- standing Jewish traditions. Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict Boyarin has complex views on Zionism and a critical view of the Israeli government. He has stated, for example, that: \\"More piercing to me is the pain of watching a tradition, my Judaism, to which I have dedicated my life, disintegrating before my eyes. It has been said by many Christians that Christianity died at Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibor. I fear, God forbid, that my Judaism may be dying at Nablus, Deheishe, Betein (Bethel), and El-Khalil (Hebron).\\"Daniel Boyarin, Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006 p. xiv. This passage was assailed by Alvin H. Rosenfeld, Director of the Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism, who accused Boyarin of lacking \\"lucid thinking\\", as well as of \\"bias\\" for having drawn an analogy between the Nazi Holocaust and the Israeli government's conduct toward the Palestinians.Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism', p. 17.

Components  * Wooden body * Nail tip * String (wrapped around the crown of the top, allowing the player to spin the top as it is thrown) Game play The game begins with all players holding their wound top. The players throw their tops at the same time ‚Äì this is the ‚Äòtoss‚Äô for the game. The \\"toss\\" is decided by the top spun and picked up quickest. The throw is triggered by a simple countdown ‚Äì at the count of 1, 2, 3 all the players wind their bambarams, unwind it on the ground to rotate and then pick it up with the rope as quickly as possible. The primary skill is to use the shortest rope length usage and still make the bambaram spin, so it can be caught with the rope. Bambarams that did not complete the toss are placed in the center of a circle. The players who finished the toss successfully try to spin the top over the tops in the circle trying to break (gunna in Karnataka slang) them and/or trying to knock them out of the circle. Each time the spinning tops have to be picked up successfully to continue.  Traditional producers  Traditional makers of Bambaram were in Ambasamudram taluk. One producer was a carpenter called Raja Gopal Achary S.His wood carving workshop was called Muthu Cheppu Pattarai in Kalakkad, Tirunelveli district. He started in 1961, and named his shop after his first son.

The station covers much of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. Between 1974 and 2006, KWJC was a conventional college radio station, operated by William Jewell College in suburban Liberty, Missouri, with a student staff. After that time, KWJC aired the national K-LOVE and Air1 formats from the Educational Media Foundation. When EMF bought a Kansas City translator (K300CH 107.9) and relocated Air1 there, KWJC went temporarily silent on May 31, 2019. On July 1, 2020 UMKC assumed control of KWJC and the station returned to the air with a classical music format. History =KWPB= KWPB went on the air in 1974. It was launched by the then-head of the William Jewell College communication department, Dr. Georgia B. Bowman. She convinced the college to name the station after a former Jewell president, Dr. Walter Pope Binns. The station broadcast from the third floor of the Yates College Union with a 10-watt FM transmitter that could reach the college campus and some of the surrounding town of Liberty. There were three rooms: an outer multipurpose production space, an inner work room where the meager collection of albums and '45s were stored, and the control room where broadcasting students operated a two-channel mixing board, two closed cartridge tape transports, one reel-to-reel tape deck and two turntables. The transmitter was located in the control room, with the broadcast antenna mounted just outside the station on the roof of the union building. Service interruptions were common. When a volunteer was unable to make a shift assignment, the station went off the air. During ice storms, common in that area, ice accumulation on the broadcast antenna would force the station to shut down to protect its transmitter. (KWPB staff learned this lesson the hard way, after internal transmitter components were destroyed during ice events and the station was forced to wait weeks for replacement parts to be shipped in.) The station was also silent during school holidays, including the entire summer. Much beloved and a little feared by her students, Dr. Bowman made sure that KWPB remained a primarily educational enterprise. The production space was used by students to produce \\"discussion\\" recordings, consisting of partly extemporaneous and partly edited recorded conversations among students about issues of the day, that were submitted for competitive evaluation against other college teams. Students wrote and produced public service announcements, ran station operations, and served as on-air talent. The first program director was a Jewell student named George Townsend who had some experience in radio broadcasting. The staff was all-volunteer, except that some students were paid under the U.S. government's work-study financial aid program. The station broadcast classical music during the day when few students were likely to be listening, then contemporary music during evenings and weekends. Despite the Baptist heritage of the college, religious content was limited to a regular subscription to \\"The Word from Unity\\" and a Southern Baptist youth- oriented program called \\"Powerline,\\" both of which arrived by mail on reel-to- reel tape. Evening and weekend contemporary pop music broadcasts were much more popular with the staff, who viewed them as superior training experiences for a future broadcasting career. The station's record collection was inadequate even for a small audience, so student disc jockeys often used their personal collections for their shows, producing a de facto play list that would best be described as eclectic and expansive. These evening shows were not very popular with Dr. Bowman, who occasionally called in to ban a song she had just heard over the air (Bob Marley's \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" is one example.) Eventually, William Jewell football broadcasts were launched for most home and away games. A modest equipment package allowed a two-person broadcast crew to send live play-by-play and color back to the station by telephone link, which were typically dial-up. Leased lines were used as the meager station budget allowed. During the early years, KWPB did not sell sponsorships that are otherwise common in public broadcasting. The college development staff worried that such appeals might dilute Jewell's larger fundraising efforts, and so the station was forced to survive on a small allocation from the school's operating budget. Necessity being the mother of invention, the student staff and director Dr. Bowman improvised. During the second year of operation, students purchased building materials from a local Liberty merchant (with funds probably provided from Dr. Bowman's personal account) and installed a soundproof, windowed partition between the broadcast booth and the transmitter, finally eliminating transmitter fan noises that had been so noticeable when a microphone was open in the booth. The work was done while the station was on-air, so construction volunteers were forced to suspend work whenever microphones were open. One cartridge closed-loop tape player used to play public service announcements developed a habit of burning out an internal solid state part. With no repair budget to deploy, student staff enlisted the help of the physics department to diagnose the problem and isolate and replace the failed component. When an electronics lab student assembled an Emergency Broadcast System receiver using Popular Mechanics plans and donated parts as a class assignment, station staff appropriated and installed the device in the broadcast booth, and from then on faithfully rebroadcast alerts from the other stations in Kansas City. =KWJC= The 1980s saw two modest upgrades: an ERP increase to 182 watts in 1982, and beginning January 1, 1985, new KWJC call letters, reflecting the name of the college. The station was known as \\"Stereo 91-9\\" in this era. In its later years, the station was \\"The Edge\\", playing alternative music with a broad, eclectic playlist. However, the format came to an abrupt end when a tornado struck Liberty and the William Jewell campus; damage to the college was extensive, with most of the residence halls destroyed. After the tornado, The Edge became \\"Jewell 91.9\\" with an adult contemporary format, after a new professor was brought on board and sought to revamp the radio program along the lines of a commercial radio station. The move also came with a $100,000 facility upgrade including all-new sound equipment; professional radio software, sound and recording equipment; and top-quality acoustic foam. Even though many students were disappointed about the change in format, most appreciated the ability to learn more of how a station operated. =EMF operation= Citing the costs of running the radio station, William Jewell College opted to terminate the Radio Communication program after the 2005-06 school year and lease KWJC to the Educational Media Foundation to air its K-LOVE Christian radio network. On May 31, 2006 at noon, a few sad members of the Jewell 91.9 Student & Faculty Staff said an on-air goodbye and the station was handed over. After Union Broadcasting sold KCXM to EMF, KWJC switched from K-LOVE to the Air1 network on December 16, 2007. That same year, the FCC approved a 1998 application to increase power to 4,000 watts; in 2016, it was approved to upgrade to 7,000 watts. On May 31, 2019, William Jewell College took KWJC silent, citing a loss of programming. The move came after EMF bought K300CH, a translator facility of KCFX-HD3 in Kansas City, from the Calvary Chapel of Kansas City for $515,000, and Air1 moved to the 107.9 frequency, with KWJC airing a loop redirecting listeners to 107.9 and 101.1 HD3. =Sale to UMKC, flip to classical= On August 16, 2019, KCUR-FM, the National Public Radio affiliate operated by the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), announced they had agreed to purchase KWJC from William Jewell College for $2 million, with the intent to flip 91.9 into a full-time classical music station, returning the format to the FM band in Kansas City for the first time since KXTR moved to the AM band in August 2000, which would eventually flip to a business talk format in March 2012. With the move, KCUR eliminated its three-hour weeknight block of classical programming fed from NPR. On July 1, 2020, UMKC assumed control of the station and KWJC returned to the air with a classical music format, fed by American Public Media's \\"Classical 24\\" service.https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=KWJC References External links * WJC Category:Clay County, Missouri WJC Category:Radio stations established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Missouri ","title":"KWJC"},{"id":"9870426","text":"Patrick Stanley Vaughan Heenan (29 July 1910 ‚Äì 13 February 1942) was a captain in the British Indian Army who was convicted of treason, after spying for Japan during the Malayan campaign of World War II. Heenan was reportedly killed by his wardens while in custody during the Battle of Singapore. According to Heenan's biographer, Peter Elphick, these events were suppressed by British Commonwealth military censors. Early life Heenan's mother, Anne Stanley (born 1882), was not married at the time of her son's birth at Reefton, New Zealand. His birth certificate recorded her maiden name as his surname, and did not include any information about his father. A year later, both mother and son moved to Burma with a mining engineer named George Charles Heenan (1855‚Äì1912). The older Heenan is described by some sources as an Irish republican, although he seems to have had a long association with New Zealand, including selection for regional representative cricket teams in the 1880s and 1890s. There is no conclusive evidence that George Heenan was Patrick's father, or that George and Anne ever married. However, Patrick was baptised in Burma as a Roman Catholic, with the surname Heenan. George Heenan died at Pauk, Burma in 1912. Patrick's mother then worked as a governess for a family named Carroll. In 1922, the Carrolls moved to England, and Anne Stanley went with them. Mrs Carroll died a few years later, and Bernard Carroll, who was an accountant, married Anne. From 1923 to 1926, Patrick was a boarder at Sevenoaks School in Kent, and in 1927 proceeded to Cheltenham College, as a day boy, in a stream of students preparing for military careers. Although he was then 16 years old, at Cheltenham he was put in classes with pupils as young as 13. Accounts of his time at Sevenoaks and Cheltenham show Heenan to have been a poor student and ‚Äì in the words of the Dictionary of National Biography ‚Äî a \\"gloomy, resentful misfit disliked by other pupils\\". He nevertheless excelled at sports, especially boxing, due largely to his impressive physique. According to Elphick, Heenan was unpopular with other students at Cheltenham and was often in trouble with school authorities. Although he joined the Officers Training Corps (OTC) at Cheltenham, Heenan did not gain any formal qualifications; because of this, he was not able to be admitted to British Army officer training, when he left school at the age of 19. Heenan instead joined Steel Brothers, a trading company with interests in Asia. Military career In the early 1930s, Heenan applied for the Army Supplementary Reserve, the only way he could become an officer without formal qualifications. According to Elphick, had Heenan's illegitimacy been known, it would have prevented him becoming an officer. He was able to join the reserve by presenting his baptism certificate, along with a certificate signed by his school headmaster, stating that Heenan was capable of performing the duties of an officer. This was endorsed by the commander of Cheltenham's OTC. In 1932, he was placed on the Supplementary Reserve. In 1935, Heenan was commissioned into the British Army, with the service number 547AI. His address at this time was recorded as Cheam, Surrey, England. He was put on the Indian Army's Unattached List, and was sent to India. After six months' training with a British regiment, Heenan was not accepted by any Indian Army regiments. He had to do an additional six months with another British regiment before being accepted by the 16th Punjab Regiment. He reportedly performed well in a skirmish on the North-West Frontier, but was later transferred to the Indian Army Service Corps. According to Elphick, this was a device commonly used to get unsatisfactory officers away from prestigious frontline regiments. However, Heenan later returned to the 16th Punjabs, but to a different battalion. In 1938‚Äì39, Heenan took a six-month \\"long leave\\" (an Indian Army tradition) in Japan. During 1941, as fears of a Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia grew, Heenan's unit was sent to Malaya. He was transferred to an Indian Army air liaison unit and was sent to Singapore for training. Following the completion of air liaison training, Heenan was stationed at Alor Star, in Kedah, northern Malaya, in June 1941. It was in this area that most of the British Royal Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons in Malaya were based. Circa 8 February 1941. Bristol Blenheim Mark I bombers of No. 62 Squadron RAF lined up at Tengah, Singapore, before flying north to their new base at Alor Star, Kedah, Malaya. Heenan was attached to the squadron at Alor Star in late 1941. Japanese forces invaded Thailand and Malaya on 8 December. Mr Sydney Tavender, chairman of the Cotswold branch of the Far East Prisoners of War, and who served in the AIL unit with Heenan, said the Japanese aircraft always seemed to know the correct recognition codes, despite the fact that they were changed every 24 hours. By 10 December, the Japanese had destroyed most of the Allied aircraft in northern Malaya. Heenan was caught during an air raid. \\"When we discovered he wasn't in the slit trenches with us we became suspicious,\\" Mr Tavender reported. \\"We went to his quarters and discovered a radio, which was still warm. That was the last we saw of him. He was arrested.\\"The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, 6 May 1992 The Japanese air raids were assisted by radio transmissions made by Heenan. Among other espionage equipment, he reportedly had a morse code transmitter operated by an alphanumeric keyboard ‚Äî similar to a Traeger Transceiver ‚Äî which was disguised as a typewriter. Heenan was sent to Singapore, and was reportedly court-martialled in January 1942. He does not seem to have been formally sentenced, but the normal sentence for treason by British officers was death. Heenan remained in custody at Singapore for several weeks. The Japanese gradually drove the Allies out of Malaya, and on 8 February they invaded Singapore Island. Within days, it became clear that the battle was being won by the Japanese. In the words of journalist and author Lynette Silver (whose main source is Elphick): :By 13 February[,] Heenan had become very cocky, taunting his guards ... that he would soon be free and they would be prisoners. It appears that ... British military police took matters into their own hands. After cards were cut to decide who would ... [kill] Heenan, it is alleged he was taken to the dockside, where a sergeant executed him with a single pistol shot to the back of the head. The body was then dumped in the harbour. Elphick also says that Heenan was shot at Keppel Harbour. Effects and aftermath Military historian Brian P. Farrell believes that Heenan could not have done decisive damage to the Allies but probably cost No. 62 Squadron some personnel and aircraft. Elphick suggests that the British Commonwealth air forces would have been defeated without Heenan's help; their aircraft in Malaya were inadequate compared to the Japanese and airfields in northern Malaya had been located in positions that were to all intents and purposes not capable of being defended. Elphick added that Heenan \\"must have passed on much helpful information pre-war and he pushed the rate of aircraft destruction along a bit after the war began\\". Elphick also says that word of Heenan's actions spread quickly among British Commonwealth officers, which had a significant effect on morale. By 1998, the families of other personnel listed on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission World War II memorial at Kranji War Cemetery in Singapore were requesting the removal of Heenan's name. His date of death on the memorial, 15 February 1942, was reportedly a standard date assigned to all Commonwealth personnel officially listed as missing during the Battle of Singapore. His date of death listed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is 15 February 1944.

She lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Activist Ducharme was required to use a wheelchair after suffering polio in 1953. She subsequently went into a coma for six months during her mid-twenties,Helen Henderson, \\"'Someone would have loved her and would have cared for her'\\", Toronto Star, 7 November 1997, 1 and for the rest of her life required a respirator. She founded the disability rights advocacy group People in Equal Participation Inc. in 1981, and was the organization's chair for many years thereafter.\\"Disabled want their say at appeal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 January 1995. The organization had forty members in 1995. In 1981, she became the first person requiring an on-board life-support system to fly as a regular passenger on a commercial Canadian airliner. Her flight to Vancouver was the culmination of a lengthy battle with officials from the government and Air Canada, who had resisted her attempts to fly because of medical concerns.\\"Air passenger is first to ride with system\\", Globe and Mail, 3 October 1981, P18. Ducharme was a vocal opponent of euthanasia. In 1993, she asked the Supreme Court of Canada to rule against Sue Rodriguez, a British Columbia woman who had a terminal illness and was seeking the right to take her life. Ducharme was quoted as saying, \\"We believe in the commandment, thou shall not kill. We have enough obstacles that access to life, not access to death is our commitment.\\"Stephen Bindman, \\"High court reserves decision on Rodriguez's suicide bid\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 21 May 1993, A7. She later called for criminal charges to be laid against Member of Parliament Svend Robinson, following Robinson's decision to sit beside Rodriguez as she apparently committed suicide with her doctor's assistance.\\"Doctor-assisted suicides nothing new in Manitoba\\", Hamilton Spectator, 24 February 1994, D14. Ducharme organized a national anti-euthanasia petition in 1994, and received more than 27,000 signatures. She personally presented the petition to Member of Parliament Don Boudria, who later tabled it before parliament.Brad Oswald, \\"Ontario MP makes good on vow to fight euthanasia\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 August 1994. In 1995, Ducharme sought legal standing for her organization to testify at Robert Latimer's appeal of a conviction for second-degree murder. Latimer had killed his daughter, a twelve-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, in an act that many had described as a mercy killing. Ducharme argued that Latimer's conviction should be upheld, and indicated her support for a ruling which gave him a life sentence.\\"Disabled want their say at appeal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 January 1995. She sought legal standing again when Latimer was granted a new trial in 1996, and accused the media of having a pro-Latimer bias.Sandra Cordon, \\"Supreme Court to hear Latimer appeal\\", 9 February 1996. A1; \\"Ducharme wants role in Latimer trial Canadian Press\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 November 1995, A6. Ducharme also campaigned to have several public services made wheelchair-accessible in her home city of Winnipeg. She led a public protest again the provincial government's decision to privatize home care services in 1996,Alexandra Paul, \\"Home care concerns activist\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 March 1996, A3; Bud Robertson, \\"Home-care strike widens\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 April 1996, A4. and later testified before the Romanow commission on health.Thomas Walkom, \\"Romanow gets earful on medicare reform\\", Toronto Star, 7 March 2002, A6. In 2003, she supported city council's decision to legislate a smoking ban in Winnipeg.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Hell on Wheelchairs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 March 2003, A6. Ducharme was a Ukrainian Catholic, and was opposed to abortion as well as euthanasia. In 1995, she was given an Apostolic Blessing from Pope John Paul II.David Kuxhaus, \\"Ducharme receives papal honor for battle against euthanasia\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 April 1995; Helen Fallding, \\"Activist held governments to account\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 June 2004, B1. She was given the Province of Manitoba's first annual Special Caring Award in 1998.Kevin Rollason, \\"Caring rewarded\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 March 1998, A8. Ducharme wrote a self-published autobiography, entitled Life and Breath. Federal cabinet minister Lloyd Axworthy wrote a preface to the book.MHR Connections , Manitoba Human Rights Commission, June 2004, Volume 4, Number 6, accessed 8 March 2007. Political candidate Ducharme ran for the Transcona-Springfield school board in 1980 and 1992, and for the Transcona ward on Winnipeg City Council in 1983 and 1986. She was considered a fringe candidate, and was defeated each time. Ducharme supported Susan Thompson's bid to become Mayor of Winnipeg in 1992, but was later strongly critical of Thompson's record in office.Lindor Reynolds, \\"You can fight city, but city may not notice\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 March 1993. She was Thompson's first declared challenger in the 1995 municipal election.Nick Martin, \\"Duguid to seek mayor's job?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 March 1995. Ducharme said that her top priority was creating a youth advisory committee of city council,\\"Where they stand on the issues\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 October 1995. and she also criticized Thompson for not having done more to promote downtown business.Nick Martin, \\"Sparks flying at forum\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 October 1995, A1.

Mekelle University is one of the largest public universities in Ethiopia. It has seven colleges, eight institutes, and more than 90 undergraduate and 70 postgraduate programs. The student intake capacity of Mekelle University has reached 31,000 or 10% of Mekelle's population. History View of the campus The Arid Zone Agricultural College was established at the University of Asmara, but was then moved to Agarfa in southern Ethiopia in 1990. In 1993, the Arid Zone Agricultural College was moved to Mekelle and started with 42 students in 3 degree programs. After two years, the Faculty of Science and Technology was established at the same campus and, together, these two faculties were then combined into Mekelle University College. Also, a Faculty of Law started its operation by accepting diploma students through a continuing education program. In May 2000, the Government of Ethiopia (Council of Ministers, Regulations No. 61/1999 of Article 3) formalized Mekelle University as an autonomous higher education institution. Professor Mitiku Haile became the first president.

On a nearby hill, the Iyesus church was established. The villagers fetched their water from the May Anishti spring underneath. In 1895, a fort was established on the small hill overlooking the campus, and the place served as a military stronghold, that was conquered by the Italian army in 1935. In 1938, there was a shop-restaurant, a post, telephone and telegraph office, an Italian military post and a military cemetery. In 1938, the village of Inda Iyesus counted approximately 350 inhabitants (including 45 Italians). After the Italian defeat in 1941, the place was taken over by the Ethiopian army, who expanded it into a large military camp. After the defeat of the Derg army in 1989, the place was used for a few years by the TPLF army after which it was transferred to the Ministry of Education for the establishment of the \\"Arid Zone College\\" that would gradually grow into Mekelle University. Popular names of the campus are taken from this history: Arid Campus and Inda Iyesus Campus.  Parks  Mekelle University main campus hosts several parks: * Momona Park, called after a large momona tree (Faidherbia albida) under which the first lectures were organised in the academic year 1993-1994 * Belgium Park, in reference to the longstanding cooperation with the Belgian academic institutions (starting 1994) * The large May Anishti forest on the slope between campus and city.

This means, in order to meet economic necessity, buyers must avoid prices that will drive them into bankruptcy and sellers must find prices that will generate revenue (or suffer the same fate). Market discipline is a topic of particular concern because of banking deposit insurance laws. Most governments offer deposit insurance for people making deposits with banks. Normally, bank managers have strong incentives to avoid risky loans and other investments. However, mandated deposit insurance eliminates much of the risk to bankers. This constitutes a loss of market discipline. In order to counteract this loss of market discipline, governments introduce regulations aimed at preventing bank managers from taking excessive risk. Today market discipline is introduced into the Basel II Capital Accord as a pillar of prudential banking regulation. The efficacy of regulations aimed at introducing market discipline is questionable. Financial bailouts provide implicit insurance schemes like too-big-to-fail, where regulators in central agencies feel obliged to rescue a troubled bank for fear of financial contagion. It can be argued that depositors would not bother to monitor bank activities under these favorable circumstances. There are numerous academic studies on this subject. The findings, at first, had mixed and somewhat discouraging results where market discipline did not appear to be an essential feature in banking. Later studies, though, when including some of the previously missing key aspects into the empirical analysis, supported the existence and significance of such a natural control mechanism unambiguously. Accordingly, depositors 'discipline' bank activities to some extent depending on the well functioning of financial markets and institutions. Introduction Since 1990's there is an increase of interest among policymakers and academics for enhancing the environment for market discipline. The reason being: Financial engineering and technological improvements enabled financial intermediaries to be involved in overly complex and advanced financial operations. These activities become more and more costly to monitor and supervise from the regulatory agency perspective. This is precisely why regulators support the idea of including market discipline as another channel to complement regulatory policies. In a study reported to the Congress in 1983 by the FDIC, the challenge to the possibility of restructuring financial markets is stressed quite nicely: > \\"We must seek new ways, in the absence of rigid government controls on > competition, to limit destructive competition and excessive risk-taking. > There are only two alternatives. We can promulgate countless new regulations > governing every aspect of bank behaviour and hire thousands of additional > examiners to enforce them. This approach would undercut the benefits sought > through deregulation, would favour the unregulated at the expense of the > regulated, and would ultimately fail. The FDIC much prefers the other > alternative: seeking ways to impose a greater degree of marketplace > discipline on the system to replace outmoded government controls\\". (page:3) Therefore, making the relevant financial data publicly available in a timely fashion will, supposedly, help investors to better evaluate bank condition by themselves and as such this will relieve the pressure of regulators and put it on the shoulders of the market investors and depositors. The right amount of information release is essential. With too little information, there is no discipline. Too much information, on the other hand, may cause a bank run which might have devastating consequences. A timely, balanced amount of information is critical for the desired results. At the Conference of Bank Structure and Competition on May 8, 2003, the then FED Chairman Alan Greenspan noted that transparency is not the same as disclosure. Relevant data shall be disclosed in a timely fashion for enhanced transparency: > \\"Transparency challenges market participants not only to provide > information, but also to place that information in a context that makes it > meaningful.\\" Basel II Basel II is a banking supervision accord in its final version as of 2006. It describes and recommends the necessary minimum capital requirements necessary to keep the bank safe and sound. It consists of three pillars to this aim: # Minimum (risk weighted) capital requirements # Supervisory review process # Disclosure requirements The third pillar requires the bank activities to be transparent to the general public. For this, the bank is supposed to release relevant financial data (financial statements etc.) in a timely fashion to the public, for example, through its webpage. This might enable depositors to better evaluate bank condition (i.e. bank probability of failure) and diversify their portfolio accordingly. As such this pillar by itself is believed will enhance the role of market discipline in financial markets. Deposit Safety Nets Deposit insurance in the U.S. was instituted in 1934 to restore depositor trust into the financial markets following the devastation of the Great Depression. It worked quite well for many decades in terms of preventing a major bank run and systemic risk. In the last couple of decades there has been increased criticism about its benefits. Concerning market discipline, one can easily say that mispriced deposit insurance distorts the incentives of depositors to monitor bank risk taking activities. For example, 100% of deposits are under government guarantee (up to $100,000) in the U.S. compared to only 70% in England. Obviously, the depositors in England, knowing that they will lose money when the bank they are investing in fails, will be more cautious than U.S. depositors and will monitor bank activities with vigilance. The question that challenges policymakers is really what an optimal deposit insurance scheme might be.

Previously, he served as chief priest at Hondenji temple in Osaka and Jozaiji temple in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Nittatsu was the first High Priest to publicly criticize Soka Gakkai for allegedly deviating from the traditional doctrines of Nichiren Shoshu and later threatened its senior leaders to remove the Dai Gohonzon from their funded building, the Shohondo, later demolished by his successor Nikken Abe. History The Fujinomiya City General Hospital, where Nittatsu Shonin was admitted before his death. Nittatsu Hosoi was born on 15 April 1902, in the Kyobashi neighborhood of Chuo, Tokyo, Japan and entered the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood in 1910 at eight years of age, training under 64th High Priest Nissho Shonin. In 1933, he adopted a newborn child whom he raised as his own. He was appointed chief priest of Hondenji temple in Osaka in 1936. In 1939, his first biological son was born. Hosoi eventually became the chief priest of Jozai-ji Temple in 1941. He became a senior member of the school's study department in 1946 and became its general director in 1956. He became the high priest of Nichiren Shoshu in 1959. On 22 June 1979 at 5:00 pm, he died aged 77 of chronic heart disease at the Fujinomiya City General Hospital and was succeeded by Nikken Abe. Legacy as High Priest The 66th High Priest Nittatsu Shonin cleaning the dust on the Dai Gohonzon mandala. Assistant priest is general director Nichiji Hayase. The O-mushibarai ceremony inside the Hoanden building. Dated April 1969. Nittatsu Shonin's tenure as high priest was mostly known for the restoration and repairing of the private buildings within Taisekiji Head Temple. He collaborated with Soka Gakkai President J≈çsei Toda during his last years, and saw the expansion of Soka Gakkai during his years as high priest. He lived through the construction of the Shohondo building, later demolished by his successor Nikken Abe. Nittatsu Shonin also publicly criticized the plan of Soka Gakkai to oversee the bookkeeping practices proposed by Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda and vowed to remove the venerated Dai Gohonzon from the Shohondo building if Soka Gakkai persisted in its efforts to exercise control over temple affairs without the priesthood's consent. In 1974, Nittatsu Shonin strongly rebuked a claim circulating among Soka Gakkai groups that a new Buddha had appeared: The Tokohibo building within the Head Temple Taisekiji, where American and European Hokkeko believers stay during their personal Tozan pilgrimages, is one of the best known buildings constructed during Nittatsu Shonin's tenure. He had the Joraibo building, finished in 1972, constructed. He also restored the buildings of Okyozo, the repository of Buddhist texts kept in Taisekiji, the oldest collections dating back from the Ming Dynasty as well as the \\"Ohanamizu\\" (English: Flower-Water) and \\"Akado\\" (English: Spring Water of Benefit/Fortune) where a spring is drawn to offer water for the Dai Gohonzon and all the other Gohonzons in the temple. Furthermore, he also started an expansion of the Ever-chanting Temple (Joshodo) of Taisekiji where 24-hour chanting is observed. This was completed by the 67th High Priest, Nikken Shonin. A copy of the Dai Gohonzon mandala as transcribed by Nittatsu Hosoi on 1 January 1966. Nittatsu Shonin's transcription of the Dai Gohonzon image is notable for its clear print calligraphy and was issued on 1 January 1966 for woodblock dissemination. He was also instrumental in the lawsuit brought by the Kenshokai group, led by Shoei Asai, who accused Soka Gakkai senior leaders of allegedly forcing Nittatsu Shonin to publicly declare the Shohondo building as the permanent sanctuary of the Dai Gohonzon as petitioned by Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda despite the Emperor Showa's not having made the Gojukai Buddhist conversion vow, which Kenshokai considered an absolute prerequisite for such a declaration. As high priest, Nittatsu Shonin affirmed the confiscation of the seven wooden Gohonzons reproduced by the Soka Gakkai, resulting in a public apology on 8 November 1978 by Soka Gakkai president Daisaku Ikeda via Vice- President Takehisa Tsuji, who published the following: Ultimately, the formal apology of Soka Gakkai President Daisaku Ikeda was published in the Dai- Nichiren manuscript released by the Head Temple in 1978: The main entrance to the Myozenbo temple complex, built by Nittatsu Shonin in August 1969. Just before his death in 1979, Nittatsu Shonin gave one of his final audiences rebuking the Soka Gakkai for allegedly deviating from its core doctrines, publicly stating the following at the 18th annual Myokankai audience of believers: After his death, among Nichiren Shoshu believers Nittatsu was remembered as the \\"smiling High Priest\\" for his pleasant demeanor in photos. For a while, the Shoshinkai, a breakaway group of priests who refused to acknowledge the authority of Nikken Shonin as Nittatsu Shonin's successor, had a few Gohonzons transcribed by Nittatsu Shonin that they used for producing copies for about ten years, but they later ceased because of copyright lawsuits pursued by the Head Temple. Today, a wooden Gohonzon inscribed by Nittatsu Shonin in 1967 is enshrined in the main hall of Nichiren Shoshu Myohoji Temple in Los Angeles, United States, and another in the Grand Hodo-in temple Nichiren Shoshu main headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. Nittatsu's cremated remains are housed in a Buddhist stupa (No. 66) in the High Priests section of cemetery at Taiseki-ji temple.

She is known for being the first actress to play the title role in Annie in its pre- Broadway tryout and for her two-year run as \\"Morgan Richards\\" on Guiding Light (1980‚Äì81). She also had a two-year run on One Life to Live (1984‚Äì85). Overview Vigard has appeared in two feature films, The Black Stallion (1979) and The Survivors (1983). Additionally she had roles in two TV movies, Home to Stay (1978) and License to Kill (1984), and also had guest appearances on three TV series. Kristen Vigard released her eponymous debut album in 1988. She recorded and toured as a backup singer with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone in the late 1980s and early 1990s, appearing on RHCP's Mother's Milk (1989) and One Hot Minute (1995) and Fishbone's The Reality of My Surroundings (1991) and Give a Monkey a Brain (1993). Vigard sang the lead vocals for Illeana Douglas for the 1996 film Grace of My Heart, including \\"God Give Me Strength\\", which was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1st Golden Satellite Awards. She released her second album, God, Loves and Angels in 2004. More recently, she was a founding member of the downtempo acoustic rock band New White Trash, which released three albums between 2011 and 2014. Early life and education Vigard was born on May 15, 1963, in St. Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of actress Mallory Millett Danaher and Ronald Vigard, who worked for 3M. In the late 1960s, she moved with her family to New York City where she made her acting debut at the age of 6. She was one of the first clients to be signed to the children's division of the Ford Modeling Agency, along with Brooke Shields and Ricky Schroder. Vigard went to high school at Friends Seminary in Manhattan. She then studied classical orchestration and music listening at the Juilliard School of Music Extension Program. Career =Musical theatre= Vigard's debut stage role was in 1970 when she worked with La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, appearing in A Cheap Trick, playing a carrot in a production starring Holly Woodlawn, Candy Darling and Jackie Curtis. This was followed by a role in 100 Miles from Nowhere, and she appeared with Ruby Dee in The Wedding Band in 1972. Vigard continued performing in theatre, appearing in additional productions with Joanne Woodward and Shirley Knight. In 1976, she created the title role in the musical Annie at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. However, the producers soon decided that Vigard's genuinely sweet interpretation was not tough enough for the street-smart character. After a week of performances, Vigard was replaced by Andrea McArdle, who played one of the orphans. Vigard later went on to become McArdle's Broadway understudy. In 1977, Vigard played \\"Crissy\\" in the short-lived Broadway revival of Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. Though the show met with mostly negative reviews, Vigard received some of the best notices. The New York Times wrote, \\"The very best song of all, and perhaps the best performance as well, is Miss Vigard in the stony and touching saga of a teenybopper, 'Frank Mills.' Miss Vigard looks like an ancient 12-year-old; she sings in a clear, clean style that cuts most satisfyingly through the general lushness.\\" Newsweek noted, \\"Angel-faced Kristen Vigard is the nicest of [the] cast.\\" In May 1979, she returned to Broadway as Johanne in Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan's I Remember Mama with Liv Ullmann. Although the show was the last musical to be written by Richard Rodgers, it received mixed reviews. =Television and film= Vigard made her television debut alongside Henry Fonda in the 1978 TV movie Home to Stay. In 1980, Vigard was cast as Morgan Richards on the daytime soap opera Guiding Light. That same year, she appeared on the cover of People as one of the \\"Torrid Teens on the Soaps\\". She remained on the show for two years. Vigard made her film debut in the 1979 film, The Black Stallion. In 1983, she appeared in her first major screen role alongside Robin Williams, playing Walter Matthau's daughter in The Survivors. Although the film itself was panned by critics, People magazine described Vigard's performance as \\"appealing.\\" She continued her work on television in a 1983 episode of Fame, a 1984 TV movie License to Kill, a two-year stint on One Life to Live as Joy O'Neill from 1984 to 1985, a 1986 episode of The Equalizer, and a 1987 episode of Amazing Stories. =Music= Vigard then pursued a music career, initially singing solo in Paris subway stations before joining the underground music scene in Los Angeles. In the late 1980s and early 1990s she recorded and toured as a backup singer with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone, appearing on RHCP's Mother's Milk (1989) and One Hot Minute (1995) and Fishbone's The Reality of My Surroundings (1991) and Give a Monkey a Brain and He'll Swear He's the Center of the Universe (1993). In 1988, she released her eponymous debut album on the Private Music label. It was chosen as one of the top 100 albums of the year by Playboy and reached the Billboard Top 30. Reviewer Tim Marklein of The Stanford Daily gave the album an \\"A+\\" and compared her to Paul Simon, writing that \\"Twenty-six year old Kristen Vigard may look young, but her debut album shows that she has as much experience merging different forms of music as Paul Simon.\\" In 1996, she sang the lead vocals for Illeana Douglas for the film Grace of My Heart. Vigard's second album, God, Loves and Angels, released in 2004, includes Vigard's performance of \\"God Give Me Strength\\", which was not included on the soundtrack CD. New White Trash From 2009 through 2013, Vigard was a member of the band New White Trash, a downtempo acoustic rock band. Vigard was a founding member, along with Michael C. Ruppert, drummer Andy Kravitz, and guitarist Doug Lewis. The band released two albums, Doublewide (2011) and Age of Authority (2013). Following Ruppert's suicide in 2014, the band announced its intention to release a tribute album. Beyond the Rubicon was released on December 11, 2014. Personal life Vigard lives with her husband and her daughter in Taos, New Mexico, where she has appeared in local plays. In popular culture Vigard's short-lived role as Annie is mentioned in the 2008 film Phoebe in Wonderland.

It was commissioned to ARTIFEX Skatepark Environments in 2004. Design The Skylit Bowl The skylight opening of the Skylit Bowl The majority of the city's other existing skatepark is typical bowls with radiused transitions and limited streetscape elements. In order to provide a large variety of skate opportunities in the city, the Alamosa facility is designed more as a park to skate. It draws inspiration from Albuquerque's world-renowned arroyo system as well as site specific elements in the city that are now off-limits to skating. Various elements are incorporated in a cohesive site plan that reacts to current trends in the sport. Skating is shifting toward site and region specific parks that have more of a campus or civic plaza feel, and this facility is a unique response to this trend. The skatepark has two distinct main areas, the Trenches and the Skylit Bowl. The Trenches is a unique flow area with a mix of banks, ledges, walls, stairs, gaps, and rails in various combinations and arrangements. The majority of the Trenches is poured-in-place concrete with a brick central plaza. The layout arrangement and concrete coloring of this area is inspired by Albuquerque's drainage arroyos and allows users to ride lines or session specific elements. The arrangement also disperses users throughout the park instead of congregating them in the middle. The entire area drains via surface flow which discharges through a replica arroyo section. The Skylit Bowl combines three deep bowls with a ¬æ pipe that has a large-scale skylight type opening on top (the first of its kind). This area of the park is inspired by the backyard pools that skaters rode in the early years of the sport. The bowls range in depth from 8' to 11' and incorporate various horizontal radii to facilitate rider circulation. The edges of the bowls are round steel pipe and granite pool edging. The Trenches and the Skylit Bowl are oriented parallel to each other in an east-west alignment. This configuration fills the shape of the existing site as well as accommodating the natural west to east slope. The Skylit Bowl is situated on the high spot of the site to allow connection to the existing storm sewer system. The rim of the bowls is 7-10 feet above the Trenches, creating a sizeable mound. Between these two areas is a sloped turf grass area for users to rest and still be able to watch the other riders. The mound of the Skylit Bowl also buffers noise from the Trenches to the adjacent properties to the north. The skatepark has multiple entry points which further enhance the concept of a park to skate. Along the south side of the park, an existing pedestrian walk provides access to three entry points; an uphill sloped walk, a down-hill sloped ramp, and a set of stairs. Two rideable walks connect the Trenches to the Skylit Bowl, which is connected to a perimeter walk with a crusher fines path. These connections provide easy internal circulation and a sense of openness to the surrounding site. this is one of the best in New Mexico for vert but has some street skate spots in it Reception The Alamosa Skatepark Envinronment is featured in the Eleventh Edition of Architectural Graphic Standards by the American Institute of Architects. Widely known as the \\"architect's bible\\", this reference book establishes standards for construction materials, methods, and practices. The skatepark environment is included, as one of only two site design case studies, because of its relevance to a broad range of site design criteria, as well as being on the leading edge of a new generation of skateparks.

Many of her works address environmental problems at the same time that they make the functioning of the environment visible. Her studio is based in rural Pennsylvania, but she works on projects around the world. Biography Stacy Levy studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. She graduated from Yale University with a BA in Sculpture, studied at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, and graduated from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University with a MFA in Sculpture.  Work  Stacy Levy uses the language of landscape and art to tell the ecological story of a site, drawing on both art and science. Her projects reveal the sometime hidden natural world in the urban environment. Stacy‚Äôs work integrates art with site design to create memorable places alive with nature and sensation. Her projects distill the essence of nature and reveal its processes to the user. Stacy works closely with building architects, landscape architects, engineers, horticulturalists and soil scientists to create artworks that allow natural systems like the infiltration of rainwater, to function and thrive. Through a lyrical approach to natural science, Levy blends an understanding of sustainable design and ecological concepts and harnesses the ephemeral changes of weather and light with the lasting presence of sculpture. From rivers to runoff, Levy has explored the many facets of water: urban watersheds, storm water, hydrologic patterns and water treatment. Her installation \\"Calendar of Rain\\" creates a year-long record of precipitation, collected daily in shimmering glass jars. Her project ‚ÄúTide Poles‚Äù for the City of Yonkers' waterfront incorporates the use of LED technology to visually manifest the ebb and flow of the Hudson River tide. Her projects \\"Tide Field\\" and \\"River Rooms\\" at Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia offer visitors new ways to become more aware of and engage with changes in the river. Levy has completed numerous rainwater pieces including a watershed rain terrace for Penn State University's new Arboretum, and a rain garden for Springside School with the Philadelphia Water Department and the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. She has public commissions in New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, Tampa, Toronto and Niigata, Japan. Recent works Spiral Wetland =Spiral Wetland, 2013= Lake Fayetteville, Fayetteville, AR Spiral Wetland is an eco-art project supported by the Walton ArtCenter as part of the Artosphere Festival in Fayetteville, Arkansas on Lake Fayetteville. Spiral Wetland is made with native soft rush, Juncus effusus, growing in a closed-cell foam mat anchored to the lake‚Äôs floor. The plants help remove excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from the lake water, and the mat adds shade for fish habitat. Inspired by Spiral Jetty (1970), Robert Smithson‚Äôs famous earthwork sited in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, this spiral is a working earthwork floating on the surface of the lake.

The Hudson River, brushing against the concrete and glass of the urban fabric, rises up and down twice a day with the eternal clock of the tides. This tidal activity connects us to the ocean, to the moon and to a daily schedule that is nature‚Äôs own. Tide Flowers will register the tidal movement with a simple visual presence of brilliantly- colored flowers blooming at high tide and closing at low tide. Tide Flowers is made up of thirty-three flower units, each with six petals, attached to selected wooden piles on two piers. Twenty-five flowers will be placed in a field-like formation on selected pilings at the end of pier 25, visible from both the path and the new park. Eight additional tide flowers will be attached to pilings closer to the pathway to give park users a hint of the larger field of flowers beyond.

The east end of Rich Passage, from a Manchester beach Rich Passage is a tidal strait in Puget Sound, allowing access to Bremerton, Washington, Sinclair Inlet, and Dyes Inlet. It separates Bainbridge Island from the Manchester area of Kitsap Peninsula. Due to the activities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Rich Passage has a high volume of marine traffic. The Seattle-Bremerton ferry, part of the Washington State Ferries, travels the length of Rich Passage on its route. In addition to the many ferry trips each way per day, tugs with hawser tows and various types of naval and recreational craft all contribute to a considerable collision hazard, particularly at the sharp bend off Point Glover. Strong tidal conditions prevail in this vicinity, and deep-draft outbound vessels making the sharp turn may be unavoidably set well over to the eastern shore.

This map follows the USGS definition of the strait. Major islands are named. Rosario Strait is a strait in northern Washington state, separating San Juan County and Skagit and Whatcom Counties. It extends from the Strait of Juan de Fuca about north to the Strait of Georgia. The USGS defines its southern boundary as a line extending from Point Colville on Lopez Island to Rosario Head on Fidalgo Island, and its northern boundary as a line from Point Migley on Lummi Island to the east tip of Puffin Island (just east of Matia Island) and then to Point Thompson on Orcas Island. Rosario Strait runs north-south between Lopez, Decatur, Blakely, and Orcas Islands on the west, and Fidalgo, Cypress, Sinclair, and Lummi Islands on the east. Rosario Strait is a major shipping channel. More than 500 oil tankers pass through the strait each year, to and from the Cherry Point Refinery and refineries near Anacortes. The strait is in constant use by vessels bound for Cherry Point, Bellingham, Anacortes, and the San Juan Islands. Vessels bound for British Columbia or Alaska also frequently use it in preference to the passages farther west, when greater advantage can be taken of the tidal currents.Strait of Juan De Fuca and Georgia, Washington; Chapter 12 - Coast Pilot 7 - Edition 43, 2011, NOAA History Converted LCM-8 landing craft, Justin, on Rosario StraitIn 1790 the Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper and Juan Carrasco, sailing aboard Princesa Real, gave the name Boca de Fidalgo, in honor of Salvador Fidalgo, to Rosario Strait, which was thought to be a bay. In 1791 Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez renamed it Canal de Fidalgo after determining it was a strait. Also in 1791 Francisco de Eliza gave the name Gran Canal de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario la Marinera to what it now the Strait of Georgia. In 1792, George Vancouver explored the region and gave the Strait of Georgia its present name after King George III. He did not provide a name for Rosario Strait. In 1847 Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition, gave Rosario Strait the name Ringgold Channel after one of his officers. Then in 1847 the British Captain Henry Kellett reorganized the British Admiralty charts, in the process removing the \\"pro-American\\" names given by Wilkes and affirming pro- British names and Spanish names.

It was established in 1966 by Joe Gauld, and specializes in teaching character development to students with histories of emotional and behavioral challenges.  History  Hyde was founded in 1966 by Joe Gauld, who had previously worked for 13 years in public and private schools. Concerned by \\"sentimentalist attitude[s]\\" about child-raising, Gauld was inspired to start his own school emphasizing character and discipline. After being fired from a two-year stint of Berwick Academy's headmaster in 1965 for trying to introduce his model of character- building, Gauld opened Hyde on the campus of a former school for physically- disabled children. It was the first school to be founded on character development. Initial expansion plans began in the 1970s, with the school considering sites in the Midwest. In the 1990s, the school was looking for a campus in the West due to a quarter of the student body being from California. In 1996, a second campus, known as Hyde-Woodstock, was opened in Woodstock, Connecticut on the campus of the former Annhurst College. Satellites were also established in Washington, D.C. and New York City were established under the umbrella of \\"The Hyde Organization.\\" By 2016, both the Bath and Woodstock campuses were facing declining enrollment. It was announced in January 2017 that the 127-acre Woodstock campus would be closed and sold to nearby Woodstock Academy for $14.25 million (USD). The consolidation of the two campuses moved Woodstock students and many faculty to Bath, allowed for an expansion of the curriculum and student financial aid, and led to plans to renovate some of the facilities.  Educational model  The mission of Hyde is to build character and \\"reach students that nobody has been able to reach before\\" due to behavioral problems. Due to this, the school focuses on character education, leadership development, and developing student potential. Applicants' academic transcripts are not evaluated as part of the admission process; instead, students and their families take a two-hour interview. As part of the character-building curriculum, all students are required to participate in academics, performing arts, athletics, and community service. Hyde students evaluate themselves against the school's five principles of Courage, Integrity, Leadership, Curiosity, and Concern. Regular visits from parents are required; they also participate in regional groups away from campus. Honors and Advanced Placement courses are offered, though graduation is based on personal development more than academics, with individual degrees being determined by community assessment. Discipline is used throughout the curriculum, with the intention of helping students develop personal values. Strict behavioral rules are enacted and enforced by administrators and the community. In keeping with the brother's keeper principle, students can stop classes and call \\"concern meetings\\" to challenge peers they feel are underprepared. Examples of past disciplinary procedures include corporal punishment, a student being ordered to box a teacher, labor on the school grounds and nearby farms, living in isolation, digging a pit as a metaphorical grave, and receiving a masculine haircut. Some families that have participated in Hyde programs have described the school's methods as being \\"cult-like,\\" \\"brainwashing,\\" and \\"indoctrination,\\" while others have defended them as educational and caring ways to help students mature into adult responsibility. In 2010, the Woodstock campus experimented with banning the use of technology on Tuesdays, in attempt to increase face-to-face communication. Hyde runs a leadership program in July for students ages 13‚Äì18. The program takes place on the Bath, Maine campus and on Hyde's Black Wilderness Preserve in Eustis, Maine.

One of the first English people to learn the Chinese language, Flint broke Qing dynasty court protocol through a direct complaint to the Qianlong Emperor, which led to three years of detention in the Portuguese colony of Macau. In later life, he was jointly responsible for the introduction of the soybean to North America. Biography =Early life= Left in China as a teenage boy by Captain Rigby of the Honourable East India Company ship Normanton in 1736, Flint grew to adulthood speaking Mandarin Chinese. For reasons unknown, he adopted or was given the Chinese name H√≥ng R√®nhuƒ´ (Ê¥™‰ªªËæâ) and in 1739 departed for Bombay and other East India Company run locations. Three years later he returned to China to continue his language studies, for which, according to scholar H.B. Morse the Company provided funding. As a result, some 136 years after its foundation James Flint became the Company's Chinese interpreter and the first such individual in British history. In 1741 he took up a position at the Company factory in Canton where he considered British trade unsatisfactory even though at that time it surpassed that of the French and the Dutch. In 1746 Flint took passage on the Company ship Tavistock and became \\"Linguist to all our Supra Cargoes in general\\", receiving 90 taels of silver per ship and accommodation at the Company's factories. During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748) the Company remained comparatively powerful and expanded its business in China. Nevertheless, its trade volume still lagged behind that of its combined European competitors. Under these circumstances the Company became anxious to expand its trade into China's interior. With trading conditions in Canton unsatisfactory, the British decided to reopen their former trade in Ningbo and other northern ports. =Flint Affair= By the 1750s the British economy had undergone significant development such that Canton could no longer satisfy the trade volumes required by the East India Company. A group of foreign businessmen headed by Flint and already disgruntled by illegal extortion on the part of the Canton customs bureau stood ready to purchase large quantities of raw silk, tea and Nankeen cloth from their point of origin or a port nearby. Between 1755 and 1757, Flint and his associates made successive sea voyages north to trade at Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. Qing officials knew that allowing Sino-British commerce in Zhejiang would undoubtedly bring increased prosperity to the province and spur its development. However, given the length of time that foreign trade had been focused on Canton, a powerful interest group comprising the local Chinese merchants, customs officials and Qing scholar-bureaucrats had developed there. This faction enjoyed a monopoly on trade and its associated corruption and extortion from which it extracted the maximum benefit. They were naturally unwilling to allow any part of their interests in Canton to be transferred to the north. Meanwhile, Zhejiang possessed a number of potential foreign trade ports but opening them up would have the unsettling side effect of creating additional responsibility for local officials. As a result, Yang Yingju (:zh: Êù®Â∫îÁêö), Governor-general of Min-Zhe and responsible for Zhejiang, lobbied officials in Beijing for a prohibition of trade in Ningbo. In 1757, the Qianlong Emperor responded to pressure from his officials and implemented a new foreign trade policy whereby all ships from overseas were barred from every Chinese port with the exception of Canton. Known in Chinese as Yƒ´ k≈èu t≈çngshƒÅng (‰∏ÄÂè£ÈÄöÂïÜ \\"Single port commerce system\\"), the Canton System arose in part as a result of Flint's actions. Flint's complaint in Tianjin With the East India Company unwilling to abide by this new prohibition, in May 1759 James Flint once again left Canton and sailed north for Ningbo. However, when he arrived in Dinghai (ÂÆöÊµ∑), at that time known as Chusan, he found a contingent of the Qing army waiting, who advised him to return south. The next month Flint left Dinghai but instead of returning to Canton he made straight for Tianjin. On 24 June he arrived outside Tianjin and announced himself as an English official of the Fourth Grade (s√¨p«ên, ÂõõÂìÅ), which would place him approximately halfway down the hierarchy of Chinese officialdom. He explained that he had previously traded in Guangdong and Macau but that the merchant Li Guanghua (ÈªéÂÖâÂçé) had not paid the silver he owed. Flint continued that he had complained to Li Yongbiao (ÊùéÊ∞∏Ê†á), the Hoppo (Guangdong Customs Supervisor) and Li Shiyao (Êùé‰æçÂ∞ß), the Governor-general of Liangguang but they both had refused to listen to his grievances so he came to Ningbo. Now, he said, at the behest of British Officials, he had come to Tianjin to request that his complaint be heard in Beijing. The Governor-general of Zhili, whose jurisdiction extended over Tianjin, then undertook to report Flint's complaint to Qianlong. Thus began a diplomatic incident that would become known as the \\"Flint Affair\\". On receipt of the complaint Qianlong responded: > \\"This matter concerning a foreigner and the State must be thoroughly > investigated in accordance with the clear laws of the Celestial > Empire.\\"‰∫ãÊ∂âÂ§ñÂ§∑ÔºåÂÖ≥Á≥ªÂõΩ‰ΩìÔºåÂä°È°ªÂΩªÂ∫ïÊ†πÁ©∂Ôºå‰ª•ÂΩ∞Â§©ÊúùÂÆ™ÂÖ∏\\" The emperor went on to say that if Flint's complaint turned out to be true, Li Yongbiao and the others responsible would be publicly executed. Accompanied by a specially chosen Qing official, Flint found himself rushed back to Canton by land, the first British subject to ever make that journey. The General Commanding the Troops in Fuzhou (Á¶èÂ∑ûÂ∞ÜÂÜõ), Xin Zhu (Êñ∞Êü±), hurried to Guangdong to conduct the investigation. There, he and Qianlong's chosen official arrested Li Yongbiao and Li Shiyao then confronted them with Flint's complaint, which listed seven grievances. However, the Englishman's real purpose in coming to Ningbo in the first place was to break through the single port commerce system and trade there he had clearly stated on arrival in Dinghai that the rear of his ship was packed with silver. While Flint was back in Canton, the British merchant ship Chesterfield arrived in the waters off Zhejiang, but its offer to trade met with a blunt refusal. The vessel's captain then claimed that he needed to stay for a few days to repair the ship's sails but after a short standoff, the merchantman withdrew. Qianlong viewed the episode with suspicion he believed that the ship's arrival was connected with Flint's complaint, which would serve as a distraction while his co-conspirator aboard the Chesterfield tried to open the ports of Zhejiang to trade. The Chesterfield and its crew would never been seen again. Qianlong's decision Qianlong's basis for deciding Flint's case focused on three principles: * If the complaint of extortion and corruption proved true, Li Yong Biao would be executed and the details made public. * Any Chinese \\"scoundrel\\" who had assisted the Englishman in writing his petition would be executed on the spot. * Flint's desire to travel from Canton to Tianjin to present a petition was abhorrent, but Flint should also refrain from informal criticism of state policy. According to written testimony from Li Shiyao, Li Yongbiao had not embezzled any government funds and had purchased goods on his own account for which he had not received compensation. Nevertheless, some of his relatives had taken delivery of goods from foreign traders and failed to pay for them. After deciding that Li Youngbiao had been blackmailed by his relatives, Qianlong stripped him of his position and sent him into exile. Li's relatives, along with other implicated Guangdong customs officials, suffered varying degrees of punishment. The emperor further ruled that the Chinese authors of Flint's complaint were particularly heinous. After investigation and analysis of the document, Qianlong concluded that it had been written in collusion with Liu Yabian (Âàò‰∫öÂåæ), a Sichuanese merchant, and subsequently edited by Lin Huan (ÊûóÊÄÄ), a Fujianese translator employed by the East India Company in Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia). Qianlong then ordered Li Shibiao to gather the Hong merchants in Canton, where Liu Yabian was publicly executed as an object lesson in what would happen to Chinese citizens who aided \\"barbarians\\". Despite Lin Huan's remote location, Qianlong secured his return to face punishment and he too was executed. At the same time he ordered the apprehension and interrogation of any members of Lin's family attempting to leave the country. The effect of the order was such that residents along the coast no longer dared to use their familiar sea routes to Jakarta. As for Flint, for the crime of \\"barbarian\\" collusion with Chinese \\"scoundrels\\" to create a petition that attempted to overthrow the single port trade system, Qianlong ordered him imprisoned in Macau for the term of three years. Thereafter he would be deported from China and banished from the country forever. Had it so wished, the East India Company could have secured Flint's release on payment of a sum equal to $1,250 today; they chose not to do so since it might encourage further exactions on the part of Chinese officials. Aftermath In dealing with the seven specific complaints in Flint's petition, the Qing court outlawed the multiple forms of extortion in the form of gifts from merchants to officials known as guƒ´l«ê (ËßÑÁ§º) or \\"customary charges\\"; Chinese merchants owing the foreign traders silver would be pressured to pay; taxes due on the provisions aboard a foreign ship on departure would be abolished and the system of Chinese merchants standing surety for visiting traders would remain. Although Qianlong's punishment of Li Yongbiao partially satisfied Flint's demands, forbidding extortion and the enforcing the rules of the merchant guarantee system hardly proved concessionary. Furthermore, Qianlong ordered the Grand Minister (D√†ch√©n,Â§ßËá£) for Guangdong to inform the foreign traders that with all the rich produce available in China, there was no urgent need to acquire trifling products from abroad, a sentiment that he would echo several decades hence when he received the 1793 Macartney Embassy. The single port trading system based around Canton would remain in force, thus dashing Flint's hopes for the opening up of Zhejiang. Worse still, in order to keep a tighter rein on foreign traders in Canton, on 24December 1759 the Qing Court proclaimed the \\"Vigilance Towards Foreign Barbarian Regulations\\" (F√°ngf√†n w√†iy√≠ guƒ´ti√°o, Èò≤ËåÉÂ§ñÂ§∑ËßÑÊù°), also known as the (F√°ng y√≠ w≈≠ sh√¨, Èò≤Â§∑‰∫î‰∫ã, literally, \\"Five counter-measures against the barbarians\\"), which amongst other things forbade foreign trade in the winter and forced western merchants to live in the Thirteen Factories. After Flint's release he was taken to Whampoa where he boarded the Company ship Horsenden bound for England. In total, he earned ¬£8,500 from 176066, ¬£6,500 of which was from commission as a supercargo and ¬£2,000 for \\"hardships suffered\\" including his imprisonment for three years between December 1759 and November 1762. =Introduction of the soybean to North America= During his years in China, Flint had ample opportunity to examine Chinese agriculture practices at first hand. As a result, on his return from the East he teamed up with fellow former East India Company employee Samuel Bowen, whom he had met on board the Company ship Success back in 1759, to introduce the soybean to North America. Bowen, possibly with funding from Flint, acquired land in Georgia where he produced soy sauce and soy vermicelli noodles. In 1770, Flint corresponded with noted U.S. statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin on the subject of how the Chinese converted callivances (soybeans) into tofu. Flint's letter is the earliest documented use of the word \\"tofu\\" in the English language. .

During World War II, after Mussolini was deposed and arrested on 25 July 1943 by King Victor Emmanuel III, Italy signed the Armistice of Cassabile on 8 September 1943, ending its war with the Allies. However, German forces shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy, creating the Italian Social Republic (RSI), with Mussolini installed as leader after he was rescued by German paratroopers. The Germans, often helped by Fascists, committed several atrocities against Italian civilians and troops. As result, the Italian Co- Belligerent Army was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. In addition, a large Italian resistance movement started a guerrilla war against the German and Italian fascist forces.See as examples the following books (in Italian): Guido Crainz, L'ombra della guerra.

Factions Map of the Italian Social Republic (1943‚Äì1945). Its territory was the theatre of the civil war The confrontations between the factions resulted in the torture and death of many civilians. During the Italian Campaign, partisans were supplied by the Western Allies with small arms, ammunition and explosives. Allied forces and partisans cooperated on military missions, parachuting or landing personnel behind enemy lines, often including Italian-American members of OSS. Other operations were carried out exclusively by secret service personnel. Where possible, both sides avoided situations in which Italian units of opposite fronts were involved in combat episodes. In rare cases, clashes between Italians involved partisans and fascists of various armed formations. =Partisans= The first groups of partisans were formed in Boves, Piedmont, and Bosco Martese, Abruzzo. Other groups composed mainly of Slavs and communists sprang up in the Julian March. Others grew around Allied prisoners of war, released or escaped from captivity following the events of September 8. These first organized units soon dissolved because of the rapid German reaction. In Boves, the Nazis committed their first massacre on Italian territory. On September 8, hours after the radio announcement of the armistice, the representatives of several antifascist organizations converged on Rome. They were Mauro Scoccimarro and Giorgio Amendola (PCI), Alcide De Gasperi (DC), Ugo La Malfa and Sergio Fenoaltea (PdA), Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Romita (PSI), Ivanoe Bonomi and Meuccio Ruini (DL), and Alessandro Casati (PLI). They formed the first Committee of National Liberation (CLN), with Bonomi taking over its presidency. The Italian Communist Party was anxious to take the initiative without waiting for the Allies: The Allies did not believe in the guerillas' effectiveness, so General Alexander postponed their attacks against the Nazis. On 16 October the CLN issued its first important political and operational press release, which rejected the calls for reconciliation launched by Republican leaders. CLN Milan asked \\"the Italian people to fight against the German invaders and against their fascists lackeys\\". In late November, the Communists established task forces called Distaccamenti d'assalto Garibaldi which later would become brigades and divisionsDespite their name, generally these detachments were not that large, and at their best they counted no more than some hundreds of members. In some cases, there were formations numbering thousands of partisans, until summer 1944 when some joint Italian-German operations would reduce this strength (as in Appendix in ). whose leadership was entrusted to Luigi Longo, under the political direction of Pietro Secchia and Giancarlo Pajetta, Chief of Staff. The first operational order dated 25 November ordered the partisans to: * attack and annihilate in every way officers, soldiers, material, deposits of Hitler's armed forces; * attack and annihilate in every way people, places, properties of fascists and traitors who collaborate with the occupying Germans; * attack and annihilate in every way war industries, communication systems and everything that might help to war plans of Nazi occupants. Shortly after the Armistice, the Italian Communist Party,Leo Valiani said about existence of \\"terrorists of Partito d'Azione\\". . the Gruppi di Azione Patriottica (\\"Patriotic Action Groups\\") or simply GAP, established small cells whose main purpose was to unleash urban terror through bomb attacks against fascists, Germans and their supporters. They operated independently in case of arrest or betrayal of individual elements. The success of these attacks led the German and Italian police to believe they were composed of foreign intelligence agents. A public announcement from the PCI in September 1943 stated: The GAP's mission was claimed to be delivering \\"justice\\" to Nazi tyranny and terror, with emphasis on the selection of targets: \\"the official, hierarchical collaborators, agents hired to denounce men of the Resistance and Jews, the Nazi police informants and law enforcement organizations of CSR\\", thus differentiating it from the Nazi terror. However, partisan memoirs discussed the \\"elimination of enemies especially heinous\\", such as torturers, spies and provocateurs. Some orders from branch command partisans insisted on protecting the innocent, instead of providing lists of categories to be hit as individuals deserving of punishment. Part of the Italian press during the war agreed that murders were carried out of most moderate Republican fascists, willing to compromise and negotiate, such as , , and the philosopher Giovanni Gentile. Women also participated in the resistance, mainly procuring supplies, clothing and medicines, anti-fascist propaganda, fundraising, maintenance of communications, partisan relays, participated in strikes and demonstrations against fascism. Some women actively participated in the conflict as combatants. The first detachment of guerilla fighters rose up in Piedmont in mid-1944 as the Garibaldi Brigade Eusebio Giambone. Partisan forces varied by seasons, German and fascist repression and also by Italian topography, never exceeding 200,000 people actively involved. Nonetheless, it was an important factor that immobilized a conspicuous part of German forces in Italy, and kept German communication lines insecure. =Fascist forces= When the Italian Resistance movement began following the armistice, with various Italian soldiers of disbanded units and many young people not willing to be conscripted into the fascist forces, Mussolini's Italian Social Republic (RSI) also began putting together an army. This was formed with what was left of the previous Regio Esercito and Regia Marina corps, fascist volunteers and drafted personnel. At first it was organized into four regular divisions (1¬™ Divisione Bersaglieri Italia ‚Äì light infantry, 2¬™ Divisione Granatieri Littorio ‚Äì grenadiers, 3¬™ Divisione fanteria di marina San Marco ‚Äì marines, 4¬™ Divisione Alpina Monterosa ‚Äì mountain troops), together with various irregular formations and the fascist militia Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana (GNR) that in 1944 were brought under the control of the regular army.Decreto Legislativo del Duce n¬∫ 469 del 14 agosto 1944 ‚Äì XXII E.F. \\"Passaggio della G.N.R. nell'Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano\\" ‚Äì Legislative Decree of Duce (Benito Mussolini) n. 469, August 14, 1944 The fascist republic fought against the partisans to keep control of the territory. The Fascists claimed their armed forces numbered 780,000 men and women, but sources indicate that there were no more than 558,000. Partisans and their active supporters numbered 82,000 in June 1944. In addition to regular units of the Republican Army and the Black Brigades, various special units of fascists were organized, at first spontaneously and afterward from regular units that were part of Sal√≤'s armed forces. These formations, often including criminals, adopted brutal methods during counterinsurgency operations, repression and retaliation. Among the first to form was the banda of the Federal Guido Bardi and William Pollastrini in Rome, whose methods shocked even the Germans. In Rome the Banda Koch helped dismantle the clandestine structure of the Partito d'Azione. The so-called Koch Band led by Pietro Koch, then under the protection of General Kurt Maltzer, the German military commander for the Rome region, were known for their brutal treatment of anti-fascist partisans. After the fall of Rome, Koch moved to Milan. He gained the confidence of Interior Minister Guido Buffarini Guidi and continued his repressive activity in various Republican police forces. The Banda Carit√†, a special unit constituted within the 92nd Legion Blackshirts, operated in Tuscany and Veneto. It became infamous for violent repression, such as the 1944 Piazza Tasso massacre in Florence. In Milan, the Squadra d'azione Ettore Muti (later Autonomous Mobile Legion Ettore Muti) operated under the orders of the former army corporal , already expelled from the PNF for embezzlement. Considering him dangerous to the public, in November 1943, the Federal (i.e., fascist provincial leader) Aldo Resega wanted to depose him, but was killed by an attack of GAP. Colombo remained at his post, despite complaints and inquiries. On August 10 1944, Muti's Squadrists, together with the GNR, perpetrated the Piazzale Loreto massacre in Milan. The victims were fifteen anti-fascist rebels, killed in retaliation for an assault against a German truck. Following the massacre, the mayor and chief of the Province of Milan, Piero Parini, resigned in an attempt to strengthen the cohesion of moderate forces, who were undermined by the heavy German repression and various militias of Social Republic. The command of the National Republican Army was in the hands of Marshall Graziani and his deputies Mischi and Montagna. They controlled the repression and coordinated anti-partisan actions of the regular troops, the GNR, the Black Brigades and various semi-official police, together with the Germans, who made the reprisals. The Republican Army was augmented by the Graziani call-up which conscripted several thousand men. Graziani were only nominally involved in the armed forces, under the apolitical CSR.F. W. Deakin, History of the Republic of Sal√≤, Torino, Einaudi, 1968, p. 579. The Republican Police Corps under Lieutenant-General Renato Ricci, formed in 1944, included the Fascist Blackshirts, the Italian Africa Police members serving in Rome, and the Carabinieri. The Corps worked against anti-fascist groups and was autonomous (i.e., it didn't report to Rodolfo Graziani), according to an order issued by Mussolini on 19 November 1944. Civil war =Background= On July 25, 1943, Mussolini was deposed and arrested. King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Pietro Badoglio as Prime Minister. At first, the new government supported the Axis. Demonstrations celebrating the change were violently repressed. Italy surrendered to the Allies on September 8. Victor left Rome with his Cabinet, leaving the Army without orders. Mussolini was rescued from imprisonment by the Waffen-SS on 12 September. Up to 600,000 Italian soldiers were taken as prisoners by the Nazis and the greatest part of them (about 95%) refused allegiance to the newly established Italian Social Republic (RSI), a fascist state with Mussolini at its head, created on September 23. This was made possible by the German occupation of the Italian peninsula via Operation Achse, planned and led by Erwin Rommel. After the armistice with Italy, British forces had two perspectives: that of \\"liberals\\", who supported democratic parties attempting to overthrow the monarchy, and that of Winston Churchill, who preferred a defeated enemy to a newly recruited ally.M. Ferrari, Recenti tendenze storiografiche sulla seconda guerra mondiale, ‚ÄúAnnali di storia contemporanea‚Äù, (\\"Recent trends in historiography on the Second world War\\", \\"Annals of contemporary history\\"), 1995, 1, pp. 411-430, p. 419 The parties were reconstituted after September 8. \\"Even in this situation over the months the life of the parties was very difficult in the South during years 1943 and 1944 and above all, they (parties) were scarcely able to break through apathy that characterized local populations\\". The rest of \\"the great majority of farmers referred to the parish structures\\".Vendramini F., (1987) Il PCI a Belluno e l'avvio della lotta armata. Documenti, ‚ÄúProtagonisti‚Äù (The PCI in Belluno and the initiation of armed struggle. Documents, \\"Protagonists\\"), 29, pp. 35-42, p. 37 Resources were concentrated to push propaganda among the masses in the liberated areas, featuring the common denominator of ending fascist support. Prefecture reports confirmed the recruitment of former fascists in the ranks of newly constituted parties. =Events= Wolff's proxy for the surrender of Caserta Fascist units, often sustained by German forces, fought for territory with partisan units. The fascists were strong in the cities and the plains, where they could be supported by heavy arms, while small partisan units predominated in mountainous areas with better cover, where large formations could not manoeuver effectively. Many violent episodes followed, on occasion pitting fascists against other fascists and partisans against other partisans. The Porz√ªs massacre saw communist partisans of the Natisone division (of the SAP brigade 13 martiri di Feletto), attached to the Yugoslavian XI Corpus by orders of Palmiro Togliatti,from La nostra lotta (\\"Our fight\\") year II, n.17, October 13, 1944: ...italian formations entering in contact with Yugoslavian formations \\"will disciplinately stand under Yugoslavian operative command\\" massacre 20 partisans and a woman at the HQ of one of the many Catholic Osoppo Brigades, claiming that they were German spies. Among the dead were commander Francesco De Gregori and brigade commissioner Gastone Valente.Oliva, La resa dei conti, pag. 156 The forces of the Italian Social Republic struggled to keep the insurgency under wraps, resulting in a heavy toll on the German occupation forces stationed to buttress them. Field Marshall Albert Kesselring estimated that from June to August 1944 alone, Italian partisans inflicted a minimum of 20,000 casualties on the Germans (5,000 killed, 7,000 to 8,000 captured/missing, and the same number wounded), while suffering far lower casualties themselves.O'Reilly, Charles (2001). Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation, 1943-1945. Oxford. Page 243. Kesselring's intelligence officer supplied a higher figure of 30,000 - 35,000 casualties from partisan activity in those three months (which Kesselring considered too high): 5,000 killed and 25,000-30,000 missing or wounded.Kesselring, Albert. \\"The Memoirs of Field- Marshal Kesselring.\\" Translation and foreword by James Holland and Kenneth Macksey. Skyhorse Publishing; Reprint edition (January 26, 2016). Page 272. Quote: \\"In the period June‚ÄìAugust 1944, my intelligence officer reported to me some 5,000 killed and 25,000-30,000 wounded or kidnapped. These figures seem to me too high. According to my estimate, based on oral reports, a more probable minimum figure for those three months would be 5,000 killed and 7,000-8,000 killed or kidnapped, to which should be added a maximum total of the same number of wounded [as missing]. In any case, the proportion of casualties on the German side alone greatly exceeded the total Partisan losses.\\" =The end= Defeats at the hands of Anglo-American forces left the Germans, and by extension the Italian fascists, increasingly weaker in Italy, until by April their front was collapsing and their rear lines were only lightly defended. The Italian partisans took advantage of this with a wide- scale uprising in late April 1945, attacking the retreating Germans and RSI forces. On April 26 Genoa fell, with 14,000 Italian partisans forcing the city's surrender and taking 6,000 German soldiers as prisoners. 25,000 partisans captured Milan the same day, with Turin falling two days later on April 28. Mussolini attempted to withdraw to the mountains on April 27, but was caught by the partisans and killed.O'Reilly, Charles (2001). Forgotten Battles: Italy's War of Liberation, 1943-1945. Oxford. Page 243-244. Fascist forces surrendered fully on May 2, 1945 after an agreement made with the Allies on April 30, before Germany's surrender to the Allies on May 7, 1945. Aftermath Following the civil war, many soldiers, executives and sympathizers of the fascist Repubblica Sociale were subjected to show trials and executed. Others were killed without a proper trial. Non-involved civilians were also killed, among them people wrongly accused of collaboration by others who wanted revenge over private grudges. Minister of Interior Mario Scelba estimated the number killed to be 732,See the Atti Parlamentari, Camera dei Deputati, 1952, Discussioni, 11 giugno 1952, p. 38736 but historians dispute this estimate. German historian Hans Woller claimed some 12,060 were killed in 1945 and 6,027 in 1946. Ferruccio Parri said the fascist casualties were as high as 30,000.See the interview with erruccio Parri, on \\"Corriere della Sera\\" 15th November 1997.

Huseynzade graduated from the Baku Art School, then studied at the Saint Petersburg Institute of Foreign Languages. After returning to Baku in 1940, Huseynzade continued his education at the Azerbaijan University of Languages.–ì—É—Å–µ–π–Ω-–∑–∞–¥–µ –ú–µ—Ö—Ç–∏ –ì–∞–Ω–∏—Ñ–∞ –æ–≥–ª—ã - –ì–µ—Ä–æ–π –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–æ—é–∑–∞ =World War II= In August 1941, two months after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Huseynzade was drafted into the Red Army. After graduating from the Tbilisi military infantry school in 1942, he was dispatched to the Soviet-German front line, where he commanded a mortar platoon during the Battle of Stalingrad. Stamp of Azerbaijan, 2013 In August 1942, near the town of Kalach-na-Donu, Huseynzade was seriously wounded and captured by the Germans. He spent the 1.5 years in the German POW camps in Northern Italy and Yugoslavia. In the early 1944, along with two other Azerbaijani POWs, Javad Hakimli and Asad Gurbanov, Huseynzade managed to escape and join the Yugoslav-Italian partisans guerilla corps. During the same year, he became a commander of the special reconnaissance diversionary unit of the 9th Corps' Staff of the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia, where he got his battlename Mikhailo. =Guerrilla Mikhailo= Plaque on building where Mehdi Huseynzade lived in Baku In the middle of January 1944, Mikhailo with the fighters has grasped topographic maps of the opponent. Next month Mehdi in the form of the German officer has made way into German barracks and, having enclosed a mine to fire extinguishers, had blown up the central premise. On 2 April 1944, Huseynzade with another Azerbaijani guerrilla, Mirdamat Seidov, installed a delayed-action mine in the Villa Opicina cinema near Trieste. The explosion killed 80 and wounded 260 Germans, of which 40 died later in hospital. At the end of April 1944, Huseynzade, Hans Fritz and Ali Tagiyev blew up a bridge near the Postojna railway station, which led to a 24-car train crash. In May, Huseynzade and Seidov blew up a casino at Trieste, where 150 German officers died and 350 were wounded. Growing concerned about these attacks, Germans set a reward of 400,000 Italian liras for killing Huseynzade. =Death= On 2 November 1944, returning from a successfully executed mission to destroy a German ammunition depot, Mikhailo stumbled upon a German ambush near the town of Vitovlje, Slovenia. After an unequal scramble with German forces, killing 25 of them, Huseynzade ran out of bullets and used the last one to kill himself. Awards and honors His life and heroism during World War II was described in Imran Gasimov's book On Distant Shores (\\"Uzaq sahill…ôrd…ô\\"), and the movie made in Soviet years by Azerbaijanfilm movie studio.

By a pact signed between her father, who had interests in Gallura, and Gallurese judge, the Pisan Lamberto Visconti in November 1218, Adelasia first married the heir of Gallura, Lamberto's son Ubaldo II in 1219. Pope Honorius III, enemy of the Pisans, immediately sent his chaplain Bartolomeo to annul the marriage, but he failed and the pact between Pisa and Logudoro stood. Ubaldo inherited the Giudicato of Gallura in 1225. Marianus died in 1232 and, by his will, was succeeded by his son Barisone III. Upon Barisone's death (1236) without heirs, also as stipulated by Marianus' will, the Logudorese magnates elected one of his daughters, Adelasia or Benedetta, to inherit. They unanimously acclaimed Adelasia, whose husband could well uphold her right. So they in turn elected him judge as well. In 1237, Pope Gregory IX sent his chaplain Alexander to Torres to receive recognition from Adelasia of papal suzerainty over Logudoro, as well as the lands she inherited from her grandfather William of Cagliari, in Pisa, Massa, and Corsica. At the palace of Ardara, in the presence of the Camaldolese abbot and monks of S. Trinit√† di Saccargia, she made the oath of vassalage and Ubaldo affirmed it, giving over the castle of Monte Acuto to the bishop of Ampurias as a guarantee of his good faith. Ubaldo did not, however, recognise any authority over Gallura other than the ancient authority of the Pisan archdiocese. By Ubaldo's will, drawn up in January 1237 at Silki, Gallura was to be inherited by his cousin John Visconti. Peter II of Arborea became Adelasia's protector. She remarried quickly to Guelfo dei Porcari, a person devoted to the Holy See. He did not live long after, though. At that time, the Doria family of Genoa, Pisa's main rival, convinced the Emperor Frederick II to marry his bastard son Enzo to Adelasia and create a Kingdom of Sardinia. Enzo arrived from Cremona in October the same year as Ubaldo's death and the two were married and titled King and Queen of Sardinia. Enzo left for the peninsula in July 1239 and never returned, being taken prisoner by the Guelphs, an imprisonment which was to prove lifelong. In 1245 or 1246, the marriage was annulled. After this date, Adelasia, saddened and tired of active government and retired to her castle of Goceano. She died in 1259, without heirs, and her territory was divided amongst the Doria, Malaspina, and Spinola families, who all held it from Genoa. The neighbouring Giudicato of Arborea succeeded in taking some land. Sassari expelled its Pisan governor with the support of the Doria, refortified its defences, and adopted a republican model of government in alliance with Genoa, which sent an annual podest√†.

The vertical strata of these sectors vary greatly depending on the geographic location covered and the variety of traffic the controllers work. = North specialty=  Ultra High Altitude Sectors  * BLR 58 (Black Rock Ultra High) - 126.92\\"OU\\" - worked 33-1/2 yrs ZAB North Specialty- retired 7-1-2016  High Altitude Sectors  * ABQ 68 (Albuquerque) - 134.6 * TAN 79 (TANER) - 118.65 * GUP 93 (Gallup) - 120.55  Low Altitude Sectors  * SAN 16 (Sandia) - 132.8 * LAV 17 (Lavan) - 124.32  Low-High Altitude Sectors  * CNX 94 (Corona) - 133.65 = East specialty =  Ultra High Altitude Sectors  * CIM 72 (Cimarron 72) - 128.22 * TCC 96 (Tucumcari 96) - 128.67 * DHT 98 (Dalhart 98) - 132.12  High Altitude Sectors  * TAN 70 (TANER Hi) - 120.95 * KEN 71 (KENTO Hi) - 133.05 * LVS 95 (Las Vegas Hi) - 125.07 * AMA 97 (Amarillo Hi) - 134.75  Low Altitude Sectors  * AMA 15 (Amarillo Lo) - 127.85 * ROW 12 (Roswell Lo) - 132.65 * TCC 11 (Tucumcari Lo) - 126.85 = Southeast specialty =  Ultra High Altitude Sectors  * FST 78 (Fort Stockton 78) - 133.22  High Altitude Sectors  * ELP 63 (El Paso 63) - 120.97 * TXO 87 (Texico 87) - 132.32 * SUN 89 (Sunland 89) - 125.52  Low Altitude Sectors  * DMN 19 (Deming 19) - 128.2 * SFL 20 (Salt Flat 20) - 135.87 * CVS 21 (Cannon 21) - 126.85  Low-High Altitude Sectors  * ROW 23 (Roswell 23) - 132.65 = Southwest =  Ultra High Altitude Sectors  * PHX 65 (65) - 132.45 * NOCHI 80 (80) - 126.22  High Altitude Sectors  * SSO 90 (San Simon 90) - 133.0 * GBN 91 (Gila Bend 91) - 135.15  Low Altitude Sectors  * GBN 42 (Gila Bend 42) - 126.45 * TUS 46 (Tucson 46) - 125.4 * SVC 47 (Silver City 47) - 134.45 * BXK 49 (Buckeye 49) - 125.25 = Northwest specialty =  High Altitude Sectors  * HIP 37 (HIPPI 37) - 134.32 * PAY 50 (PAYSO 50) - 128.12 * INW 67 (Winslow 67) - 133.92 * PRC 92 (Prescott 92) - 135.32  Low Altitude Sectors  * FOS 39 (FOSIL 39) - 135.72 * DRK 43 (Drake 43) - 128.45 * INW 45 (Winslow 45) - 127.67  Low-High Altitude Sectors  * MIA 38 (Miami 38) - 132.9  References   External links  * Albuquerque Center Weather Service Unit (CWSU) (NWS/FAA) Category:Air traffic control centers Category:Transportation in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:WAAS reference stations Category:Aviation in New Mexico ","title":"Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center"},{"id":"9870960","text":"The Battle of Saumur occurred during the last stages of the Battle of France during World War II, when officer cadets from the Cavalry School at Saumur, led by superintendent Colonel , made a defensive stand along the Loire River at Saumur, Gennes, and Montsoreau. For two days the Cavalry School, and other assorted units which had fallen back before the German Wehrmacht advance, held off a German attack. Since the battle occurred after the message by Marshal P√©tain which called for an end to fighting (on 17 June 1940), the event is often considered one of the first acts of the French Resistance. Prelude Modern map of the vicinity of Saumur (commune FR insee code 49328) In the first week of June 1940, in accordance with instructions by General Maxime Weygand to delay German Wehrmacht army units, Colonel Michon issued contingency orders for the cadets to take up defensive positions along the southern bank of the Loire, not that there was any likelihood of Germans getting to the Loire. On 8/9 June there was an air raid against Saumur railway station, which killed three people. A further air raid at nearby Souzay took place on 13 June. On 13 June Paris was declared an open city and a meeting of the Anglo-French Supreme War Council with Churchill and the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud was taking place in Tours, on the Loire. On 14 June the French government left Tours and fled to Bordeaux, Wehrmacht troops entered Paris. On 15 June Reynaud resigned and Philippe P√©tain became Prime Minister. Next morning, through the Spanish ambassador, P√©tain asked Germany for a cease fire and announced this fact over the radio. =Forces= The Wehrmacht troops advancing south across France into the area of Saumur were from the 1st Cavalry Division . The battle therefore set graduates of the German cavalry school against the cadets from the French cavalry school. They had advanced at 45‚Äì60 miles a day. The Germans had 10,000 troops, some motorised, armoured cars, artillery and the usual divisional equipment, whereas the French troops comprised 800 of the younger cadets who had joined the school 3 months earlier, older cadets having been assigned as junior officers of regiments, those teachers who had not already joined their normal units, and any retreating men that could be collected to add to the defence. One of the annual war games played by the students at the Cavalry School was to organise a defence along the Loire River, covering four bridges and a front of . The 1940 game would be at this location, but with live bullets. The French army manual required 80,000 men and several divisional artillery units to cover a 40 km front, the students comprised just 780, although they had acquired rifles, ten old 25 mm guns, 35 machine guns, three World War I-era armoured cars, four 81 mm mortars, seven 60 mm mortars, and two 75 mm artillery pieces by 18 June 1940. By the time battle took place, by acquiring retreating soldiers and some additional units, including 200 Algerian riflemen, 450 men from an armoured warfare training centre, and 210 men from the 1st Groupe Franc under Capitaine Robert de Neuch√®ze who arrived with five Hotchkiss H39 tanks and three Panhard 178 armoured cars, Michon had 2,190 men lined up to face the 10,000 German troops. =Defences= The front comprised to the west, the town of Gennes on the south bank, with double suspension bridges connecting the north via an island. The north bank comprised a levee, which extended east for the whole of the 40 km front, behind which is a lower old flood plain. Small villages built into the southern bank cliffs, overlooking the river and a number of islands in the river, filled the 20 km until Saumur which had another double bridge of stone via the Offard island which is 1.5 km by 0.5 km and was covered in buildings, overlooked by the ancient Ch√¢teau de Saumur. A rail line over a bridge just to the east of Saumur entered a tunnel into the cliffs on the south bank. Another 20 km further east, along which there were a number of small villages, also built into the cliffs overlooking the river and more small islands is the town of Montsoreau with a truss road bridge across the river. Pont des Cadets de Saumur sign Preparations were made to destroy the four bridges, over which refugees were streaming south. Sappers from 6th Engineers based at Angers arrived with lorries loaded with explosives. Barricades were set up and fighting pits dug. The students and troops were allocated into groups of around 20 students called a Brigade. Four or five brigades made a Troop. Each Brigade had a task, some being static and others in reserve were given transport so they could rush to threatened areas. Each bridge was given one Brigade, a section of tirailleurs, a 25mm cannon, two mortars and a heavy machine gun. Between each bridge were two Troops. Communications were established using the civilian telephone system and some old radios. Sadly for the defenders, the river level had recently fallen revealing multiple sand banks and small islands. Men and materials not required for the defence were evacuated south, as were 800 horses belonging to the Cavalry School and the world-famous Cadre Noir, together with their saddles and ceremonial harnesses. Refugees crossing the river were also sent further south. A reconnaissance unit was sent north to try to locate the enemy. The Mayor of Saumur was not sure they wanted to be defended; all towns with a population of over 20,000 had been declared open. Saumur, now full of refugees, possibly qualified, but the army would not countenance making the town open or allowing the population to evacuate. Petain had not received a reply from the Germans and sent a message contradicting a previous message, saying that France had not abandoned the struggle nor laid down arms. Saumur therefore prepared for a siege. On 18 June at 9pm a telephone call was received at the HQ Les Grandes Brises, 800m east of the Chateau de Saumur, warning that the Germans were 20 km north of Saumur. Battle =Centre= Modern map of Saumur The lead elements of the Wehrmacht 1st Cavalry Division, the only horsed cavalry division in the German army, all others having converted to armoured cars and tanks, arrived at the river at Saumur just before midnight on 18 June with reconnaissance units riding motorcycles with sidecars, followed by armoured cars. A 25 mm gun manned by Cadet Hoube scored the first hit. It was the start of the battle that was to continue until 20 June. The French blew the Pont Napoleon at Saumur just after midnight, the Montsoreau bridge at 1:15 am and 1,700 kilos of melinite destroyed the railway bridge to the east of Saumur at 3:00 am. At dawn on the 19th, a German staff car approached the destroyed Saumur bridge and a German and French officer got out and approached the bridge under a white flag. The French opened fire for unknown reasons, the car was destroyed and the two officers lay dead. The Germans brought up artillery to bombard the town. 2,000 shells hit Saumur over the next two days. A number of ancient buildings were destroyed, the civil population suffered casualties and hid in the cellars and wine caves. Telephone lines were cut to the HQ and it was too exposed to shellfire, so that evening it relocated 3 km west to Auberge de Marsoleau, near the airfield. Fighting continued throughout the day with cadets on the island firing at any targets offered. The 25 mm gun on the island scored nine more hits on armoured vehicles. The morning of the 20th was strangely quiet; some students crossed from the island to the north bank and found it deserted, the Germans were presumed to have gone east or west to effect crossings elsewhere. Several French died on the north bank taking the battle to the Germans including Lt G√©rard de Buff√©vent who was posthumously awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur. =West= Gennes and St Eus√®be At Gennes, to the west of Saumur, there was no sign of combat troops until the 19th when Wehrmacht scouts arrived in the afternoon and early evening. As motor cyclists approached, the suspension bridge to the north of the island was blown. The 11th century church of St Eus√®be, on the high ground overlooking the bridge was an excellent view point and a good location for another of the 25 mm guns, however at 8pm on the evening of 19 June, 50 German troop carriers arrived on the north bank packed with assault troops. Artillery began to bombard the island and Gennes, destroying the tower of St Eus√®be and setting buildings in the town on fire. The Wehrmacht then assaulted the island in the river using rubber boats but were repelled by the Cadets and Algerian riflemen by midnight. An engineer, worried that his charges might be damaged by another bombardment, without orders, blew the southern bridge, isolating the troops on the island. The wounded had to be evacuated by boat. Early next morning on the 20th, having been reinforced and with more artillery, the Wehrmacht used rafts and boats to overwhelm the few defenders on the island when their ammunition had run out, but they were unable to cross from the island to the south bank of the Loire, which was still strongly defended by four units of cadets. Moving westward downriver, the Germans looked for an alternative crossing point, identifying a gap that was only lightly held, where despite students arriving and inflicting casualties on the Germans the Wehrmacht managed to establish a small bridgehead on the south shore. Other Wehrmacht moving further west towards Angers, managed to find a point at which they could force a crossing against a different French defending unit and captured the city of Angers. Whilst reinforcements were approaching Gennes to repel the German bridgehead, yet another German bridgehead was established between Gennes and Saumur, threatening to take the town from the rear. The reinforcements were diverted to this new threat. The cadets at Gennes, supported by two tanks, were ordered to take back the bridgehead west of them. By 3pm, the Gennes commander was able to report that they had been successful and the left bank of the Loire was in the hands of the French, but casualties had been high. The German casualties around Gennes were between 200 and 300, killed, wounded and captured. =East= At Montsoreau, after the bridge was blown, it was quiet until dawn on 20 June when the Germans tried a 5:00 am crossing between Montsoreau and Saumur, and despite losses, managed to obtain a foothold on the south bank at Le Petit-Puy but were held back from advancing on Saumur by the cadets based around the railway viaduct. Three armoured cars patrolled the river road east of Saumur trying to keep the area clear of additional Wehrmacht reinforcements rowing across the river and driving them back to stop them assaulting Saumur. It was not possible to eliminate the Wehrmacht as they could shelter in the troglodyte houses in the cliff.Aunis farm near Saumur Aunis farm on the flat plateau 1,800m inland of the Loire River and cliffs was the headquarters of troop leader Captain de St-Blanquat and the troop brigades ordered to protect the gap between the railway bridge at Saumur and Montsoreau and when the Wehrmacht landed on the south side of the river, the unit realised it was in an excellent position to provide a defensible position to block a German breakout and trenches were quickly dug. The position was equally important to the Germans who opened up with artillery from north of the river using an aircraft as a spotter plane. Outlying student units began to attack Wehrmacht mortar positions in the bridgehead that were firing on the farm, causing it to catch fire, suffering casualties in the process. French military infantry officer students from St Maixent had arrived early on 20 June and, initially ordered towards Gennes, were diverted to the eastern sector and sent into a counterattack to relieve the pressure on Aunis, with the backing of the five Hotchkiss tanks of the reserve. The fighting had gone on for six hours with part of the farm on fire and under artillery, mortar, and machine gun fire, with multiple assaults having been made by the Germans, each one beaten back by the students when at 1:00 pm the counterattack from the south was mounted. The German artillery barrage switched to the advancing students and tanks, knocking out two of the tanks. The remaining three tanks pulled back, but the infantry students managed to reach the farm, reinforcing the cavalry cadets. The farm cellar was full of wounded, a second barn caught fire, and the French decided to pull back south before they were surrounded. The Wehrmacht took the farm in the late afternoon. The Germans and their French prisoners then tended to the wounded and collected the dead of both sides that were in the fields around the farm. Among the French soldiers killed was the organist and composer Jehan Alain. He was assigned to reconnoitre the German advance on the eastern side of Saumur and encountered a group of Wehrmacht soldiers at Le Petit-Puy. Coming around a curve, and hearing the approaching tread of the Germans, he abandoned his motorcycle and engaged the enemy troops with his carbine, killing 16 of them before being killed himself. He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery.Aur√©lie Decourt-Gommier, et al.: \\"Alain, Jehan\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed 15 September 2008), (subscription access) Further to the east, the Wehrmacht had also managed to cross the river towards Tours and were advancing south and circling behind Saumur. A bridge at Port-Boulet which had failed to collapse when demolition explosives went off was well-defended until it was captured at midnight of 20/21 June. The German commander gave an order to disengage from the Saumur fight, as it was easier to bypass the town rather than continue against the stiff resistance and incur more heavy losses. =Conclusion= Saumur - √âcole de Cavalerie - Caserne grille A national armistice had been agreed on 19 June; however, it was on the afternoon of the 20th when Germany gave instructions about where and when the armistice would be signed: the French delegation would cross into German territory at Tours at 5 pm on 20 June. Meanwhile, at 9:00 pm on 20 June, with Tours to the east and Angers to the west in German hands and with orders to pull back, Colonel Michon decided the cadets could no longer hold Saumur and withdrew them south. The defenders were exhausted, but those that could made their way south, many by bicycle, to a rendezvous south of Fontevraud Abbey where the bodies of two English kings and a queen are buried: Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine and Richard the Lionheart. The Battle of Saumur was fought on the 125th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo and acquired a special name, La Haie Sainte (The Sacred Line) after the farm La Haye Sainte in the centre of the Belgian battlefield. There was evidence that German officers, posing as Belgian civilian refugees, had shot two cadets on the 20th at Gennes; one of the Germans died later that day and was found with army dog tags under his shirt. A similar problem of spies was encountered at Montsoreau, where an empty house was discovered with a map marking where the defenders were dug in and two men in civilian clothing were found carrying signalling equipment on the south bank. Why the battle took place is a bit of a mystery. The students provided the moral backbone to the defence; their decision to fight was probably because they would not accept the dishonour of simply retreating. The students were backed by other units and there were many instances of outstanding personal bravery, even though they knew it was only hours before the war would end and they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. Many Wehrmacht officers commented on the bravery of the French students. To the French public, the cadets' resistance formed a seed for the rebuilding of French honour. Charles de Gaulle had made his appeal of 18 June and considered the action by the cadets to be the first act of resistance. Max Hastings in All Hell Let Loose describes the battle in great detail and focuses on Colonel Michon, whom he calls \\"an old war horse\\" somewhat affectionately. Aftermath The Wehrmacht entered Saumur on the morning of 21 June, the students retreated, with many burying their weapons before they were captured. The German commander, General Kurt Feldt, praised the resistance of the students in his after action report, in which he was the first to call them \\"Cadets of Saumur\\". The armistice was signed on 22 June at Compi√®gne. Of the 560 student officers from Saumur, 79 were killed and 47 wounded. In total 250 French were killed or wounded. Two tanks were destroyed. The Germans lost 132 killed, hundreds wounded and 7 armoured vehicles were destroyed. The 218 students captured by the Germans were released in the following days instead of being interned, the cadets marched south, in the heat of summer, covering 43 km on 4 July, 35 km the next day as they passed St Maixent, then on the 8th they arrived in sight of the Demarcation Line, after cleaning their uniforms and polishing their boots they marched, singing, across the line to the Free Zone between lines of German soldiers standing at attention. They would be joined by other students as they acquired the opportunity to escape. The school was Mentioned in Despatches at the Order of the Army by General Maxime Weygand. The school became Stalag 181, holding French prisoners of war from October 1940 until June 1942. During the war the town became a centre for resistance, unable to capture some of the trouble makers, the town was fined FF 500,000 by the Germans, but after the war, it was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm, the citation referring to the town being a symbol of French patriotism. The bridges were repaired under orders from the Germans, until in 1944 when Allied bombers destroyed them again in an attempt to isolate the Normandy battlefields by destroying all routes over the Loire River. The town of Saumur would remain occupied until the liberation of the town on 30 August 1944 by the forces of an ex-student of the school, U.S. General George S. Patton, who had been studying there in 1912 under the then Colonel Maxime Weygand. =Memorials= M√©morial de la France Combattante, Le Mont-Val√©rien - Suresnes - France * Saumur - Pont Napoleon renamed Pont des Cadets de Saumur * Saumur - on island, east of northern bridge - to the civilians who died * Saumur - at Hotel de Ville - plaque commemoration Croix de Guerre * Gennes - on island - monument to those who died * Gennes - St Eus√®be church - 17 graves and memorial to all those who died in the battles * Aunis farm - Memorial to those who died near the farm * There are additional single memorial stones alongside roads recording where specific students and instructors died * Other soldiers who fell in the 1940 battle are buried in the National necropolis in Fleury-l√®s-Aubrais (Loiret) a suburb of Orl√©ans The fight for Honour at Saumur is shown on a relief plaque by sculptor Pierre Duroux on the National Fort Mont-Val√©rien M√©morial de la France combattante.

E. Blake of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too\\", originally published as \\"Tip and Ty\\", was a popular and influential campaign song of the Whig Party's colorful Log Cabin Campaign in the 1840 United States presidential election. Its lyrics sang the praises of Whig candidates William Henry Harrison (the \\"hero of Tippecanoe\\") and John Tyler, while denigrating incumbent Democrat Martin Van Buren. Folk music critic Irwin Silber wrote that the song \\"firmly established the power of singing as a campaign device\\" in the United States, and that this and the other songs of 1840 represent a \\"Great Divide\\" in the development of American campaign music.Silber, Irwin (1971). Songs America Voted By. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole Books. The North American Review at the time even remarked that the song was, \\"in the political canvas of 1840 what the 'Marseillaise' was to the French Revolution. It sang Harrison into the presidency.\\"As cited in Silber. Today, however, the slogan Tippecanoe and Tyler Too is better remembered than the song itself. Origin A campaign banner with the \\"Tip and Ty\\" slogan, derived from the song. The song was written by Alexander Coffman Ross, a jeweler of Zanesville, Ohio, in 1840, to the music of the minstrelsy song, \\"Little Pigs\\". He first performed it at a Whig meeting in Zanesville, and it came to national attention when, traveling on a business trip, he introduced it to a Whig rally in New York. Ross apparently never copyrighted the song. \\"Little Pigs\\" itself is not well documented, but the available evidence suggests that there was a substantial adaptation of the score for \\"Tip and Ty\\".Schrader, Arthur (2001). \\"Singing SHEAR History: A Commentary and Music Sampler\\". Journal of the Early Republic. A historical society in Madison, Wisconsin, claimed that a local, the young nephew of future U.S. Supreme Court justice Levi Woodbury, wrote the first verses of the song and that its premiere performance at a Whig rally came at the suggestion of Woodbury himself.Historic Madison Inc. (Feb. 19, 2007) \\"Historic Madison: Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too\\". The Capital Times.Forest Hill Cemetery: A Biographical Guide to the Ordinary and the Famous Who Shaped Madison and the World, 2002 (reference to book content) Woodbury was, however, by all accounts a Democrat, not a Whig, and was in fact serving as Secretary of the Treasury under Martin Van Buren at the time. There were many variations on the song published at the time, especially ones with new verses. It has been called a \\"satirical, expandable text that permitted, nay urged, singers to add their own lines\\". Lyrics Ross's version has twelve verses and a rousing chorus. There is repeated reference to rolling balls and constant motion, and rolling \\"great canvas balls\\"White, Andrew Dickson (1911). The Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White, Vol. 1, online became a physical prop in the campaign pageantry, alongside the better-known log cabins and hard cider barrels. The song's appeal has been compared to that of a great pop novelty song, as against the relative seriousness of most campaign songs. Martin Van Buren is derided as \\"Little Van\\" and \\"Little Matty\\" and his supporters as \\"Vanjacks\\". These are contrasted with the rustic virtues of Harrison and the inevitability of his victory throughout the states. The refrain For Tippecanoe and Tyler too is highly euphonious: it exhibits a triple alliteration, an internal rhyme, and nearly forms an iambic tetrameter. Modern recordings The song was part of the 1968 Off-Broadway musical How to Steal an Election and its cast album, with music and lyrics adapted by folk singer Oscar Brand. The song has been recorded in a traditional form multiple times: in 1960 by Broadway veteran Howard Da Silva on the album \\"Politics and Poker - Songs to Get Elected By\\" released by Monitor Records (New York), in 1978 by Peter Janovsky on the album Winners and Losers: Campaign Songs from the Critical Elections in American History, Vol. 1 for Folkways Records, and in 1999 by Oscar Brand on the album Presidential Campaign Songs: 1789 ‚Äì 1996 for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings, the successor label to Folkways Records. The band They Might Be Giants recorded an alternative rock version of the song for the 2004 compilation album Future Soundtrack for America, using a three verse lyric as adapted by Oscar Brand (from the first, eighth and second verses in Ross's original). Appropriately enough, the compilation was a benefit album for political causes relating to that year's election. John Flansburgh of They Might be Giants has remarked on the song's historical success as \\"the 'Rock Around the Clock' of campaign songs\\" and \\"the 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' of campaign songs.\\" References External links * Category:1840 in the United States Category:1840 United States presidential election Category:1840 songs Category:Songs about politicians Category:Whig Party (United States) Category:American political catchphrases Category:William Henry Harrison Category:John Tyler Category:Martin Van Buren Category:They Might Be Giants songs Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 19th century ","title":"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"},{"id":"9871023","text":"Richard Michael \\"Ricky\\" Blitt is a Canadian born screenwriter, film director, producer, and actor who has been based in Los Angeles since 1994.

It was the sixth of the thirteen cartoons in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. Plot Tom and Jerry are sleeping outside during the day when a yellow bird wearing a red pilot's helmet lands on Tom, waking him up. Although the warbling bird brushes Tom's torso off and reacts politely like \\"pardon me\\", Tom goes after the bird, catches it, and proceeds to beat it up. Jerry wakes up hearing this and goes after Tom by tying a string to his tail, throwing the string over a tree then tying the other end to a telephone pole. After this, he cuts the pole and tips it enough to lift Tom up into the tree. The bird and Jerry then fill a large tub with water, put it on an outside fireplace and light a fire underneath. Tom is begging them to stop as the bird loosens the string. The string releases Tom and he sling-shots into the tub, where he splashes around shouting and screaming in pain, jumps out and bounces away and back (with funny \\"boing boing\\" noises). The bird and Jerry laugh at the fact Tom looks bottomless. After all his fur is back, Tom grabs the hose and chases Jerry and the bird into the mousehole and with a nasty chuckle, tries flooding them out, but Jerry and the bird stop the hose with a mousetrap until the water backs up enough and the bird comes out and pops the hose, leaving Tom tied up in the hose. Tom then tries catching the bird on a telephone wire and almost electrocutes himself, then falls off bashing into a wheelbarrow and into a shed, where he gets an idea. He turns himself into some kind of bird then climbs a tree, but before he could take off, Jerry brings an electric oscillating stand fan over, turns it on, and Tom loses his balance, falls off and bounces away. Next, Tom returns to the house with a box saying \\"DANGER\\"!. We find out that it's a cannon, and while he is trying to take aim at the bird, Jerry sneaks down, drills a hole in the missile, then ties Tom's tail in it, so when he fires the missile, he is taken with it into a tree. As the missile goes through the tree, Tom gets his rear end stuck in the back of the tree and in the front part, Tom's head and feet are sticking out. Finally, in the most memorable scene, Tom takes a medium-sized amount of grass around the outdoor fireplace, sets it in there and sets it on fire, causing smoke to just about blanket the sky. Afterwards, he grabs a lawnmower and mows a strip in the field, then lines the strip with Christmas lights, illuminates them, then waits at the end of the strip with his mouth open. However, instead of the \\"yummy\\" bird, a jet airliner comes down and picks Tom up by his mouth. After the plane flies over the tree Jerry and the bird are in, Tom lands on the same branch they're on. The bird then slaps a sticker saying \\"VIA AIR MAIL\\" on his forehead, kisses him on the cheeks, then Jerry salutes him, while Tom tiredly returns the salute.

He was born in London but raised from the age of five in South Africa, where he was educated. He returned to London in July 1926 after spending two years as a precocious sports cartoonist on the Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg. He quickly established himself in the artistic and literary atmosphere of London. He not only illustrated the works of other writers, but also his own novels. He wrote three plays, composed songs and undertook theatre criticism and caricatures. He acted in British movies including \\"Latin Quarter\\" and appeared in the dying days of British music hall as The Great Daleno. His art was highly influenced by Aubrey Beardsley and many of his illustrations were in an erotic vein. Egan is remembered as the rare original British exponents of art d√©co. He was one of the most famous people of London's bohemian scene for nearly five decades. His career graph was phenomenal, beginning with The Sink of Solitude, the dazzling debut which was a satire on the banning of Radclyffe Hall's controversial novel The Well Of Loneliness (1928). That book marked the beginning of a prolific phase of around six years during which Egan created numerous illustrations and book covers for works of Aleister Crowley, Pierre Lou√øs and Charles Baudelaire. Egan was also a writer, and wrote a couple of novels, which he embellished with his wonderful illustrations. He also made illustrations for the monographs made by his wife Catherine Bower Alcock. Following military service in WW II, he acted occasionally in films, including four for director Vernon Sewell. He died in London in 1984.

The problem  Since there is not a single reference or measurement system for calculating the depth in sub-surface environments, two engineers talking about a single drilling might give different answers when asked to give a measurement of depth. The two main depth references used in the \\"downhole\\" (i.e. sub-surface) environment are driller's depths and logger's depths (also called wireline logger's depths). These measurement systems are recorded quite differently and logger's depths are generally considered the more accurate of the two: * Driller's depth measurement is tied to drilling operations and other closely associated activities such as logging while drilling), measurement while drilling, and coring. * Driller's depth is always recorded, and it constitutes the primary depth system, unless it is later superseded by a more accurate measurement such as the depth from an open- or cased-hole wireline log. * Driller's depth should always have 1) a unit of measurement e.g. meter or feet, 2) a datum reference e.g. rig floor. =Measurement of Driller's Depth= There are several parts of the drilling site to be considered while measuring: * The assembly of rotating parts that goes down the hole, which is a series of drill pipe connections and drill collars, ending in a rotating bit. There may optionally be tools for logging while drilling as well. The length of all these is measured, and this gives the driller's depth at a given point in time. As more pipe is added, and the drilling deepens, this measurement will be updated. * On land, the floor of the rig provides us with a starting altitude, and all depth measurements are calculated relative to it. Since it is unlikely for the height of the ground to change significantly during drilling, this is assumed to be absolute. * Offshore, this absolute datum must be independent of the tide. Common absolute datum include (lowest astronomical tide) and mean sea level). This is most relevant for wells drilled from floating rigs, where the potential for error is greatest. In practice, driller's depth measurement is a manual operation, not changed significantly over the years and there are many facets of the system with potential to introduce errors and inconsistencies. This process was first described by Reistle and Sikes in 1938,Reistle, C. E., Jr., and Sikes, S. T., Jr., Well-depth measurements, Am. Petroleum Inst. Drilling and Production Practice, 1938, p. 80‚Äì95 and has not changed significantly. =Measuring drill string length=  Lack of uniformity of drill pipe  The bulk of the drill string is drill pipe which has a nominal length of 9.6 meter per pipe section, however, in reality, not all pipes are the same length. Weakened or damaged ends of a pipe section will be reworked, resulting in reduced length. Steel pipe has a \\"male\\" connection at one end (called the pin) and a \\"female\\" connection at the other end (called the box) and as each section of pipe is lowered into the hole it is connected to the pipe preceding it by threading together the male and female components. Drill pipe connections (or drill pipe/collar, or collar/bit and any other connection) must have a very good sealing surface because high pressure mud will be traveling through the pipe and any pitted or galled areas could be quickly eroded out. This is usually referred to as a wash-out, or words to that effect, and can occur in any part of the drill string or bottom hole assembly. Because of this pipe is routinely inspected before and after use. Any imperfections are eliminated one of two actions: # A \\"Chase and Face\\", where a thin section is shaved off the end of the pipe, and the box, or pin, is re- threaded resulting in pipe length reduction # A \\"Re-cut\\", where the pipe threads are effectively moved further down, again resulting in reduced overall length Different methods of measuring the drill pipe length also have a significant effect on the accuracy of the measurement made. Pipe \\"strapping\\" is commonly used to define drill pipe length, where the pipe is measured on the pipe racks using a (steel) measure tape. These results are noted in a tally book, and the drillstring length is hence defined. However, the accuracy of this measurement method is limited by the application of the steel tape correctly, the reading accuracy, and a host of environmental issues. A significant improvement to drill pipe measurement accuracy is provided using laser, and accuracies can be easily improved by around factor 4. It is also important to note the calibration conditions so that corrections can be applied based on these calibration conditions. This is specifically true for temperature when defining the thermal elongation.Bolt H. Along-hole Depth Rev 5.1, ICT Europe, , available through www.lulu.com, accessed November 2018.  Tracking of drill pipe length used  Tracking and recording of drill pipe at the rig site starts when individual joints are picked up. Joint numbers are manually marked on the side of the pipe. Typically three sections of pipe are joined together into a stand (of about 27‚Äì29 m in length) and stacked in rows of 10, with their base resting on the drill floor. Prior to running in the hole each stand is manually measured with a steel tape measure and the measurement recorded in a computer spreadsheet (previously a pipe tally book was used) alongside the stand number. To confirm at any stage what depth the drill bit is operating at, the driller consults the pipe tally records, and measures the length of the current stand of drill pipe below the rig floor. = Measurement errors due to bottom-hole assembly = Another potential area for error is the bottom hole assembly. This consists of the drill bit, drill collars and stabilizers. It can also include a downhole motor, tools for measurement while drilling and logging while drilling. Errors come about if the total bottom hole assemblyis not correctly measured or recorded. Bottom hole assembly changes may be made during operations and if these changes are not recorded then the depths will be incorrect. Ideally the bottom hole assembly is operated to minimize \\"sagging\\" within the borehole. Pipe stretch and compression will occur from time to time but are not corrected for during normal operations, even though they can introduce fairly significant cumulative errors on driller's depth, particularly in deep wells or in areas of hard rock. Dealing with driller depth errors If exploration derived prognosticated depths are significantly different from the driller's depths, for example by 10‚àí30 m, then warning bells come up ‚Äì it is possible a pipe section or stand has been left off the calculations. If this is suspected, then the drill string should be measured (in tension) when the string is next pulled out of the hole, and the results checked with the tally. Mudloggers should be vigilant, as they provide the opportunity to cross check with the drilling company. An important aspect in this is identifying the required accuracy for the logged driller's depths. If drillers and geologists are \\"OK\\" with (for example, +/- 15 m) at these depths, but later the reservoir engineers trying to map fluid water contacts require a higher level of precision (for example, +/- 3 m), then by the time the drilling is finished the higher level of accuracy cannot be recreated. This leads to the concept of true along-hole depth, where the measurements made are defined using the accuracy of the pipe length calibration method and (if any) the accuracy of the corrections applied the correction methodology. One methodology that has been introduced is called Driller Way-point Depth (patent applied)Bolt H., A Method for Determining Well Depth, Driller's Way-point Depth Ltd., International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2018/000030, February 2017 which results in true along-hole depth. The measurement uncertainty is then a combination of the drill pipe length measurement accuracy, how accurately the correction parameters are measured, and the fidelity of the correction model applied. Examples For some deep wells, e.g. 7000 m or 25000 ft deep, the drill pipe elongation due to its own weight and temperature must be taken into account. This can be on the order of 24 m (80 ft). Wireline does not behave this way: it tends to lengthen under tension but shorten with increasing temperature. One can only assume by how much this net effect varies. Wireline depth correction for temperature and tension has been around since before the days of computer data acquisition, and is generally seen as reliable. Based on experience, the impact on a geological model previously based on wireline depth, when drilling at greater than 7,000 m and using logging while drilling (driller's) depths, can introduce differences in marker depths of up to 25 m (80 ft): the driller's depths are consistently higher than the more reliable wireline depths. The driller's survey do not call this elongation an uncertainty but rather call it bias or error. For the example above, in addition to the 25 m (+80 ft) bias, there would be about ¬± 3 m/12 ft to 10 m/30 ft residual uncertainty depending on hole inclination. There are a few in the industry who know how to correct for this real time and some service companies have developed conceptual or prototype tools/processes to account for this elongation effect. In future, these corrections should become standard practice for the industry, but they are not . The determination of an accurate depth has not traditionally been a popular area of research primarily because of lack of recognition of the impact that depth measurement inaccuracy has on the value of the depth data. The impact of errors in depth is most critical when integrating data from more than one well, e.g. to build a reservoir model. This impact, however, is usually apparent only long after the depth measurement process has occurred and is not seen as being an issue during the well construction. Recognition of the value of depth measurement accuracy at the planning stages of drilling, and then during the drilling process itself, is a precursor to achieving improving accuracy.Bolt H., What Depth ?

The oldest record of the Nippenburg's existence is from the Codex Hirsaugiensis of 1160, making it among the very oldest castles in the vicinity of Stuttgart. Today, all that remains of the castle is the high curtain wall and outer bailey, and a large barn built in 1483 thanks to a short lived effort in the early 1980s to restore these items. History The Nippenburg was built by a local family of Knights in the Twelfth Century,Theurer, von Ertingen, p. 11 though it could have been originally built in the 9th Century. In the 17th Century, the castle was positioned favorably: lying on a mountain spur over-half the Glems valley and built in direct proximity to the manor-house lock Nippenburg. In following centuries the castle was heavily quarried and abandoned. The ruins are with high walls and fortifications as well as a substantial scrub. In the 1980s, the building was partially restored to its 1483 condition. Nippenburg Castle was probably built for military purposes in the 12th centuryHelmut Theurer: The Nippenburg, its history and its genders, 2nd supplemented edition, K. M. Leutrum von Ertingen, Schwieberdingen 1998, p. 11. by a local noble family. It is considered the oldest castle ruin in the Stuttgart area. The castle was first mentioned in documents in the Codex Hirsaugiensis, which testifies to a mill built by a berwart \\"below the Nippenburg\\" for 1160.Helmut Theurer: Die Nippenburg, ihre Geschichte und ihre Geschlechter, p. 11, quoting the Hirsauer Donation Book Codex Hirsaugiensis in den W√ºrttembergischen Geschichtsquellen, which dates from the 12th century. Vol. I. Stuttgart 1887: When in 1160 Berwart built a mill below the Nippenburg for the benefit of the monastery. The mentioned Berwart (or Berwardus) was later provost of the Hirsau monastery and was first mentioned in 1157. In 1283, a prominent rendezvous took place at the Nippenburg: Guests of Frederick of Nippenburg (dictus Urrus de Nippenburc) were the Lower Swabian imperial bailiff Count Albrecht II. of Hohenberg, Count Eberhard I. of W√ºrttemberg, Count Konrad III. von Vaihingen and the provost Dietrich von Beutelsbach as well as numerous clergymen, noblemen and ministers mainly from the area between Sindelfingen and Pforzheim, who all testified to a comparison of the inheritance of the lords of Nippenburg and the lords of Enzberg around the castle Kapfenhart near Weissach.W√ºrttembergisches Urkundenbuch Volume VIII, No. 3284, page 420f WUB online. The original castle complex of the lords of Nippenburg has been extended several times over the years. For example, the kennel in front of the curtain wall dates from the first half of the 14th century. The outer bailey with the massive barn still preserved today was built towards the end of the 15th century. Due to the newly developed explosive projectiles and the resulting replacement of catapults with mortars and cannons, the castle complexes could no longer offer the inhabitants sufficient protection. Since the castles were only cold, wet and uncomfortable to live in, they were increasingly abandoned. Around 1600 the construction of the manor house Schloss Nippenburg above the castle complex was therefore begun, which was extended and altered in the 18th and 19th centuries. When Wilhelm, the last knight of Nippenburg, built the manor house, he had stones broken out of the castle and used them as building material for his new manor house. After the castle itself was inhabited until about 1700, it was left to decay in the following centuries. At what point in time the castle was completely abandoned as a place of residence and protection cannot be exactly determined. For example, a stove plate from 1770 found during restoration work indicates that the castle was still partially inhabited later. However, correspondence between the bailiffs of Grueningen and Leonberg, who fought in 1647 and 1648 over well-preserved boards and beams of the Nippenburg, shows that parts of the buildings within the castle had already been abandoned at this time and that the remaining remains of the castle were used until it was finally only a ruin. Over time, ivy and shrubs covered the remains of the walls. Only the storerooms and storerooms of the castle were used by the inhabitants of the manor house for a long time. In the 1960s and 1970s the plan to restore the desolate walls matured. To preserve the castle ruins, extensive restoration measures were carried out on the walls, which were in danger of collapsing, between 1979 and 1984. The costs for this were borne by the State Monument Office of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, the municipality of Schwieberdingen, the current owner, Count Leutrum, and the district of Ludwigsburg. Today the ruins of Nippenburg Castle are a popular destination for excursions.Helmut Theurer: The Nippenburg, its history and its genders, S. 11 ff.

The under parts are buff streaked with black and brown on the breast, with barring to the flanks. Its crown is black streaked with buff and the throat is white. The overall hue in colour varies greatly over its range; in part caused by the differences in soil at the specific localities.

In Argentina they seem to eat more of the animal matter then they do in other locations. =Reproduction= This species can reproduce rapidly, as the female is mature within 2 months and can have five to six broods per year. The male does not mature as fast. The male will incubate the eggs and raise the chicks. Like most tinamous, its eggs have a spectacular glossy porcelain- like shell.

Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F.

This process has several degrees of freedom and there are many strategies for transforming images to the common plane. *It is used in computer stereo vision to simplify the problem of finding matching points between images (i.e. the correspondence problem). *It is used in geographic information systems to merge images taken from multiple perspectives into a common map coordinate system. A camera (red) rotates about the blue axis by 5¬∞ to 90¬∞ (green), as the images are rectified by projection to the virtual image plane (blue). The virtual plane must be parallel to the stereo baseline (orange) and for visualization is located in the center of rotation. In this case, rectification is achieved by a virtual rotation of the red and green image planes, respectively, to be parallel to the stereo baseline.  In computer vision right Computer stereo vision takes two or more images with known relative camera positions that show an object from different viewpoints. For each pixel it then determines the corresponding scene point's depth (i.e. distance from the camera) by first finding matching pixels (i.e. pixels showing the same scene point) in the other image(s) and then applying triangulation to the found matches to determine their depth. Finding matches in stereo vision is restricted by epipolar geometry: Each pixel's match in another image can only be found on a line called the epipolar line. If two images are coplanar, i.e. they were taken such that the right camera is only offset horizontally compared to the left camera (not being moved towards the object or rotated), then each pixel's epipolar line is horizontal and at the same vertical position as that pixel. However, in general settings (the camera did move towards the object or rotate) the epipolar lines are slanted. Image rectification warps both images such that they appear as if they have been taken with only a horizontal displacement and as a consequence all epipolar lines are horizontal, which slightly simplifies the stereo matching process. Note however, that rectification does not fundamentally change the stereo matching process: It searches on lines, slanted ones before and horizontal ones after rectification. Image rectification is also an equivalent (and more often used) alternative to perfect camera coplanarity. Even with high- precision equipment, image rectification is usually performed because it may be impractical to maintain perfect coplanarity between cameras. Image rectification can only be performed with two images at a time and simultaneous rectification of more than two images is generally impossible. = Transformation = If the images to be rectified are taken from camera pairs without geometric distortion, this calculation can easily be made with a linear transformation. X & Y rotation puts the images on the same plane, scaling makes the image frames be the same size and Z rotation & skew adjustments make the image pixel rows directly line up. The rigid alignment of the cameras needs to be known (by calibration) and the calibration coefficients are used by the transform. In performing the transform, if the cameras themselves are calibrated for internal parameters, an essential matrix provides the relationship between the cameras. The more general case (without camera calibration) is represented by the fundamental matrix. If the fundamental matrix is not known, it is necessary to find preliminary point correspondences between stereo images to facilitate its extraction. = Algorithms = There are three main categories for image rectification algorithms: planar rectification, cylindrical rectification and polar rectification. = Implementation details = All rectified images satisfy the following two properties: * All epipolar lines are parallel to the horizontal axis. * Corresponding points have identical vertical coordinates. In order to transform the original image pair into a rectified image pair, it is necessary to find a projective transformation H. Constraints are placed on H to satisfy the two properties above. For example, constraining the epipolar lines to be parallel with the horizontal axis means that epipoles must be mapped to the infinite point [1,0,0]T in homogeneous coordinates. Even with these constraints, H still has four degrees of freedom. It is also necessary to find a matching H' to rectify the second image of an image pair. Poor choices of H and H' can result in rectified images that are dramatically changed in scale or severely distorted. There are many different strategies for choosing a projective transform H for each image from all possible solutions. One advanced method is minimizing the disparity or least-square difference of corresponding points on the horizontal axis of the rectified image pair. Another method is separating H into a specialized projective transform, similarity transform, and shearing transform to minimize image distortion. One simple method is to rotate both images to look perpendicular to the line joining their collective optical centers, twist the optical axes so the horizontal axis of each image points in the direction of the other image's optical center, and finally scale the smaller image to match for line-to-line correspondence. This process is demonstrated in the following example. = Example = Model used for image rectification example. 3D view of example scene. The first camera's optical center and image plane are represented by the green circle and square respectively. The second camera has similar red representations. Set of 2D images from example. The original images are taken from different perspectives (row 1). Using systematic transformations from the example (rows 2 and 3), we are able to transform both images such that corresponding points are on the same horizontal scan lines (row 4). Our model for this example is based on a pair of images that observe a 3D point P, which corresponds to p and p' in the pixel coordinates of each image. O and O' represent the optical centers of each camera, with known camera matrices M=K[I~ 0] and M'=K'[R~ T] (we assume the world origin is at the first camera). We will briefly outline and depict the results for a simple approach to find a H and H' projective transformation that rectify the image pair from the example scene. First, we compute the epipoles, e and e' in each image: : e=M \\\\begin{bmatrix} O' \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} =M\\\\begin{bmatrix} -R^T T \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = K[I~ 0]\\\\begin{bmatrix} -R^T T \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = -KR^T T : e'=M'\\\\begin{bmatrix} O \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = M'\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = K'[R~T]\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = K'T Second, we find a projective transformation H1 that rotates our first image to be perpendicular to the baseline connecting O and O' (row 2, column 1 of 2D image set). This rotation can be found by using the cross product between the original and the desired optical axes. Next, we find the projective transformation H2 that takes the rotated image and twists it so that the horizontal axis aligns with the baseline. If calculated correctly, this second transformation should map the e to infinity on the x axis (row 3, column 1 of 2D image set). Finally, define H=H_2H_1 as the projective transformation for rectifying the first image. Third, through an equivalent operation, we can find H' to rectify the second image (column 2 of 2D image set). Note that H'1 should rotate the second image's optical axis to be parallel with the transformed optical axis of the first image. One strategy is to pick a plane parallel to the line where the two original optical axes intersect to minimize distortion from the reprojection process. In this example, we simply define H' using the rotation matrix R and initial projective transformation H as H' = HR^T. Finally, we scale both images to the same approximate resolution and align the now horizontal epipoles for easier horizontal scanning for correspondences (row 4 of 2D image set). Note that it is possible to perform this and similar algorithms without having the camera parameter matrices M and M' . All that is required is a set of seven or more image to image correspondences to compute the fundamental matrices and epipoles.  In geographic information system  Image rectification in GIS converts images to a standard map coordinate system. This is done by matching ground control points (GCP) in the mapping system to points in the image. These GCPs calculate necessary image transforms. Primary difficulties in the process occur *when the accuracy of the map points are not well known *when the images lack clearly identifiable points to correspond to the maps. The maps that are used with rectified images are non-topographical. However, the images to be used may contain distortion from terrain. Image orthorectification additionally removes these effects. Image rectification is a standard feature available with GIS software packages.

Meinberg (January 11, 1889 - April 15, 1975) was a 20th-century Catholic priest in the United States who served as the seventh president of St. Ambrose College in Davenport, Iowa from 1937 to 1940. He is included by the Diocese of Davenport on a list of credibly accused abusers for the alleged abuse of at least four minors. Biography Meinberg was born on January 11, 1889 in Keokuk, Iowa. He was educated at St. Francis School and St. Peter‚Äôs High School, both in Keokuk, and St. Ambrose College. He went on to St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary in Baltimore. He was ordained on May 30, 1914 at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport by Bishop James Davis. He holds a Master‚Äôs Degree from The Catholic University of America. He also did graduate work at the University of Iowa and the University of Notre Dame. He became a member to the faculty at St. Ambrose College after his ordination to the priesthood. In his early years, Meinberg served as the head of the library, and was also the director of the choir and the orchestra. He taught in the departments of religion and Spanish, and eventually became the head of the history department and the campus spiritual director before becoming president. He served as the college president from November 1937 until February 1940. In 1939 Pope Pius XII named Meinberg a Domestic Prelate, upon the nomination of Bishop Henry Rohlman. After leaving the presidency, Msgr. Meinberg became the pastor of St. Mary‚Äôs Church in Iowa City. His predecessor at St. Mary‚Äôs was Msgr. A.J. Schulte, the first president of St. Ambrose. During his 27 years as pastor the rectory and convent were renovated, and the church was redecorated. The parish celebrated its centennial in 1941. St. Mary‚Äôs High School merged with St. Patrick‚Äôs High School, upon the directive of Bishop Ralph L. Hayes, and created Regina High School. He also served as dean of the Iowa City Deanery. Msgr. Meinberg retired in August 1967 to St. Ambrose College. He died there on April 15, 1975 at the age of 86. He had two funerals one in Christ the King Chapel at St. Ambrose and one at St. Mary‚Äôs.

Three of the surviving ones are signed. Joan of Arc did not come from a place called Arc, but was born and raised in the village of Domr√©my in what was then the northeastern frontier of the Kingdom of France.Domr√©my was a king's territory, but the parish depended on the bishop of Toul, who was a lord of the Holy Roman Empire. In the English language her first name has been repeated as Joan since the fifteenth century because that was the only English equivalent for the feminine form of John during her lifetime. Her surviving signatures are all spelled Jehanne without surname. In French her name is today always rendered as Jeanne d'Arc, reflecting the modern spelling of her first name. The surname of Arc is a translation of d'Arc, which itself is a nineteenth-century French approximation of her father's name. Apostrophes were never used in fifteenth-century French surnames, which sometimes leads to confusion between place names and other names that begin with the letter D. Based on Latin records, which do reflect a difference, her father's name was more likely Darc. Spelling was also phonetic and original records produce his surname in at least nine different forms, such as Dars, Day, Darx, Dare, Tarc, Tart or Dart.Pernoud and Clin, pp. 220‚Äì221Donald Spoto: Joan - The Mysterious Life of the Heretic Who Became a Saint (2007) To further complicate matters, surnames were not universal in the fifteenth century and surname inheritance did not necessarily follow modern patterns. Joan of Arc testified at her trial that the local custom in her native region was for girls to use their mothers' surname. Joan's mother was known both as Isabelle Rom√©e and Isabelle de Vouthon. No surviving record from Joan's lifetime shows that she used either her mother's or her father's surname, but she often referred to herself as la Pucelle, which roughly translates as the Maiden. Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, when Jeanne d'Arc and Joan of Arc became standard, literature and artistic works that refer to her often describe her as la Pucelle or the Maid of Orl√©ans. Her native village has been renamed Domr√©my-la-Pucelle in reflection of that tradition. Her given name is sometimes referred to as \\"Jeanneton\\". Joan appears, in a negative light, in William Shakespeare's late sixteenth-century play Henry VI, Part 1. In the play she is referred to mainly as Joan La Pucelle and Joan, but also twice as Joan of Arc.  De Quincey on the name (1847)  > \\"Now, the worshipful reason of modern France for disturbing the old received > spelling, is‚Äìthat Jean Hordal, a descendant of La Pucelle's brother, spelled > the name Darc, in 1612. But what of that? Beside the chances that M. Hordal > might be a gigantic blockhead, it is notorious that what small matter of > spelling Providence had thought fit to disburse amongst man in the > seventeenth century, was all monopolized by printers: in France, much more > so.\\" Thomas De Quincey, Joan of Arc  In Latin  In the bull of her canonization, Divina Disponente of 16 May 1920, Pope Benedict XV consistently gave her name in Latin as \\"Ioanna de Arc\\", \\"Ioanna\\" being the feminine nominative singular form of Ioannes.Pope Benedict XV, Divina Disponente (Latin), 16 May 1920, http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xv/la/bulls/documents/hf_ben- xv_bulls_19200516_divina-disponente.html. Although it has been given elsewhere as \\"Ioanna Arcensis\\", \\"Arcensis\\" being in the nominative case and denoting \\"of Arc\\", Roman Catholic saints denominated toponymically in Latin generally are denominated \\"de\\" (which takes the ablative case) followed by the toponym, though, in post-classical Latin usage, \\"de\\" was used patronymically on occasion as well. In any case, in translating foreign names that did not have commonly recognized Latin equivalents, the oblique forms of the native names were also used on occasion. Due to the ambiguous meaning of the surname, the Latin \\"de Arc\\" is likely not a true toponym, but rather the Latinization of \\"d'Arc\\", despite the absence of apostrophes in French surnames during the life of St. Joan.

Demaine, Dion Harmon, John Iacono, and Mihai PƒÉtra»ôcu in 2004. It is named after Buenos Aires, of which the tango is emblematic. It is an online binary search tree that achieves an O(\\\\log \\\\log n) competitive ratio relative to the offline optimal binary search tree, while only using O(\\\\log \\\\log n) additional bits of memory per node. This improved upon the previous best known competitive ratio, which was O(\\\\log n). Structure Tango trees work by partitioning a binary search tree into a set of preferred paths, which are themselves stored in auxiliary trees (so the tango tree is represented as a tree of trees). =Reference tree= To construct a tango tree, we simulate a complete binary search tree called the reference tree, which is simply a traditional binary search tree containing all the elements. This tree never shows up in the actual implementation, but is the conceptual basis behind the following pieces of a tango tree. In particular, the height of the reference tree is . This equals the length of the longest path, and therefore the size of the largest auxiliary tree. By keeping the auxiliary trees reasonably balanced, the height of the auxiliary trees can be bounded to This is the source of the algorithm's performance guarantees. =Preferred paths= The preferred paths of a tree. Each node's preferred child is its most recently visited child. First, we define for each node its preferred child, which informally is the most- recently visited child by a traditional binary search tree lookup. More formally, consider a subtree T, rooted at p, with children l (left) and r (right). We set r as the preferred child of p if the most recently accessed node in T is in the subtree rooted at r, and l as the preferred child otherwise. Note that if the most recently accessed node of T is p itself, then l is the preferred child by definition. A preferred path is defined by starting at the root and following the preferred children until reaching a leaf node. Removing the nodes on this path partitions the remainder of the tree into a number of subtrees, and we recurse on each subtree (forming a preferred path from its root, which partitions the subtree into more subtrees). =Auxiliary trees= To represent a preferred path, we store its nodes in a balanced binary search tree, specifically a red-black tree. For each non-leaf node n in a preferred path P, it has a non-preferred child c, which is the root of a new auxiliary tree. We attach this other auxiliary tree's root (c) to n in P, thus linking the auxiliary trees together. We also augment the auxiliary tree by storing at each node the minimum and maximum depth (depth in the reference tree, that is) of nodes in the subtree under that node. Algorithm =Searching= To search for an element in the tango tree, we simply simulate searching the reference tree. We start by searching the preferred path connected to the root, which is simulated by searching the auxiliary tree corresponding to that preferred path. If the auxiliary tree doesn't contain the desired element, the search terminates on the parent of the root of the subtree containing the desired element (the beginning of another preferred path), so we simply proceed by searching the auxiliary tree for that preferred path, and so forth. =Updating= In order to maintain the structure of the tango tree (auxiliary trees correspond to preferred paths), we must do some updating work whenever preferred children change as a result of searches. When a preferred child changes, the top part of a preferred path becomes detached from the bottom part (which becomes its own preferred path) and reattached to another preferred path (which becomes the new bottom part). In order to do this efficiently, we'll define cut and join operations on our auxiliary trees. Join Our join operation will combine two auxiliary trees as long as they have the property that the top node of one (in the reference tree) is a child of the bottom node of the other (essentially, that the corresponding preferred paths can be concatenated). This will work based on the concatenate operation of red-black trees, which combines two trees as long as they have the property that all elements of one are less than all elements of the other, and split, which does the reverse. In the reference tree, note that there exist two nodes in the top path such that a node is in the bottom path if and only if its key-value is between them. Now, to join the bottom path to the top path, we simply split the top path between those two nodes, then concatenate the two resulting auxiliary trees on either side of the bottom path's auxiliary tree, and we have our final, joined auxiliary tree. Cut Our cut operation will break a preferred path into two parts at a given node, a top part and a bottom part. More formally, it'll partition an auxiliary tree into two auxiliary trees, such that one contains all nodes at or above a certain depth in the reference tree, and the other contains all nodes below that depth. As in join, note that the top part has two nodes that bracket the bottom part. Thus, we can simply split on each of these two nodes to divide the path into three parts, then concatenate the two outer ones so we end up with two parts, the top and bottom, as desired. Analysis In order to bound the competitive ratio for tango trees, we must find a lower bound on the performance of the optimal offline tree that we use as a benchmark. Once we find an upper bound on the performance of the tango tree, we can divide them to bound the competitive ratio. =Interleave bound= To find a lower bound on the work done by the optimal offline binary search tree, we again use the notion of preferred children. When considering an access sequence (a sequence of searches), we keep track of how many times a reference tree node's preferred child switches. The total number of switches (summed over all nodes) gives an asymptotic lower bound on the work done by any binary search tree algorithm on the given access sequence. This is called the interleave lower bound. =Tango tree= In order to connect this to tango trees, we will find an upper bound on the work done by the tango tree for a given access sequence. Our upper bound will be (k+1) O(\\\\log \\\\log n), where k is the number of interleaves. The total cost is divided into two parts, searching for the element, and updating the structure of the tango tree to maintain the proper invariants (switching preferred children and re-arranging preferred paths). Searching To see that the searching (not updating) fits in this bound, simply note that every time an auxiliary tree search is unsuccessful and we have to move to the next auxiliary tree, that results in a preferred child switch (since the parent preferred path now switches directions to join the child preferred path). Since all auxiliary tree searches are unsuccessful except the last one (we stop once a search is successful, naturally), we search k+1 auxiliary trees. Each search takes O(\\\\log \\\\log n), because an auxiliary tree's size is bounded by \\\\log n, the height of the reference tree. Updating The update cost fits within this bound as well, because we only have to perform one cut and one join for every visited auxiliary tree. A single cut or join operation takes only a constant number of searches, splits, and concatenates, each of which takes logarithmic time in the size of the auxiliary tree, so our update cost is (k+1) O(\\\\log \\\\log n). =Competitive ratio= Tango trees are O(\\\\log \\\\log n)-competitive, because the work done by the optimal offline binary search tree is at least linear in k (the total number of preferred child switches), and the work done by the tango tree is at most (k+1) O(\\\\log \\\\log n).

WBC replaced the ADSL Max product. It also refers to BT's native fibre-to-the- premises service. WBC is defined in SIN 472. IPstream IPstream is the most highly used wholesale broadband Internet service in the UK. BT Wholesale sells the service to ISPs and IPTV providers, who use it to provide ADSL services to customers over Openreach telephone lines. The IPstream product covers the transport of data between the end-user's premises and an interconnect point of the ISPs choice, such as their main colocation facility, which is served by one or more links called BT Centrals. BT has operational control of the network for tasks such as load balancing. Transit of data to and from the internet, along with other services such as email servers, are the responsibility of the ISP. IPStream is widely used by ISPs because it is cheaper to set up and costs less in maintenance than the ISP building its own network. This is balanced by the fact that usage costs for ISPs are higher using IPstream than their own network. Datastream is the similar system where ISPs in the UK use BT equipment but use their own IP transport. BT Wholesale pays Openreach for access to the local loop and the exchange. The alternative to IPStream is local-loop unbundling, in which the ISP obtains these facilities from Openreach directly, and makes its own arrangements for onward carriage of the data stream. Similar services are offered in other countries where there is a single dominant telecommunications provider, such as wholesale DSL from Telstra in Australia. IPstream has largely been retired by BT in favour of its Wholesale Broadband Connect.

It was written by Francis Beaumont and is known to have been performed on 20 February 1613 in the Banqueting House at Whitehall Palace, as part of the elaborate wedding festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of King James I, to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. The show The masque was preceded by a procession, in which the masquers came down the River Thames from Winchester House on the royal barge, accompanied by a flotilla of other barges and boats, on Shrove Tuesday, 16 February. The masque itself was scheduled to be staged that evening, but had to be postponed for four days, due to the press of crowds at the Banqueting House and the fatigue of the King.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 234‚Äì5. Some thought that the masque was spoiled by the delay, since the surprise value of the costumes and set had been lost; but the King enjoyed it when he saw it, and ordered the dances repeated. The principal masquers were fifteen knights of Olympia, dressed in carnation costumes; the musicians were costumed as twelve priests of Jove. The masque is richly dependent upon Greek mythology: the presenters were Mercury and Iris, the dancers of the first anti-masque were Naiads, Hyades and Cupids, joined by statues forged by Vulcan for Mount Olympus that came alive (four each of Naiads, Hyades, and statues, and five Cupids). The second anti-masque was a dance of rustic figures in \\"country sports.\\" This second anti-masque was reproduced in a slightly simplified form in The Two Noble Kinsmen later in 1613‚Äîone sign of the influence that masques had on the stage drama of the era. (See Oberon, the Faery Prince for its similar connection with The Winter's Tale.) Sponsorship The masque was sponsored by two of the four Inns of Court. (The other two inns sponsored a wedding tribute of their own, The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn, by George Chapman.) Inns of Court records reveal that the Inner Temple paid over ¬£1200 for its half of the costs of the masque; the bill for Gray's Inn must have been comparable. The Inner Temple charged its members assessments of ¬£1 or ¬£2 to help pay the cost; charges at Gray's Inn ranged from ¬£1 to ¬£4. The costumes for the masquers cost ¬£60 per man.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 235. Publication Beaumont's masque was entered into the Stationers' Register on 27 February 1613 and published soon after in an undated quarto by the bookseller George Norton. Norton issued a second quarto edition, also undated, sometime later. Beaumont dedicated the work to Sir Francis Bacon, who had organized the show for the Inns of Court. The masque was reprinted in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647, and in a collection of Beaumont and Fletcher poems published in 1653 and reprinted in 1660, and in the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 233. The title page of the first edition attributed the masque to Beaumont alone ‚Äì a verdict with which modern scholars agree. The quarto and folio texts are not identical; the quarto is much fuller in its descriptions of the action of the masque.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S.

One of his notable subjects of research is the fall of the fort of Masada, the last refuge of a Jewish group, the Sicarii, to the Romans in 73 CE. The Sicarii committed mass suicide rather than surrender to slavery. De bello Iudaico) He views the story of Masada as a modern legend. According to his book Sacrificing Truth, the rendition of Josephus was embellished before and after the establishment of the State of Israel. Based on transcripts of the 1963-65 archaeological dig, he claims that the team, led by Yigael Yadin, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, fraudulently misrepresented findings and artifacts to fit within a pre-scripted narrative. Ben-Yehuda compared the story as reported in the sole historical source, Flavius Josephus, to the myth that developed during the Zionist movement from the 1940s to the 1960s. He examined how archaeologists, notably Yigael Yadin, interpreted their findings to conform to the myth. According to Ben-Yehuda, Josephus describes the Sicarii unflatteringly. They assassinated their Jewish opponents, and would not help the Jewish Zealots who were besieged in Jerusalem. They raided nearby villages, including Ein Gedi, where they murdered 700 Jewish women and children. They offered no resistance to the Romans, and their suicide was cowardly, unheroic and unwise. Ben-Yehuda himself was brought up on the Masada myth, and climbed Masada himself to watch the sun rise over the Dead Sea. Israeli youth movements visited Masada, and it was the location for military swearing-in ceremonies. According to the myth, the Jews at Masada were Zealots who escaped the destruction of Jerusalem and continued to harass the Romans. Ben-Yehuda quotes Moshe Dayan calling Masada \\"a symbol of heroism and of Liberty for the Jewish people to whom it says: Fight to death rather than surrender.\\" Contrary to Josephus, the myth claims that the rebels are \\"Zealots\\" rather than Sicarii, Masada was a rebel base for attacks on the Romans. The massacre in Ein Geddi disappears. Ben-Yehuda compared Yadin's tape-recorded notes during the excavations with Yadin's later statements. For example, Yadin found three skeletons, of a woman, a man and a child. On the tape, Yadin said that they could not have been a family. In later writings, Yadin said that they were the remains of an important commander, his wife, and their child. Ben-Yehuda believes that Yadin's distortions were ideologically motivated.

Early life Sigurd Jonny Hansen was born in Seattle, the eldest of three sons; his brothers are Norman and Edgar. Their father, Sverre Hansen, was descended from a long line of Norwegian-ancestry fishermen. His father and grandfather pioneered opilio crab fishing in Alaska as a way of giving crab boats a chance to earn money year-round rather than in short-term or late-year seasons. He began fishing at age 14, working on his family's boat. After he graduated from high school, he began fishing year-round, spending on average 10 months per year in Alaska and the Bering Sea. Occasionally he also fished mackerel and cod in Norway during the summer. In his early years, he cut school so that he could go fishing. Career Hansen started as a deckhand on his father's boat before his teenage years, working his way up the ranks. At age 22, he became a ‚Äúrelief skipper‚Äù, relieving other captains on the Northwestern, as well as doing short-haul stints on other boats in the fleet. By age 24, he began running the Northwestern full-time. Over the years, the boat has become a top producer with an excellent safety record; it has never had a single death at sea in the nearly 20 years Hansen has been at its helm, and its serious injury rate is significantly lower than other boats in the Bering Sea fleet as well. In 2005 for King Crab and 2006 for Opilio, the Northwestern won the final derby seasons, taking home the titles for both the highest poundage caught and the highest dollars earned between the featured boats in the Deadliest Catch. As of 2011, Hansen serves as the full-time captain during king and opilio crab seasons, as well as the pot cod fishery on the Northwestern. His younger brothers, Edgar and Norman, are deck boss and deckhand, respectively. In March 2010, Hansen became a published author with the release of his book (co- written with Mark Sundeen) North By Northwestern: A Seafaring Family on Deadly Alaskan Waters, which reached the bestseller list of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. On April 29, 2010, Hansen was a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. During the show, he expressed his desire to be a contestant on the next season of the hit ABC reality television series Dancing with the Stars. Leno's staff set up a Facebook page to gather support for him to be selected for the show. In September 2010, Hansen announced that he would not return for the seventh season of Deadliest Catch. However, on October 8, it was announced that Hansen would come back to the show. He provided the voice of a boat named Crabby (modeled after the Northwestern) in the Disney Pixar film Cars 2. He competed in the 14th season of The Celebrity Apprentice. In 2014, Hansen was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame, along with Tonight Show bandleader, Doc Severinsen, and singer Bobby Vee. Personal life Hansen has two adopted daughters, Nina and Mandy, with his wife, June and lives in Seattle. He also has a biological daughter, Melissa, from a previous marriage. His youngest daughter, Mandy, has joined him on the Northwestern as his relief captain. Like his brothers, he speaks fluent Norwegian, which he learned before English as his Norwegian parents spoke the language at home. He is an alumnus of Shorewood High School and a supporter of Seattle-based sports teams, the Seattle Seahawks and the Seattle Mariners. In March 2016, Hansen suffered a heart attack, which was recorded and shown on Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch. He returned to fishing the following season. In early October 2018, right before the king crab season, he suffered a severe allergic reaction to an antibiotic, which caused a second heart attack. He had to be medically cleared before he could return to fish and film the show's 15th season.\\"'Deadliest Catch' Captain Sig Hansen Reveals He Suffered Another Heart Attack\\", popculture.com; accessed July 1, 2020.

The line takes its name from the power plant at its west end which generates hydroelectric power below the Shoshone Rapids in Glenwood Canyon.Florence Clark, Light and Power for a State, Popular Electricity, Vol. IV, No. 6 (Oct. 1911); pages 481-485, see page 483, right column, for a discussion of the role of the Boulder power plant. The line began service on July 17, 1909, conveying power from the 15 MW Shoshone Generating Station, outside of Glenwood Springs to Denver, serving substations in Leadville, Dillon and Idaho Springs.Charles W. Henderson, Chapter 7 -- Production, history and mine development, Geology and Ore Deposits of the Leadville Mining District, Colorado professional paper 148, government printing office, 1927; page 134. At the east end of the line, it was connected to the utility's Boulder Canyon Hydroelectric Plant powered from the Barker Meadow Reservoir. In the event of a break in the line, either power plant could supply customers along the line. As originally built, the line was 153.4 miles long, crossing the Continental Divide at Hagerman Pass (at altitude 12,055 feet), Fremont Pass (at altitude 11,346 feet) and Argentine Pass (at altitude 13,532 feet). For many years, this was the highest electric power transmission line in the world.Public Service Company of Colorado -- Providing Energy for More than a Century, (undated, but content implies 1976, the United States Bicentennial); pages 12-13. The three-phase line operated at 90 kV and was supported 1400 steel towers 44 feet high on an average spacing of 730 feet.High-Tension Transmission Experience in Central Colorado, Electrical World, Vol. 58, No. 15 (Oct. 7, 1911); page 871. A secondary power line from the backbone of the Shoshone line connected it to a steam generating station at Leadville, as well as to many of the mines in the Leadville region. At Dillon, a secondary line served the numerous gold dredges of the Breckenridge placer mining district. Connections were also made to smaller hydroelectric plants at Dillon and Idaho Springs.William DuVall, The Shoshone Project of the Central Colorado Power Company, The University of Colorado Journal of Engineering, No. 9 (1912-1913); pages 36-39. In 1951 and 1952, the Public Service Company of Colorado replaced the hemp-cored 6-strand copper cable on the Shoshone line with steel-core aluminum cable.ShoShone Transmission Line 1951-1952 Upgrade, Lines -- Public Service Company of Colorado, Vol. XI, No. 2 (Feb. 1952); page 7. reproduced here. By this time, the Shoshone generating station had been upgraded to 14.4 MW. New towers were installed in the 1970s, with some changes in the path of the line.Sara E. Simonson, Scott Toepfer, et al, Rapid Assessment of a Large-Magnitude Snow Avalanche Event in Colorado, Researchgate.net, Oct. 6, 2014. The severe climate and mountain terrain along the line are a challenge. Within a few years of construction, sleet buildups of as much a 6 inches (15 cm) had been observed on wires along the line. Several towers were buckled and demolished by wind force alone‚Äîwind speeds of over 165 miles per hour (265 km/h) were measured at one point along the line, leading to metal fatigue at the points where insulators support the power line. In the vicinity of the high passes, snow depths as great as 35 feet (10 meters) have been measured. Avalanches along the line have been known to take out multiple transmission towers in remote and difficult to service locations.A 100,000-Volt Transmission on the Roof of the Continent, Electrical World, Vol. 59, No. 22 (June 1, 1912); pages 1205-1208.

Biography Wells's career began in 1936. While listening to a hockey broadcast on CFQC, Wells boasted he could do a better job than the guy on the mike. Dared by a chum to prove his claim, Jack applied for a job at the station, and was hired. In 1939, Wells joined CJAT-FM in Trail, British Columbia as an all-round announcer and play-by-play man for the Trail Smoke Eaters. In 1941, Wells got a job as a sports announcer at CJRW in Winnipeg. CJRC provided Wells with his first experience in football broadcasting, and he began calling games for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Jack became a free-lance broadcaster after gaining the exclusive rights to broadcast from Shea's Amphitheatre and Osborne Stadium which, in turn gave him the right to sell time to any one of the Winnipeg stations. It was during an announcing stint on CKY that Jack acquired his illustrious nickname. When Jack filled in for Porky Charbonneau on his western show, it occurred to Wells that he should have a moniker and adopted \\"Cactus\\" and it became one of the most famous in Canadian broadcasting. Jack was famous for reporting the weather with the phrase, \\"Well, it turned out nice again.\\" even when calling in from his winter location of Phoenix, Arizona. During his career, Jack Wells broadcast on four Winnipeg stations - CKRC, CKY, CJOB and CFRW. In the early 1950s, he became the first television voice of Western Conference Football for the CFL on CBC. In 1952, Wells turned down the play by play job on Hockey Night in Canada to remain in Winnipeg. The job eventually went to the Danny Gallivan.Sports Media Canada Wells was closely associated with the national curling scene, beginning in 1952 when he covered his first Macdonald Brier.

As Vicereine of India, she held the highest official title in the Indian Empire that a woman could hold. In America Mary Victoria Leiter, 1887 by Alexandre Cabanel She was born in Chicago, the daughter of Mary Theresa (n√©e Carver) and Levi Leiter, the wealthy co-founder of Field and Leiter dry goods business, and later partner in the Marshall Fields retail empire. On her father's side, she was of Swiss-German descent. Her family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1881 and entered the exclusive circle of official society there. They lived for several years in the former home of James G. Blaine on Dupont Circle. She was taught dancing, singing, music, and art at home by tutors and learned the French language from her French governess. A Columbia University professor taught her history, arithmetic, and chemistry. Travel and prolonged residence abroad cultivated her powers of observation and breadth of mental vision at an early age. As stated in 1901, her education \\"gave her that poise and finish that made her so charming to men and women of mature and brilliant intellect.\\" Mary was a striking presence with a curvy figure. Her appearance was described at her wedding: \\"a face of unusual beauty, oval in shape, with dark grey eyes, straight black brows, a sweet, sensitive mouth, a prettily shaped nose, and a low forehead with fine black hair brushed simply away from it and emphasising its whiteness.\\" Her debut was in winter of 1888. She was regarded an equal in beauty and breeding, and, frequently, superior in manner and intellect of daughters of better known and longer established families in eastern U.S. society. Prior to her marriage, her closest friend was Frances Folsom Cleveland, six years her senior and the wife of a much older President Grover Cleveland. In England Lady Curzon in her Delhi Durbar dress, oil on canvas, 1903 by William Logsdail Mary was introduced to London society in 1890. She met a young man, George Curzon, a Conservative Member of Parliament who was thirty- five years old, had been representing Southport for eight years, and was heir to the Barony of Scarsdale. The position he had made for himself through his own talents was of more interest to her than his eventual inheritance, and his high reputation as a writer on the political questions in the East particularly attracted her admiration. Mary Leiter and George Curzon were married on 22 April 1895 at St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C., by Bishop Talbot, assisted by the Rev. Dr. Mackay Smith, the pastor of the church. She played an important role in the reelection of her husband to Parliament that autumn and many thought that his success was due more to the winning smiles and irresistible charm of his wife than to his own speeches. They had three daughters, Mary Irene (later Lady Ravensdale), in 1896, Cynthia (first wife of Sir Oswald Mosley), on 23 August 1898, lastly, Alexandra, on 20 April 1904 (wife of Edward \\"Fruity\\" Metcalfe, the best friend, best man, and equerry of Edward VIII); best known as Baba Metcalfe. In India Lady Curzon of Kedleston, Vicereine of India, c. 1902 by Franz von Lenbach Her husband accepted the position of Viceroy of India and was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Curzon of Kedleston in the summer of 1898 at age thirty-nine. As Vicereine of India, his wife held the highest official title in the Indian Empire that a woman could hold, as did Lady Wellesley, also an American wife of a prominent British man. On 30 December they arrived in Bombay to the greetings of royal salutes and great excitement. She instantly made an impression of beauty and respect that soon spread all over India. She gained the title vicereine, as wife of the viceroy, a title of the British aristocracy. They were greeted in Calcutta a few days later with great enthusiasm. It was estimated that over one hundred thousand people witnessed the magnificent spectacle of their reception at Government House. The Indian poet Ram Sharma referred to her in his welcome address to Lord Curzon of Kedleston, as: > \\"A rose of roses bright > A vision of embodied light.\\" Another declared her to be: > \\"Like a diamond set in gold > the full moon in a clear autumnal sky.\\"Virginia Tatnall Peacock.

At the state ball Mary wore an extravagant coronation gown, by the House of Worth of Paris, known as Lady Curzon's peacock dress, stitched of gold cloth embroidered with peacock feathers with a blue/green beetle wing in each eye, which many mistook for emeralds, tapping into their own fantasies about the wealth of millionaire heiresses, Indian potentates and European royalty. The skirt was trimmed with white roses and the bodice with lace. She wore a huge diamond necklace and a large brooch of diamonds and pearls. She wore a tiara crown with a pearl tipping each of its high diamond points. It was reported that as she walked through the hall the crowd was breathless.Finding Aids to Official Records of the Smithsonian Institution, Accession 87-156, National Portrait Gallery, Office of Exhibitions, Exhibition Records, 1975‚Äì1979, Mary, Lady Curzon: Portrait of Mary Victoria Leiter, Baroness Curzon of Kedelston (Lady A.

Lady Curzon contributed to the design of the exquisitely rich and beautiful coronation robe of Queen Alexandra of Great Britain, made from gold fabric woven and embroidered in the same factory in Chandni Chauk Delhi where she ordered all the materials for her own state gowns. The factory owner said that she had the rarest taste of any woman he knew, and that she was the best dressed woman in the world‚Äîan opinion shared by others. Lady Curzon was an invaluable commercial agent for the manufacturers of the higher class of fabrics and art objects in India. She wore Indian fabrics, and as a result many of them became fashionable in Calcutta and other Indian cities as well as in London, Paris, and the capitals of Europe. She placed orders for her friends and strangers. She assisted the silk weavers, embroiderers, and other artists to adapt their designs, patterns, and fabrics to the requirements of modern fashions. She kept several of the best artists in India busy with orders and soon saw the results of her efforts, reviving skilled arts that almost had been forgotten. Lady Curzon was tutored in Urdu by the Mohyal patriarch Bakhshi Ram Dass Chhibber.General Mohyal Sabha, 2005-06, A-9, Qutab Institutional Area, New Delhi-110067, \\"MEMBERS OF MOHYALS\\" The Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore, now known as Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital Progressive medical reforms were initiated by English women in India under the leadership of the Marchioness of Dufferin and Lady Curzon by supplying women doctors and hospitals for women. There is a Lady Curzon Hospital in Bangalore, shown to the right. William Eleroy Curtis, Chicago journalist and author, dedicated his book Modern India thus: \\"To Lady Curzon, An ideal American woman\\". On 4 November 1902 Lady Curzon wrote from Viceroy's Camp, Simla, to Lady Randolph Churchill advising her on the appropriate headgear to wear in Delhi, saying that she is looking forward to seeing her and that she will not need an ayah in addition to her maid.Churchill College, CHURCHILL ARCHIVES CENTRE, CHAR 28/66/36 retrieved 3/23/2007 In 1903 she sailed on a yacht from Karachi for a tour of the Persian Gulf with Lord Curzon, Ignatius Valentine Chirol, young Winston Churchill and other notable guests. In 1904, Lady Curzon traveled by train with Lord Curzon to Dhaka and toured the Shahbagh area in a fleet of Dechamp Tonneau-model 1902 automobiles. (photo: Fritz Kapp) Lady Curzon learned about the great one-horned rhinoceroses of Kaziranga from her tea-plantation friends and wanted to see them. In the winter of 1904 she visited the Kaziranga area, and saw some of their hoof marks, but was disappointed by not having seen a single rhinoceros. It was reported that the noted Assamese animal tracker, Balaram Hazarika, showed Lady Curzon around Kaziranga and impressed upon her the urgent need for its conservation. Concerned about the dwindling numbers of rhinoceros, she asked her husband to take the necessary action to save the rhinoceros, which he did. The Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest thus was created. Later it was developed into the Kaziranga National Park.  Private life  The Curzons' home in London, 1 Carlton House Terrace The Curzons had three daughters but no son, as much as Lord Curzon wished for one. Lady Curzon's demanding social responsibilities, the tropical climate, a prolonged near-fatal infection following a miscarriage, and fertility-related surgery eroded her health. Despite several trips to England to convalesce, her health continued to decline. Following their return to England after Curzon's resignation in August 1905, her health was rapidly failing. She died on 18 July 1906 at home at 1 Carlton House Terrace, Westminster, London, at age thirty-six. It is said that Lady Curzon, after having seen the Taj Mahal on a moonlit night, exclaimed in her bewilderment that she was ready to embrace an immediate death if someone promised to erect such a memorial on her grave.SR Shaheed DOHS Banani (25 October 2004) \\"Lady Curzon's wish\\", The Daily Star, Vol. 5 Num 153, Dhaka Following Lady Curzon's death, in 1906, Lord Curzon had a memorial chapel built in his late wife's honour, attached to All Saints, the parish church at Kedleston Hall. Lady Curzon is buried, with her husband, in the family vault beneath it. The design of the chapel, by G. F. Bodley, does not resemble the Taj Mahal, but is in the decorated Gothic style. It was completed in 1913.*The National Trust (1988; repr. 1997). Kedleston Hall. page 60. In the chapel Curzon expressed his grief at his wife's premature death by charging the sculptor, Sir Bertram Mackennal, to create a marble effigy for her tomb which: \\"expressed as might be possible in marble, the pathos of his wife's premature death and to make the sculpture emblematic of the deepest emotion.\\" *The National Trust (1988; repr. 1997). Kedleston Hall. page 61. Later, Curzon's own effigy was added to lie beside that of his wife's, as his remains do in the vault beneath. Curzon's second wife chose to be buried in the churchyard outside. The Curzons' youngest daughter, Alexandra Naldera, was conceived in July 1903 at Naldehra, 25 km from Shimla, perhaps after a high altitude game of golf. She was born on 20 March 1904. and became best known as \\"Baba\\", an Indian name for baby or little one. In 1925 she married Major Edward Dudley Metcalfe, the best friend and equerry of Edward VIII. Lord Curzon's second wife and stepmother to the daughters, Grace Curzon wrote a book Reminisces. The sisters are rumored to have had affairs with various men, but this is not documented. In popular culture Mary Curzon and her three daughters are considered to be part of the inspiration for the fictional characters Lady Grantham and her three daughters, particularly in respect to the inability to produce a male heir, and the importance of a woman's virtue in the Downton Abbey television series written by Julian Fellowes and produced by ITV. Lady Curzon Soup, a curry-flavored turtle soup, was named after her. In 1977 a food article in The New York Times noted its popularity in Germany and, according to a letter to the columnist, that Lady Curzon always had sherry added to it.

Red and blue enemies charge at the ships of the opposite color. If a player ship touches an enemy of the same color, the enemy is destroyed; but if the enemy is of the opposite color, the player ship is destroyed. When all red and blue enemies are cleared from the level, the level ends and players begin the next level. Two single-player game modes are available: Wingman Bot Training, in which the player controls the blue ship and a bot controls the red ship; and Uberschizoid, in which the player controls both ships simultaneously. One multiplayer game mode is available, playable either as an Xbox Live game over an Internet connection, or with two players at the same console in \\"Local Co-op\\" game mode. The only control used on the game controller during the game is the left thumbstick, unless playing in Uberschizoid game mode, in which case the player uses both thumbsticks to control the two ships. During gameplay, the two ships must work closely together to clear enemies from the levels. Each player ship alone is completely vulnerable to enemies of the opposite color; only the other player ship can provide a rescue. Game progress is saved at a checkpoint after completing a \\"chamber\\" of seven levels before the players' 10 lives are exhausted. If the players complete any level without losing any lives, the players earn a \\"gold star\\" for that level. In subsequent games, any time the player goes through that chamber, the game will automatically skip past any level that has a gold star, making it more likely the player will be able to finish the chamber before his 10 lives are exhausted. Schizoid has 119 levels, followed by a sequence of \\"Infinity Chamber\\" levels, which are randomly generated by the game. Torpex Games calls Schizoid \\"the most co-op game ever\\" because of the tight cooperation required to play multiplayer games. (Official Xbox Magazine wrote of this claim, \\"It ain't lying.\\"Torpex Games) The game's \\"Uberschizoid\\" single-player game mode is apparently intended for hardcore gamers; IGN claimed of Uberschizoid, \\"Your brain will never be the same.\\" Development history Schizoid is notable for being the first Xbox Live Arcade game built using XNA Game Studio Express; Aegis Wing had been created using pre-XNA tools. Development of the game started in September 2006. The first prototype of core gameplay was completed in just four days. Richard Garfield, famous for creating Magic: The Gathering, helped in the design of the game.

All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F.

Behavior Like other tinamous, the ornate tinamou eats fruit off the ground or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 different females, and then will raise them until they are ready to be on their own, usually 2‚Äì3 weeks.

The customs varied from region to region and caste to caste. Sambandham may take place only if the bride had already had this elaborate ritual marriage known as Kettu Kalyanam.The Kettu Kalyanam ceremony is ceremonial only as after the ceremony rituals the groom returns to his house, never to meet the bride again. In some parts of Malabar immediately after the ceremony a formal divorce is constituted whereas in some other areas the groom enters into Sambandham with the girl and becomes her husband in practice, if the girl be of marriageable age. This practice was not performed in North Malabar. Among the Nair of Central Kerala, every ten or twelve years each lineage held a grand ceremony at its oldest ancestral house, at which time all immature girls of the lineage of one generation were ritually married by men of \\"enangar\\" groups. (linked neighborhood kinship groups not of the same family group as the brides) This ceremony, called tƒÅlikettukalyƒÅnam (\\"tƒÅli-tying ceremony\\") had to be performed for each girl before puberty, on pain of her excommunication from her caste (Gough, 1955).Cathleen Gough, Matrilinear Kinship, 1961 University of California Press Ltd: Berkeley and Los Angeles, pp 328 - 329 Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=lfdvTbfilYAC&printsec;=copyright&source;=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Examples of Hindu Matrimony Service - Nair Matrimony Service Provider At the ceremony, each bridegroom, in the company of representatives of every household in the neighborhood, tied a gold ornament (tƒÅli) round the neck of his bride. Each couple was then secluded in a room of the ancestral house for three days and nights. On the fourth day the bridegrooms departed; they had no further obligations, and did not need to visit them again. After the tƒÅli ritual, a girl was regarded as having attained the status of a mature woman, ready to bear children to perpetuate her lineage. The tƒÅli ceremony was a both a religious and legal ceremony between the lineage and enangu group, and thus can be seen as a form of mass marriage.

He was also known as the ' (, modern: , \\"Captain of the Sea\\"). Typically, he was based at Galata and Gallipoli during the winter and charged with annual sailings during the summer months. The title of Kapudan Pasha itself is only attested from 1567 onwards; earlier designations for the supreme commander of the fleet include (\\"bey of the sea\\") and (\\"head captain\\"). The title Derya Bey was first granted during the reign of Bayezid I as an official rank within the state structure. Following the Conquest of Constantinople, Mehmet II raised Baltaoƒülu S√ºleyman Bey to the status of sanjak bey for his efforts against the Byzantines in the Golden Horn.Shaw, Stanford J. History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Vol. 1, pp. 131 ff. Cambridge University Press (Cambridge), 1976. Accessed 12 Sept 2011. Baltaoƒülu received the sanjak of Gallipoli (the principal Turkish naval base) and the kazas of Galata (until the Conquest a Genovese colony) and ƒ∞zmit (whose tax remittance consisted of ship timber). The success of Hayreddin Barbarossa saw the Kapudan Pasha elevated to the ranks of beylerbey and vizier in 1535, with his territories expanded into the Eyalet of the Archipelago and Algiers. Hayreddin's successors succeeded to these holdings, but saw their rank drop to two-horsetail vizier for several centuries. The official residence of the Kapudan Pasha was in the Divankhane in the Imperial Arsenal in the Golden Horn, but he was often away as his governorship of the Eyalet of the Archipelago entailed visiting its various provinces in person every year. The post was one of great power and prestige within the Ottoman hierarchy: Evliya √áelebi reports that it had an annual income of 885,000 silver . Additional income, to the amount of 300,000 in the 18th/19th centuries, came from leasing a number of Aegean islands to tax farmers (). The heyday of the post was in the 16th century, when a succession of capable holders brought Ottoman naval power to its height, and for a time ensured its supremacy in the Mediterranean. Although in theory the post could only be filled by a serving admiral (), a chief of the Imperial Arsenal () or, at the very least, by the of Rhodes, from the turn of the 17th century the appointment of court favourites and/or persons lacking in military or naval experience marked the beginning of Ottoman naval decline. As a part of the Tanzimat reforms, the Eyalet of the Archipelago was reduced in rank and granted to the wali of Rhodes in 1848. The Kapudan Pashas retained their rank but were thereafter solely military servicemen.

Also known as Lycaenidae, they are members of the superfamily Papilionoidea, the true butterflies. This family has approximately 4,700 species that are unevenly distributed throughout the world, however the distribution of the Tamil oakblue is limited only to India, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Description The adults are small, often brilliantly coloured with electric blues, reds, and oranges. Females lay single, sea urchin shaped eggs on host leaves or flower buds; the resulting caterpillars are typically slug shaped. In many species, caterpillars depend on ants for protection, so caterpillars produce sugary secretions that are collected by the ants, in a symbiotic relationship. Most individuals overwinter in either the egg or pupal stage. The species was once considered as extinct from Sri Lanka, but rediscovered in 2014 from wet zone lowland forests of Sinharaja and Kanneliya.

Nov. 23, 1911 and d. Nov. 22, 1988) ‚Äì‚Äìalso referred to by her nickname, ‚Äúel Peque‚Äù‚Äì‚Äì was a Mexican author, screenwriter, and journalist. She is considered to be one of Mexico's seminal women writers. She is best known for her two novels, El libro vac√≠o (‚ÄòThe empty book;‚Äô published first in Spanish in 1958 and in English in 1992) and Los a√±os falsos (‚ÄòThe false years;‚Äô first published in Spanish in 1982 and in English in 1989) and for her pioneering contributions to twentieth-century Mexican politics and political thought through her activism and journalism. She also authored several screenplays, many of which were produced and released as widely viewed films. She was born in Villahermosa, Tabasco state but lived most of her adult life in Mexico City. El libro vacio (The Empty Book) was the first Mexican meta-literary novel, using the resources of the \\"Nouveau Roman\\". It was awarded the Xavier Villarrutia Prize in 1958. It has recently been selected by the National Commission of Mexico for UNESCO's Literature & Translation project.El Premio Xavier Villaurrutia, Coordinaci√≥n Nacional de Literatura ‚Äì in SpanishLiterature & Translation (Mexico), UNESCO  Early life  Vicens was born during the Mexican revolution and grew up in Villahermosa, Tabasco. Her father was Spanish, her mother Mexican. Her father was a small shop owner, her mother a primary school teacher. They had 5 daughters, including Josefina. The Vicens family lived on a farm throughout Vicens‚Äô earliest years. They were staunch Catholics. The family was very musical, and her mother kept a notebook of poetry and song lyrics; perhaps this influenced Vicens‚Äô own appreciation for writing. In the early 1920s, the Vicens family moved to Mexico City and settled in the prosperous Colonia Roma neighborhood. Here, Vicens‚Äô parents opened a store, where they worked. It fell to Vicens and the other older daughters to care for their younger sisters while their parents were at work. Vicens studied at a business school after finishing grade school; there, she learned shorthand and typing. Later, she would support herself off of the skills she learned in school, gaining her independence in an era when women were just beginning to gain suffrage but did not usually hold influential roles outside the home. Independence was very important to Vicens, who saw the ability to support herself as a potential escape from the confines of her family's household. After the family settled in Mexico City, Vicens‚Äô father started working for a hot sauce manufacturing company of which he later became the owner. When she was still in her early teens, Vicens began to work at the factory with her father. There, Vicens perceived great inequality between the managers of the factory‚Äì‚Äìincluding her father‚Äì‚Äìand its workers, causing conflict for her. In the mid-twenties, she left the factory and her family, and went for a time to Chapultepec. There, she found work at an auto-transport company. She would return to her family and in 1925 she found work at a psychiatric hospital as a secretary, where she would remain for a year and a half. She agreed to work at the hospital only if, she recounted later in an interview, the director would let her speak to patients after she had finished her secretarial tasks for the day. It is likely that this experience helped to inform many of the major themes in her written work, including a particular fascination with ‚Äúlife and death, insanity and sanity.‚Äù After working at the hospital, Vicens found work at the Department of Agriculture. There, she was known for her humor, and she caught the attention of her supervisor. This was also where she, singled out because she was the youngest worker in the division, earned the nickname ‚ÄúEl Peque.‚Äù In 1938, she was chosen to be the Secretary for Women's Action of the National Confederation of Farmers. Thus began her life in politics. It was a political life defined, as she put it, ‚Äúby a rebellious fight for social justice.‚Äù Influenced by her experiences with inequality at earlier jobs, including her work at her father's factory, Vicens used her position at the National Confederation of Farmers to fight for farmers‚Äô rights. She worked, in particular, to promote women's rights in that sector. Also in 1938, she became the head of the Women's Section of the Agricultural Sector of the Mexican Revolutionary Party. She would hold those two positions simultaneously. Art formed an important part of this struggle, and she allied with some artists who were her contemporaries in order to advocate for social justice, including: Juan Soriano, Antonio Pel√°ez, and Ram√≥n Gaya. She was surrounded by artists and writers even when she was in politics. In 1937, Vicens married Jose Ferrel. Ferrel was widely believed to be homosexual by those in his social circle, and while the marriage surprised many acquaintances for that reason, Vicens and Ferrel were close friends. By marrying, Vicens was finally able to move out of her parents‚Äô house, thus gaining the independence that she had so desired from her family. Her life was to continue to be defined by her desire for independence and her fierce individuality. In 1938, Vicens published for the first time‚Äì‚Äìreleasing a collection of her thoughts on politics. This marked the start of her writing career, but her most important publications would not be made until the fifties.  Later life, and death  Throughout the 1940s, Vicens dedicated herself to her writing and political activism, authoring articles about Mexico's oil trade and Mexico's international relations while also covering bullfights for a local paper under the pen name Pepe Faroles. In 1946, Vicens transitioned to screenwriting, and in 1948, she completed her first script, Aviso de ocasion, which was never adapted to the screen. She worked with Gabriel Figueroa, the famous Mexican cinematographer. In 1958, Vicens published her first novel, El libro vac√≠o, which she began writing 10 years prior. She spent years writing and editing the novel before its publication, and it was met with critical success. Because of her already active political life and screenplay writing, her novel came as a surprise, and was considered to be evidence of a secret passion. She continued to write a multitude of screenplays through the 1960s. Vicens fought for the rights of screenwriters, as well as for opportunities for new screenwriters to develop and innovate. From 1970 to 1976, Vicens served as president of the Mexican Academy of Cinematographic Sciences and Arts. In 1973, Los perros de dios, a film written by Vicens, won the Ariel Award for Best Screenplay, and Renuncia por motivos de salud won two years later. In 1979, she wrote her last screenplay, El testamento, and in 1982 she published her second and final book, Los a√±os falsos. Around this time, she began to lose her vision, and was therefore distanced from the social life she had maintained. She lamented the loss of vision in an interview, calling it a tragedy because she could no longer read and also lost her independence. Josefina Vicens died on November 22, 1988, just one day short of her 78th birthday. In one of a series of interviews conducted in 1987 and 1988, Vicens expressed that she hoped to feel her death, as she wanted to be conscious of this transit from life to death. Literature Vicens wrote two works of fiction, which each feature male protagonists and are largely introspective. These novels are considered to be important works in the history of Mexican literature. Josefina Vicens fully developed her writings in the 50s, the decade in which Mexico City became the center of modernity in the country, where many intellectuals and artists met and collaborated. Both the studies and influences of the period were very diverse: Los poetos malditos, surrealism, French existentialism, the philosophy of Nietzsche, etc. Many studies consider Vicens‚Äô marriage and solid friendship with Jose Ferrel and authors like RImbaud and Gide to be her point of contact with the group of los Contempor√°neos. She also formed friendships with many artists and painters like Pedro Coronel, Juan Soriano, Jos√© Luis Cuevas and Antonio Pel√°ez, as well as writers like Sergio Fern√°ndez, Pita amor, Edmundo Valad√©s, Octavio Paz and Juan Rulfo. This interaction with renowned artists was linked to her visits to caf√© Par√≠s, which was a common meeting space for many artists of the age. = El libro vacio (1958) = El libro vac√≠o ( David Lauer, University of Texas Press (1992), ) won the Villaurutia prize for literature. The novel follows Jos√© Garc√≠a as he struggles with his inability to write. The book, a work of metafiction, addresses the struggle to express universal ideas while living in what Jos√© considers a mediocre life. He writes of the tension between imagination and real life, unsure how to reconcile his desire for truth with his search for a compelling story. He lives with his two sons and wife, whom he refers to as ‚Äúhis woman‚Äù (‚Äúmi mujer‚Äù) throughout the book. As he goes about his normal life, he reflects upon past sexual relations, his childhood, and the growth of his two sons. In a 1986 interview with Vicens, she describes the problem of whether to write as something she struggles with just as much as her protagonist. She explains that the title was the first thing she wrote, deciding on the theme of emptiness before starting the book. = Los a√±os falsos (1981) = Los a√±os falsos (English: The false years trans. Peter Earle, Latin American Literary Review Press (1989), ‚Äì reviewed at ) was published in 1982. It follows 19-year-old protagonist Luis Alfonso Fernandez Jr. as he stands at the grave of his father, who died years earlier when he accidentally shot himself. Luis reflects on his life, probing into his personality and his desire to be independent from his father. Through this reflection on the clash of generations, Vicens criticizes Mexico's political corruption and the lasting influence of familial traditions on contemporary life. Screenplays Josefina Vicens has been quoted as saying that she made her living off of her screenplays‚Äì‚Äìeven if perhaps her novels are better known in translation. Both of her novels have been translated into English; The empty book in the nineties and The False Years in the eighties and remain in distribution. Her career in film got its start when she worked for a time as the head of the Mexican Cinematography Production Union. There, she learned the screenwriters‚Äô craft, picking up skills from popular and art film writers that would inform her own work. After she completed her term at its helm, she stayed on at the union as a scriptwriter herself. Later, she took charge of the Academy of the Mexican Cinematographic Arts and Sciences. Vicens‚Äô first successful film was released in 1954, when she found commercial success in her script for El rival (‚ÄúThe Rival‚Äù). Her career as a scriptwriter would take off from there, and she produced screenplays prolifically from then on. Her early films mirrored and to a certain extent were constrained by the conservatism of popular Mexican film in the mid-twentieth century. Many of her early films were about Mexican family life: wives, children, and family drama. Her first screenplay to be considered to the one that broke out from that mold and defined her unique style was Las se√±oras vivanco (‚ÄúThe ladies vivanco‚Äù). Her screenplays were considered unique in their originality; in those days, most scripts were commissioned by production companies and so Vicens‚Äô stood out because she wrote them without being paid to do so. Some of her most well- known films include Los perros de dios (‚ÄúThe dogs of God‚Äù), renuncia por motivos de salud (‚ÄúTo renounce for health reasons‚Äù), and el testamento (‚ÄúThe will‚Äù). These films addressed political or surrealist themes, and tackled weighty issues about identity, self-definition, and mortality that also appeared in her novels. However, Vicens was probably better-known for her films than her novels in Mexico, as they reached a higher audience, although English-language speakers know her novels better for their translations. Her screenplays were the most popular of her productions during her lifetime, and Vicens would recount that she had written more than ninety scripts. However, according to her, she was proudest of her novels, and wanted to be considered an author and not a screenwriter. Vicens' many scripts include two that were nominated for the Ariel Award, Mexico's top film award.Ariel nominees by category, Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematogr√°ficas * Renuncia por motivos de salud (1976) * Los Perros de Dios (1974)  Journalism  When Vicens accompanied her father on his first return trip to Spain after 20 years, she was intrigued by the bullfighting scene she found there. She began covering the fights for a local paper under the pen name Pepe Faroles in the early 1940s. After writing insultingly about a prominent bullfighter, she was not welcomed to publish more articles with the newspaper. She decided to co- found a newspaper with a friend, and she revived her pseudonym to bad-mouth a boxer who threatened to beat up Pepe Faroles. When Pepe (Vicens) agreed to meet with the boxer, he was stunned to find out who was behind the pseudonym. Vicens published a number of political articles throughout her career under the pen name ‚ÄúDi√≥genes Garc√≠a.‚Äù She discussed issues of workers‚Äô rights, Mexican political corruption, and a range of societal issues after the Mexican Revolution. Vicens went by many pseudonyms, depending on the subject area about which she was publishing, but she affixed her own name to the articles she wrote about films.

It is the first in a series about Joe Mauser, a soldier in a rigid, caste-based society that makes it very difficult to better oneself. Plot summary Western society is split up into nine castes, from Lower- Lower to Mid-Lower all the way up to the privileged Upper-Upper. Mauser himself was born a Mid-Lower. Ambitious, he had chosen one of the few professions, Category Military, where upward mobility was still a reasonable possibility. To prevent any chance of a ruinous war between the West and the Sov-world, the Universal Disarmament Pact had restricted all militaries to pre-1900 technology. Gradually, powerful corporations began settling business disputes by hiring troops to fight real battles (fracases) on one of many military reservations. This served a dual purpose: to maintain a military well-honed by actual combat and to provide the decadent general population with a diversion. The life-and-death struggles are so popular that they are televised. Mauser had worked his way up to captain and Middle-Middle status after many years of effort. When upstart Vacuum Tube Transport finds itself forced into an expensive, division-sized fracas with Continental Hovercraft, he sees his opportunity.

Mauser tells Baron Haer, the head of Vacuum Tube, that he can engineer an improbable victory with a gimmick he has been working on for a long time; in return, he expects the baron's support which, in conjunction with his anticipated popularity with fracas fans, should be enough to get him promoted into the Upper caste. The baron's son, Bart, scoffs at the undisclosed idea, but the baron is desperate for experienced officers and hires him. When the conflict starts, Mauser takes off in a glider, something no one else had thought of before. Powered aircraft had not been invented before 1900, but gliders had. From his vantage point, Mauser can see where all of the enemy forces are positioned. This information makes Cogswell's situation hopeless and he recommends to his employer that he settle quickly. When Mauser returns in triumph to Vacuum Tube headquarters, he learns that Baron Haer has died of natural causes. His son does not have the deceased man's political influence, and has also invested heavily in the rival company, assuming his side will lose, so Mauser is out of luck. However, his unusual interest in the state of western civilization attracts the interest of Dr. Nadine Haer, the late baron's attractive, reform-minded daughter.

Early life and family Belcher was born at Hall's Track (now known as Lebrina) north east of Launceston to William (a labourer) and Isabella Mary Belcher (nee Mitchell). The family moved around Tasmania at the time, there having been two elder brothers born at New Norfolk, Allan (b 1884), and Albert Victor (b & d 1887) and in 1890 another brother Gabriel Lawrence was born at Formby (now Devonport). The family then moved to Victoria and in 1893 the birth of another brother Ernest Staley was registered in the Brunswick area of Melbourne.https://online.justice.vic.gov.au/bdm/indexsearch.doj Victoria BDMs 20106/1893 Playing career By the time Vic was seventeen years old he was still in the Brunswick area where he played for both All Stars and Coburg (VJFA) before joining his brother, Allan, at Brunswick Football Club in August 1905. Immediately successful as a defender, Belcher was selected in the back- pocket to represent the VFA in 1906 when they played the Bendigo and Northern District Association. That year he shared club's the best defender trophy. He was recruited by South Melbourne secretary Bert Howson and debuted for them in round 1, 1907. Despite residing in Brunswick, Belcher chose South because he supported them as a youth and cycled to the Lake Oval to train and play. South made the 1907 grand final but lost to Carlton. Belcher began in defence but was moved to the ruck in the second quarter where he performed creditably. This match was an early indicator of Belcher's career. He was a tireless ruckman who could also play in a key position. South were premiers in 1909 and Belcher rucked the whole match. In 1913 Belcher was elected South's captain, a position he would hold until 1917 and again in 1920. He had been stand-in captain in the 1912 semi-final against his brother's Essendon side and as a result they became the first brother's to not only captain opposing sides, but to also play on each other during the match. Essendon were victors. Two weeks later they met again in the grand final but not as captains as Charlie Ricketts had returned from injury. South lost again and not until 2013, did brothers face each other in a grand final. Belcher was appointed South Melbourne captain-coach from 1914‚Äì15 and 1917, losing the 1914 grand final and finishing fifth and seventh in the other seasons. South had withdrawn from the VFL in 1916 at the height of the First World War. As vice-captain in 1918 Belcher won his second premiership with South and enhanced his reputation as a good finals player. Collingwood led by 12 points at the final break of the grand final but South switched Belcher from defence to the ruck and he was instrumental in a comeback that saw South win by five points. Until 2012 he was the only person in VFL/AFL history to win two premierships with the South Melbourne Swans. Belcher represented Victoria against South Australia twice in 1919, both times he was elected captain. Upon his retirement at the end of the 1920 season Jack Worrall assessed his career: > When he began playing senior football, Belcher was a ruckman, being as fine > a performer in that position as any man playing. In his latter years he has > been a noted defender, his coolness, judgement, fine marking qualities and > dash making him an ideal back man and captain. Like the vast majority of > champions Belcher has been fairness personified. He possesses fine spring > and determination, was a hard man to beat and was a manly opponent In 1996 Belcher was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and in 2003 was named in the Sydney Swans Team of the Century. He was the last survivor of the 1909 Premiership team. Belcher is one of only five dual South Melbourne/Sydney Swans premiership players, the other four being Jude Bolton, Adam Goodes, Ryan O'Keefe and Lewis Roberts-Thomson. Coaching career As a playing-coach Belcher guided South Melbourne in 53 matches. After a single season as an umpire in 1921 he was appointed coach of Fitzroy Football Club in 1922 and lead them to that season's premiership. He continued in 1923-24 finishing second and third respectively. Having received a playing clearance from South Melbourne he was recruited by City Football Club in the Launceston- based NTFA competition for the 1925 season. Belcher played regularly until a groin injury in a representative match ended his on-field season. City finished third for the season. Belcher returned to Melbourne as non-playing coach of Fitzroy from 1926-27 then moved to a junior team, East Brunswick, as playing coach in 1928. After a year on the committee Belcher was appointed non-playing coach at Brunswick in 1932. Umpiring career Belcher had two stints as an umpire with the VFL and a single season with the VFA. In 1921 he applied for a position as an umpire with the VFL. He was accepted and made his debut as a boundary umpire in round two's Melbourne versus Collingwood match earning Heritage Number 134. Belcher umpired 16 VFL matches during the season, all on the boundary, and was appointed to the 1921 VFL Grand Final. He returned to coaching the following season. In 1928 Belcher trialled as a boundary umpire for the VFL but was unsuccessful and instead field umpired in the VFA seconds for the season. He trialled again in 1930 and was placed on the VFL list as a field umpire. As a country field umpire he officiated in 14 matches for the season. He was appointed to the Benalla-Mulwala association grand final which became a particularly violent match. It degenerated to a series of melees in the second half, although no blame was attached to Belcher. During this period the VFL appointed one field umpire to senior matches as a boundary umpire in case of emergency. In this capacity Belcher officiated in his final senior match in round 5, 1930 - Geelong versus Carlton. After being elected to a committee position with the Brunswick Football Club in January 1931 Belcher umpired only a single country match that season before retiring from umpiring for the final time.Flegg, David.

Serhat Ulueren is believed to be a fan of Turkish giants Galatasaray, although never stating this on his show. Recently a group of Fenerbah√ße fans angrily protested against Serhat Ulueren on the Baƒüdat Avenue, ƒ∞stanbul. These protests were made following Ulueren's decision to invite confesser Cihan Oskay to his programme, Cihan Oskay made controversial claims about Fenerbah√ße and Aziz Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m being involved in match-fixing cases. Fenerbah√ße board and its fans insisted that Ulueren acted unfairly and partially, as well as stating that Ulueren didn't ask for a response from Fenerbah√ße based on these claims. Recently Ulueren has been criticized due to the unfavoured and heated arguments that usually take place in his weekly programme Telegol. The television ratings have even decreased due to the unnecessary fall outs.

What's on the screen is a notch franker than most TV fare, but not structured enough to win much play outside festivals...Aside from a few well-observed scenes and moments, there are a lot of warmed-over ideas and little compelling cinema.\\"Young, Deborah.

Smilax zeylanica is preferred for Oviposition and eggs are laid singly at the base of young shoots. Before hatching parts of the egg shell are consumed. Just after their emergence from the egg shells the hatchlings (1.23 ¬± 0.11 mm) consumed the remaining part of the egg shell, then they start feeding leaves. The first htree instars take 2-3 days. The fourth instar stops feeding after four days and attaches itself with a silk girdle abd builds the pupal case. 15 to 16 days fter hatching from eggs the pupation takes place. The adult butterflies emerged from the pupae after 7.7 (¬±0.27) days. The total life cycles were completed in 23-26 days in laboratory conditions and may be change with temperature changes. This short duration of life cycle enables the butterfly species to complete several life cycles within a year.

He also served as a college professor and held positions in the government, including Minister of Education and several ambassadorships.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Germ√°n Arciniegas Family Arciniegas was the son of Rafael Arciniegas Tavera, a farmer, and his wife Aurora Angueyra Figueredo. He had three brothers and four sisters. His father died young, leaving his mother struggling to support the family. His maternal great-grandfather was Perucho Figueredo, an early Cuban freedom fighter who wrote La Bayamesa, Cuba's national anthem. Both of Perucho's daughters fled the country when he was executed. Luz, the younger daughter, was married to a Cuban engineer who went to Colombia to help build a railroad line. It was there, amid the dangers of the jungle, that Germ√°n's mother was born.Germ√°n Arciniegas. Por Rafael Grillo. En El Caim√°n Barbudo Early years At the age of eighteen, he began studying law at the National University of Colombia. At that time he had already created two journals: A√±o Quinto (1916) and Voz de la Juventud (1917). While a student he founded and managed the magazine Universidad (1921). He collaborated with many well-known figures at all three periodicals, including Luis L√≥pez de Mesa, Jos√© Vasconcelos, Le√≥n de Greiff and Jos√© Juan Tablada, who introduced the haiku into Spanish literature via Universidad. His love of journalism led him to establish and manage numerous cultural magazines throughout his life. In 1928, he joined El Tiempo, a daily newspaper in Bogot√°, where he managed the editorial section, put together the Sunday Literary Supplement and wrote a weekly column, becoming the general manager in 1937. He would continue to contribute articles and opinion pieces to El Tiempo for the rest of his life, speaking out against drug trafficking, Marxist guerrillas and restrictive immigration policies. With the assistance of Carlos Pellicer, he established the Federation of Colombian Students. The group opposed Jesuit influence in the nation's universities and held student carnivals which verged on riots. He narrowly missed being killed when a bullet grazed his head at one student rally. Their activism eventually helped to end the Conservative Party's grip on the government and, in 1933, led to the passage of university reforms, which gave students the right to elect their own rectors and have a representative in the legislature to act as their advocate; a position Arciniegas held for a time.La Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango del Banco de la Rep√∫blica: Germ√°n Arciniegas For him, students were the axis around which all political and intellectual movements had turned throughout history. This gave rise to his first book El Estudiante de la Mesa Redonda (The Student of the Round Table, 1932), in which he speaks of history as a \\"tavern\\" with the students sitting at a single table, drinking, recounting their deeds and laughing at everybody else. Later career He continued his fight for students' rights during his brief tenures as Minister of Education in 1942 and 1945-46. During this time, he founded the Caro and Cuervo Institute and moved the Colombian National Museum to its current home in a former prison building. During World War II, he supported giving aid and asylum to refugees. This was in opposition to Luis L√≥pez de Mesa, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who prohibited the entry of Jews into Colombia. Due to this resurgence of Conservative ideology in the 1940s, Arciniegas felt that he and his family were in danger and moved to the United States, taking advantage of an offer to teach at Columbia University. He lived in New York for ten years (1947‚Äì57). At this time, he wrote his most important and most often banned book, Entre la Libertad y el Miedo (Between Freedom and Fear, 1952). The work analyzes a critical period in Latin-America, when seven dictators were in power at the same time. He also criticized the U.S. State Department for its conciliatory behavior towards these regimes and, as a result, was detained for questioning several times after returning from trips abroad. The publication and translation of the book was prohibited in at least ten countries. General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, the President of Colombia, accused Arciniegas of being a Communist and ordered all of his books to be burnt. Rafael Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, put Arciniegas on his hit list. In terms of culture, Arciniegas strove to achieve and maintain a synthesis between the indigenous and the European. This approach was the driving force behind all of his diplomatic and political activities. He served as vice consul in London (1929), chancellor at the Colombian embassy in Argentina (1940) and as Ambassador to Italy (1959), Israel (1962), Venezuela (1966) and the Holy See (1976). In all of these positions, he acted as an advocate for the art and culture of America, which he perceived as extending from Alaska to Patagonia. In 1992, he was appointed President of the National Commission for the Celebration of the Five-Hundredeth Anniversary of the Discovery of America. He was summarily dismissed by then First-Lady Ana Milena Mu√±oz de Gaviria, who took over the commission herself; an action that generated much controversy.

Together with James R. Miller, Pflueger designed some of the leading skyscrapers and movie theaters in San Francisco in the 1920s, and his works featured art by challenging new artists such as Ralph Stackpole and Diego Rivera. Rather than breaking new ground with his designs, Pflueger captured the spirit of the times and refined it, adding a distinct personal flair. His work influenced later architects such as Pietro Belluschi. Pflueger, who started as a working- class draftsman and never went to college, established his imprint on the development of Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne, neo-Mayan, Beaux-Arts, Mission Revival, Neoclassical and International. His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces, including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont, three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day. Pflueger's social and business connections spanned the city, including three private men's clubs which he joined: the Bohemian Club, the Olympic Club and The Family. He designed buildings and interior architecture for the latter two. Pflueger was highly placed in several important planning organizations: He was the chairman of a committee of consulting architects on the Bay Bridge project Quoting Gray Brechin (1999). Imperial San Francisco: Urban Power, Earth Ruin. and he served on the committee responsible for the design of the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939. Quoting from the Official Guide Book of the Golden Gate International Exposition, 1939. Pflueger was a board member of the San Francisco Art Association starting in 1930, and served variously as chair and director. While on the board, Pflueger helped the organization found the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA). Early life Pflueger was born the second of seven sons in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco to German immigrants August Pflueger and Ottilie Quandt who had met in Los Angeles and married. Other Quandt relatives lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood, and, in 1904, the Pflueger family moved closer, to 1015 Guerrero Street in the Mission District, a melting pot neighborhood of blue-collar workers. At age 11, Pflueger took his first job working for a picture-framing firm near his home. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pflueger continued his grade-school education, graduating at age 13 in a mass ceremony held in Golden Gate Park for all the city's devastated public schools. By 1907, Pflueger was working as a draftsman and soon joined the architectural firm Miller and Colmesnil, under the guidance of James Rupert Miller, senior partner. Young Pflueger sketched ornamental details based on ideas from his bosses, and attended Mission High Evening School to further his education. In 1911, Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club (SFAC), an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal Atelier Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing, lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux-Arts in an established school abroad. Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914. Early career In 1912, while Miller and Colmesnil were busy with their entry in the competition to redesign San Francisco City Hall as well as with the design of many new hotels, apartments and private homes, Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family, a club to which Miller belonged. Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de As√≠s (locally known as Mission Dolores) but added his own personal statement: a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a scrolled pediment. After working with sub-contractor members of The Family on the project, Pflueger joined the club himself. The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977. Our Lady of the Wayside Church (1912), a rural Catholic church in Portola Valley Colmesnil left the firm some time around 1913, leaving Miller to conduct business as \\"J. R. Miller\\". Subsequently, Pflueger was assigned by Miller to work closely with the firm's major client, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who engaged in a succession of expansion projects at their San Francisco location at 600 Stockton Street. The first expansion, completed in 1914, gave the building a roof garden, dining room, kitchen and subbasement. Pflueger volunteered for World War I in 1917, working for the Quartermaster Corps to design base facilities. He was first stationed in Washington, D.C. and then sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico to take part in base expansion there. Returning to San Francisco in 1919, Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who now wished for a further doubling in size, extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street, and adding a seventh floor. A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected, topped by a pediment displaying a tableau carved by Armenian sculptor Haig Patigian. The Neoclassic-style project was completed in 1920. In 1984, the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167. 1920s In June 1920, Pflueger passed his architecture licensing exams to become a certified California architect. He was elected president of the SFAC later that year, taking office in early 1921. J. R. Miller, relying more and more on Pflueger's hard-working energy, social conviviality and artistic talent, gave him a wide variety of assignments including designs for an automobile showroom, a firehouse and a number of private homes. Pflueger extended his proposed styles to include Aztec elements and Spanish Colonial Revival themes, the latter favored by several clients for their homes. Miller made Pflueger his junior partner following their completion of the US$80,000 San Francisco Stock Exchange building at 350 Bush Street in 1923. The firm conducted business as Miller and Pflueger. The building at 350 Bush, a neoclassic design topped with a pediment displaying a sculpture by Jo Mora and later called the San Francisco Mining Exchange, is currently empty; it was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 113 in 1980. =Skyscrapers= Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building towered over its neighbors. Miller and Pflueger were selected in 1923 to build an expansive new headquarters tower for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph. In June 1924, Pflueger showed his plans for a $3 million skyscraper, 26 stories high, designed with continuous vertical elements and a progression of step-backs narrowing the floors near the top. Arthur Frank Mathews was brought in to paint a mural in the boardroom on the 18th floor. The structure was fully devoted to offices for 2,000 employees, mostly female. Pflueger's vision was strongly influenced by Eliel Saarinen's second-place entry in the competition to design the Tribune Tower in Chicago. In June, 1925, the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building was completed for $4 million ($ million in current value), becoming the tallest building in San Francisco for the next 40 years, tied by the Russ Building in 1927. 450 Sutter Street was completed on October 15, 1929, using a primarily unbroken exterior verticality without step-backs, featuring triangular thrust window bays, the whole decorated with stylized Mayan designs impressed on the terra cotta sheathing and inscribed in metals, marble and glass within the luxurious lobby. In 1983, Pietro Belluschi said that the vertical triangular faceted lines of 450 Sutter formed part of the inspiration for the similarly faceted exterior of 555 California. As the Telephone Building was being completed in 1925, a group of Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project to be replaced by Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today. =Artists= By the late 1920s, Pflueger was already working with a number of artists such as Haig Patigian, Jo Mora and Arthur Mathews who provided fine detail and craftsmanship to his larger designs. In March 1928, Pflueger published his submission for a new building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange, featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes. Miller and Pflueger won the competition for the commission. Eight months later, the Exchange committee decided instead to rebuild the Sub-treasury building at 301 Pine Street while keeping its Tuscan columns and entrance steps, requiring a completely new approach. Pflueger's first response was a sketch with little ornamentation. Construction began in December 1928. By January 1929, Pflueger's plans indicated prominent sculptures, bas-reliefs, inscriptions and carvings, to be detailed by local artists. Ralph Stackpole's monumental stone figures top the entrance to 155 Sansome, the Stock Exchange Tower. Also in January, Pflueger booked a flight in a small mail plane heading for New York but a winter storm forced the pilot and his two passengers down in the Sierras. The three men waited 36 hours exposed to the cold before being rescued. Pflueger immediately continued his trip and met with his Metropolitan Life Insurance clients regarding a third expansion project. Early in 1929, Pflueger met Ralph Stackpole, an art professor at California School of Fine Arts and a former student of Mathews, who agreed to sculpt monumental figures for the stock exchange project as well as recommending and supervising other artists. Stackpole wrote later of his experience that \\"the artists were in from the first. They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building.\\" Pflueger hired nine artists to help decorate the neighboring Stock Exchange Tower at 155 Sansome, and instructed them only to keep their themes light and airy. Diego Rivera was brought with some difficulty from Mexico to paint a two-story mural in the stairwell between the 10th and 11th floors of the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club (now the City Club). Stackpole himself worked with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone above the tall 155 Sansome entrance, as well as carving two large sculpture groups flanking the Tuscan columns of 301 Pine Street. =Architectural lighting design= Paramount Theatre's ceiling grid and indirect lighting system patented by Pflueger Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger mounted a ceiling composed of interconnected sheet metal strips above which he used indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures that appeared to be pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939. Metropolitan Life Insurance expanded their 600 Stockton location yet again in 1929, with Pflueger designing a new wing on the Pine Street side. =Movie palaces= The Castro Theatre is San Francisco Landmark No. 100. The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, specifically requested Pflueger in 1920 after they received financing for a grand movie palace on Castro Street. In a hurry to see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles. In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser turned to Pflueger again for a new neighborhood theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996. The Senator Theatre in Chico, California includes a prominent tower at the street corner. The Nassers and Naify contracted with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger the design of the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within. Back in San Francisco, Pflueger designed the Nasser Brothers' 1,830-seat El Rey Theatre (1931) at 1970 Ocean Avenue in pure Moderne style, including a sleek tower topped by an aircraft warning beacon. A mirrored foyer in black and gold held floral and geometric accents, and twin curved stairways to the balcony flanked the foyer. Paramount Theatre showing the perpendicular blade and flanking terra cotta mosaic figures Shortly before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors including William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels of land in Oakland for the purpose of erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, but wanted to use their own East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past projects of his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930. For the 3,200-seat design, Pflueger took his inspiration from Green Mansions, a romantic fantasy novel by William Henry Hudson set in the Guyana jungle of Venezuela. Tropical rain forest motifs were used throughout the theater, including climbing vines, waterfalls, parrots and emerald green lighting. As with his other works, Pflueger mixed together sources from around the world, adding images of Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses as well as Egyptian lotuses to the primarily jungle theme. Plans were complete in November and in December 1930 ground was broken in a ceremony that called for \\"prosperity celebration\\". The grand opening was held December 16, 1931 with a crowd which extended out to the street. Live action variety performances alternated with film showings. Unfortunately for the theater, the number of tickets sold in the subsequent months was not enough to keep the theater in the black. It closed in June 1932, reopening in 1933 as only a movie theater, devoid of the extravagant live pieces. Alameda Theatre, restored in 2008 Increasingly tough economic times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides on either side of Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount. 1930s During the Great Depression, Pflueger continued to win commissions, but because of the straitened financial climate, the most noteworthy examples were no longer prominent downtown skyscrapers. Pflueger designed a handful of unique schools for San Francisco Unified School District, including two elementary schools, a junior high, two high schools and every major building on the first campus (Ocean campus) of San Francisco Junior College, an institution that would later expand to become City College of San Francisco. In 1932, Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother's New Mission Theater, bringing Art Deco stylings to the lobby in contrast to the Spanish Mission trimmings in the main auditorium. In 1993, the theater closed. The theater, now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245, was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor, opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015. Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser's New Fillmore Theater, a sister design similar in many respects. The New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project. =Cocktail lounges= During Prohibition, Pflueger designed bars for private clubs such as the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker to show off the new cocktail lounge in photographs. =Bay Bridge= Comparison of a 1930 civil engineering sketch of a Bay Bridge suspension tower and a 1935 construction photo of the architectural committee's design as built Pflueger was invited by California governor James \\"Sunny Jim\\" Rolph to chair the committee of architects who were given nominal oversight of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge project. Arriving two years into the design phase of the bridge, Pflueger was stymied at every turn by civil engineers citing the inflexible budget in his attempts to bring a more artistic theme to the bridge. A heroic figure of a giant man standing at the central anchorage between the two main suspension spans was suggested and quickly canceled; all that remains of the proposal is a 14-inch study modeled by Ralph Stackpole. The committee of architects succeeded mainly in making the suspension bridge towers more streamlined in appearance by getting rid of the civil engineer's plans for a greater number of horizontal cross members. Pflueger very likely designed the stepped semicircular tunnel entrance and exit portals and, by mounting a campaign of public pressure, prevented the bridge from being painted black, successfully substituting a silvery aluminum- based paint instead. When the bridge was completed, Pflueger designed the Transbay Terminal, the main transit center for the train lines built on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge. =Golden Gate International Exposition= For the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939‚Äì1940 on Treasure Island, Pflueger joined a committee of well-known Beaux-Arts architects and was frustrated in establishing a more modern design scheme, though his own Federal Building amply demonstrated the new direction he espoused. Pflueger's contributions were among the few buildings at the Exposition that received positive reviews. When the Exposition's investors failed to turn a profit in 1939, they decided to extend the fair another year. For the summer of 1940, Pflueger put together a large exhibit of Art in Action, showing a number of artists on display, engaged in creating works. Alfred Frankenstein of The New York Times visited in June and wrote \\"Here the visitor is privileged to observe a kind of twenty-ring circus of art... On the floor, in a series of little ateliers, sculptors, painters, lithographers, etchers, ceramicists, weavers and whatnot are at work under the direct observation of the public.\\" Pflueger once again brought Diego Rivera to San Francisco, this time to serve as the main attraction at \\"Art in Action\\". Rivera painted Pan American Unity on ten steel-framed panels spanning 74 feet in width and reaching 22 feet in height. For the second time, Rivera included Pflueger in a mural of his. Some 68 artists had participated by the end of September when the Exposition was closed. Rivera was not finished, however; he and two assistants labored for two more months in the empty exposition hall. On November 30 and December 2, 30,000‚Äì35,000 visitors came to Treasure Island to view the completed mural. On December 8, 1940, Rivera's 54th birthday, Kahlo and Rivera were married for the second time in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall. 1940s Macy's complex at Union Square includes this building which was once I. Magnin's flagship location. The flat face of white stone and plate glass, an example of International style, was Pflueger's final work, completed in 1948. In 1938, Pflueger sailed to Paris with Grover Magnin, head of the I. Magnin department store chain, aboard . The two men investigated French shopping ideas that could be brought back and used at American department stores. Pflueger gained ideas from the ship's famous Art Deco adornments. Magnin and Pflueger went to Venice and Milan as well, but found very little of use to them on their short European trip. The $3 million I. Magnin store on Wilshire (currently the Wilshire Galleria) opened in Los Angeles on February 10, 1939, with an interior completely devoted to Pflueger's concept of luxuriously separate boutique spaces within which individual sales items would receive unique attention. Pflueger's interior was attuned to women's fashions: the ground level floor was laid with rose-beige marble from France, pink velvet counter tops held gloves for trying on, rose-beige leather panels covered the walls of the shoe salon and the same leather served as covering for sofas and chairs that were provided by Neel D. Parker, interior designer and Pflueger's fellow club member from The Family. Grover Magnin continued to work with Pflueger on three more stores into the 1940s. In 1939, plans for an underground garage at Union Square were given to Pflueger for political reasons. George Applegarth's 1935 design was actively opposed from several directions and Pflueger's social contacts and his friendship with mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi were needed to get the project started. Union Square garage opened in 1943 with Pflueger's touch making it a full-service valet garage complete with a waiting room and rest rooms for shoppers and the option of having shopping packages sent directly from a nearby store to the garage or for the car to be delivered to the store. The concept of an underground garage below a city park was influential: New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger's plans (little changed from Applegarth's) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines. In 1942, while America geared up for front line involvement in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments than he had been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel in order to create a bomb-resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs of the Voice of America. This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war. Death and legacy Timothy L. Pflueger died suddenly at the age of 54 on November 20, 1946, of a heart attack on Post Street outside of the Olympic Club after taking his usual evening swim. At his death, Pflueger was not finished with the radical interior and exterior transformation of the I. Magnin flagship store at Union Square, a sleek International design that remained influential for years afterward. All his adult life, Pflueger maintained his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street. When entertaining downtown late into the evening, he was known to spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club. Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady lady friend on his arm. Pflueger never married and left no children. His brother Milton, fifteen years younger, had been working with the firm since the 1930s and, at Tim's death, Milton reorganized and headed the company, doing business as Milton T. Pflueger, Architect. In 1990, a bas-relief of influential San Franciscans was sculpted over the facade of 235 Pine Street, a 26-story skyscraper. Timothy L. Pflueger was the only architect among those memorialized. In 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to change the name of Chelsea Place, a small alley leading to the garage of the 450 Sutter Street building, to Timothy Pflueger Place.

The movement originally emerged in rural communities and was used widely in farming and the industrial development of the agricultural industry. It soon diversified into consumer organizations and in the 1900s, housing, retail and banking among other sectors. The Danish cooperative movement employed a means of economical and productive organization under the leadership of consumer- or producer- controlled corporations, where each individual member owned a part of the corporation. Members of the cooperative corporations seeks to share the economic stress of producing or buying goods, and divides the eventual end- year financial surplus amongst themselves. The specific rules of ownership varies greatly between individual cooperative corporations, as some divides the financial risk equally, while others give more power to the most financially involved individuals. Early history About 90% of all farming soil in Denmark was cooperative from 1300, as the Black Death depopulated the rural parts of the country.Busck & Poulsen (ed.), pp. 80-81 Then, the inhabitants of a Danish village would work together, forming Landsbyf√¶llesskaber (village communes). To distribute land fairly between farmers, the land was normally distributed between all farmers in a village with each of them owning a strip of land on every field. Re-allocation of land took place if the size of the individual families changed strongly.E.g. if one family had many children, while another couple remained childless. In this system, it was virtually impossible to only work individually, since the plots of land might have the full length of the field, but only be a few meters wide. A second characteristic was that all farms were located close together and near the church, with the result that fields far from the village were often poorly utilized. The Enclosure Movement This all changed in the enclosure movement between 1750 and 1800, which aimed to reunite fields and award them to one owner only.Ole Feldb√¶k, Denmark - History - The Long Peace and the Short War, 1720-1814 at Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark Any farmer would normally be awarded a coherent piece of land and perhaps an additional piece of forest. In many villages, farmers were either forced or strongly encouraged to tear down their homes and rebuild them in the middle of their new fields with the intention that this would give them easier access to every part of the field, enabling them to utilize the land more effectively. These events are known as Landboreformerne (the agricultural reforms) or Udskiftningen (the parcellation), and were instigated at the initiative of the Danish Crown to raise production. For the next century, a standard village would be composed of a series of farms, many located a distance from each other, each family working for itself producing grain and raising a few animals. After the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, two new movements hit Denmark. One was a successful attempt to reclaim moors in central and western Jutland for farming; mostly sandy land abandoned in the 14th century as a result of the Black Plague, but in many cases good for potatoes. This movement was initiated by Hedeselskabet (the Heath Association). Equally important was an influx to the world market of grain from the Russian provinces Ukraine and Poland, resulting in a sharp drop in price. The most important factor was a flood of agricultural imports to Britain, Denmark's primary market for grains, from a rapidly industrializing United States, which caused not only a sharp drop in prices, but an agriculture crisis throughout Europe in the final decade of the 19th century. This affected the income of many Danish farmers and the result was a change in production; from grain to dairy products and meat. Andelsmejerier at Arla Foods When a farmer couldn't sell his grain, he fed it to his cows and pigs. Cooperative production This change in production resulted in a need for dairies and slaughterhouses. A Danish minister visited England and studied the Rochdale system of co-operatives, which he then brought back to Denmark.Birchall, Johnston 1997 The International Co-operative Movement The only way to pay for such massive investments was for a large group of farmers to share the cost and risk between them, thus creating the cooperative dairies and slaughterhouses. The new situation implied that farmers would buy cheap grain from Russia and feed it to their livestock, selling milk, butter, eggs and meat for a much higher price. The first cooperative dairy was initiated in 1882 in Hjedding, a small village in western Jutland, and the movement subsequently resulted in the creation of the now large and well-known Danish Bacon and Danish Lurpak Butter brands.The dairy in Hjedding was not only the first coop dairy in Denmark, but the first in the world, and there is a museum dedicated to the Danish coop history in the village.Hjedding Andelsmejeri The combination of the Cooperative Movement and the switch away from the production of grain resulted in a great increase in wealth for the average Danish farmer and it became very important in the way Danish farmers perceived themselves. The system was also attempted in other places where Danes settled, for example in the Danish communities in the United States. Before World War I, Denmark gained a foothold on the Russian market, and the Russian Revolution of 1917 cost Danish industry dearly. Attempts to construct cooperative dairies in Russia played a large role in this policy, but only a few were actually built there. The Russian Revolution destroyed this work, but new attempts were made in the Baltic States during the Interwar period. Attempts to export the system to Poland were considered in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to boost the exports of Danish machinery. Attempts to export this system were often linked with attempts to export the Danish system of secondary education for farmers; H√∏jskolebev√¶gelsen. Second redistribution of land Denmark saw a second redistribution of land, which effectively meant the creation of a number of small-scale farms (husmandsbrug).A \\"husmand\\" literally means a man with a house in contrast to a \\"g√•rdmand\\", which is a man with a farm, implying that the latter could make enough from his farm to live off the land alone while the \\"husmand\\" would also have to work as a manual labourer, craftsman, or similar occupation to feed his family. The top stratum in a village was the priest and schoolmaster, then came the big landowners; \\"g√•rdm√¶nd\\" or better. Next level of society was the craftsmen who normally owned a bit of land as well. The bottom of society was formed by \\"husm√¶nd\\" and landless people. The land acquired from the manors was paid for in cash by the government, and was used not to increase the existing farms in size, but to create new ones. The impact was most prominent in Southern Jutland (Northern Schleswig) which had been reunited with Denmark in 1920. Before the war in 1864, Northern Schleswig had a population density pretty much the same as the rest of the country; in 1920 it had virtually the same population as in 1860, while the population density of the rest of Denmark had doubled. Here the Danish government forced through an acquisition of large German Dom√§nenp√§chter farms; splitting them up into smaller units, that was effectively a way to try to ensure that Danes didn't leave the poorly populated and poorly industrialized province. Influence The cooperative idea and organization of the Danish cooperative movement has made a large and lasting impact on the farming and industrial sector in Denmark and has also inspired other groups to form cooperatives independently of the original movement. Notable examples of the legacy of the Danish cooperative movement includes the following: Dairies In the 1950s, a joint stock company was formed out of a series of dairies, uniting into two rivals Mejeriselskaberne Danmark and Kl√∏ver who later merged to found MD Foods (now Arla Foods) which controls almost all of the Danish milk market. The Danish Crown meat processing company also owes its existence to the cooperative movement. Co-op shops The cooperative movement have also resulted in a series of co-op retail chains, now known as Coop Danmark (formerly FDB), which are administered by The Danish Consumers Co-operative Society. The stores keeps a large share of the Danish consumer goods market and had 1.4 million members as of 2017. Wind mills The cooperative ownership model for wind mills was developed in Denmark. First for smaller wind mills, later for wind farms. One of the biggest cooperatively owned wind farms are at Middelgrunden in Copenhagen and at the Sams√∏ island. Communities In the late 70's early 80's, collective lifestyle, including cooperative production, became very popular in Denmark. Some of the intentional communities that emerged from that era, still exist, such as the Svanholm community, started in 1978. Freetown Christiania was established in 1971, when a group of young hippies occupied abandoned military grounds in Copenhagen, and several collectives also emerged from the Danish fraction of the squatting movement (\\"BZ\\" in Danish) of the 80's. People living in these communities often practice environmental consciousness, and some have joined the Danish Ecovillage Network. Co-housing Living in co-housing groups with a common area and community house is relatively common in Denmark. The community house is used for gatherings, common eatings, common washing machines, meetings and celebrations. There are three types of co-housing groups: * One type, where the flats or houses are financed and built by one of the Danish housing associations, subsequently renting out to members only. The co-housing organisation Lejerbo with 37,000 apartments across Denmark is one example. In English, this type of housing is often referred to as social co-housing. * Another, where residents are collectively owning the homes, the land and the initial financing loan. In Danish, this kind of co-housing is called \\"andelsbolig\\". * A third type, where people own the community house and the land collectively, but each family finances and individually owns the house they build and live in. The AiH community in Hjortsh√∏j is one example.andelssamfundet.dk References *Steen Busck & Henning Poulsen: \\"Danmarks historie - i grundtr√¶k\\", Aarhus Universitetsforlag, 2002 Footnotes Denmark Cooperatives ","title":"Danish cooperative movement"},{"id":"9872551","text":"The huayco tinamou (Rhynchotus maculicollis), also known as waypu (Quechua)Mart√≠n R. de la Pe√±a, Diccionario de nombres vulgares de las Aves de Argentina, Serie Naturaleza, Conservaci√≥n y Sociedad, No. 1, 2011Juan Carlos Chebez, Alejandro Mouchard, Lucas Rodr√≠guez, Ornitonimia popular y cient√≠fica de las aves argentinas II.

Ramaswamy began his literary career translating Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai's Malayalam novel, Thottiyude Makan into Tamil and writing his first short story, \\"Muthalum Mudivum\\", which he published in Pudimaipithan Ninaivu Malar. Early years Sundara Ramaswamy spent his childhood in Kottayam, Travancore, where his father worked as a Burmah Oil agent. Coming from a Tamil family, he spoke the language, but as he lived in Travancore, he only learned to read and write in Malayalam. His father decided to move to Nagercoil, Kanyakumari in 1939. He continued his schooling there, but was generally considered to be a poor student. Kanyakumari then was still a part of Kerala, so his education continued in Malayalam. At ten years old, he developed rheumatoid arthritis, and remained ill for the next five or six years. Often bedridden, his schooling was interrupted regularly until he discontinued it altogether. He taught himself Tamil from the age of 18, and became exposed to writing from the magazine Manikodi, and famous Tamil writers such as Na. Pitchamurthy and C.S. Chellappa. He was particularly influenced by Pudumaipithan. Career At 20, he began his literary career, translating Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai's Malayalam novel, Thottiyude Makan into Tamil and writing his first short story, 'Muthalum Mudivum', which he published in Pudimaipithan Ninaivu Malar. He was influenced by the works of contemporary thinkers such as Gandhi, Periyar, Sri Aurobindo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ram Manohar Lohia, J. C. Kumarappa and J.Krishnamurty. In 1952, he began to be influenced by marxist theory after meeting the Communist T. M. C. Raghunathan, editor of the magazine Shanti. He joined the editorial-board of Saraswathi, edited by Vijayabhaskaran, who was also a Communist. He met the editor M.Govindan in 1957 and they became friends. = Short stories and Novels = The majority of his early short stories were published in the magazines Sarawathi and Santhi, although he also wrote several collections, among them Akkaraic chimaiyil (On the Shores Beyond, 1959) and Pitatchatam (Offerings,1964) Oru Puliamarathin Kathai (The Story of a Tamarind Tree, 1966) was his first novel. It received critical acclaim, and is now regarded as a groundbreaking classic of Tamil literature. He edited and published a literary magazine called Kalachuvadu Ramaswamy suspended active writing for nearly six years; and when he resumed in 1973, his style had evolved. It was in this phase that he wrote the short stories in Pallikutt takhihal (The Palanquin Bearers), the book of novellas Tiraikal ayiram (Thousand curtains,1975) and later the novel J.J. Silakuripukal (J.J. Some Notes) in 1988. He published his last novel, Kuzhanthaigal, Pengal, Aangal (Children, Women, Men) in 1995. = Poetry = He wrote his first poem \\"un kai nagam\\" in 1959, using the pseudonym 'Pasuvayya' and publishing it in Ezhuthu. Nadunisi nayagal (Midnight dogs) was published in 1975 followed by Pasuvayya kavithagal (Pasuvayya poems). Although his earlier poems used structured language, they later became more spontaneous. His poetry is collected into the book 107 Kavithaikal. =Translation Work= He has translated from Malayalam into Tamil two of Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai's books Chemmeen and Thottiyude Magan and short stories by Basheer, Karoor Neelakanta Pillai and M. Govindan. =Critical writing= He wrote Na.Pichamoorthiyin Kalai marabum manitha neyamum, a book of criticism on N.Pichamoorthi's literary works. Analysing the author's poetry and short stories in depth, Ramasamy describes how Pichamoorthi has contributed to free verse poetry with his simple words and philosophy, and defines how Pichamoorthi has set the grammar on how free verse poetry should be, in comparison to many modern poets. The book was released in April 1991 by Vanathi publications. Translations of works Oru Puliamarathin Kathai has been translated into English (Tale of a Tamarind Tree, Penguin India, New Delhi), Hindi, Malayalam and Hebrew. Penguin India has released a new translation of Oru Puliyamarathin Kadai titled Tamarind History. A translation of Kuzhanthaikal, Pengal, Aangal was also released, titled Children, Women, Men. Death He died in the United States from pulmonary fibrosis in 2005, aged 74. He is survived by a son and two daughters.

History The Tatra 97 was designed to complement two full-size cars in the Tatra range: the Tatra 77 launched in 1934 and the Tatra 87 launched in 1936 along with the Type 97. Each of the three models has an air-cooled rear engine and share similar aerodynamic fastback four-door sedan bodies. But whereas types 77 and 87 each have a large V8 engine, Type 97 has a flat-four engine. The Type 97 is distinguished by having two headlights and a one-piece windscreen, whereas the 77 and 87 have three headlights and a three-piece windscreen. The Type 97's flat-four engine displaces 1,759 cc and produces , giving it top speed of . Tatra already had a mid-size car in the same class, the more conventional 1,688 cc Tatra 75 that it had launched in 1933. Tatra continued to produce the Type 75 alongside the futuristic Type 97. In fact production of the Type 75 outlived that of the Type 97 and continued until 1942. Kop≈ôivnice is in a part of northern Moravia that Nazi Germany annexed after the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Production of the Type 97 was terminated in 1939, possibly to avoid comparison with the KdF-Wagen (see below). Production of the Type 97 was 508 cars in total. In 1946 Tatra resumed car production, and replaced the Type 97 with the larger and more modern Tatra 600 \\"Tatraplan\\". Resemblance to Volkswagen KdF- Wagen Type 97 in the Tatra museum at Kop≈ôivnice In both streamlined design and technical specifications, especially the engine design and position, the Type 97 has a striking resemblance to Volkswagen's KdF-Wagen. However Tatra 97 itself doesn't appear original, as it has resemblance to sketches by Hungarian engineer Bela Barenyi, conceived in the 1920s and published in 1934. In any case Adolf Hitler is reported to have encountered and said of Tatra's cars, \\"This is the car for my roads.\\". Ferdinand Porsche was accused of using Tatra designs to design the Volkswagen quickly and cheaply. In Ledwinka's words, \\"Well, sometimes Porsche looked over my shoulder and sometimes I looked over his.\\" Tatra sued Porsche for damages, and Porsche was willing to settle. But Hitler cancelled this, saying he \\"would settle the matter\\". Soon after Germany occupied the Sudetenland, Tatra stopped production of the Type 97 and the lawsuit was discontinued. After the Second World War Tatra resumed its lawsuit. In 1965 Volkswagen settled it by paying Tatra in compensation. {  valign=\\"top\\" Tatra 97 interior  valign=\\"top\\" Tatra 97 rear quarter view  valign=\\"top\\" Air-cooled, rear-mounted flat-four engine } References center Streamlined Tatras *Tatra V570 1931, 1933 *Tatra 77 1933‚Äì38 *Tatra 87 1936‚Äì50 *Tatra 97 1936‚Äì39 *Tatra 600 Tatraplan 1946‚Äì52 *Tatra 603 1956‚Äì75 Bibliography  * External links Category:Cars powered by boxer engines Category:Cars introduced in 1936 Category:Cars of the Czech Republic Category:Rear-engined vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Tatra vehicles ","title":"Tatra 97"},{"id":"9872581","text":"Easa Saleh Al Gurg Group is a conglomerate in the United Arab Emirates.

He played seven seasons in Major League Soccer with the Columbus Crew and one in the USISL with the Richmond Kickers. He is the son of legendary Indiana University soccer coach Jerry Yeagley. Player =College= Yeagley elected to play for the Indiana Hoosiers men's soccer team under his father. Yeagley earned second team All- American honors his first three years at Indiana as a forward, midfielder and defender. His senior year, the team made it to the NCAA championship before losing to Virginia. That year he earned first team All-American honors and the Missouri Athletic Club named him as the player of the year. He graduated in 1994 with a bachelor's degree in sociology. =National team= While at Indiana, Yeagley appeared with several junior national teams, including the U-20 national team and the national B-team. At the time, the United States Soccer Federation had two distinct national teams, the A and B team . The A team players tended to be under contract with USSF to play for the national team. B team members could also be under contract, but were more typically amateur or college players. Yeagley fell in this second category. As a B team member, he never played a full international for the U.S., but competed in subsidiary international competitions. He competed at the 1993 World University games. =Professional= Yeagley signed with Major League Soccer in January 1995, as the new league was laying the groundwork for its first season. The league signed players who then entered a pool for the league's first draft which did not take place until 1996. MLS had originally intended to begin play in the fall of 1995, but delayed a year when it experienced problems with stadiums, sponsorship and team ownership. Rather than have the players it signed sit idle for a year, MLS loaned them to various domestic and foreign teams. For Yeagley, MLS loaned him to the Richmond Kickers of the USISL Premier Division (U.S. Second Division). That season, the Kickers achieved a double when it won both the league and 1995 U.S. Open Cup titles. When MLS held its Inaugural Draft, Yeagley was selected by the Columbus Crew in the 8th round (71st overall). He went on to play seven years as a defender with the Crew, retiring following the 2002 season. Coach When Yeagley retired from playing in 2002, he moved to the Crew's front office as an assistant general manager for a year. When Yeagley's father announced that he planned to retire from coaching after the 2003 NCAA season, Yeagley left the Crew and joined the Indiana soccer team as a non-paid assistant coach. The team went on to win the NCAA championship. The next year, Indiana brought Yeagley in as a full-time assistant and he had the good fortune to again see his team win the NCAA championship in penalties against the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2008, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison hired Yeagley to replace Jeff Rohrman as head coach of the school's men's soccer team. In December 2009, Yeagley was named Head Coach of the Hoosiers. In 2012, Yeagley guided the Hoosiers to their 8th championship. The Hoosiers became the first 16 seed to win the College Cup.

There have been further allegations that Safronov disclosed classified information in his articles. FSB agents questioned him in 2006 over a story about the Samara-based TsSKB-Progress, the manufacturer of the Soyuz rocket.

He had stated that he would check information that he had received on possible new deliveries of Russian weapons to the Middle East while at the arms exhibition in the United Arab Emirates. Safronov was interested in a possible sale of Su-30 fighter jets to Syria and S-300V missiles to Iran. He had information that those deals would be concluded through a third party, in order for Moscow to avoid accusations in the West of selling weapons to pariah states. Safronov called the editorial office at Kommersant from Abu Dhabi to say that he had found confirmation of his facts. On 27 February he attended a press conference held by the head of the Federal Service of Military and Technical Cooperation Mikhail Dmitriev at ITAR-TASS.

In 2006, GGP remodeled the mall complete with new flooring and a new food court entrance, however the north wing and a corridor in the south wing were left untouched. The remodel also added a 12-screen Kerasotes movie theater. When Ulta first opened in 2017, the mall has planned to relocate the former south food court next to AMC, but it was scrapped.

The Titans were granted an expansion franchise in the winter of 2003 for the 2004 season. The previous two seasons, the Titans were dominant in the Tier 2 league as they compiled a total of 32 wins, 2 losses and 1 tie. They also captured the Tier 2 Provincial championship in 2002 as well as 2003. The Titans hired Paul Rai as their first ever head coach.  2004 season  The Titans' first season of play in the RMLL Junior B circuit was successful as the team compiled an 11-7-3 record, good enough for third place. The Titans were eliminated from the playoffs first round by the Calgary Mountaineers, who in turn eventually claimed the RMLL Junior B Championship. The inaugural season was not without controversy as the Titans' home opener was marred by criminal charges that were laid against Titans player Jeff Benuik. These were in regards to a fight that occurred between him and Edmonton Warriors rookie Cam Ritchie. The charges against him were eventually dismissed. Also, the Titans were shorted a home game by the Calgary Mountaineers due to the Calgary Flames' playoff run in 2004. The Mountaineers were fined and forfeited the two points to the Titans.  2005 season  The Titans were poised to be the team to beat in 2005. With a long list of veterans returning to the team as well as a good group of rookies, the Titans were the team to beat in 2005. The Titans were led by Jesse Draper and Jordan Houstra on offense and Jeff Benuik commanding the defense. The Titans acquired Russ Decker off waivers from the Edmonton Warriors and he was slotted into the mix between current goaltenders Darcy Niedzielski and Eric Mitskopolous. The Titans started out of the gate extremely well staying on top of the RMLL standing for most of the season. The Titans ended up tied with the Edmonton Warriors for the league lead but the Titans claimed the regular-season title as they had a better \\"season series\\" with the Warriors. This was the Titans' first Regular season championship. The Titans went into the playoffs with home floor advantage starting off with the Calgary Mountaineers. The Titans claimed the series 2-0. The Titans for the first time in team history reached the RMLL Provincial Finals against their arch rivals the Edmonton Warriors. The Titans claimed the first game of the series winning 11-7. The second game went to the Warriors by a score of 11-2. Game three, in Edmonton, went to the Warriors by a score of 6-4. The Titans were on the verge of elimination as the Warriors led the best of 5 series 2-1. The Titans however fought back and tied the series at two games apiece. The last game of the provincials was played out of the Bill Hunter Arena, the Edmonton Warriors home arena, as the Titans' home rink was unavailable for the play. The game was very close as both teams jockeyed for position. However the climax was a line-clearing brawl that involved both teams' goaltenders. Eric Mitskopoulous, who was in net for the Titans, was ejected from the game, leaving the Warriors' goalie Tyler Suchan in net. Titans backup Darcy Niedzielski came in cold. The Warriors capitalized on the ensuing Power Plays that came from the line brawl and went up 7-4. Phil McIntyre scored to make the score 7-5 but it was little too late. The Warriors locked up the victory and claimed the Provincial Title.  2006 season  Many changes came about for the Junior Titans. Paul Rai resigned as head coach. Also with the new expansion in Junior A, the Titans' roster was sacked as many players were picked up through the Entry draft. In total twelve players from the Titans 2005 were gone. As well many players were over aged. All three factors did not bode well for the Titans. The Titans hired former assistant coach Wayne Niedzielski to take on the head coaching duties. The 2006 was one that lacked much needed experience as they had only a total of four returning players to balance the leadership roles. The team started out decent with two wins and a loss but quickly they were decimated by that lack of leadership and overall skill. The team did not see much success through the rest of the season as they were inconsistent. However the game results were much closer than expected as the Titans were only losing games by a couple goals, something that is rare for a team that lacked the playing experience that the 2006 team experienced. The Titans went into the playoffs as a long shot as they were facing off against the league leading Edmonton Warriors. The Titans however came to life and forced the Warriors to a 12-12 tie in Game One. The Game went to overtime and with the Titans shorthanded, the Titans lose 13-12 on the ensuing powerplay. Game two was at the Sherwood Park Arena and the Titans on the verge of elimination. The Titans fought back though and with probably one of the most recent displays of determination won the second game by a score of 7-6. The Titans were now slated to upset the Warriors and the Titans dominated the game play of both games. Game three at the Bill Hunter Arena again had its fair share of controversy. The Warriors requested the Titans changed benches. With the teams already throbbing with emotion and the game tied 1-1 in the second period, the Titans goaltender Kyle Kowalchuk was called on illegal equipment. The call was granted and Kyle was ejected from the game. The Titans then had to rally behind defenseman Brendan Sanche, who had to go in net as the Titans backup Austin Souliere was not able to attend the game. The Titans were decimated as they were down to three men as the Warriors had a powerplay before the call. The Warriors quickly made it a 5-1 game. Austin Souliere however did end up making it but was not able to stop the Warriors scoring. The game ended with a score of 7-2 and thus ending the Titans season. The titans also had novice, pewee and higher lacrosse teams who were in GELC (greater Edmonton lacrosse council) One of the novice titans the sherwood park 2b novice titan won gold at lacrosse provincials 2015 2016 in Lloydminster, Alberta.

Career  =Music= Twemlow was born in Hulme, Manchester, the son of a merchant seaman. He became a nightclub bouncer, or \\"Tuxedo Warrior\\", in 1950s Morecambe before this occupation would take him to Scotland and back to Manchester. Hoping to diversify Twemlow worked as an extra on the television series Coronation Street and attempted to break into the music industry by composing library music under the pen name Peter Reno. The latter was a hugely successful venture, with Twemlow penning more than two thousand compositions within the space of a few years. Musically self-taught, Cliff composed music using what he referred to as the 'De Dum Da' Principle. \\"I had discovered that with the aid of a tape recorder, I could assemble or compose lyric and tune. My voice would simulate orchestral sounds, giving me an insight as to how it could be arranged. God, the noises were appalling. Um Te Ta, Deeple, Dum Rump Pa Pa! I was in hysterics listening to the playback.\\" he later claimed in his autobiography. Most of his Peter Reno material was written for the company De Wolfe Music and used in television (Public Eye, Rutland Weekend Television, The Benny Hill Show,Queenie's Castle, The Sweeney), films (Zeta One, Secrets of Sex, A Touch of the Sun, Deathdream) and advertisements. One of his songs \\"Cause I'm a Man\\", written in 1967, later became famous when it was used in the film Dawn of the Dead. A particularly lucrative composition was \\"Distant Hills\\", which was used as the end credit theme of the programme Crown Court from 1972 to the shows end in 1984. \\"Distant Hills\\" would also prove to be Cliff's only brush with the charts when it was used as the B side to Eye Level- the theme from Van der Valk - a single that enjoyed four weeks at number one in 1973. The same year however Cliff would encounter legal problems due to a song of his ‚Äì recorded by Salena Jones ‚Äì bearing the name 'Live and Let Die'. Though released shortly before Paul McCartney recorded a song by the same name for the eponymous James Bond film, a court case was instigated by the publishers of the McCartney song and an injunction slammed on the Twemlow record. Twemlow's defence was that it was simply an innocent example of two songs bearing the same title, unfortunately a \\"James Bond\\" style pose on the picture sleeve threw doubt on this, and the court found in favour of McCartney's people. The Twemlow/Salena Jones record was subsequently withdrawn. Unfortunately such problems within the music industry, combined with bad business deals, legal hassles and a divorce from childhood sweetheart Georgina Curly meant Twemlow's music success was short lived and he was eventually declared bankrupt. One of Twemlow's songs from this period \\"Once\\" from the album Restless Woman (1971), claims ‚ÄúOnce I owned a mansion/ Money couldn't buy / People used to stop and say / There goes quite a guy/ Now I'm left with nothing/ And I have no place to go/ For when you're down/ Nobody wants to know\\". =Writing= In the mid-1970s, Twemlow took a variety of odd jobs, including a delivery driver for Lomas and Baynes, a company that specialized in supplying equipment for offices, he also worked for a time as a ferryman on the Manchester Ship Canal in Irlam. After undergoing an extreme fitness r√©gime to get back into shape (Twemlow's exercise sessions ‚Äì which included jogging with lead weights tied to his legs ‚Äì were the stuff of local legend) Twemlow eventually returned to work as a nightclub bouncer, taking a ¬£70 a week job, at Peter Stringfellow's 'Millionaire' nightclub in Manchester's West Mosley Street ‚Äì this was the real name of 'The Omega' club referred to in the book, The Tuxedo Warrior. He was married to Judith, who worked as a secretary for a Manchester firm of solicitors and they lived in Whitefield on the north side of the Manchester area. In the early 1980s he wrote his autobiography The Tuxedo Warrior, which documented his career in the music industry and as a bouncer. In the book's final chapter, Twemlow is hospitalized after a fight in a nightclub leaves him with a fractured skull and his family asking him to retire or seek an alternative lifestyle. He refuses and returns to being a Tuxedo Warrior with the book closing with the statement \\"it is far better to be a resident on the brink of hell, than spend a lifetime in a relentless pursuit of a mythical heaven\\". Encouraged by the success of the Tuxedo Warrior book, Twemlow would go on to write two fiction books for the pulp horror market: The Beast of Kane (1983) and The Pike (1982). The Beast of Kane, concerns the Gordon family, who adopt a stray elk- hound that turns out to be \\"Satan himself, fulfilling an ancient prophecy\\". Written in the late 1970s under the title The Dogs of Kane, the book was submitted as a possible film project for Hammer Film Productions but was rejected. Twemlow then tried to make a film adaptation of The Pike, starring Joan Collins, but the budget could not be raised despite Collins' star power and Twemlow and Collins promoting the film on the BBC's Look North programme. During the promotion Joan appeared on a BBC TV Tomorrow's World special featuring the innovative and technically advanced mechanical Pike, made especially for the film. The mechanical Pike apparently now resides as an exhibit of robotics in Japan. =Film= Tuxedo Warrior was turned into a film in 1982, however the film chooses to ignore all aspects of Twemlow's life and instead merely uses him as a character in a fictional narrative. In the film Cliff (John Wyman) is an ex-bouncer from Manchester who has opened a bar in South Africa and becomes involved in diamond smuggling, as well as being torn between two women, an American free spirit (Holly Palance) and a British compulsive gambler (Carol Royle). Confusingly, the real Twemlow appears in the film as supporting character 'Chaser'. The only other character in the film taken from the book, in real life Chaser, r.n. Barney Brogan, was an American bouncer who had a violent confrontation with Twemlow in 1950s Morecambe. In the book he is described as \\"a big burly American, around 5' 11 whose face had taken more second prizes than a blind tomcat in a bowling alley‚Ä¶.. Chaser was big and evil.‚Äù In 1982‚Äì83 Twemlow acted in, wrote and composed the music score for the film G.B.H., one of the earliest British films to be shot-on- videotape. Considered to be far more accurate in depicting Twemlow's life than the Tuxedo Warrior film, G.B.H. features him as Steve Donovan aka \\"The Mancunian\\", a world weary nightclub bouncer hired to protect a club from a London gang. The film's well remembered video cover features a blood- splattered Twemlow holding an axe with the tag line \\"more brutal than The Long Good Friday\\". The theme song of the film, written by Twemlow was actually a ballad depiction of how Twemlow was in real life; the lyrics \\"he walks tall with his head held high, before he backs down he would rather die, he's a mean machine, none tougher than, the man, man, man, man-cunian man!\\" were exactly how Twemlow lived his life. To those who really knew him, rather than those who knew him vaguely or claimed to know him; his true friends who lived day by day, shoulder to shoulder with him through the 1980s and into the 1990s saw him live by his words and actually led by example, often daring to venture where others genuinely feared to tread. GBH led to Twemlow appearing in 12 more films shot as video features plus a plethora of film-shorts and MajorVision special interest films. Later film titles include Target Eve Island (1983), which became known as Operation Urgent Fury, named after the American military operation to Grenada, co-produced with director David Kent- Watson in Grenada and Barbados; The Ibiza Connection (1994) with his close friends Steve Powell and Brian Sterling-Vete. In 1985, Twemlow worked closely with Sterling-Vette in an attempt to produce the film called The Blind Side of God with former Coronation Street star Peter Adamson, the film was later produced in conjunction with David Kent-Watson but Peter Adamson did not appear in the finished DKW version. Late in 1986, Twemlow produced and starred in Predator: The Quietus (aka Moonstalker) alongside Cordelia Roche and his old friend Brian in the role as 'Bager', the psycho killer of the film. This film was shot by David Tattersall (Director of Photography ‚Äì DOP), who then went on to eventually become the cinematographer on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, The Green Mile, Con Air, Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, and The Day The Earth Stood Still. Twemlow took a short break in December 1985 and January 1986 when he was invited to join his friend Brian Sterling-Vete in Iceland, this is where Brian was co-producing a play, Trafford Tanzi with Jon Paul Baldwinsson of the Icelandic National Theatre. It was there that Twemlow met Brian's old friend and 4 time World's Strongest Man, [Jon Pall Sigmarsson]. When Twemlow and Sterling-Vete returned to the UK, Twemlow set to producing The Eye of Satan (1987) with director David Kent- Watson, in which Twemlow plays a mercenary with satanic powers alongside glamorous co-star Ginette Gray. Twemlow followed this with Tokyo Sunrise with director Robert Foster in 1988. In 1991, Twemlow David Kent-Watson produced GBH 2 for television with filming taking place in Manchester and on the island of Malta. In the same year, Twemlow and Kent-Watson produced a pilot for a hard-hitting television series Bad Weekend. The revolutionary concept was that each episode should be filmed in the space of one weekend, as was the pilot. The following year, the duo took on their most ambitious film project, Firestar: First Contact, in which the crew of the spaceship, Firestar, battle alien monsters. The action was staged by Twemlow and Stuart Hurst. The film starred Bond-film actors Charles Gray and John Wyman. Star of The Stud films, Oliver Tobias, co-starred as the captain of the spaceship. After working on Tokyo Sunrise with Robert Foster and Brian Sterling-Vete, Twemlow appeared in several special interest films produced by his friend Sterling-VeteBrian on the MajorVision label that included The Power to Win, The Ultimate Self Defense and Fitness Over Forty. The pioneering feature films, some shot on super-low-budgets and mostly filmed in and around Manchester, continued until Twemlow's premature death from a heart attack in 1993. Twemlow had shot scenes for a comedy-action boxing film with Davi dKent-Watson on the Greek island of Rhodes with actor Terrence Hardiman. Sadly it was to be their last collaboration.

History =Colonial era= Established in the 17th century, Quarterpath Road extended from Middle Plantation (renamed Williamsburg in 1699) through what later became Kingsmill Plantation to Burwell's Landing on the James River, a few miles east of Jamestown. The Burwells were among the First Families of Virginia in the Colony of Virginia, and built the plantation's manor house beginning in the 1730s. A few years later, Carter Burwell built Carter's Grove immediately to the east in what became the modern day Grove Community. For many years, the Quarterpath Road was the most direct route between Williamsburg and the landing on the James River at Burwell's which was east of Jamestown and more convenient to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1775, as the hostilities which became the American Revolutionary War escalated, British troops loyal to the final Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore, walked along the road to steal gunpowder and munitions from the colony's stores at the Powder Magazine in Williamsburg. http://www.vagazette.com/news/local/va- news1_070908jul09,0,7697451.story =American Civil War= During the American Civil War (1861-1865), although he had personally hoped to avoid secession and a war for Virginia, James City County resident Benjamin S. Ewell, the president of the College of William and Mary, joined the local Virginia militia as the Board of Visitors closed the College during the War. Colonel Ewell, an older brother of Confederate Major General Richard S. Ewell, was tasked with designing fortifications across the Virginia Peninsula east of Williamsburg which became known as the \\"Williamsburg Line\\". Under his guidance, 14 mostly earthen redoubts were planned and built, taking advantage of the terrain, and anchored by the earthen Fort Magruder at the junction of the roads to Williamsburg leading from Lee's Mill and Yorktown. Several of the redoubts to the southwest were located near (and west) of the Quarterpath Road and protected it. In the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan attempted to move northwesterly up the Peninsula from Fort Monroe and capture the Confederate capital of Richmond by circumventing the Confederate States Army in northern Virginia. Greatly outnumbered forces on the Peninsula initially under Major General John Bankhead Magruder delayed the advance through tactics which included elaborate ruses and physical barriers such as the Warwick Line (anchored by Mulberry Island and Yorktown), and the much less substantial Williamsburg Line. During the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862, nearly 41,000 Federals and 32,000 Confederates were engaged. Confederate casualties, including the cavalry skirmishing on May 4, were 1,682. Union casualties were 2,283. The area along the Quarterpath Road saw fierce fighting. Several of the redoubts still exist there, and have been preserved, as has a small portion of Fort Magruder along Penniman Road. At the time, the Northern press portrayed the battle as a victory for the Federal army. McClellan mis-categorized it as a \\"brilliant victory\\" over superior forces. However, the defense of Williamsburg was seen by the South as a means of delaying the Federals, which allowed the bulk of the Confederate army to continue its withdrawal toward Richmond. (Benjamin Ewell's efforts to save and restore the College after the War became legendary in the U.S. Congress and the Williamsburg community). Modern times For much of the 20th century, most of the adjacent land to the Quarterpath Road was owned by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (CW). Under the leadership of CW Chairman Winthrop Rockefeller, a large tract was sold to Anheuser-Busch (AB) in the early 1970s for planned development. Among the goals were to complement Colonial Williamsburg attractions and enhance the local economy. The result was a large brewery, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, the Kingsmill planned resort community, and an office park. AB and related entities from that development plan now are the source of the area's largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases. =James City County= Although all of the Quarterpath Road was originally in James City County, Williamsburg became an independent city from the county in the late 19th century. Border adjustments through annexation have divided the roadway between these two local political subdivisions of Virginia. The portion of the Quarterpath Road in James City County is now adjacent to and within the Kingsmill planned resort community. Near the intersection of Route 199, sections of the old Quarterpath Road and Carter's Grove Country Road each pass within sight of the county government complex, which is located on a heavily wooded site. =City of Williamsburg= With the city limits of Williamsburg, the section between U.S. Route 60 and State Route 199 still exists. Williamsburg's Quarterpath Park is located near the northern end, including a recreational center and a community swimming pool (however, the community center stopped operating the swimming pool in 2013.). City of Williamsburg : Parks & Recreation However, there will be no direct motor vehicle connection to new development areas because the city elected to close Quarterpath Road at Tutters Neck Pond and convert it to a walking and biking trail, with access to Redoubt Park commemorating the American Civil War history there. A shopping center is being developed along a portion near Route 199, with other development including a hospital complex under construction on the largest undeveloped tract of land in the city. Studies in the area began in 2005 as plans to utilize some of the large tract of undeveloped land were in exploratory stages. The James River Institute for Archaeology - Experience According to the local Virginia Gazette newspaper, archaeologists working in 2008 found signs of a complex of dwellings they believe date to 1670, apparently a farm. Artifacts recovered from the site date from 1650 to 1750. Included were tobacco pipes and kitchen implements, fragments of wine glasses, and an array of tools. Although the site is only a short distance from the restored historic district known as Colonial Williamsburg, the researchers feel that the inhabitants probably had little communication with Williamsburg during its early days. Garrett R. Fesler, senior archaeologist on the project, told the newspaper: \\"It was probably oriented more toward the river. Tobacco was probably grown and hauled to the river for shipment. Later, when Williamsburg began to grow, the outlying farmer probably began to see it as a market.\\"  References  Quarterpath Road Quarterpath Road Category:Roads in Virginia ","title":"Quarterpath Road"},{"id":"9872920","text":"Cigaritis vulcanus, the common silverline, is a species of lycaenid or blue butterfly found in Asia.

Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois, the counties of Lee, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago were especially plagued by them.Channick, Herbert S. The Regulators and the Prairie Bandits , Illinois Heritage, 2002, Illinois Periodicals Online, Northern Illinois University Libraries. Retrieved March 5, 2007. The new crime wave in the region of the frontier Middle West may have occurred following the crackdown on southern outlaws by the rising vigilante-regulator movement and the breakup of the criminal syndicate of John A. Murrell and his gang, the \\"Mystic Clan\\" in the Southern United States. In the year 1841, the escalating pattern of house burglary, horse and cattle theft, stagecoach and highway robbery, counterfeiting, and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County. As the crimes continued, local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators. A clash between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County near Oregon, Illinois, resulted in the outlaws' demise and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime within the county. Banditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841. Crimes continued, committed by both sides, across northern/central Illinois. The Banditti were involved in other notable events as well, including the 1845 torture-murder of merchant Colonel George Davenport, the namesake of Davenport, Iowa. Edward Bonney, an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers, wrote of his exploits and alibi, which were recounted in his book, Banditti of the Prairies, or the Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, published in Chicago in 1850. The outlaw gangs also continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago counties following the events in Oregon.

The Bandits wielded considerable influence in the area collectively known as the Rock River Valley, following the influx of immigrants after the Black Hawk War of 1832, the last Indian war in Illinois. The Banditti posed a far greater threat, for a much longer period, than the exaggerated paranoia of the two-month Native American conflict. Former Illinois Governor Thomas Ford wrote in History of Illinois: Banditti activity In Lee County, Illinois, the Banditti also had enough power to get away unnoticed. The group had enough allies that they were scattered throughout the county. The connections the Banditti had around the county made illegal activities such as counterfeiting and dealing in and concealing stolen property easy to perpetrate.\\"The Banditti,\\" Stories & Articles, Lee County Historical Society. Retrieved July 7, 2007. It was reported that, at one time, every township officer in Lee County was a member of the Banditti. Acts of theft were carried on in defiance of authority. Citizens were threatened when they tried to seek redress from the thieves. In the end, the Prairie Bandits' activity in Ogle and Lee County became more than area residents were willing to withstand. In Ogle County the crimes that occurred in March 1841 resulted in a kangaroo court which culminated with the lynching of two Banditti near Oregon, Illinois. , National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Preservation Agency. Retrieved March 5, 2007. In nearby Lee County, a Vigilance Committee was formed by men from throughout Lee County, and especially Lee Center Township took an active role in suppressing the Banditti activity. = Ogle County = Beginning with the events on March 21, 1841, violence and retribution escalated in the area around the Ogle County seat of Oregon. Illinois, still frontier in 1841, was settled by large numbers of migrants after the Black Hawk War. The settlers were followed to the area by a criminal element. The Banditti of the Prairie were part of the crime problem that plagued much of northern Illinois. As such, the concerned citizens of Ogle County organized and eventually took the law into their own hands. On March 21, 1841, six members of the Banditti were arrested on charges of counterfeiting. They were held at the Ogle County Jail in the city of Oregon. That night a fire broke out in the newly completed courthouse, which was to be used for the first time the next day. The fire, set by the Banditti, was meant as a diversion to facilitate the escape of the apprehended gang members. The diversion failed; though the courthouse burned to the ground, the jail remained intact. The court records concerning the case had been safely concealed in the home of the court clerk. Ford, who sat as Ogle County Circuit Judge at the time, reconvened court at a new location and the trial for the accused counterfeiters went on as planned. The jury, as was common in Ogle County at the time, had been infiltrated by one of the Banditti, who subsequently refused to convict the accused. The other jurors persuaded the rogue juror to convict by threatening to lynch him in the jury room if he failed to agree with the majority opinion. The Banditti juror capitulated and three of the accused were convicted. The convicts, however, soon escaped and avoided their sentences. In April, 1841, the community of Oregon and Ogle County in general had reached a boiling point. During that month, a group of citizens, possibly acting under direct counsel from Ford, met at a schoolhouse in White Rock Township and formed an organization aimed at driving the outlaws out of the county. Membership in the new group grew quickly, soon numbering in the hundreds, and copycat chapters sprang up all over the Rock River Valley. These bands of citizen vigilantes were most often known as \\"Regulators\\". They were also called \\"lynching clubs\\", and in Lee County one group was known as the \\"Associations for the Furtherance of the Cause of Justice\\". The Regulators in Ogle County began by whipping two horse thieves, one of whom joined the group after the incident. The first Ogle County Regulator captain, W.S. Wellington, stepped aside after his grist mill was destroyed and his horse tortured and killed in April 1841. The new captain, John Campbell, was a resident of White Rock Township. The local Banditti were the Driscoll family and members of the Driscoll Gang. At the head was John Driscoll, who had migrated from Ohio in 1835 with his four grown sons, William, David, Pierce and Taylor. The Driscolls lived on Killbuck Creek in northeast Ogle County. Driscoll and his son Taylor had both been convicted of arson while they lived in Ohio. Campbell's ascension to the lead Regulator post was met with hostility from the Driscoll camp. William Driscoll immediately sent Campbell a letter offering to kill him. Campbell responded in kind; he assembled 200 Regulators, and marched to the Driscoll home. A small group of Banditti had gathered at the Driscoll homestead but seeing they were outnumbered they fled, only to return with the DeKalb County Sheriff and other authorities in tow. The Sheriff and his companions did not see the events as the outlaws had hoped; they sided with the vigilantes, and the Driscolls promised to leave within twenty days. Instead of leaving, the Driscolls and the other Banditti held a meeting in which they determined that Campbell and his fellow Regulator, Phineas Chaney, had to be murdered. Execution Nearly three months later, on June 25, 1841, there was an attempt to kill Chaney. Two days passed, and on June 27 David Driscoll and his brother Taylor attacked Campbell at his farm. David fired the single, fatal shot. Campbell's son, Martin, then 13, fired at the Driscolls with a shotgun, but the weapon failed to go off. The account that stated David and Taylor Driscoll were the gunmen came from Campbell's wife. Despite this claim, hoofprints at the scene of the crime indicated that there had been an additional three horses there. It was these hoofprints that the Regulators followed back to the Driscoll home. Once there, accompanied by Ogle County Sheriff William T. Ward, the angry group confronted John Driscoll. After questioning by Ward and his accompanying mob, the sheriff was satisfied that John Driscoll was involved in Campbell's murder and arrested him \\"on suspicion of being accessory to the murder\\". While David and Taylor Driscoll, the gunmen, fled that fateful day, William and Pierce Driscoll were arrested by a group of Regulators from Rockford. The regulator court was convened at \\"Stephenson's Mill\\" in Washington Grove, Illinois, because of the courthouse fire in March, 1841. The court was organized, witnesses gathered, and proceedings went forward. A crowd gathered at the mill, estimated to be as many as 500. At this point, Ogle County Sheriff Ward appealed to have the Driscolls returned to his custody. E.S. Leland presided over the makeshift court as judge, a position he would later hold legitimately in Ottawa, Illinois. Leland directed those present who were Regulators to form a circle. 120 men initially stepped forward; nine were dismissed as not being \\"real\\" Regulators. The 111 men remaining formed the \\"jury\\". On June 29, 1841, the vigilante trial began and William Driscoll admitted to telling his brother to kill Campbell, but only \\"in jest\\". His father, John, denied vehemently that he had anything to do with the murder, though he did admit to stealing numerous horses. Pierce Driscoll was released from custody when no evidence was found linking him to the crime. At the trial's end the guilty verdict was described as \\"almost unanimous\\"; the Driscolls were immediately sentenced to be hanged on the spot. The Driscolls refused to be hanged and instead requested that they be shot. Before the execution was carried out, William Driscoll confessed to six murders; John confessed to nothing. The Regulators then assembled a large firing squad and prepared to carry out the execution. The Regulators divided themselves into two separate squads, one for each man, of 55 and 56 riflemen. The line of 56 executioners shot first John Driscoll. William, by this time trembling, was gunned down next by the line of 55 Regulators. The description in the 1909 Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois was somewhat more tame: The lynching of the Driscolls did not spell the end of the Regulators, nor the Banditti, but it did serve to greatly decrease Banditti activity in Ogle County. =Other Banditti activity= Though the banditti continued to plague areas of northern Illinois, they were largely eradicated from Ogle County following the lynching of the Driscolls.The Regulators and the Banditti , Missing Historical Marker, Illinois State Historical Society. Retrieved March 5, 2007. However, both the Banditti and the Regulators continued to be active. In Winnebago County, in early July 1841, the offices of the Rock River Express were ransacked, an early predecessor to the Rockford Register Star, the daily newspaper of Rockford, Illinois.About Us - History, Rockford Register Star, Retrieved March 5, 2007. The offices were likely trashed in response to a scathing editorial published by the Express speaking out against the vigilante action taken by the Regulators. Banditti crimes continued well into the 1840s. One of the most shocking incidents, outside of the murderous crimes of the Driscoll Gang in Ogle, to be attributed to the Banditti was the callous murder of Colonel George Davenport at his home on the grounds of Rock Island Arsenal. On July 4, 1845, Colonel Davenport was assaulted in his home by Banditti men who thought he had a fortune in his safe. Beaten and left for dead, he survived long enough to give a full description of the criminals before he died that night. An amateur detective named Edward Bonney tracked down the killers and brought them to justice. Five men were charged with the murder of George Davenport, and all but one, who escaped before the trial, were hanged for the murder. Three more men were charged with being accessories to the murder. One man was sentenced to life in prison but escaped and was killed three months later, one man served one year in prison, and the charges were dropped against the third man, who left the area. In Lee County, Illinois the Banditti were most active in the years 1843-1850, after the lynching in Ogle. During that period, crime and gang operations were rampant throughout the Mississippi Valley but Lee County, like its neighboring northern Illinois counties, saw consistent activity. Near the Lee County village of Franklin Grove, a brutal double- murder was committed in 1848. On May 20, 1848, area resident Joshua Wingert, while searching through the grove two miles (3 km) west of town for his cattle, came upon a small log hut. Inside he discovered the bodies of two men, killed with their own axe. One of the men was nearly decapitated and the other had a large gash across his forehead. The assumed motive was robbery, as the hut was ransacked and bloody fingerprints were all about the small building. The Banditti perpetrator or perpetrators were never apprehended.History, From a booklet printed by Telegraph and Herald Book and Job Print, Dixon, Illinois, 1870, Village of Franklin Grove, Official site. Retrieved March 5, 2005. Also in Lee County, the Banditti were active in and around Inlet Grove. In June 1844 the group carried out a daring robbery of a Mr. Haskell. Haskell's residence was robbed by masked men in the midst of a summer thunderstorm. The perpetrators entered Haskell's bedroom while he and his wife were asleep. The robbers dragged a trunk of money out from underneath the sleeping Haskell's bed undetected, much of the noise they made probably drowned out by thunder. The Haskells did not discover they had been the victims of a robbery until the next morning.\\"Lee Center,\\" The History of Lee County, Lee County Historical Society. Retrieved July 7, 2007.

On 10 September 2014, the film was banned in Singapore, with the Media Development Authority claiming that it undermined national security as \\"the individuals in the film have given distorted and untruthful accounts of how they came to leave Singapore and remain outside Singapore,\\" and that \\"a number of these self-professed 'exiles' were members of, or had provided support to, the proscribed Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).\\" In response, a group of 39 artists, including filmmakers Anthony Chen, Royston Tan and Kelvin Tong, released a joint statement expressing \\"deep disappointment\\" and urged the Media Development Authority to reverse the ban. Tan stated that she would consider re-submitting the film for a rating in the future. In addition, academic Cherian George commented on the ban, writing that it is \\"not just disproportionate. It is also an insult to Singaporeans, who are in effect being told that they are not smart enough to engage critically with Tan's film, no matter how biased it may be, and to weigh what her interviewees claim against what the official history states.\\" Even Chua Mui Hoong, the opinion editor of the conservative The Straits Times, did not support the ban, writing, \\"When there are diverging interpretations of events, like the arrests of leftist activists in the 1960s to 1980s, the best antidote is not a ban on some points of view, but more openness and access to information...Singapore and its history do not belong to the ruling party.\\" Chua had joined a group of about 350 Singaporeans who had travelled to Johor Baru, Malaysia, to watch To Singapore, With Love after the ban. On 2 October 2014, Tan submitted To Singapore, With Love, unchanged, to the Media Development Authority's Film Appeals Committee to review the film's ban. In a statement, Tan wrote, \\"As we approach our 50th birthday, I feel that we as a people should be able to view and weigh for ourselves, through legitimate public screenings in Singapore, differing views about our past, even views that the government disagrees with. I hope that Film Appeals Committee will see the film and review the classification in this light.\\" On 12 November 2014, Tan's review was denied. In a statement, the chairman of the Film Appeals Committee (FAC) said, \\"While of commendable artistic standard, the FAC found the film to be a one-sided account with minimal attempts to provide a balanced mix of views beyond those provided by the interviewees featured in the film\\". Of the 12 FAC members present, nine voted to uphold the classification while the other three voted that the film be given a Restricted 21 (R21) rating instead. The film also ran into controversy in Kuantan, Malaysia, where its October screening by human rights non-governmental organisation Pusat Komas under its annual FreedomFilmFest was cancelled after Putrajaya was alleged to have pressured the owner of the Kuantan venue that would have hosted the viewing. However, deputy home minister Datuk Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar denied the allegations, claiming that To Singapore, With Love was not banned and is still under scrutiny. At the FreedomFilmFest screening in George Town, Penang, 15 officers from Malaysia's Ministry of Home Affairs turned up to stop the show, claiming that the film had not been vetted and approved by the film censor board. However, after half an hour of discussions with the organisers, the officers allowed the screening to proceed. = Snow City (2011) = In 2011, Tan released Snow City.

Tan's interview with the elderly Polunin takes place shortly after he underwent brain surgery, a trauma that has caused him to lose, by his own admission, much 'brainpower'\\".

In Singapore Gaga (2005) for instance, Tan captures and then privileges the marvelous diversity, idiosyncrasies and musicality of ordinary voices in Singapore, voices that have mostly been overpowered by the ubiquitous and bland pronouncements of officialdom\\" Professor Tan goes on to point out that \\"Tan's film points to two stages of violence which are visually resonant. At the first stage, in the 1950s-70s, large numbers of Singaporeans living in village communities were dispersed and resettled-sometimes against their will- into modern public housing estates. In the earlier decades, these mass produced high-rise apartment blocks-though clean,safe and convenient- were criticized for alienating the individual, atomizing community and lacking aesthetic character...... The visual and conceptual resemblance between apartment blocks and columbaria is uncanny, and the film does not miss the opportunity to foreground the irony.\\" Still from Moving House'Moving House gives an insight into what it is like for one of the 55,000 families in Singapore forced to relocate the remains of their relatives from a cemetery to a columbarium.

In 2015, the Group generated revenues of CHF 1.26 billion and had 4,300 employees around the world. Overview In 1995, Dr. Arend Oetker acquired a majority shareholding in Hero and re-positioned the Group to focus on branded business. Business segments that no longer fitted this brand strategy were divested. In parallel, the Group embarked on a major geographic expansion program. Today, Hero is producing products in its core product categories. The Group's operations are based predominantly in Europe, North America, Middle East/Africa and Turkey/Central Asia. History Small jars of Hero jam and marmalade at a brunch buffet 1886: Foundation of Conservenfabrik Lenzburg, Henckell & Zeiler Hero was established in 1886 when two friends, Gustav Henckell and Gustav Zeiler, set up the Henckell & Zeiler, Conservenfabrik Lenzburg to process fruit and vegetables. Henckell was an experienced conserve factory employee while Zeiler was a fruit farmer. By the end of the year, they were joined by Carl Roth as a silent partner. 1889: Carl Roth becomes a full partner Gustav Zeiler, aged 30, died unexpectedly on February 12, 1889, and was succeeded by Carl Roth. The company was renamed Henckell & Roth. 1910: Launch of the Hero brand The Hero brand name, derived from the first two letters of the partners\` names, HEnckell and ROth, was launched in 1910. Tin cans also inspired the name with the letters H, R, and O resembling their shape. This remains true today. 1910-1939: A flourishing business and international expansion Between 1910 and 1939, five companies were set-up or acquired in Switzerland and the export business flourished. Subsidiaries were founded in the Netherlands (1914) and Spain (1922). By 1922 there were 31 different types of Hero conserves ranging in size from 500g jars to the 55 kg oak tubs 1914: Quoted on the stock exchange Hero was floated on the stock exchange in 1914. This year also marked the death of Carl Roth. 1940-1945: World War II and its consequences for Hero Hero was affected by the shortages and scarcity during the war years. To ensure that supplies continued, Swiss housewives were encouraged to wash and return empty containers for re-use. Due to sugar rationing, Hero developed a conserve with less sugar and a higher fruit content, creating one of Hero's most popular brands ‚Äì Hero Delicia. This premium conserve range has 60% fruit content and a lower sugar content than standard conserves. 1942: Henckell passes away The man who contributed the first half the name Hero, Gustav Henckell, passes away early in January 1942. 1946-1994: ‚ÄòHero Classics‚Äô conquer the market In the post-war period, Hero launched a range of products, including tinned ravioli (1948), fruit juices (1963) and R√∂sti (1968) which are still on supermarket shelves today and known as classics. In 1949, the Conservas Alimenticias Hero SA, Sao Carlos, Brazil, was formed Further expansion Hero extended its activities in the baby food category with the launch of Hero Baby in Spain (1985), in the UK with Hero Foods (UK) Ltd., in Germany with the acquisition of a majority holding of Lindavia Fruchtsaft AG (1990) and in France with the take-over of Les Verges d‚ÄôAlsace (1990). 1986: Hero celebrates its centenary Hero organized a number of events to mark the 100 years since its founding. On the business side, the company purchased the conserve factory De Betuwe in Tiel, the Netherlands, among others. 1995: Hero under the ownership of the Oetker Family In 1995, the German company Schwartau International GmbH, founded in 1899 and owned by Dr Arend Oetker, acquired a majority stake in Hero. A year later, Hero entered the North American market through a joint venture with McCormick to form Signature Brands LLC with the aim to manufacture food decoration products. Hero sold off its British Rayner subsidiary, and non-Hero branded fruit juices companies, including Klindworth and Lindavia. 2000-2014: Becoming an International House of Brands In 2002, Hero acquired a majority stake in Schwartau. In 2003, it delisted from the Swiss Stock Exchange. Hero expanded into Turkey and the Middle East through the acquisition of the Egyptian jam company Vitrac and the set-up of a joint venture with √úlker Group to produce baby food in Turkey. Hero also entered the Swiss baby food market by acquiring Wander's Adapta and Galactina brands and expanded into Eastern Europe through the purchase of the Sunar trademark in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 2005, Hero purchased the Beech-Nut baby food business in the United States and set up a large R&D; centre for infant nutrition in Spain. In 2006, the company acquired Semper, the leading baby food manufacturer in Scandinavia and a year later, added the Friso brand (today Hero Baby) from Friesland Foods to its infant nutrition portfolio. Hero also acquired the Juvela gluten-free business in the UK strengthening its position in nutritional- products. Hero expanded into the Russian market, entered the organic baby food sector in the UK through the acquisition of Organix, and the Belgian market through a licensing agreement with Bl√©dina. In 2009, a new baby food plant was opened in Ankara, Turkey, as part of the joint venture between Hero and √úlker and a marketing partnership with Abbott Nutrition in the USA was established. In June 2010, Hero started production in the newly built Beech-Nut baby food plant in the US. In 2014 Hero acquired full ownership of the business in Turkey, where all products are now sold under the Hero Baby brand. 2011: New premises The building of the Hero Group's new headquarters and factory in Lenzburg was completed, a project which was to be completed a year later, right on time for the company's 125th anniversary. Previously, the company had its production facilities and offices right next to the Lenzburg train station. 2012: New CEO In 2012, Dutch national Rob Versloot was appointed as CEO of the Hero Group 2015: Expansion into South America In December 2015, the Hero Group entered into a joint venture with Kiviks Marquand, the makers of the Queensberry jams, the market leader in Brazil.

Scott was the eldest son of James Scott, of Logie and his wife Agnes Falconer, daughter of Sir Alexander Falconer, 1st Baronet, of Glenfarquhar, Kincardine. His father was Shire Commissioner for Forfarshire in the Parliament of Scotland from 1693. Scott made a marriage contract with Isabella Bannerman, daughter of Sir Alexander Bannerman, 2nd Baronet, of Elsick, Kincardine, on 3 November 1692. Scott was a Shire Commissioner for Forfarshire from 1698 to 1702. He was appointed Joint Master of works for Scotland in 1700 and Commissioner Justiciary for the Highlands in 1701 and 1702.Note: History of Parliament Online states that the son was commissioner from 1698 to 1702, apparently with his father. Foster states that his father was commissioner from 1693 to 1702, and by analysis all seats between 1693 and 1702 are accounted for without including the son. So it is possible that these offices relate to father rather than son He was then a Burgh Commissioner for Montrose from 1702 to 1707. After the Union in 1707, he sat as a Member of Parliament, representing Scotland in the first Parliament of Great Britain. At the 1708 general election he stood for Aberdeen Burghs but was unsuccessful. He became Provost of Montrose in 1710 and was elected MP for Aberdeen Burghs at the 1710 general election but was unseated on petition on 8 February 1711. In July 1712 he took part in a violent protest against the provincial synod, and publicly burnt the act of proclamation at the market cross in Montrose. However he did not stand at the next two general elections. Following the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion, several Forfarshire families who took part lost their estates and political influence, and the sitting MP for the county was expelled from parliament. Scott, who was a government supporter, was returned unopposed as MP for Forfarshire at the resulting by-election on 30 July 1716. He was provost of Montrose again in 1722 and was returned unopposed at the 1722 general election. In 1725, he was attacked by the mob at Dundee who accused him of being party to the malt tax bill and was only rescued by soldiers who happened to be at hand. He was elected for Forfarshire again at the 1727 general election but the only time he was present to vote was with the Government on the Hessians in 1730. Scott died in October 1732, aged 61. He and his wife had three sons James, Alexander and John, and six daughters Margaret, Katherine, Isabella, Helen, Mary and Elizabeth. His sons had no children and the estate of Logie passed to his daughter Margaret who married Alexander Mill.
