Its use is constructed for the general population. There are other versions of the MAST screening tool, all of which can be self- administered or via interview with someone who is trained in the tool being used. All MAST screening tools are scored on a point scale system. As stated on the Project Cork website, there are 25 questions to the MAST screening tool. The tool's length makes administering it inconvenient in many busy primary health care and emergency department settings. The tool also mainly focuses on the patient's problems throughout their lifetime, rather than the problems currently displayed by the patient. The questions throughout the screening tool operate in the past tense, which means that it is less likely to detect any problems with alcohol in its early stages, according to T. Buddy. The extended questioning is a benefit in a sense that one accomplishes a bit of the assessment section when conducting the screening; furthermore, it allows the individual conducting the screening to achieve better communication and rapport with the client. The MAST-G screening tool is directed towards screening geriatric clients and has one less question than the MAST tool. There has always been an underlying concern as to the sensitivity and reliability when questioning geriatric clients. Another related screening tool is the \\"brief MAST\\", which is much shorter than the previous tests at 10 questions. There is also the Short-MAST tool similar to the brief test; it contains 13 questions. Which tool to use is decided by the screener.

Kristen Elizabeth of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"All in all, it was a surprisingly flat episode of The Cleveland Show, especially as it kicked off the entire season.

Venezia, 1822, by Bartolommeo Gamba. Alberto Fortis (1741‚Äì1803) was a Venetian writer, naturalist and cartographer. Life Born Giovanni Battista Fortis (his religious name was Alberto) in Padua on either 9 or 11 of November 1741. He journeyed extensively in Venetian Dalmatia. His best known work is Viaggio in Dalmazia (Travels into Dalmatia), originally published in 1774 and first published in London in 1778. The highlight of the book is the description of \\"Morlachia\\", a term used by Fortis for the rural Dalmatian interior to distinguish it from the coastal towns under the influence of Venice. In his book, Fortis presented his literary discovery \\"Hasanaginica\\" as a Morlach (Vlach) ballad. Larry Wolf believed Fortis wrote the ballad as a poetry of South Slavs rather than a poetry of the Morlachs.Larry Wolff, Rise and fall Morlachismo. In: Norman M. Naimark, Holly Case, Stanford University Press, Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, p.44 Fortis believed that the Morlachs preserved their old customs and clothes. Their ethnographic traits were traditional clothings, use of the gusle musical instrument accompanied with epic singing. He also published several specimens of Morlach songs. Morlachs were speaking a language close to Romanian but they were Slavicized and finally many of them Islamized, under Turkish occupation. Fortis noted that Morlachs called themselves \\"Vlachs\\". Alberto Fortis's account of the Morlachs, translated into French, English and German brought the Morlachs to the attention of Europe.Larry Wolff, Rise and fall of Morlachismo. In: Norman M. Naimark, Holly Case, Stanford University Press, Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, p.41 The Croatian writer Ivan Lovriƒá, who wrote Notes on 'Travels in Dalmatia' of Abbe Alberto Fortis, accused Fortis of many factual errors, which he attempted to rectify. Travels into Dalmatia played an important role in bringing the Dalmatian culture to the attention of Europe during the rise of Romantic notions about folklore. Dalmatian hinterlands became epitomized by Hasanaginica, a folk ballad that was first written down by Fortis. In 1795 Fortis was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in London. He died in Bologna eight years later on 21 October 1803.

Philately was one of the most popular forms of collecting around the world.  Concept of collecting  For people who collect, the value of their collections are not monetary but emotional. The collections allow people to relive their childhood, connect themselves to a period or to a time they feel strongly about. Their collections help them ease insecurity and anxiety about losing a part of themselves and to keep the past to continue to exist in the present. Some collect for the thrill of the hunt. For these collectors, collecting is a quest, a lifelong pursuit which can never be completed.McKinley, 2007 Collecting may provide psychological security by filling a part of the self one feels is missing or is void of meaning.McKinley, 2005 When one collects, one experiments with arranging, organizing, and presenting a part of the world which may serve to provide a safety zone, a place of refuge where fears are calmed and insecurity is managed.Schwartz, 1999 Motives are not mutually exclusive, rather, different motives combine for each collector for a multitude of reasons.  What is collected  People can and do collect almost anything. Saint Louis collected saints‚Äô relics and built temples for them. Collections may be antisocial, such as the collection described in Mozart‚Äôs darkest opera, Don Giovanni. Mozart‚Äôs character, Don Giovanni, scoured the town collecting sexual conquests, making his indentured servant, Leporello, follow after him, listing names in a catalog and verifying the authenticity of the account while doing so.Rykwert, 2001 Henry Wellcome, a pharmacist, collected for society. He spent 40 years collecting over a million sharp objects that he felt represented the history of medical science. He later opened a museum, \\"The Museum of Medical Science\\", which operated during World War I. The infamous are famous for their collections. Demi Moore has an entire house filled exclusively with her doll collection, Sharon Stone collects cashmere sweaters. Napoleon collected countries, a habit that led to the \\"Napoleon complex\\" clich√© we use to describe a man who compensates for physical flaws through acts of aggression.  Psychologists' perspectives  Collections such as this one of locks showcase the diversity of what people collect. Psychologists have often taken a Freudian perspective when describing why people collect. They highlight the controlling and impulsive dark side to collecting, the need for people to have \\"an object of desire.\\" This desire, and hence the innate propensity to collect, begins at birth. The infant first desires the emotional and physical comfort of the nourishing breast, then the familiar baby blanket the child clings to for comfort and security. Stuffed animals, favorite toys are taken to bed and provide the emotional security needed to fall asleep. A sense of ownership and control is facilitated through possession of these items for the vulnerable child. Freud himself took a more extreme position on the origins of collecting. Not surprisingly, he postulated that all collecting stems from unresolved toilet training conflict. Freud took the stance that the loss of bowel control was a traumatic experience, and the product from the bowels was disgusting and frightening to the child. Therefore, the collector is trying to gain back control of their bowels as well as their \\"possessions\\" which were long flushed down the toilet. Where Freud linked object fixation to the anal- retentive stage in childhood, Muensterberger, in his perspective paper \\"Unruly Passion\\" believes collecting to be a \\"need-driven compensatory behavior where every new object effectively gives the notion of fantasized omnipotence.\\" Jung had his own theories about why people become collectors. He touted the influence of archetypes on behavior. These universal symbols are embedded in what he termed our collective unconscious. Using this logic, collecting and completing sets have as their archetypal antecedents the collecting of \\"nuts and berries\\" once needed for survival by our early ancestors.  Negative Effects  There are unemotional commerce-motivated collectors, those that hunt for collectibles only to turn them around soon after and sell them.McCallum, 2005 However, the current author of many autograph collecting books, Mark Baker, describes most autograph seekers as being emotionally motivated to collect. Baker (2005) estimates that over 90% of autograph collectors have no intention to sell their wares. If not for money, and assuming issues arising from childhood were long resolved, then what reasons do people give for collecting? \\"For me there are three sides to it,\\" says Petrulis, a former outfielder at St. Mary's University in Winona, Minnesota who is an avid autograph collector. \\"The thrill of the chase, seeing who will sign that day. Second, the collecting aspect, trying to put together one of the best autograph collections around. And, finally, feeling more connected to the game because I actually meet the guys playing it instead of just seeing them on television.\\" Petrulis also admits there is a dark side to collecting, providing some support for views that certain passions can be bad. \\"It gets addictive,\\" says Petrulis, \\"just like gambling, drugs or sex. It's like putting a coin in a slot machine. It might not pay off this time, so you put another quarter in and keep doing it until you are tapped out or finally hit the jackpot.\\"  Positive Effects Despite the interesting \\"dark side\\" of collecting, collecting is still mostly associated with positive emotions.Swartz, 1999 There is the happiness from adding a new find to the collection, the excitement of the hunt, the social camaraderie when sharing their collection with other collectors.Oxlade-Vaz, 2010Shirley M. Mueller, ‚ÄúThe Neuropsychology of the Collector,‚Äù in Collectible Investments for the High Net Worth Investor. Editor: Steven Satchell, Academic Press, 2009, pages 31-51 Oxlade-Vaz describes the intense emotional bond she had with her grandmother, and the rich heart-warming memories she had amassed at her grandma's house as a child and even as an adult. Her grandmother, a product of the Great Depression, \\"saved\\" everything. As a child, the author recalls the loving and gentle way her grandmother organized seemingly ordinary items: rubber bands were neatly bound together and artfully displayed on the mantle. Tops of pens of all colors and sizes were neatly arranged in drawers and bins. Artificial flowers, saved from the dumpster decorated every room in the house. At her grandmother's death, Oxlade-Vaz recalls the overwhelmingly pleasant emotions that overcame her as she sorted through her grandma's collections. Though not valuable, the author kept these collections to remember her grandma's thrifty, sensible, wisdom‚Äîreminders of the graceful way her grandmother was able to provide seemingly useless items dignity and respect.  Hoarding  During the COVID-19 pandemic many began hoarding toilet paper There are also times when collecting is not pleasant for anyone‚Äî and much harder to describe than simply dark. There are those who have surpassed healthy collecting behavior and can be considered hoarders. Mere collecting can cross into the realm of hoarding when it also becomes pathological. Hoarding is pathological nature can be attributed to its interference with living a normal life.Frost & Hristova, 2011 The differences between collecting and hoarding are apparent: Items in a collection are neatly organized, maintained, and presented or manipulated with ease. If a collector of 1000+ trains wishes to find a particular specimen from their collection, they can find it easily. Collections are often catalogued, sorted, and objectively maintained like books in a library. Hoarding behavior is the opposite. Items with no value or clear utility are piled in stacks with neither order nor reason. Steven W. Anderson, a neurologist specializing in hoarding behavior, posits that the need to collect stems from the basic drive to collect basic supplies such as food. This drive originates in the subcortical and limbic portions of the brain. According to Anderson, people need their prefrontal cortex to determine what supplies are worth saving (or hoarding). Anderson has found that many compulsive hoarders with brain injuries have suffered damage to a region of their brain responsible for the regulation of cognitive behaviors such as decision making, information processing, and organizing behavior‚Äî the prefrontal cortex. Those with brain injuries who did not display hoarding behavior possessed no damage to their frontal cortex, but showed damage distributed throughout the right and left hemispheres of their brain.Steketee, Frost, & Kyrios, 2003  References  # Frost, R.

It is intended to allow the offensive player to evade a defender and attack the basket. Background According to The New York Times writer Jonathan Abrams, > The move is a crafty way to distribute the two steps allocated to a player > after he stops dribbling, and it goes right to the edge of being a traveling > violation. Anecdotal reports indicate that officials not familiar with the move may call it a traveling violation. Today, the Euro step is often used when a player drives to the hoop, and it can be especially effective when a shorter guard takes on a taller forward or center. In a 2018 ESPN.com story on the move, writer Jordan Brenner said, \\"It has changed the way players navigate the defense to reach the rim and, with it, the game of basketball itself,\\" also adding that the move \\"would end up altering the very balance of power between penetrator and defender.\\" History While the first confirmed media usage of the term \\"Euro step\\" was not seen until 2007, the move has a decades-long history in European basketball. In Brenner's 2018 story, he noted that longtime coach Vlade Durovic had seen early versions of the move around 1960. Durovic himself said in the story, \\"That move was normal in Europe, especially in Yugoslavia.\\" The move was first brought into the NBA in 1989, primarily by ≈†ar≈´nas Marƒçiulionis, now generally accepted as the league's first practitioner of the move. The move was further popularized in North America in the 2000s by Manu Gin√≥bili, who arrived in the NBA from the Italian league, though Ginobili honed the move while playing on playgrounds in his native Argentina. It has since been adopted by many American-born players, among them James Harden and Dwyane Wade. According to Brenner, the physical gifts of another European player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, have led his version of the Euro step to become \\"the final phase of the move's evolution,\\" adding: > A FiveThirtyEight study showed that he covers just over 15 feet off a single > dribble when driving to the basket. Add that to his 7-foot-3 wingspan and he > can start his Eurostep from the 3-point line. . . . James Naismith never > could've envisioned two steps like Antetokounmpo's. Two steps that cover 15 > feet. Two steps that render the area between the top of the key and the > basket all but undefendable. The Greek Freak and others have weaponized > footwork by stretching the rules to their limit. In doing so, they have > fundamentally changed the way basketball is played and how we see it. While the eurostep was in common use in the NBA before 2009, it did not become technically legal until 2009. Prior to 2009 the NBA rule book had always said a player could only take one step. In 2009 it changed to read \\"A player who receives the ball while he is progressing or upon completion of a dribble, may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing or shooting the ball.\\" When the change was made, ESPN noted \\"It is believed to be the first time any league, at any level anywhere in the world, has explicitly allowed two steps.\\" References External links * How to Perform the Euro Step With Iman Shumpert via YouTube Category:Basketball terminology ","title":"Euro step"},{"id":"33213637","text":"The Durham County Palatine Act 1858 (21 & 22 Vict c 45) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Background Before the 1992 implementation of the Medicare fee schedule, physician payments were made under the \\"usual, customary and reasonable\\" payment model (a \\"charge-based\\" payment system). Physician services were largely considered to be misvalued under this system, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued. Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated an improved model to replace the UCR fees, which had been associated with stark examples of specialists making significantly higher sums of money than primary care physicians. With reference to the research of William Hsiao and colleagues, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 was passed with the legislative intent of reducing the payment disparity between primary care and other specialties through use of the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). Beginning in 2000, all three components of the Medicare RBRVS, physician work, practice expense and malpractice expense are resource-based as required by Section 1848(c) of the Social Security Act. Workings RUC was established in 1991 by the American Medical Association (AMA) and medical specialist groups. The AMA sponsors RUC \\"both as an exercise of 'its First Amendment rights to petition the Federal Government' and for 'monitoring economic trends ... related to the CPT [Current Procedures and Terminology] development process\\". RUC is highly influential because it de facto sets Medicare valuations of physician work relative value units (RVUs) of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. (The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the de jure work RVU determining body.) On average, physician work RVUs make up slightly more than half of the value in a Medicare payment. Historically, CMS has accepted RUC recommendations more than 90% of the time.see http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/5/965 Health economist Uwe Reinhardt characterized the CMS as slavishly accepting RUC recommendations. The physician work RVU values accepted by CMS also influence private health insurance reimbursement. In 2002, a RUC update of values raised concerns that the process, which was initiated by medical speciality groups, unfairly cut primary care physician pay. In a 2010 Archives of Internal Medicine publication written before the major health care reform legislation passed Congress‚Äîthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)‚ÄîFederman et al. wrote: Critics have pointed out that many RUC members may have significant conflicts of interest because of their financial relationships. In 2013 a report in the Washington Post highlighted how time seemed to bend in the system of time values assigned to various procedures. A Florida practice performing an average twelve colonoscopies and four other procedures a day in 2012 would be considered to take the physically impossible 26 hours in a nine- to 10-hour day. In other examples: In Florida and Pennsylvania surgery centers in some specialties, \\"more than one in five doctors would have to have been working more than 12 hours on average on a single day ‚Äî much longer than the 10 hours or so a typical surgery center is open\\"; and \\"Florida records show 78 doctors ‚Äî gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons and others ‚Äî who performed at least 24 hours worth of procedures on an average workday\\". RUC chairperson Levy said in the report, \\"None of us believe the numbers are fine-tuned.... We do believe we get them right with respect to each other\\" while emphasizing that the \\"voting people around that table can be really harsh\\". Researcher Hsiao of the original Harvard study said the \\"current set of values 'seems to be distorted.... The AMA fought very hard to take over this updating process. I said this had to be done by an impartial group of people. This is highly political'\\". Looking at the time between 2003 and 2013, \\"the AMA and Medicare have increased the work values for 68 percent of the 5,700 codes analyzed by The Post, while decreasing them for only 10 percent\\" and while technology is argued, again with colonoscopies as an example, to be reducing actual time spent. Looked at another way, \\"Medicare spending on physician fees per patient grew 58 percent between 2001 and 2011, mostly because doctors increased the number of procedures performed but also because the price of those procedures rose\\". Finally, there was an indication in the report that the acceptance rate of the AMA's values by Medicare \\"has fallen in recent years from 90 percent [or higher] to about 70 percent\\" but the federal agency has far fewer people - \\"six to eight\\" - monitoring the process than the AMA has operating it.Whoriskey, Peter, and Dan Keating, \\"2How a secretive panel uses data that distort doctors‚Äô pay\\", Washington Post, July 20, 2013.

In a follow-up to The Washington Post report, Bloomberg notes: \\"There is no system of payment-setting that will not ultimately rely on information from self-interested parties, just as there is no system of financial regulation that can be designed without talking to bankers, or a system of education reform that can be put in place without asking teachers and principals how things work now.\\" McArdle, Meagan, \\"Who Should Set Medicare Prices?\\" Bloomberg, July 29, 2013.

He served as a colonel in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was promoted to brigadier general but died two days later before the notification of his promotion reached him. Early life Samuel Benton was born on October 18, 1820, in Williamson County, Tennessee. He was a prominent lawyer in Holly Springs, Mississippi. He was also the publisher of a newspaper, The Mississippi Times; Number I of which appeared in April 1853. In politics he was an Old Line Whig and in favor of states' rights. He was a member of both the Union Convention of 1855 and the Mississippi Secession Convention of 1861. He served on the Ways and Means Committee at the Secession Convention. In 1852, he served in the Mississippi state legislature.Confederate Veteran Magazine, Vol. XI, No. 3, May‚ÄìJune 1992 Civil War During the American Civil War, Benton enlisted for Mississippi state service in early 1861. He was elected captain in the \\"Old\\" 9th Mississippi Infantry, 12 month regiment. In March 1861 the regiment went to Mobile, Alabama, then marched from there to Pensacola, Florida. When the enlistments of the original 9th Regiment soldiers was up, he was made Colonel of the 34th Mississippi Infantry Regiment (known as the 37th Regiment for a short period of time). The Regiment saw its first service under Major General Earl Van Dorn, during his attempt to drive back the Union Army during the movement to Corinth, Mississippi after the Battle of Shiloh. Colonel Benton was commended, as was the regiment for its behavior during the engagement. Benton and the 34th Mississippi Infantry accompanied General Braxton Bragg's army to Chattanooga, Tennessee in July 1862, then in August joined Major General William J. Hardee's Corps back to Middle Tennessee, into Kentucky, and fought at the Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, where the 34th fought successfully but at great cost. Benton was wounded, and his lieutenant colonel and major were both permanently disabled. Due to his wounds, Benton was absent from the 34th at the Battle of Chickamauga. He was back in command at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, where the regiment was on the picket line at the base of the mountain. The 34th was overrun by four columns of Union infantry, and around 200 men were captured. In the Atlanta Campaign, Benton commanded the 29th, 30th and 34th Mississippi infantry regiments at the Battle of Alt's Gap, then the 34th in Major General Edward C. Walthall's brigade at the Battle of Resaca. The brigade was flanked by Union artillery, and the war has few if any cases of greater losses (unit-proportional) by artillery fire than Walthall's Brigade at Resaca. But the brigade was immovable and defended the position for both days. When Major General Walthall was promoted to division command, Col. Benton was given the brigade. At the Battle of Atlanta July 22, 1864, while commanding the brigade, he was severely wounded in the chest by a shell fragment and wounded in the right foot, causing the loss of his leg. Death and legacy Benton's grave in Hillcrest Cemetery Benton died six days later in Griffin, Georgia. He died before his promotion to brigadier general, dated two days earlier, reached him.Rowland, Dunbar. \\"Military History of Mississippi, 1803-1898\\" Due to his death, his appointment was not confirmed.Eicher, 2001, p. 590.Warner, 1959, pp. 26-27 nonetheless lists him as a brigadier general.

He has been invited to speak at the American Symphony Orchestra League convention in Boston and assisted with the organisation's \\"Meet for the Millennium\\" project. =Portland Youth Philharmonic= Edwards became conductor and music director of the Portland Youth Philharmonic (PYP) in 1995, following Jacob Avshalomov's forty-year tenure to become the orchestra's third conductor. He was selected unanimously by a twelve-person committee from a field of more than one hundred candidates, and was officially handed the baton by Avshalomov at the season opening Riverside Classics concert on 30 August. Note: Article was published between 31 August and 4 September 1995, based on text indicating days of week in relation to concerts; exact date unknown. After Avshalomov conducted the first half of the concert, Edwards completed PYP's set with performances of works by Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The program for the first subscription series concert, which received positive reception, included: Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco Overture, Ralph Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music, and Paul Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes of Carl Maria von Weber. In addition to the four season subscription concerts performed at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, the 1995‚Äì1996 season included performances at the Newport Performing Arts Center in Newport and The Resort at the Mountain near Mount Hood, as well as in Eugene, Salem, and Newberg. In 1996 the first interactive Children's Concert was broadcast live via satellite across Oregon. The collaboration between PYP and Multnomah Community TV continued beyond 1996; in 1998 concerts were streamed as far away as Tucson, Arizona, and a 1999 recording became a finalist in the national Hometown Video Festival. Released on 27 March 1998, Fountain of Youth became the orchestra's sixth commercial recording on Compact Disc (previous recordings were vinyl or cassette). The compilation album included works recorded at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall during seasons seventy-three and seventy-four. In January 1999, Portland Parent published an article by Edwards titled \\"The Role of Classical Music in the Lives of Young People\\", which discussed the benefits of classical music to child learning development. The 1998‚Äì1999 season included performances in Salem, Newberg, Welches, St. Helens, and Milwaukie and Longview, Washington in addition to the regular subscription series. On 10 February 1999 the orchestra opened a Portland Trail Blazers game at the Rose Garden performing The Star-Spangled Banner. During Edwards' seven years with the orchestra, he and other PYP representatives established a peer mentor program which partnered orchestra musicians with low-income students with little access to music education, and earned the ensemble its second ASCAP award for \\"Adventurous Programming and Commitment to Contemporary Music\\". He made five recordings and led the orchestra on two tours: in April 1998 the Philharmonic represented the United States at the Banff International Festival of Youth Orchestras in Canada, and the orchestra toured Australia and New Zealand in 2000. The tour included performances in Auckland, Brisbane, Canberra, Armidale, Newcastle, Sydney, and Melbourne. Edwards also recorded Gabriel Faur√©'s Requiem at St. Mary's Cathedral as a collaboration with Cantores in Ecclesia. Edwards left PYP in 2002 and was succeeded by Mei-Ann Chen. Guest conductors during PYP's 2007‚Äì2008 season included Ken Selden, director of orchestral studies at Portland State University, former Seattle Symphony conductor Alastair Willis, along with former PYP conductors Edwards and Chen. =Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra= He became music director of the Seattle Youth Symphony at the start of its sixtieth season (2002‚Äì2003), putting him in charge of 1,000 young musicians participating in the symphony and its four preparatory orchestras as well as the organisation's outreach programs and the Marrowstone Music Festival program. Edwards increased the Seattle orchestra's repertoire by performing works by British composers of the 20th century and by premiering works by American composers such as John Mackey. One Seattle Post- Intelligencer contributor wrote that Edwards made a \\"fine choice\\" for the ensemble, noting that he \\"nurture[d], coache[d] and encourage[d] his musicians\\". Furthermore, she claimed that his program notes were a \\"model of clarity and fascinating detail\\". Edwards remained music director of the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra until 2005. He has stated the following about working with young musicians: =Portland Columbia Symphony, Olympia Symphony Orchestra= Edwards began serving as music director of the Portland Columbia Symphony in 2000. His year-long audition process for the music director position with the Olympia Symphony Orchestra began during the 2002‚Äì2003 season. The season also marked his fifth with the Marrowstone Summer Music program, where he remained until 2005. In 2010, Edwards was one of four finalists for the conductor position with the Yakima Symphony Orchestra. In April 2012 Edwards announced his resignation at the end of his twelfth season with the Portland Columbia Symphony, citing exhaustion from the commutes between Olympia and Portland as the reason. He has been named Conductor Emeritus and Principal Guest Conductor and returned for the 2012‚Äì2013 season finale concert. During the final performance of the Olympia Symphony Orchestra's 2014‚Äì15 season it was announced that Edwards had signed a ten-year contract extension as its conductor. In September 2019, he announced that although several years remained on his contract, the 2019‚Äì2020 season would be his final season with the Olympia Symphony Orchestra. =University of Puget Sound= In May 2012, Edwards accepted the orchestra conductor position at the University of Puget Sound, a private liberal arts college located in Tacoma, Washington. Interests Dedicated to music education, Edwards enjoys conducting Beethoven for youth orchestras. He has admitted that he did not envision a career conducting youth orchestras but also that he \\"did not rule them out\\". His favourite composition is Parsifal by Richard Wagner; other favourites include unaccompanied choral music, cello suites by Bach, quartets by Beethoven and jazz, including Nat King Cole. Apart from music, Edwards likes the Chicago Bears, CrossFit, golf, kayaking, Masterpiece Theater, poetry, and Rh√¥ne wine along with the winemaking process. Edwards is an avid sports fan and fitness advocate; he is a former rugby player, enjoys running and playing squash, and believes there are similarities between how music and sports affect the community. He was sometimes referred to as \\"coach\\" by musicians of the Portland Youth Philharmonic. Edwards has shared that he would want to work at a vineyard or winery, or be a sports radio host or travel correspondent for a publication if he were not a conductor.

It is the largest of wolf spiders, typically measuring 18‚Äì20 mm (males) to 22‚Äì35 mm (females). The Carolina wolf spider is mottled brown with a dark underside. Males have orange coloration on their sides. They live in burrows that they either create or find and ambush their prey. The spiders are particularly known for the females carrying their egg sacs on their bodies during the incubation period. The Carolina wolf spider also has a unique type of venom that both paralyzes their prey and helps to prevent microbes from their prey infecting them.  Naming  Hogna Carolinensis is commonly known as the Carolina wolf spider. Historically, it was referred known as Lycosa Carolinensis, but refinement in taxonomy in the later half of the 20th century led to H. Carolinensis, among other many spiders, to be reclassified to how it is known today.  Description  The Carolina wolf spider is the largest wolf spider in North America. Adult females can reach 22‚Äì35 mm and adult males 18-20. They are an overall light brown color, but have darker brown patterning on their backs. Their undersides are a darker black and the males can have orange coloration on the sides of their abdomen.  Identification  The Carolina wolf Spider has a few identifying characteristics. The orange coloration on the males is a good way to identify a male Carolina Wolf Spider. The spiders are also unique in that the females carry the egg-sac with them during incubation, so females can be identified in this way during the breeding season. Additionally, the eyes of these spiders reflect light, which is an especially good identifier when encountering one at night. Immature male  Range  Carolina wolf spiders are found throughout a large part of North America. This includes, but is not limited to, South Carolina, Kansas all Great Lake States, and the American Southwest. Most research on Carolina wolf spiders, though they are present in many ecosystems, has been conducted on the desert-dwelling ones.  Habitat  Despite their name, Carolina wolf spiders live across the North American continent. Due to this, they inhabit many types of geography and topology. Research seems to suggest that these spiders prefer flatter and more open areas. In fact, researchers noticed that the home range of spiders (distance they frequent from their burrow) would be cut off by sharp topographical changes in desert areas.  Movement  There is not a significant difference of the sprint speed, the speed at which they will escape perceived threats, of the Carolina wolf spider, between males and females. There is, however, a difference in the amount males and females will flee from a threat. Spiders will flee to try and get far enough from a predator or other threat so that the potential attacker loses interest in them. Male Carolina wolf spiders flee significantly more than females. Researchers believe that this is due to Carolina wolf spider burrowing habits. Male spiders do not have burrows as often as females, so they are not able to find a safe escape in their burrows as frequently as their female counterparts. Interestingly, speed of the spider and flee distance are positively correlated, meaning that the spiders that flee farther are able to run away faster, both mechanisms helping their antipredatory reactions.  Senses  In addition to sight and olfactory senses, Carolina wolf spiders will react to vibrations they sense. They will either return to their burrow, if available, or they will flee.  Hunting Tactics  Carolina wolf spiders are burrowers, so they do not catch their prey in webs. Instead, they sit on the edge of their burrow or in some other good ambush location, and attack their prey when it gets too near the spider. If the spider is not in its burrow when it catches its prey, it will feed on its prey before returning to the burrow. If a Carolina wolf spider is in its burrow when it catches its prey, it will drag it down into the depth, holding onto its victim with its chelicerae (the ‚Äújaws‚Äù of the spider). Carolina wolf spiders usually feed on insects and other small invertebrates, but have been observed with juvenile Texas Banded Geckos, implying their ability to catch and consume small vertebrate species.  Reproduction and Life Cycle  = Reproduction = 308x308px Carolina wolf spiders mate in late summer. The females carry the eggs, the sacs attached to their abdomen, during the approximately two week incubation period. There tend to be two main egg carrying seasons, the first being late July and the second being late August. While incubating the eggs, female spiders are often seen ‚Äúsunning‚Äù the egg sacs by sitting near the top of their burrow with their heads down and their abdomen, and therefore the egg sac, sticking up. As the spiders are nocturnal, this behavior is observed during night hours. Researchers do not know exactly why this behavior occurs, but they believe the warmth helps the eggs to hatch faster. When the eggs hatch, there are about 200 spiderlings per sac. = Life Cycle = Spiderlings are born near the end of summer and, barring exceptional circumstances like flooding, stay with their mother for the first 6 days of their life. During that time they learn different cues and behaviors from their mother and subsist on the remains of the yolk from where they emerged. The spiders then disperse and find their own burrows or places to live (10). As immature spiders, the spiderlings go through multiple instars (growing stages) until they reach breeding age at about three years. During their third summer, the spiders will reproduce for the first time. Males die that same summer, but female spiders can live for multiple breeding seasons. Due to this, adult male percentage peaks in June and adult female percentage peaks in July. During the year, Carolina wolf spiders are active from March to October, and they hibernate from November through February.  Burrows  Carolina wolf spiders tend to live in burrows. They come about their burrows in one of two ways: they make their own burrow or they find and inhabit one already made. To construct their own burrow, the Carolina wolf spider digs out a small area, spins a web to act as a mat to hold the structure, and will then keep digging out areas in this manner until they create a burrow that is a sufficient size for what they want. Though they are diggers, Carolina wolf spiders do not have specialized digging anatomy, so it is sometimes easier to take over the burrow of other small organisms. Occasionally, spiders will take over the burrow of their mother if she has died while her offspring are still spiderlings (10). Carolina wolf spider burrows vary in size and shape. Some are tubes that are just dug straight down while others have bends. Researchers think the variety in size and shape has to do, in part, with spiders digging the path of least resistance, though there is some correlation between spider and burrow size. In addition to the burrows themselves, Carolina wolf spiders will create turrets around the entrance to their burrows using sticks, grasses, leaves, pebbles, small animal droppings, and mud. The exact purpose of these turrets is not known, but they are hypothesized to be a lookout or early warning system for potential predators. Carolina wolf spiders tend to dig and improve their burrows in the early part of their activity season. More than offering a safe place for the spiders to live, these burrows are important microclimates for the Carolina wolf spiders. As the burrows go deep in the ground, some as deep as 30 cm, they tend to be about 4 ¬∞C cooler than the temperature on the surface. This is especially important for the Carolina wolf spiders that live in desert and other hot climates The burrows are the main base for the Carolina wolf spider, and they typically have claim over the area that is about a meter out from their burrow. They do not typically interact with others of their kind outside of mating and early offspring rearing, so burrows are dispersed randomly, no matter the environment, outside of the range of other spiders‚Äô burrows. It has been noted that when Carolina wolf spiders are brought in to lab conditions for observations, they do not burrow as well as out in the wild.  Behavior  = Courtship and mating = During courtship, males will approach the female and make the first move: they will enter into a courtship posture by extending their forelegs. They will then extend their palps and vibrate their abdomen, repeating this a few times over. Then, depending on the movement of the female, the male will approach. If the female is moving around quickly, the male will too. The male will also mimic her movement speed if she is moving slowly. Once the male is close enough to the female, he will carefully prod her with his forelegs. The female will react in one of two ways: she will either fight or not. If the female fights the male and does not kill him, he will keep pursuing her. If she fights and then pursues after the male, he will flee and try to escape her attack. If she does not fight at all and instead flees, the male will follow her in order to continue the courtship. If no female is present, male/male courting can occur. If the female is amenable to mating, she will face the male and elevate the front legs on one side of her body, waiting for the male to copulate. The male will then insert his palps several times into the female. After copulation, the male will quickly run away so they are not attacked and eaten by the female. It has been observed in a lab setting that females will court with a male if she has already copulated with a different male, but she will not pursue a second mating. = Female/Female interaction = As these spiders are mostly solitary, there is not much interaction between females. When female Carolina wolf spiders do interact, their behavior can range from merely making foreleg contact to cannibalism. Typically, they will make threatening motions like extending their forelegs, spreading their chelicerae, or drumming their palpi. = Social Behavior = Though Carolina wolf spiders are not social, research has shown that the offspring that stay with and socialize with their mother after birth have better hunting skills and bigger brains.  Predators  Carolina wolf spiders are prey to large arthropods, including scorpions, owls, and coyotes. One researcher witnessed a group of predatory ants enter a spider‚Äôs burrow, consume the spider, and take over the burrow as their own.  Thermoregulation  Carolina wolf spiders are able to thermoregulate very well, which is especially important for those that inhabit desert ecosystems or other locations with large temperature swings. They are able to acclimate to any sized (within reason) temperature change in 1.5‚Äì3 days. They do this by increasing their oxygen consumption levels to very high amounts and then lowering it to the appropriate level for that temperature. This adaptation is helpful because it reduces the shifts in food and water needs that in other spiders is associated with large temperature shifts. In the short term, before they have thermoregulated, Carolina wolf spiders are able to keep cool by keeping their abdomens close to water and drinking large amounts of water. These water sources are especially important because Carolina wolf spiders need outside sources of water as they are not able to derive water metabolically.  Venom  The Carolina wolf spider is venomous, but is not meant as a defense system against threats. Instead it is thought that their venom, which is composed of lycotoxins, is used as a paralytic agent for their prey and as a method of defense against infection from any microbes that may be in their prey. Lycotoxins change the ion and voltage gradients in their targets, especially targeting the Calcium ion, which is what makes it a paralytic. Recent research on the toxins of the Carolina wolf spider has determined that this particular toxin creates a new subclass of spider venom due to its unique amino acid sequencing and the fact that it has important antimicrobial activity.

It is one of the largest water and sewer systems in the United States. In 2000, the utility utilized five water treatment plants using water from the Detroit River and Lake Huron. In mid 2014, the DWSD had acquired significant debt and delinquent accounts, and talks of privatization were occurring. As of January 1, 2016, under the terms of the City of Detroit's municipal bankruptcy the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) was created with a $50 million annual lease agreement to the City of Detroit for 40 years, while the DWSD bifurcated to focus its services specifically on the water and sewer customers within only the city of Detroit. Overview The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department is a sprawling network covering 1,079 square-miles, servicing more than 40 percent of the U.S. state of Michigan's population, and employing nearly 2,000 people.The History of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Official website The DWSD is one of the most extensive and largest water and sewage systems in the United States. Along with serving the entire city of Detroit, it also serves the counties of Genesee, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, Wayne, St. Clair, Lapeer and Monroe. In 2000, the network comprised 11,000 miles of water mains and a storage capacity of 363 million gallons. In 2000, the DWSD provided water for around four million customers in Detroit and its metropolitan area. At this time, the department utilized five water treatment plants that were fed from three raw water intakes, two of which were sourced from the Detroit River and one of which was sourced from Lake Huron. The water treatment plants used the technologies of \\"pre- chlorination, rapid mix, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and chlorine disinfection\\". At this time, the five water treatment plants were Waterworks Park, Springwells, Northeast, Southwest and Lake Huron. In a 1992 survey, \\"nine of the 119 water purveyors that receive DWSD water indicated that considerable amounts of unlined cast-iron pipe were in place\\", and that \\"two- thirds of the eighteen survey respondents also indicated that red/rusty water occurrences were the most common cause of customer complaints\\". This was associated with the occurrence of iron uptake in the pipes. Contemporary issues , the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department has taken on significant debt and delinquent accounts, and has been under discussion for potential privatization. Efforts to collect on overdue billing has been characterized as an effort \\"to get rid of the bad debt associated with the water department and prep the public entity for privatization\\". Per a June 2014 Democracy Now article: > The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department says half of its 323,000 accounts > are delinquent and has begun turning off the taps of those who do not pay > bills that total above $150 or that are 60 days late.

Trained at the University of Auckland and the University of London, he became the author of numerous books, papers, and newspaper columns. Morton researched New Zealand's ecology and marine life, and was a marine zoologist. He was also the presenter of the imported nature and science television programme, Our World. Early life Morton began his zoology degree at the University of Auckland. In 1952 he completed his Doctorate of Philosophy (in Science), followed in 1959 by a Doctorate in Science at the University of London. During this time he was also a lecturer in the zoology department at the same university. Career On his return from London in the early 1960s,Free online Passenger Listing for the April 1960 voyage of the New Zealand Shipping Company's Rangitiki on which the Morton family travelled from London to New Zealand. he became the first person to be appointed to the chair of the School of Zoology and Biological Sciences at Auckland University, a position he held from 1959 to 1988. He was considered at this time one of New Zealand's most talented up-and-coming academics, and was later regarded by many as one of New Zealand's greatest marine biologists. His teaching style and influence have been well-documented in A History of Biology at Auckland University 1883‚Äì1983. He believed in \\"humanising\\" complex scientific issues, and presenting them in laymen's language. Morton was also regarded as one of New Zealand's leading Christian academics and believed in a unified view of science and religion. He told The New Zealand Herald upon his retirement in 1988 that \\"I find that my scientific work has confirmed my Christian convictions. To me biology and theology complement each other.\\" In his 1984 book Redeeming Creation he acknowledged the influence of the French palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin in forming the teleological view he expounded in his academic life. Morton did much for conservation in New Zealand. In 1975, he was a leader in the establishment of New Zealand's first marine reserve, Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine Reserve (which is near Cape Rodney and Leigh and includes Goat Island). He led the conservation movement to a series of victories in the 1970s and 1980s, which saved the last of New Zealand's mainland native forests, Pureora, Whirinaki, Waitututu and South Westland from logging. He served on the Auckland Regional Authority from 1971 to 1974, losing his re-election bid after switching his party affiliation to Labour. In 1989 he became a founding member of the New Labour Party, which in 1991 formed a coalition with other parties called the Alliance.

It constitutes an apology of solitude dedicated to his friend Philippe de Cabassoles.Petrarch 1978: 15  Argument  Solitude is necessary for a life of contemplation, for both saints (such as Augustine or Pope Celestine V) and philosophers.Petrarch 1978: 42 Petrarch merged the medieval interest in spiritual meditation with Cicero's idea of philosophical otium.Petrarch 1978: 31‚Äì32 His idea of a happy life is that of meditative retirement in the peace of the countryside, where it is possible to pursue both literary studies and religious meditation away from the distractions of urban life also referred to as the \\"active life\\" .Petrarch 1978: 134‚Äì137  Contents  Petrarch divided this work into two books from the beginning. A later translator further broke it down into tractate sections and chapters. The elaborate chapter titles were not in the original. = Book 1 =  First Tractate  In the first chapter, Petrarch talks in this book of needful to those that desire peace and quiet. He talks of \\"men of learning\\" desiring solitude for contemplation.Petrarch 1978: 105‚Äì106 In the second chapter, he addresses the experiences of the life of solitude. He indicates that while others may have written on the life of solitude, he draws mostly from his own experiences rather than that of a stranger. He prefers to use his own experiences as a \\"guide\\" to what a life of solitude is.Petrarch 1978: 106‚Äì107 In the third chapter, he states that there is a single idea underlying the observations of the life of busyness and the life of solitude being opposites. One life leads to grievous worry, while the other attains happy leisure. He says that he dislikes the adversities that happen in crowds and a populous environment, while solitude promotes happy leisure and more favorable results with peace and tranquility.Petrarch 1978: 107‚Äì108  Second Tractate  In the first chapter, Petrarch discusses two types of people. One is the city dweller who awakens in the middle of the night thinking of his clients with falsehoods. He thinks how he may be able to drive a corrupt bargain with ill-gotten profit gains or betraying his friends or his seductions for his neighbor's wife to tempt her away from her loyalty. He looks for whatever mischief he can create. He begins before dawn on his quest to corruption. Contrast this to the retired man, a man of leisure that is fully rested and happy when he arises. He praises God for the gifts he has received, which can not be matched by the luxury items of the busy man. He immediately engages in an honest task or an agreeable lesson. He then waits for sunrise with calmness of mind. He has a happy heart and peace of mind with good intentions for his upcoming daily activities.Petrarch 1978: 109‚Äì110 In the second chapter, he talks of the daily sunrise. Each man, businessman and retiree, has their own prayers. The businessman is greeted at the doorway by enemies and friends; complaints and lawsuits. They engage him and immediately take up his time in different directions, whatever the business is or whatever the argument. The retiree, on the other hand, has a free doorway. He can pass through or not and choose whatever activity he desires or no activity. The choice is strictly up to him. The retiree takes on a serene day of leisure and calm, while the businessman is dreaded with complaints and problems. The retiree goes for walks in the woods and smells the flowers caring not about gold or jewels. The businessman slaves under a cruel day to make even more money than before or keep others from getting what he already made. He plots to ruin another businessman or dishonestly swindle an innocent. He hides in shame at the end of his day in his home pulling the curtains for concealment. Petrarch then asks who spent their hours more truthfully.Petrarch 1978: 111‚Äì112 = Book 2 =  First Tractate  In the first chapter, Petrarch states that philosophers, holy men and poets always sought for themselves solitude for contemplation. He explains in detail how they achieved higher levels of understanding through solitude.Petrarch 1978: 187‚Äì194  Second Tractate  In the second chapter, Petrarch talks of Adam, parent of the human race. He explains that while Adam was alone he lived in peace and happiness with much joy. As soon as he received a companion, however, he lived in labor and sorrow. Alone he was immortal, with a woman he was mortal. By this he shows what posterity can hope for from the accompaniment of a woman.Petrarch 1978: 195‚Äì196  Editions  There are over 120 manuscript copies that still exist of De vita solitaria, which demonstrates its popularity through the centuries. * :(Original 1926 review of this English translation available here on the JSTOR website.) *  Footnotes  Category:14th-century Latin books Category:Medieval philosophical literature Category:Petrarch ","title":"De vita solitaria"},{"id":"33214117","text":"Max Andreyevich Reyter (, ; - 6 April 1950) Alternative transliterations found in English-language sources include Reiter and Reuter. was an Imperial Russian and Soviet military officer of Latvian origin.

It is named after Saint Servatius, the first bishop of Maastricht, and (despite being largely rebuilt after World War II) it has been called the oldest bridge in the Netherlands.. Description The Sint Servaasbrug connects pedestrian traffic from the Binnenstad district of Maastricht on the west bank of the Meuse (the most central part of the city) to the Wyck district on the east bank.. The bridge is made of limestone, and in its current configuration it is long and wide. Its seven arches each span approximately , and are supported by seven piers.. A separate steel drawbridge with a span of connects the east end of the bridge to the east bank of the river. History The Romans built a wooden bridge across the Meuse in what is now Maastricht, in approximately AD 50,. and the Latin phrase for \\"crossing of the Meuse\\", \\"mosae trajectum\\", became the name of the city. For many years this remained the only crossing of the lower Meuse.. However, the Roman bridge collapsed in the year 1275 from the weight of a large procession, killing 400 people... Its replacement, the present bridge, was built somewhat to the north of the older crossing between 1280 and 1298;. The Roman Catholic Church encouraged its construction by providing indulgences to people who helped build it. The bridge was accoladed in honor of Saint Servatius around this time. The bridge was renovated in 1680, and in 1825 a wooden strutwork section on the east side of the bridge was replaced by a stone arch.. In 1850, as part of the construction of the Maastricht-Li√®ge Canal, a channel was cut on the west side of the bridge. The damaged bridge after Allied forces liberated the city, 14 September 1944 When in the early 1930s the bridge had been relieved of its function as the city's only river crossing by the construction of the Wilhelmina bridge, downstream, a major renovation was performed. The arches were reconstructed in concrete, covered with the original stones. Underwater, counter-arches were constructed to prevent erosion of the river bed on which the bridge was built. Two arches on the eastern end of the bridge were removed and replaced by a vertical-lift bridge. Between the two bridges, on the eastern side of the river, a levee was built to separate the navigable eastern channel from the rest of the river. During World War II the bridge was severely damaged by the German army as they retreated from the Netherlands in 1944, but it was rebuilt in 1948.. In 1962, the shipping channel to the east of the bridge was spanned by a steel drawbridge attached to the main bridge.. In 1968 the bridge was illustrated on a Dutch postage stamp..

He recognizes the event from the Doomsday Prophecy book written by Rupert Crane who has already published a book about disasters around the globe which all came true. Crane calls the archaeologist Brook Calvin and invites her to his home in a remote part of British Columbia, claiming New York will face destruction. He also invites a journalist, Eric Fox to come to get his new manuscript. When Eric and Brook reach his house, Crane is found dead, leaving behind videos and a mysterious metal rod. Eric touches the rod and has a vision of future events. Soon after that, government agents appear and Eric and Brook narrowly escape them. By using the information from Crane, Eric finds out that the series of worldwide earthquakes is caused by the gravitational influence of a dark planet approaching our Solar System which will destroy the Earth when the Earth crosses the galactic equator. One of his visions reveals that there are seven ancient stone heads similar to those on Easter Island that, when joined with the rod, will send out an energy beam which will push back the dark planet. With the help of Agent Garcia, Eric and Brook locate the stone heads and try to activate them, but they are interrupted by General Slate, who wants the cataclysm to happen and plans to use the rod to rule the world after the end of catastrophe. He is defeated by Agent Garcia and Eric who successfully activates the system in the last moment, pushing the dark planet away from the Earth.

In his youth, he was a keen sportsman and played football for Scotland in the last of the representative matches played in 1872. Family and education Muir Mackenzie was born on 29 September 1847, the eighth of ten children of Sir John William Muir Mackenzie and his wife, Sophia (n√©e Johnstone). He was baptised on 29 October 1847 at Caputh in Perthshire, close to the family home at Delvine. He was educated at Charterhouse School between 1860 and 1866 before going up to Hertford College, Oxford University. He graduated with a BA degree in 1870 and became a Fellow. On 17 August 1888, he married the Hon. Sarah Napier Bruce (1856‚Äì1931), daughter of Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare. They had one child, Enid, born on 25 June 1889; she died on 17 November 1952, unmarried.

Biography On June 3, 1908, Blasi won Italy's first national marathon championship in Rome in a time of 3:01:04. Given that the race also served as the nation's Olympic trial for that year's Games, he earned a spot on the Italian Olympic team with Augusto Cocca and Dorando Pietri. The following month in London, Blasi was one of 56 who lined-up to start the marathon on a warm and muggy afternoon. He dropped out after 8 miles and did not finish. Blasi later won his second consecutive national championship with a 2:38:30 on a 40 kilometer course in Milan on September 19, 1909. One week later on an official distance course in Voltri, Italy, his 2:48:44 mark lowered the Italian marathon record set three months earlier by Arturo deMaria. On April 2, 1910, Blasi was one of ten professional competitors in a marathon with 16,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds in New York City. Dropping out after 18 miles, he was reportedly \\"carried to his dressing room\\". Supporters of Blasi and another Italian runner, Fortunio Zantis, forced an early end to another marathon in Rocky Point, Rhode Island, on July 10, 1910, by crowding the track and attempting to trip the leader, Patrick Dineen of Boston. Dinnen, who completed 21 laps, was declared the winner while Blasi finished in fifth. Three weeks later at the Rocky Point baseball grounds, 3,500 spectators witnessed Blasi compete with five other runners in a 20-mile race that was subsequently believed to have been \\"considerably less than 18 miles\\". He was reported to have led Zantis at the half-mile post by 45 yards and crossed the mile mark first in 4:36 before fading to a fourth-place finish. Blasi eventually ran his marathon personal best with a 2:38:00.8 performance to capture his third and final national title in Legnano, Italy on November 29, 1914. Although not recognized as a world best by the International Association of Athletics Federations, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians lists this mark in their progression of world records in the marathon as well as the world's fastest for 1914.

Derived from informal deliberative groups created by Nurhaci (1559‚Äì1626) in the 1610s and early 1620s, the Council was formally established by his son and successor Hong Taiji (1592‚Äì1643) in 1626 and expanded in 1637. Staffed mainly by Manchu dignitaries, this aristocratic institution served as the chief source of advice on military matters for Hong Taiji and the Shunzhi (r. 1643‚Äì1661) and Kangxi (r. 1661‚Äì1722) emperors. It was particularly powerful during the regencies of Dorgon (1643‚Äì1650) and Oboi (1661‚Äì1669), who used it to enhance their personal influence. After serving as the most influential policymaking body of the dynasty for more than a century, the Deliberative Council was displaced and then made obsolete by the more ethnically mixed Grand Council, which the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722‚Äì1735) created in the late 1720s to circumvent the influence of the deliberative princes and ministers. The Deliberative Council was formally abolished in 1792. Origins and formal establishment alt=Full-face painted portrait of a corpulent man with a thin mustachio wearing a red hat and a multi-layered yellow robe with dragon decorations, and sitting on a throne mounted on a low podium. Historian Robert Oxnam has called the origin of the Council \\"a complicated and often confusing process.\\" The Council originated in informal institutions created by Nurhaci (1559‚Äì1626) to promote collegial rule among his sons. In 1601, Nurhaci had organized Manchu society into four \\"Banners\\" that were doubled in number in 1615 to become the Eight Banners. In 1622, he gave eight of his sons (who were called \\"princes,\\" or beile) control over one banner each and ordered them to meet to deliberate major policies, especially military matters. Nurhaci's eight sons were known collectively as the \\"princes who deliberate on government\\" ( y√¨zh√®ng w√°ng; Manchu: doro jafaha beise). Another precursor to the Council was a group of \\"five high officials\\" and \\"ten judges\\" (jarguci), all Manchu, that Nurhaci put in charge of administrative and judicial tasks in 1615 or 1616. Robert Oxnam claims that this group was then referred to as \\"high officials who deliberate on government\\" ( y√¨zh√®ng d√†ch√©n; Manchu: hebe-i amban) and assisted the princes in discussing policy. Franz Michael, however, claims that they were mere \\"technical advisors\\", a point of view supported by Silas Wu. In 1623, \\"eight high officials\\" were also made deliberative officials, but their functions were chiefly censorial and their primary role was to let Nurhaci know of conspiracies among the princes. Nurhaci was succeeded by his son Hong Taiji (r. 1626‚Äì1643), who, instead of following his father's wish for collegial rule, became a strong ruler who laid the institutional foundation of the Qing dynasty. In 1627 he placed the Eight Banners under the command of eight \\"high officials\\" (Ma.: gusai ejen; Ch.: dachen), who were also told to assist the princes in policy deliberations. Silas Wu identifies this reform as the bona fide origin of the Deliberative Council, which then became Hong Taiji's main policymaking structure and was consulted on foreign and military matters. In 1637, one year after he had declared himself emperor of the Qing dynasty, Hong Taiji officially excluded imperial princes from the Council. Instead, the Council was manned by eight lieutenant-generals (later called dutong in Chinese) with two deputies (fu dutong ) each, who were put in charge of managing the Eight Manchu Banners. By limiting Council membership to Manchu military leaders from outside the imperial clan, Hung Taiji enhanced his personal power at the expense of the other princes. Nonetheless the Council remained a bastion of \\"collective aristocratic rule\\" within the Qing government. Central role in the early Qing alt=Full-face painted portrait of a severe-looking sitting man wearing a black-and-red round cap adorned with a peacock feather and dressed in dark blue robes decorated with four-clawed golden dragons When Hong Taiji died in 1643, he was replaced by the young Shunzhi Emperor and two co-regents: Dorgon and Jirgalang. In 1644, under their leadership, the Qing dynasty replaced the collapsed Ming dynasty and moved its capital to Beijing. The Deliberative Council of Ministers was Dorgon's main policymaking body during his regency. Soon after moving to Beijing, he gave the Council control over both military and civil affairs, and expanded its membership to all lieutenant-generals and deputy lieutenant-generals in the Manchu and Mongol Banners, as well as to all Mongols and Manchus who held posts of Grand Secretary or Board president. Far from limiting Dorgon's power, the Council served as his tool to denounce and arraign other princes who challenged his authority. In May 1644, for instance, he had Hong Taiji's son Hooge accused of seditious behavior and made Hooge's enemies testify against him in front of the Council. He used the same method to purge Hooge for good in 1648. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor started his personal rule: he ordered the members of the Council to memorialize to him directly on important matters of state. After Dorgon's supporters had been purged from the court (by March 1651), his former co-regent Jirgalang made a number of special appointments to the Council to foster loyalty among the Manchu elite. Between 1651 and 1653, he added thirty new members who lacked official positions in the Banners or the metropolitan bureaucracy. Two of the new appointees were Chinese Bannermen Fan Wencheng ËåÉÊñáÁ®ã (1597‚Äì1666) and Ning Wanwo ÂØóÂÆåÊàë (d. 1665), two of only three Chinese who were ever appointed to the Council. All four of the future regents for the Kangxi Emperor (Oboi, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Soni) were also appointed to the Council at that time. In 1656, the emperor issued an edict abolishing the automatic appointment to the Council of Manchu and Mongol Grand Secretaries, yet by the end of his reign in 1661, the Council still counted more than fifty members. During the Shunzhi reign, the Council was often convened to investigate important officials who had been accused of corruption or malfeasance. The Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643‚Äì1661) was succeeded by four regents led by Oboi, who took care of state affairs during the minority of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661‚Äì1722). Under the Oboi regency (1661‚Äì1669), the Deliberative Council became \\"the most prominent Manchu institution.\\" While keeping their own seats on the Council, the regents limited membership to lieutenant-generals of the Manchu and Mongol Banners and to Manchu and Mongol presidents of the Six Ministries. They also decided to grant membership to the president of the Court of Colonial Affairs, whose independence the Shunzhi Emperor had compromised by subjugating it to the Board of Rites. By 1662, the Deliberative Council had been reduced to 31 members, chiefly senior Manchu leaders who had significant experience in both military affairs and civil government. The Kangxi Emperor reverted many of the bureaucratic reforms of the Oboi faction after 1669, but continued to rely on the Deliberative Council as a body of Manchu counselors whom he consulted on a wide variety of military and civil matters, especially those that were too sensitive or complex to handle through the regular bureaucracy. The emperor allowed the president of the Censorate to sit on the Council, then in 1683, after the rebellion of the Three Feudatories had been suppressed and peace reestablished, he decided that the lieutenant- generals of the Banners would no longer be automatic members. After that, the Deliberative Council became more oriented toward civil administration. Nonetheless during the First Oirat‚ÄìManchu War, fought from 1687 to 1697 between the Qing Empire and the Dzungar Khanate, the Kangxi Emperor often consulted the Council on how to deal with Galdan, the khan of the Dzungars, and with the Dzungars' enemies the Khalkha Mongols. During his reign, the Council met on imperial request and transmitted the result of its deliberations to the emperor, who usually followed the Council's advice. Replacement by the Grand Council alt=painted portrait of a man with small eyes and a thin mustache sitting cross-legged on what appears to be a large embroidered cushion placed on a low platform. He is holding a folded string- bound book in his left hand, and flanked on each side by a low table on which are posed boxes of books (to his left) and a cup containing brushes (on his right). He is wearing an opulent yellow imperial robe with five-clawed dragons, clouds, and water patterns. The Yongzheng Emperor succeeded the Kangxi Emperor after a crisis that pitted many of the Kangxi Emperor's sons against one another. Many Manchu nobles who had sided with the Yongzheng Emperor's rivals during the succession struggle were still members of the Deliberative Council. To avoid alienating these grandees, the Yongzheng Emperor still made new appointments to the Council and consulted it on various military matters, but he also worked to undermine its power. To bypass the Council, he created smaller parallel bodies which he found more reliable and less entrenched. Slowly, he transferred deliberative powers to these more trusted ministers. Around 1730, these informal institutions crystallized into the Grand Council. Unlike the Deliberative Council, whose membership was almost exclusively Manchu, the Grand Council counted many Chinese among its ranks. This more ethnically mixed privy council served as the empire's main policymaking body for the rest of the Qing dynasty. After the stabilization of the Grand Council in the 1730s, the influence of the Deliberative Council quickly declined. During the Qianlong period (1736‚Äì1796), the titles of \\"deliberative minister\\" and \\"deliberative prince\\" became mainly honorific. Manchu Grand Secretaries held such titles until 1792, when the Council was formally abolished by the Qianlong Emperor. The title was revived in the second half of the nineteenth century for Prince Gong and others when Prince Gong was head of the Grand Council. Notes Bibliography *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

Trained as a scientist, he has long endorsed the study of anatomy and need for artists to acquire technical skills. Pivar grew his fortune in the plastics industry and is also the author of several books.  Early life and education  Stuart Pivar was born 1930 in Brooklyn, New York to a father who imported velvet ribbons and a mother known for being \\"intensely style- conscious\\". Pivar speaks Yiddish and was brought up in a Jewish family. He began collecting objects at age 7, starting with insects in Central Park, and later bottle caps on Kings Highway at age 8. He spent time at a summer camp in Kingston, New York. Pivar attended Brooklyn Technical High School before going on to earn a B.Sc in chemistry at Hofstra University, graduating in 1951.  Career  In 1959, Pivar founded Chemtainer Industries, a business that specialised in bulk-storage plastic containers. As an inventor, he made a large fortune in plastics. While remaining active in the plastics industry, he became an independently wealthy investor and buyer on the art scene.Paul Alexander, Death and disaster: the rise of the Warhol empire and the race for Andy's millions, Villard Books, 1994, p.14. New York art world At The Factory in the early 1970s, Pivar met Andy Warhol who became one of his closest longtime friends. With Warhol he would go on regular shopping trips to buy \\"masterpieces\\", which could be objects bought anywhere, from a high-end auction house to a fleamarket. After the artist's death in 1987, Pivar recalled that \\"Andy Warhol loved to buy art. We used to go shopping together for it for a few hours practically every day in the past couple of years.\\"Russell W.

Pivar endorsed the reintroduction of traditional skills into art school curricula, including the study of human and animal anatomy. With Warhol, he helped to found the New York Academy of Art in 1979, becoming one of its board members. The academy opposed abstract art and promoted traditional skills. According to Eliot Goldfinger, Pivar \\"strongly supported the acquisition of an anatomical collection of comparative skeletons, related artwork, anatomical models and charts, and the use of dissection as part of the curriculum.\\"Eliot Goldfinger, Animal anatomy for artists: the elements of form, Oxford University Press, 2004, p.ix. He donated over $1.2 million to the Academy during his involvement with it. Pivar resigned from the Academy in 1994 and complained that he had been \\"lied to and outmaneuvered\\" by other senior figures at the institution. A report placed most of the blame on his \\"disruptive, angry and abusive\\" behavior for problems at the institution. Pivar attempted to sue the Academy for $50 million, claiming that he had been caused \\"emotional and mental distress\\" and that he had been ostracised for pointing out falsification of financial records and employment of illegal immigrants. Pivar has stated that he resigned from the Academy Board along with Caroline Newhouse. Pivar is a life long art collector. Pivar was also a well known friend of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, however the two had a falling out prior to Epstein facing charges for sex crimes. Pivar corroborated the account of Maria Farmer, a graduate of the New York Academy of Art in 1995, who stated that she had informed him about her abuse at the hands of Epstein in 1996. According to Pivar, this was when the friendship with Epstein ended. Biological theories Beginning with his book Lifecode in 2004 Pivar has published novel claims about the evolution of species. He asserts that the body form of species are encoded not in DNA but in the patterned structure of a primordial germ plasm.On the Origin of Form: Evolution by Self-Organization, Stuart Pivar, North Atlantic Books, 2009 ILAOL introduction by Mark Macmenamin However, critics have stated that Pivar's proposed developmental sequences bear no resemblance to anything actually observed during embryological development. In his book on the demarcation problem, Nonsense on Stilts, Massimo Pigliucci says that he and his graduate students received \\"more or less threatening\\" emails from Pivar complaining that his non-novel theory (written in quotes) of form was not being taken seriously. On his blog \\"Pharyngula\\", developmental biologist PZ Myers reviewed Lifecode and concluded that it was \\"a description of the development and evolution of balloon animals\\". In 2007 Pivar attempted to sue Seed Media, whose ScienceBlogs hosted \\"Pharyngula\\", for describing him as \\"classic crackpot\\", but the case was withdrawn after ten days.

Maria del Monte, Varese, 1950) was an Italian painter, sculptor and decorator. Biography Lodovico Pogliaghi was born to an upper middle class Milanese family. He was enrolled at the Brera Academy at a very young age; and by 1889, he completed his studies. Among his strongest influences there was Giuseppe Bertini, who taught painting. During the 1880s, he obtained important commissions for the artistic decoration of palazzi belonging to the Milan aristocracy. He also executed religious works, and launched on his career as an illustrator of historical subjects for the Treves publishing house in Milan. He was appointed teacher of decoration at the Brera Academy in 1890, and in 1895, he had won a prestigious competition to design the bronze doors of the Duomo of Milan.Collezione di monografie illustrate: serie Ia Italia artistica, Volume 26,By Corrado Ricci, page 157, Bergamo, Instituto Italiano D'Arti Grafiche- Editore, 1906. Photo of Door of Duomo of Milan One of his works is the Pieta above the entrance to the Expiatory Chapel of Monza. As a leading exponent of an eclectic academicism orientated towards a restoring to earlier classical styles, he devoted himself to an intense activity that saw him involved in all the major official works of the time, including as consultant for the Department for Antiquities and Fine Arts, and as a restorer. During the 1920s, while continuing to carry out his official duties, he gradually distanced himself from the art world, devoting himself mainly to church commissions. In his maturity, from the mid-1880s onwards, he withdrew to the house-museum on the Sacro Monte di Varese, where he built up his collection of ancient art, shown alongside models of his own works in a striking arrangement with a historical slant.

Biography Born in Savona and after losing his father at the age of ten, Cesare Tallone moved with his mother and sisters to Alessandria, where he became a pupil of the decorative artist Pietro Sassi. Some members of the local bourgeoisie commissioned the first portraits from him and persuaded the City Council to finance his studies. Thanks to this financial aid, Tallone was able to enrol in the Brera Academy in 1872, studying under Raffaele Casnedi, Luigi Riccardi and Giuseppe Bertini until 1880. His talent was obvious from his very first works and was recognised by Francesco Hayez, who allowed him the use of his own studio near the Academy. An active participant in the lively cultural milieu in Milan and member of the Famiglia Artistica since its foundation in 1873 by Vespasiano Bignami. He won the triennial combined schools of painting competition at the Brera exhibition in 1879, with a historical subject. He reprised this subject for the canvas shown together with the Portrait of Luigi Bernasconi (Rome, Galleria Nazionale d‚ÄôArte Moderna) at the \\"Esposizione di Belle Arti\\" di Roma in 1883. Tallone often spent time in Rome with Antonio Mancini and Francesco Paolo Michetti. His success with public and critics alike was confirmed the following year at the Esposizione Generale Italiana in Turin. In 1885, he was appointed teacher of painting at the Carrara Academy, in Bergamo, a position which he also held at the Brera Academy from 1899, succeeding Bertini. During these years he continued to exhibit his works and he became known as a portraitist in intellectual, bourgeois and aristocratic circles. One of the last awards he won was the Principe Umberto Prize in 1908, and an entire room was devoted to his works at the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte di Venezia the same year. He died in Milan. In 1921, on the initiative of his friend Bignami, the Brera Academy commemorated him with a posthumous retrospective.

Biography Inspired by the example of his elder brother Angiolo and his cousin Adolfo, Ludovico Tommasi devoted himself to painting, developing his art in close contact with Silvestro Lega, a frequent visitor to the Tommasi family villa at Bellariva. After his military service in Milan between 1888 and 1891, Tommasi and his brother Angiolo frequented the cultural circle that gravitated around Giacomo Puccini at Torre del Lago, and it was here that he came into contact with several exponents of the Tuscan artistic avant-garde, including Galileo Chini and Oscar Ghiglia. Towards the end of the 19th century he became interested in the Divisionist research carried out in that period by his friend Plinio Nomellini. He regularly participated in the principal artistic events in Italy and abroad. In 1913 he was among the participants in the Rome breakaway faction of the Giovane Etruria group that returned to the Tuscan naturalistic tradition, leading to the revival of more classic forms in the years following the First World War. In his maturity he devoted himself to engraving, and in 1912 he opened a school of etching in Florence. In 1884, he displays Studio al Vero at the Promotrice.

The works of the 1880s and 1890s also include increasingly intimate scenes of everyday life in the setting of Valsassina, Valle d‚ÄôAosta and Verbano. Bazzaro continued to take part in numerous exhibitions in the region of Lombardy as well as the Venice Biennale and the Rome Quadrenniale right up to his death, always achieving great success with collectors and being asked to execute replicas of his most popular subjects.

Biography A pupil of Giuseppe Bertini at the Brera Academy, Belloni made his debut in 1879 with two perspective views of interiors. After a stay in Verona, during which he painted his first landscapes en plein air, he settled in Milan, where he established himself as a landscape painter as from 1882. The success achieved in Venice at the Esposizione Nazionale Artistica di Venezia of 1887 made him known beyond the regional borders. He came under the influence of Lombard Naturalism as from the beginning of the 1880s and specialised in seascapes, painted from life during summer stays at Sturla, Noli and Forte dei Marmi but distinguished by a poetic and evocative atmosphere. While continuing to work primarily as a landscape painter, producing large-scale views of the Alpine area and Brianza, he also turned his hand to portraits and still lifes. The influence of Divisionism at the turn of the century was developed through his own interpretation of light. Belloni‚Äôs assiduous participation in major exhibitions at the national and international level culminated in the allocation of a personal room at the Venice Biennale in 1914 and a show at the Galleria Pesaro in 1919.

The award of a grant in 1867 enabled him to visit Venice and then Paris in 1869. He took part with some success at the Brera exhibitions and the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. It was in this period that he began to paint genre scenes in 18th-century settings and numerous portraits, soon becoming one of the artists most in demand with the Milanese middle classes. He returned to Venice in 1879 and visited Chioggia for the first time. Both places were to be featured also in later years in a series of intense views exhibited at exhibitions in Milan and Venice alongside genre scenes, views of Milan and landscapes of the countryside around Gignese. Among his main works were a Monaca di Monza and a Milton exhibited in 1877 in Naples. In 1878, he exhibited in Paris a portrait of his father, a portrait of Signora Ponti, and I Chierici in Processione (Clerics in Procession).

Courtesy of Prof. Amatzia Genin Heinz Steinitz (April 26, 1909 ‚Äì April 28, 1971, ) was a senior Israeli marine biologist and herpetologist, Professor and Chairman of the Department of zoology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He laid the foundation for research and teaching in marine biology and oceanography in Israel. In 1968 he founded the Marine Biology Laboratory of the Hebrew University near Eilat, serving as its first director. He also served as a founding member of the Zoological Society of Israel and a co-founder of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. Biography Heinz Steinitz was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland) on April 26, 1909, to Walter Steinitz (1882-1963), a cardiologist and zoologist, and Marta Schindler Steinitz (1885-1926).Steinitz, R. (2016) Eine deutsche j√ºdische Familie wird zerstreut. Books on Demand GmbH, Norderstedt. pp. 91-107. He grew up in Breslau and was greatly inspired by his father to study science and to be an active Zionist. He studied medicine from 1927 to 1933 in the universities of Breslau, Freiburg and Berlin.Steinitz, H. Curriculum Vitae. Heinz Steinitz archive, The National Library of Israel. Although he passed the Medical Board examination in 1933, and would have started work in a hospital in Berlin and in the Jewish hospital in Breslau, he was prohibited from practicing by the Nazi regime which came to power that same year.Boschwitz, D. (1969) Professor Heinz Steinitz on his sixtieth birthday. Israel Journal of Zoology 18: 127-130. Together with his wife Ruth Aber Steinitz (1907-1995), a medical student as well, he left Germany in 1933 and immigrated to Palestine. Three sons were born to Heinz Steinitz and Dr. Ruth Steinitz. Each turned to sciences: Raphael Steinitz, an astrophysicist, is a Professor Emeritus at the Department of Physics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be‚Äôer Sheba; Gideon Steinitz, a senior geologist, was the former Head of the Geological Survey of Israel, Jerusalem; and Benjamin Steinitz, a plant scientist retired as a senior research scientist in the fields of plant physiology and horticulture at the Institute of Plant Sciences, Agricultural Research Organization, The Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion. Heinz Steinitz died suddenly from a stroke on April 28, 1971, while being fully active in all positions he held at that time. Academic career Unable to get in 1933 a permit from the British administration in Palestine to practice as a physician, Heinz Steinitz turned to earn his living in an agricultural research station located in Rehovot (and later in Petah Tikva). That work marked the moment he changed his path from medicine to zoology. His research on the control of citrus pests, under the supervision of Prof. F. S. Bodenheimer,Harpaz, I. (1984). Frederick Simon Bodenheimer (1897-1959): idealist, scholar, scientist. Annual Review of Entomology 29: 1-24. eventually became the experimental basis for his doctoral thesis. In 1938, Steinitz was the first to obtain a Ph.D. degree in zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and he took his place in the founders and pioneers of zoology in Israel. He became a member of the teaching and research staff of the Department of Zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1936, advanced along the academic track up to the highest degree of full professor, and worked in the department until his death.Por, F. D. (1973) Heinz Steinitz in memoriam. Marine Biology 19: 271-272 doi:10.1007/BF00348892. The Hebrew University, the first university in Israel, was established only a decade before Steinitz's arrival in Jerusalem; thus, his academic career parallels the early history of zoology research and teaching in the Israeli academia. In the first decade of his career, including the years of World War II, he acted in the department as a teaching and research assistant, and concurrently, during 1943‚Äì1946, he lectured zoology at the Kibbutzim College of Education. Appointed lecturer in 1946, he instructed animal histology, anatomy of livestock animals and laboratory animals. During the Arab-Israeli War (1948-1949) he served in a preventive healthcare military unit, teaching medical students recruited to army service. As a consequence of that war, the campus of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus became an enclave in the Jordanian kingdom, disconnected from the western part of a divided Jerusalem. The university relocated its faculties to west Jerusalem. The zoology department, excluded from the new Givat Ram campus constructed in the 1950s, resided in buildings on different sites in the western city. Steinitz was active in reorganizing the department's function under the new circumstances and took care of the zoological collections moved from Mount Scopus to west Jerusalem. His office and labs migrated over the years. At first they were in the Terra Sancta building in Rehavia, then in the St. Antonio Monastery building, across from the official residence of the President of Israel, and finally close to the Russian Compound in the center of west Jerusalem. In 1951 Steinitz went to the US for two years as a research fellow at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, where he conducted research in the field of experimental embryology. By 1954 he was promoted to Assistant Professor, became Associate Professor in 1957, and was appointed in 1963 Chairman of Division A of the Department of Zoology in Jerusalem. He lectured in general zoology, vertebrates and invertebrates morphology, animal histology, experimental embryology and ecology. From the mid-1950s onwards, marine biology and marine ecology became core of his research interests. He was the first to teach marine biology, and by 1966 he headed the development of the marine biology curriculum and research programs. In 1968, being Chairman of the Department of Zoology, he was appointed Full Professor. Steinitz supervised masters and doctoral students, some of whom became senior scientists in fields of biology and environmental sciences in universities, research institutes, colleges and teacher colleges around the country. He believed in the importance of teaching and education at all levels, including preparing students to be school teachers. In this context, in the years 1957-1960 he was board member of the School of Education of the Hebrew University. Research on fish, amphibians and the ecology of lakes and seas Heinz Steinitz was an ichthyologist, herpetologist, and marine biologist. He researched the ecology, distribution and evolution of amphibians and fresh water fish in the Middle East; the ecology, distribution and taxonomy of fish in the Red Sea; the ecology of the southeast Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.Aron, W. and Por, F.D., 1972. A tribute to Heinz Steinitz (1909‚Äì1971) and Gunnar Thorson (1906‚Äì1971). Israel Journal of Zoology 21: 129-130. Other research interests included experimental embryology, neurohistology, and anatomical microscopy of the amphibian eye.Stone, L.S., Steinitz, H. (1957) Regeneration of neural retina and lens from retina pigment cell grafts in adult newts. Journal of Experimental Zoology 135: 301-317. Geographically, his studies were conducted along the Syrian-African Great Rift valley, from Lake Hula and Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee) in the north of Israel, through the Dead Sea in the center of the country, down to the Gulf of Eilat and the Red Sea in the south. Other parts of his work were carried out in the south east Mediterranean Basin and along the coasts of the Sinai Peninsula. His research concerned taxonomy, anatomy, zoogeographic distribution and ecology of the fauna investigated. Together with his colleague Dr. Heinrich Mendelssohn, then at the Biological-Pedagogical Institute and later Professor at the Department of Zoology at Tel Aviv University, he explored the fauna of Lake Hula and its surrounding swamps.The papers of Heinrich Mendelssohn. Franz Rosenzweig Minerva Research Center. In 1940, the two researchers discovered the rare Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer), the only living member of the genus Latonia, an amphibian endemic to the Hula marshes.Mendelssohn, H., Steinitz, H. (1943). A new frog from Palestine. Copeia 4: 231-233. Lake Hula and its marshland were drained in the 1950s. The frog, considered to be extinct for about half a century due to the destruction of its habitat, was rediscovered in 2011. It is considered a living fossil, and it is included in the list of endangered species.Hula painted frog, Latonia nigriventer, The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Steinitz also explored fish species living in the unique ecological niche of Ein Feshkha.Steinitz, H. (1951). The fishes of Ein Feshkha, Palestine. Nature 167: 531-532.Steinitz, H. (1951) On the distribution and evolution of the Cyprinodont fishes of the Mediterranean region and the Near East. Bonner Zoolgische Beitr√§ge 2:113-124. This site ‚Äî the deepest continental point on Earth ‚Äî is a saline wetland in the desert, on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, nourished by a spring of brackish water. Fish in this special habitat evolved isolated from fish populating other habitats. On a first study of the southeast Mediterranean Basin, published in 1947 jointly with Prof. Georg Haas, they observed fish of Indo- Pacific origin.Haas, G., Steinitz, H. (1947). Erythrean fishes on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine. Nature 160: 28. Later, Steinitz published dozens of papers on fish, the fauna and the ecology of the southeast Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. In 1967, together with Dr. William Aron from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, Steinitz launched a joint program on the role of the Suez Canal as a waterway for the passage of marine species between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. After Steinitz's death in 1971, the survey and monitoring of the invasion of biota from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea (and to a smaller extent biota migration in the opposite direction) proliferated, and it continues into the 21st century.Por, F. D. (1978) Lessepsian Migration ‚Äì the influx of Red Sea biota into the Mediterranean by way of the Suez Canal.

The Egyptian Journal of Aquatic Research 41: 129-144. The phenomenon of the continuous flow of marine biota across the Suez Canal is termed Lessepsian migration. To this day, hundreds species native to the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean Sea, and probably others are yet unidentified. This human-mediated invasion has significantly impacted the Mediterranean ecosystem and endangered many local and endemic Mediterranean species.Galil, B. S. and Goren, M. (2014) Metamorphoses: bioinvasions in the Mediterranean Sea. In: The Mediterranean Sea, its history and present challenges (pp. 463-478). Springer Netherlands. Goffredo, S., Dubinsky, Z. (Eds.) DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6704-1_27 ISBN. Steinitz carried out research on a number of fish families, among them the Blenniidae, Cichlidae and Cyprinodontidae . He published nearly sixty papers in his different research fields, including on the discovery of fish new to science like the Kinneret-Sardine Acanthobrama terraesanctae, Garra Barreimiae (together with Henry Weed Fowler), and Tristramella sacra intermedia (together with A. Ben-Tuvia). Some of his publications appeared in special platforms he initiated and edited like the Contributions to the Knowledge of the Red Sea, Israel South Red Sea Expedition Scientific Reports, and Contributions to the Knowledge of Lake Tiberias. Together with Otto Haim Oren he published a Regional Bibliography of the Mediterranean coast of Israel and the adjacent Levant countries and Bibliography on Lake Kinnereth (Lake Tiberias). Research-supporting activities Parallel to research and teaching at the university, Steinitz was involved in three types of research-supporting long term pursuits: (a) Participation, organization and management of scientific expeditions; (b) building-up and curation of a fish collection; (c) planning, founding and managing a marine research station near Eilat. =Scientific expeditions= In his earliest expeditions, in 1938‚Äì1940, Steinitz explored the fauna of Lake Hula and its surrounding marshland. Immediately following the outbreak of the Suez Crisis of 1956, Steinitz organized and headed an expedition examining the marine fauna along the Red Sea coasts of the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal. In 1962 he led the first Israeli South Red Sea Expedition (ISRSE) which was based on the islands of the Dahlak Archipelago of Eritrea.Fishelson L. 2009 Red Sea Explorations by Israeli Zoologists 1950-2009. The ISRSE was part of the first International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) from 1962 to 1965. It was an interdisciplinary marine sciences research effort to survey the south Red Sea and to collect biological specimens and data from the region. Otto Haim Oren from the Haifa Sea Fishery Research Station and Lev Fishelson from the Tel Aviv University, both at that time doctoral students of Steinitz, assisted in organizing the project. The expedition team included a crew of researchers from universities and research institutes in Israel, as well as scientists from the Netherlands, USA and Ethiopia. =Building-up and management of a fish collection= The fish collection of the Hebrew University was begun in the 1920s by Prof. Israel Aharoni and Prof. Georg Haas, soon after the opening of the Department of Zoology.Golani, D. (2006) The section of fishes: The history of the Hebrew University fish collection. Haasiana 3: 13-16. Steinitz added specimens from the very beginning of his work in the department. During the 1950s, the collection of fish specimens was carried out also by Prof. Adam Ben-Tuvia from the Sea Fishery Research Station in Haifa, a former student of Steinitz. A considerable augmentation of the collection occurred with the harvest of the expeditions to Sinai in 1956 and the Israeli South Red Sea Expeditions in the 1960s, when over 3,000 lots of fish were deposited. The taxonomic and zoogeographic identification of specimens was often conducted by correspondence between Steinitz and ichthyologists and curators of research institutes and science museums around the world. As a consequence, the collection became recognized as having major international importance, serving as a reference collection for the international community of ichthyologists. =Forging connections with the international scientific community= The formative years of Steinitz's career took place under the difficult conditions prevailing in any budding university, compounded with the instability of the wars which accompanied the resurrection of the state of Israel. Steinitz pursued connections and collaborations with the international community of scientists in order to ensure that research in Israel met the highest standards‚Äîa goal of critical importance for himself, the university, and the country. Furthermore, he realized that connections with colleagues from foreign countries would diminish the limits and disadvantages inherent in working in a small local scientific community geographically removed from global science centers. The wide and branched connections he wove over many years with scientists worldwide helped him to form a sound basis for what was, at that time, the early days of marine biology, oceanography, and ichthyology in Israel.The papers of Heinz Steinitz. Franz Rosenzweig Minerva Research Center. A special facet of Steinitz's international activities was building-up contacts and collaborations with West Germany's scientists, institutions and organizations. He commenced doing so years prior to the establishment, in 1965, of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel. In 1946, working on the fish collection, he exchanged information and biological material with the German zoologist and geneticist Curt Kosswig. Prof. Kusswig emigrated in 1937 from Nazi Germany to Turkey, where he established the Department of Zoology at the Istanbul University. He returned to West Germany in 1955, was appointed head of the Zoological Institute and the Zoological Museum of the University of Hamburg, and visited Steinitz at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From the early 1960s Steinitz was invited several times to visit as a guest professor at the University of Hamburg and other German universities. He also visited and tied connections with museums of science, zoological museums and marine biology research stations in West Germany. He became acquainted with Dr. G√ºnther B√∂hnecke, an oceanographer who played a central role after World War II in rehabilitating Germany's scientific relationships with countries worldwide. Dr. B√∂hnecke was an advisor to the German Research Foundation, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), in the field of oceanography. The personal acquaintance and mutual appreciation between Steinitz and B√∂hnecke led to the support by the DFG for building and operating a marine biology laboratory near Eilat. =Founding a marine biology research laboratory near Eilat= Doctor Walter Steinitz, father of Heinz Steinitz, published in 1919 his vision and proposal to establish a marine biology research station on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine.Steinitz, W. (1919) Denkschrift zur Begr√ºndung einer zoologischen Meeresstation an der K√ºste Pal√§stinas. Brosch√ºrenbibliothek des K.J.V. Nr. 7, 24pp. The Hebrew University, and scholars in Palestine and in other countries, supported the plans of the project, but attempts to raise funds for it failed. Inspired by his father's vision, Heinz Steinitz resumed the effort to carry out the concept. However, he decided in the 1950s that the station would be better situated if it were built on the coast of the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba). He had three reasons for this preferred location: (a) Being by that time knowledgeable about the marine life in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, Heinz Steinitz recognized the higher richness and the notable biodiversity of the latter, which still remained widely uninvestigated. (b) First reports about the presence of fishes of Indo-Pacific origin in the eastern Mediterranean Sea began to appear in the beginning of the twentieth century. Indo-Pacific fishes were also observed along the coast of Palestine for the first time by Walter Steinitz.Steinitz, W. (1929) Die wanderung indopazifischer Arten ins Mittelmeer seit beginn der Quart√§rperiode. Internationale Revue der gesamten Hydrobiologie und Hydrographie 22: 1-90. The findings were indicative for intrusion of alien fishes into the eastern Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal that was constructed and opened only several decades prior to those first observations. Heinz Steinitz believed that a research base in the Golf of Eilat would be best placed to conduct investigations into the phenomenon of migration of marine biota from the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea (a northern branch of the Indian Ocean) through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, a marine station in the Gulf of Eilat would facilitate analysis of the environmental and ecological changes resulting from man-made connection between the two global water bodies. (c) Polluting spills from the cities of Eilat and Aqaba into the Gulf waters, and pollutants discharged by ships and oil tankers that traffic along the Red Sea and cross the Suez Canal, constituted environmental perils.Fishelson, L. (1973). Ecology of coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) influenced by pollution. Oecologia 12: 55-67. The marine research station staff in Eilat would be able to monitor impacts of anthropogenic activities on ecological processes and on the very sensitive marine ecosystems of the region. In preparation for the construction of the marine research station, Steinitz visited during the 1950s and the 1960s dozens of oceanographic research stations and marine aquariums in Europe, the US and in the Caribbean Islands in order to learn from other's experience managing such facilities. Since the Gulf of Eilat is in the geographical periphery of Israel and remote from any academic center, and considering that the Israeli nucleus of marine biologists was at that time still very small, Steinitz developed relationships with colleagues abroad and convinced them to come and conduct some of their research in the planned station. He also reinforced the local station's research and management staff with an international scientific advisory board of oceanographers from Europe, Australia and the US in order to strengthen and sustain the nascent activity.Por F. D. (Editor) First report of The Marine Biological Laboratory at Elat, August 1968 ‚Äì June 1971. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, August 1971, 20pp. In this way he guaranteed that the laboratory, from its inception, would be run at levels meeting international standards. Steinitz received support and collaboration for his initiative from colleagues at other Israeli universities and research institutions, from the Israel Oceanographic and Limnology Research (IOLR) and from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The vision of Walter Steinitz was ultimately realized in 1968, five years after he died, when the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) of The Hebrew University near Eilat was inaugurated.Clark, E. and Aron, W. (1972) Heinz Steinitz: to realize a dream. Israel Journal of Zoology 21: 131-134. Launching the laboratory was a peak in the career of Heinz Steinitz as an Israeli zoologist and as an internationally recognized senior marine biologist. He died in 1971 while being the first director of the laboratory; in his honor, the laboratory was renamed The Heinz Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory. The scientific activity in the station gained momentum soon after its inception, and under the leadership of its successive directors the research spread from marine biology to a wide scope of additional disciplines including chemical and physical oceanography, marine ecology and environmental quality. Supplemental buildings, new laboratories, teaching spaces and lecture halls were constructed. Israel's Council for Higher Education decided in 1985 that the station would become an interuniversity institute, with the marine biology laboratory being an integral part of it. The Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) near Eilat became a national facility shared by all universities in Israel, The Weizmann Institute of Science and The Technion (Israel Institute of Technology). Activities in non-academic forums Heinz Steinitz was active in ex-university professional forums and organizations, some of them of national importance. Jointly with Prof. Georg Haas and Dr. O. Hecht, he founded in 1936 the Zoological Society of Israel. In the 1940s plans were advanced to drain Lake Hula and its swamps. Being concerned about the potential ecological detrimental consequences, Steinitz opposed these plans. After the establishment of the state of Israel (1948), with the fast growing population, settling the country, and the rapidly growing economy, he became troubled about carelessness lack of attention to the value of nature, the danger of loss of wild fauna and flora, and the destruction of local natural resources. In 1953, together with Azaria Alon, Prof. Heinrich Mendelssohn, Prof. Amotz Zahavi, and others, he co-founded the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI), a non-profit environmental organization working to preserve plants, animals, open spaces, and natural environments that represent biodiversity. Steinitz was appointed to a number of governmental forums and assigned to national tasks by different Ministries: *In the Prime Minister's Office - member of the national committee of lakes and seas. *In the Ministry of Agriculture ‚Äì nominated adviser to the Sea Fisheries Research Station in Haifa (that later became the National Institute of Oceanography in Haifa), beginning work with its first director Dr. Helmut Lissner, and continuing with the next directors ‚Äì Dr. Otto H. Oren, Prof. Baruch Kimor and Prof. Adam Ben- Tuvia. *In the Ministry of Interior - Member of a committee dealing with prevention of pollution of the Red Sea. Lake Kinneret is the largest aboveground freshwater reservoir in Israel. The lake is fed mainly by the Jordan River down-flowing from Lake Hula and the Hula valley. Two development projects in the 1950s profoundly impacted the ecosystem of Lake Kinneret: (i) Lake Hula and its marshland were drained and dried, and the soil revealed was converted to farmland. Consequently, the mineral salts composition of the water entering into Lake Kinneret was altered significantly. (ii) A water carrier was constructed and great amounts of drinking water began to be pumped and conducted from Lake Kinneret to central and south Israel. Science-based sustainable management of the lake's water quantity and quality, including understanding of the lake's biota as part of its ecosystem, became necessary. Steinitz chaired a joint committee of Mekorot (the national water company of Israel and the country's top agency for water management) and Tahal (TAHAL Group, the major provider of infrastructure development water projects), coordinating multidisciplinary investigation of Lake Kinneret. In parallel, The Kinneret Limnological Laboratory as part of Israel Oceanographic Limnological Research was founded in 1968. Ensuing research of the physical, chemical, biological and environmental components of the lake's ecosystem continuously supports intelligent management of this important national freshwater resource.Zohary, T., Sukenik, A., Berman, T., Nishri, A. (Eds.) (2014) Lake Kinneret: Ecology and Management. Springer New York, Heidelberg, Dordrecht, London. DOI 10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8. In 1965 Steinitz became member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and of the Academy's committee publishing the Fauna of Israel. He was co-editor of the Bulletin of the Sea Fisheries Research Station in Haifa, and a board member of Bamidge, the journal of Israel's fishery research and development. Honors The national and international reputation of Heinz Steinitz is reflected by names in his honor given to more than twenty newly discovered fishes, marine organisms and amphibians, listed in the Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names. Some names were given years after he passed away. The fish species Tylognathus steinitziorum (discovered and named by Dr. Curt Kosswig in 1950, now called Hemigrammocapoeta nana) was dedicated to Walter Steinitz and his son Heinz Steinitz. Animal species named after Heinz Steinitz include Aphanogmus steinitzi (Priesner, 1936); Albunea steinitzi (Holthuis, 1958) (Lipke Holthuis); Elasmopus steinitzi (Ruffo, 1959); Typhlocirolana steinitzi (Strouhal, 1961); Bohadschia steinitzi (Cherbonnier, 1963); Pseudocyclops steinitzi (Por, 1968); Hydroides steinitzi (Ben-Eliahu, 1972); Istiblennius steinitzi (Lotan, 1969) (synonym of Istiblennius flaviumbrinus (R√ºppell, 1830)); Scorpaenodes steinitzi (Klausewitz & Fr√∂iland, 1970) (Wolfgang Klausewitz); Gammogobius steinitzi (Bath, 1971); Photoblepharon steinitzi (Abe & Haneda, 1973); Amblyeleotris steinitzi (Klausewitz, 1974); Omobranchus steinitzi (Springer & Gomon, 1975); Cocotropus steinitzi (Eschmeyer & Dor, 1978); Helcogramma steinitzi (Clark, 1980) (Eugenie Clark); Rubratella steinitzi (Pawlowski & Lee, 1991); Hyla heinzsteinitzi (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊†◊ô◊™ ◊î◊ô◊ô◊†◊•- ◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊†◊ô◊•)Grach, C., Plesser, Y., Werner, Y.

On its website, it claims to be the government in exile of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state with limited recognition which controlled Manchuria from 1932 to 1945; it seeks to revive the state and to separate it from the People's Republic of China, which controls its claimed territory. Journalists and internet users have expressed doubts about its authenticity and aims. Structure and symbols Media summaries of its website state that the Manchukuo Temporary Government includes an emperor, a royal family, a prime minister, and a cabinet. It continues to use the old National Anthem of Manchukuo and Flag of Manchukuo. The website also has accounts of the history of the region and its people, including a claim that the Manchu people are one of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel; James Leipold of the China Policy Institute described it as \\"thick on anti-communist vitriol\\" while failing to address Japanese hegemony in Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Temporary Government is a member of the International Monarchist League. It also seeks to join the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. It claims to have overseas branches in Brazil, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States. The leadership of the Manchukuo Temporary Government is formed by electing an emperor and a prime minister. In the 2008 elections, the emperorship was won by \\"Aisin Gioro Xiaojie\\" (ÊÑõÊñ∞Ë¶∫ÁæÖ‚ÄßÂ≠ùÂÇë), stated to be a student in the University of Hong Kong's history department; his actual relation to the Aisin Gioro clan is suspect, as his generation name \\"Xiao\\" (Â≠ù) does not fit with the actual clan genealogy. However, that emperor dropped out of contact with the Manchukuo Temporary Government, so in April 2010, it held another election, won by \\"Aisin Gioro Chongji\\" (Áà±Êñ∞ËßâÁΩó‚ÄßÂ¥áÂü∫). Jason Adam-Tonis was elected as Prime Minister in May 2011. At the time, Adam-Tonis was a New York University student and also a chairman of the Songun Politics Study Group, a North Korean front group based in the United States. Financial activities The Manchukuo Temporary Government's \\"central bank\\", which claims to succeed the old Central Bank of Manchou, declared the old Manchukuo yuan to have a fixed exchange rate of 0.8 to the United States dollar, and offers currency exchange services by post. As early as 2007, it was issuing identity cards for US$3 each, and fantasy passports for US$8 each, with payment to be made by PayPal. Its website claimed to sell Manchukuo postage stamps, but when a Ming Pao columnist enquired with them about the possibility of purchasing them, a spokesperson stated that the items were sold out. It also issued what it referred to as \\"loyalty bonds\\". Its activities led the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, Greece's Hellenic Capital Market Commission, and Spain's Comisi√≥n Nacional del Mercado de Valores to issue public warnings about it in February 2008 to emphasise that it is not a body permitted to offer investment services. Reactions The Manchukuo Temporary Government received occasional media attention in the context of the politics of Taiwan around the time of the 2009 elections, as its members may be distant relatives of Kuomintang general-secretary and ethnic Manchu King Pu-tsung, and it was jokingly suggested that King himself might be one of its secret agents. Some internet users suspected the entire website of being a scam set up for the purpose of raising money. Hong Kong political scientist Simon Shen, an expert on Chinese nationalism and the internet, also expressed suspicion of the website and its attempt to portray the revival of Manchukuo as a movement undertaken on behalf of Manchu people; he pointed out that the people who ever felt genuine identification with the state of Manchukuo were mostly not Chinese or Manchu but rather Japanese. Another news commentator similarly suggested that Japanese nationalists were behind the site. On the other hand, Shen also suggested that the whole website might simply be a spoof designed by internet trolls. The Manchukuo Temporary Government also provoked angry reactions from some quarters. A NOWnews guest columnist in May 2011, in the midst of other arguments against Taiwan independence, called the Manchukuo Temporary Government \\"the shame of the people of Northeast China\\". Its stated political positions, such as support for the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan independence movement, as well as its calls to disrupt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, earned it the ire of internet users in mainland China. At one point, rumours were spreading in mainland Chinese internet forums that one \\"Toshiaki Kawashima\\" (Â∑ùÂ≥∂ÂøóÊòé), whom they alleged to be the nephew of Yoshiko Kawashima and prime minister of the Manchukuo Temporary Government, was working as a secret agent for Chen Shui-bian in Papua New Guinea with the aim of fomenting violence against Chinese people there.

Henriette von Schirach is one of the few people known to have challenged Hitler personally about the persecution of Jews.  Early life  Henriette Hoffmann was the eldest child of the photographer Heinrich Hoffmann and was born to his first wife, Therese \\"Nelly\\" Baumann (d. 1928), a former singer and actress. Along with her brother Henry (b. 1916), she spent her childhood in Schwabing. Her house was an early Nazi stronghold, and in 1920 her father, a nationalist and anti-Semitic German Workers' Party (DAP) member joined its successor, the Nazi Party. Henriette was nine years of age when she first met Adolf Hitler, who frequently came to the Hoffmann house for dinner. She described a moment when she met him when she was 17: From 1923 onwards, her father became the personal photographer of Hitler and had a lucrative business selling busts of Hitler. By 1930 Henriette Hoffmann worked alongside her studies at the University of Munich, as Hitler's secretary. Prior to the suicide of Geli Raubal, Hitler briefly dated Henriette.Kershaw 2008, p. 218. Soon after in 1931, Henriette met Baldur von Schirach, the former leader of the Nazi Student League and the youngest of Hitler's entourage. The couple married on 31 March 1932 in Munich, where both Adolf Hitler and Ernst R√∂hm acted as best men. Between 1933 and 1942, Henriette gave birth to four children: Angelika Benedicta, Klaus, Robert, and Richard. She also became grandmother of Ariadne von Schirach. Henriette identified herself with the goals of her husband, who held sole control over the educational system of the German Reich. He was appointed by Hitler to the Gauleiter and Reich Governor in Vienna, and moved with his family to the prestigious Vienna Hofburg. Confrontation of Hitler In the television programme Hitler's Henchmen (Episode, Corrupter of the Youth, about her husband Baldur von Schirach) Dr. Henk van Capelle and Dr. Peter van de Bovenkamp tell how Henriette von Schirach in 1943 was invited to the Netherlands by friends in the German occupation forces. A transcript is played in the programme in which she explains \\"I heard screaming outside the hotel late at night so went out to investigate. I saw Jewish women and children being bundled into transportation to be deported. I then asked a German soldier what they were doing to which he replied, \\"What Hitler is doing in Holland is wrong, we are making enemies of the Dutch which is a big mistake, make sure you tell him this the next time you visit the Berghof\\". She went on to say that what she had witnessed in Amsterdam had troubled her deeply. Henriette broke off her visit to the Netherlands, and telephoned the Berghof to make an appointment with Hitler. Years later, for a BBC interview, Henriette explained what had happened: Henriette von Schirach and her husband were never invited again. The incident was recounted by Traudl Junge (Hitler's last private secretary) in Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary and Until the Final Hour-her husband, aide-de-camp to Hitler, Hans Hermann Junge, was present. Following the first major American air attack on Vienna, Baldur von Schirach sent his family to Bavaria to the country house Aspen Stone. After the war At the end of the war Henriette's husband attempted to avoid capture, posing as a writer (\\"Dr. Richard Falk\\"). But he soon decided to surrender to the Americans, doing so in June 1945. He was tried and convicted at Nuremberg, being sentenced on 1 October 1946, for crimes against humanity for his deportation of the Viennese Jews. He served 20 years as a prisoner in Spandau Prison. On 20 July 1949 whilst Baldur von Schirach was imprisoned, Henriette filed for divorce, because of her romantic involvement with Peter Jacob, former husband of German film director Leni Riefenstahl. The divorce was granted a year later in July 1950. In 1956, there was discussion in the media about the last three Nazi war criminals detained at Spandau, (Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer, and Baldur von Schirach), due to the long time for detention and high cost to the international community to imprison war criminals. Henriette Hoffman von Schirach traveled to London to the British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd in order to request a reduction of the 20-year prison sentence for her ex-husband. She was unsuccessful. That same year she published her book The Price of Glory. In 1982, Henriette von Schirach published a book of anecdotes about Hitler, called Frauen um Hitler: Nach Materialien (Women around Hitler: After Materials). Here she describes Hitler as a \\"cozy Austrian\\", who \\"wanted to make himself and others a little bit happy.\\" In 2016, new research determined that in 1960 Henriette von Schirach had convinced authorities to return to her some 300 works of art she had owned during the war but which had originally belonged to a Jewish couple who had left the art behind when they fled Vienna. Following the war, the art had been entrusted to the Bavarian State Painting Collections, which was supposed to ensure the works were returned to their rightful owners. Instead, the Bavarian authorities sold many works back to former Nazis as so-called 'return sales'.

Frank McLaughlin =Plaintiffs= Robertson, Castle & Anthony *Joseph G. Anthony *Frank D. Padgett =Defendants= Attorney General‚Äôs office *Ray J. O'Brien *Leon R. Gross *Howard K. Hoddick Conclusion Judge McLaughlin found the Attorney General‚Äôs office in violation of the First Amendment rights of plaintiffs in the United States Constitution with reference to Robert H. Jackson in American Communications Association v. Douds. Judge J. Frank McLaughlin found the Attorney General‚Äôs office had no basis on which to exercise the Trading with the Enemy Act, moreover since 1945 Japan had abolished state religion under Douglas MacArthur and by judicial order return seized property to Kotohira Jinsha. Results Kotohira Jinsha Shrine reopened almost immediately after the case that year. After relocating a second time in 1962 to make way for the H1 Freeway (the first time in 1931) to its current location. The successful case demonstrated the possibility for other Japanese-based organizations perceived as being wronged by the United States to go to court. In 2010 the Ground Zero mosque controversy over Park51 near the World Trade Center site, in comparison between the Attack on Pearl Harbor and September 11 attacks, renewed interest Kotohira in Jinsha v. McGrath arose as a counterpart for Park51. References *The Shinto Shrine Near Pearl Harbor (2010) by Bob Jones, MidWeek *Kotohira Jinsha v. McGrath, 90 F. Supp. 892 - Dist. Court, D.

Later on, ETP membership opened up to non UK-based tea packers, and extended the scheme to include environmental issues as well. The ETP works in all the main tea producing regions, with a London-based Secretariat, and five regional managers based in Kenya, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and China. Monitoring and Certification The ETP monitoring programme has been running since 1997 and is free of charge to producers. The programm's environmental and social provisions are outlined in the ETP Global Standard, and are closely aligned to the main certification programmes operating under (Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ Certified) programmes. The social and labour provisions are based on the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, which covers the International Labour Organization's (ILO) core conventions. = Social Provisions = * Freely chosen employment * Freedom of Association & the right to collective bargaining * Health and Safety * Child Labour * Wages and Benefits * Working Hours * Discrimination * Regular Employment * Disciplinary Procedures = Environmental provisions = * Environmental Management Systems * Agrochemicals * Soil Conservation * Ecosystem Conservation * Water Conservation * Energy Use * Waste Management To increase impact and reduce duplication, the ETP has formal relationships with Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, and UTZ Certified.http://www.utzcertified.org/en/newsroom/utz-in-the-news/95-press- release-utz-certified-announces-code-for-responsible-tea-and-partnership-with- etp?template=gk_corporateinner The ETP works to facilitate certification where requested by member companies, when producers are interested. Through its producer support programmes, the ETP also works with certification programmes, and with a wide range of NGOs and development organisations. Producer Support In order to help producers to meet international social and environmental standards the ETP co-ordinates a series of training and improvement programmes. These are aimed at both management and workers and cover a number of issues including: * Factory health and safety * Agrochemical management * Fair treatment of workers * Gender * Environmental management (including wildlife and biodiversity) These capacity building projects are facilitated by the ETP Regional Managers who build relationships with tea producers and support them to participate effectively in the ETP programme.International Trade Centre ‚ÄòEthical Tea Partnership - At a Glance‚Äô May 2011 ETP has been working with ETI on a training programme focused on reducing discrimination and harassment of workers in Africa. This type of training supplements the auditing process by offering practical support to producers and it tackles long-term problematic issues that cannot be addressed by auditing and certification alone.

For example, in Kenya, the ETP is working in partnership with GIZ (the German Development Agency) to help in excess of 10,000 smallholder farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change in order to help them secure their future livelihoods from tea. Together, ETP and GIZ are developing toolkits for good climate change adaptation practices that span from technical solutions (good practice farming) to socio-economic approaches and institutional and political options.‚ÄòRecent Developments to Respond to Climate Change in Tea & Coffee in GIZ Public Private Partnerships: The Case of Tea in Kenya ‚Äô September 2011 As well as working with NGO and development organisations, the Ethical Tea Partnership works closely with tea producers to share and develop ideas on how to improve the sustainability of tea.

It is considered to be an entry-level synthesizer in the Moog family. Its design is based on the Little Phatty, which in turn is a more modernized version of the Minimoog Voyager. It is among the first synthesizers created and produced following the death of Moog founder Robert Moog in 2005. The Slim Phatty is also the first Moog (beside the Little Phatty) that is capable of USB connectivity. It was inferred that Moog would be releasing a new and possibly more stripped down synthesizer when reports surfaced that Moog had registered a trademark for the name \\"Slim Phatty\\".  Features  The Slim Phatty is able to make use of MIDI controller integration via out, in, and \\"thru\\" channels. The only other Moog synthesizers that can boast this capability are the Little Phatty, Minimoog Voyager, and the early Memorymoog+. It also features two robust oscillators, diverse tuning controls, and the patented ‚ÄúMoog Ladder‚Äù filters. Also included are a large number of patches or preset sound settings. Unlike many synthesizers, it does not possess a keyboard, so a MIDI or other sound input is required in order to create sound to modulate or filter. It is also small in size, and weighing in at roughly 5.5 lbs. For these reasons, the Slim Phatty is useful in both studio recording and live playing. = Comparison to Little Phatty = As noted above, the Slim Phatty is essentially a stripped down version of Moog's Little Phatty. Moog removed the keyboard, as well as the pitch and modulator wheels, and compacted the entire setup into a unit that is only seventeen inches wide. For these reasons, many may find the control panel a little cluttered, although the use of smaller knobs and buttons helps alleviate this issue. Like its counterpart, the Slim Phatty possesses an \\"Overload\\" control, which acts a filter drive that \\"supercharges\\" the filter and sound. It also shares firmware versions with the Little Phatty, which gives it more flexibility - such as integration with the Little Phatty in polyphonic mode. Its lightweight and small size also give it an edge in regards to portability.

Personal life Peter Liversidge studied Fine Art in Exeter at the University of Plymouth and film and photography at Montana State University-Bozeman. He moved to London in 1996 where he now lives with his wife and two children.http://www.vitalarts.org.uk/2012/09/peter-liversidge/ Work Over the course of the last 12 years, using an Olivetti typewriter, Liversidge has created proposals for exhibitions that range from the simple to the impossible. He experiments with what he describes as the \\"notion of creativity\\", often realised as objects, performances, or happenings over the course of an exhibition. Liversidge says of his proposals that: \\"...it's important that some of the proposals are actually realized, but no more so that the others that remain only as text on a piece of A4 paper. In a sense they are all possible and the bookwork that collates the proposals allows the reader to curate their own show, and because of its size and scale the bookwork allows an individual to interact with each of the proposals on their own terms, one to one.\\" He draws inspiration not just from artists such as On Kawara, Fischli and Weiss, but also from artists such as Joseph Cornell and the Reverend Howard Finster, as well as inveterate tinkerers like his own grandfathers. Liversidge is driven by the generative notion of creativity and the idea that art is most successful when it exists slightly outside of formalist notions of fine art. The physical objects Liversidge produces often include banal, everyday materials that are repurposed or co-opted for his use. His work, as seen in a lot of his proposals, requires the presence of the viewer and their interpretation of the proposals to complete the aesthetic experience. Liversidge has worked with, and exhibited at, Tate Liverpool in 2008, the Centre d'Art Santa M√≤nica, Barcelona in 2008, Bloomberg SPACE, London in 2009 and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in 2010. He has also developed projects for Cab Gallery, the Frieze Art Fair, (with Ingleby Gallery), the Europalia Festival in 2007, Art Basel, Miami, in 2009 and Edinburgh's Sculpture Park, Jupiter Artland, also in 2009. His performances, such as Gin Stand, Plum Bread and Embossing Bank Notes present the viewers with a piece of work to take away with them. Another aspect of Liversidge's work is sending various objects through the post. \\"For Peter Liversidge the postal service is also a collaborator in the work. The attached post labels and alterations are like contributions to the piece.\\" He has also created video projections for the bands Wires Under Tension and Balmorhea. In April 2012, Liversidge created the stage design and projection backdrop for Low at the Royal Festival Hall as a specific proposal. He again worked in collaboration with the band on their 2013 tour, creating the stage design and projection at London's Barbican Centre in April 2013. In October 2014, Liversidge collaborated with musicians Julia Kent and Rachel Grimes on 11 new compositions to mark the end of his exhibition, doppleg√§nger, at The MAC in Belfast. In 2015, Liversidge created the cover for the album Ones and Sixes by the band Low. He worked with the band again to create the cover for their 2018 album Double Negative. For the opening of the Tate Modern extension in June 2016, Liversidge presented a choral piece for 500 singers.

She is one of the most critical and courageous voices of dissent in broadcasting about Azerbaijan. She is known for her forthright interviewing style, particularly when interrogating politicians. She currently produces and hosts a daily news program on YouTube called: OSMANQIZI TV. Osmanqizi was ANS TV network's Chief Editor and News Director, Founding Chairwoman of WMW. She is the first Azerbaijani woman appointed to a diplomatic post, a CNN World View contributor, and host of the weekly debate programme Open Talk. Biography She was born Sevinj Mirzayeva in Baku, Azerbaijan to a known journalist Osman Mirzayev and his wife, newspaper editor Solmaz Mirzayeva. After the country regained its independence in 1991, her father rose to the position of Senior Advisor to the President of Azerbaijan Republic. Osmanqizi's father was killed at 53 on the board of MI-8 military helicopter, carrying an international peacekeeping mission team to Nagorno- Karabakh. Her father's tragic death have greatly affected her. After graduating from university, she worked as TV reporter and became popular for her news reports from the Nagorno-Karabakh war. In 1990's she was one of the first news presenters introducing independent from government reporting, contributing a newer, outspoken quality to Azerbaijani television. In 1992, Osmanqizi demonstrated her distinctive line of questioning in interview with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She has regularly made headlines with interviewees such as James Baker, Benazir Bhutto and others. In 1994, Osmanqizi became the first Azerbaijani woman appointed to a diplomatic post when she was named Deputy Spokeswoman of the Foreign Ministry. However her diplomatic career was brief; Later in 1994 she moved to UK to work for BBC World Service. Upon return to Azerbaijan, Osmanqizi became Chief Editor of ANS Independent Broadcast Company. From 2008 to 2011 she hosted the weekly programme Friday with Sevinj Osmanqizi and from 2011, the weekly debate show Open Talk. Political Debate Moderator In 2011, Osmanqizi introduced political special Open Talk, a televised debate between political leaders and public figures. The debates addressed issues of political dialogue, corruption, fair elections, crackdown on political opponents, prisoners of conscience. It was originally intended to have only a short run, but the program became very popular and was duly extended. Political leaders labeled as ‚Äúradical opposition‚Äù and blacklisted for over a decade, appeared in the debate. Media experts characterized the debates as the rare exception in the Azerbaijani media offering pluralism of views. Investigating her father's death She was 22 when her father, Osman Mirzayev, died. He was an important part of the administration - head of the press bureau and unofficial spokesman for then President Ayaz Mutallibov. She was working at the national television news centre as an intern, and heard the news being announced that a helicopter had crashed in Nagorno Karabakh. No alarm bells rang, because she thought her father was in Ganja. Then the announcer read out the names of the casualties, and suddenly she heard her father's name. The Russian media initially said it was a tragic accident - then later that it had been shot down. The following day, November 21, the chairman of the crash investigation committee announced on TV that the helicopter was shot at by large caliber weapons. Meanwhile, investigators didn't get there till the next day, and were hampered in their inspection of the scene by Russian soldiers. The Russians had recovered the black box from the wreckage and sent it to Russia, but it was soon announced that it had been too badly damaged by fire to provide any information. An official investigation by the Azeri government failed to come to any conclusion, and closed after a few years 'as the area of the crash site was still under occupation'. Eventually, frustrated with the lack of progress in the official investigation, Osmanqizi undertook her own. She traveled to the crash scene, interviewed dozens of eyewitnesses, tracked down the people in charge at the time, former investigators etc. She put together the hundreds of little pieces of evidence she was able to gather, and in 2011, on the 20th anniversary of the crash, the first part of her documentary \\"Mission of Peace\\" came out. It showed that the delegation of peacekeepers from Azerbaijan, Russia and Kazakhstan was killed only two days before the planned signing of a peace agreement. Their deaths were a fatal blow to peace talks and plunged Azerbaijan and Armenia into war over Nagorno Karabakh that took over 20,000 lives. Threats, harassment and persecution Threats, intimidation and violence have been used against Sevinc Osmanqizi to influence her journalism, including death threats and legal persecution. In early January 2015 the Azerbaijani government targeted Sevinc Osmanqizi in its latest attempt to stifle press freedom. While Osmanqizi‚Äôs inquisitive, balanced, hard-hitting reporting had long garnered criticism from government officials who prefer to feed citizens propaganda, recent unsubstantiated allegations of libel - a criminal offense in Azerbaijan - caught her by surprise. In launching libel charges against Osmanqizi over the holidays, the Azerbaijani government was able to expedite the criminal case before she had the opportunity to challenge the allegations. Rights activists described the case as \\"trumped up charges after being critical of the government.\\" With more than 25 years of professional journalism experience, Osmanqizi is well versed in the language the Azerbaijani government likes to employ against free thinkers - especially those in the media spotlight. She says that, despite her best efforts to honor media ethics - accuracy, objectivity, transparency - she has long been flagged as a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù and a ‚Äúspy,‚Äù false accusations of espionage that come with harsh consequences. The fact that her journalistic talents allowed her to freelance for international news outlets like the BBC and CNN simply fueled government campaigns framing her as a threat to local government. The judge excluded journalists and foreign observers from attending Osmanqizi's trial. Osmanqizi is no stranger to the dangers of practicing quality journalism in Azerbaijan. She comes from a family of journalists, including her father, Osman Mirzayev, who died on the job. His death ingrained an even deeper passion for truth-seeking and truth-telling in Osmanqizi, who began broadcast reporting at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and went on to becoming the chief editor of ANS TV and host of a weekly debate program called Open Talk. She also taught journalism at the US-Azerbaijan Journalism Academy. Sadly, she says that if she were still teaching today, she‚Äôd advise students to prioritize their safety above all else because the best journalists are thrown in jail, not recognized for their contributions to the nation‚Äôs co-called democracy. Since fleeing Azerbaijan for the U.S., she has been active in promoting democracy through her online news channel on YouTube. She has been one of the most popular and critical voices of dissent. She is regularly targeted for her courageous and independent voice. Her online news program OSMANQIZI TV has attracted more than 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.

Tooker was the eldest son of Giles Tooker, Recorder and Member of Parliament for Salisbury, by his marriage to Elizabeth Eyre, daughter of Thomas Eyre of Salisbury. Tooker entered Lincoln's Inn in 1610 and was called to the bar in 1616. In 1623 he succeeded to the estates of his father at Maddington. He became guardian to his orphaned nephew Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, who later described him as \\"a very honest, industrious man, an hospitable, prudent person, much valued and esteemed, dead and alive, by all that knew him\\". History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Edward Tooker Tooker became active in public life during the English Civil War, becoming commissioner for assessment and commissioner for levying of money for Wiltshire in 1643. He was commissioner for assessment for Wiltshire from 1647 to 1652 and High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1648. He was commissioner for militia in 1648 and 1649. In 1651 he became a Justice of the Peace and in 1653 commissioner for the relief of poor prisoners. In 1654, he was elected Member of Parliament for Salisbury in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Wiltshire in 1657 and commissioner for militia in 1659. In 1659 he was elected as a Member for Hindon in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was again commissioner for assessment for Wiltshire from January 1660 until his death and commissioner for militia in March 1660. In April 1660 he was again elected as a member of parliament for Salisbury in the Convention Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Salisbury from August 1660 until his death and commissioner for oyer and terminer on the Western circuit in July 1660. In 1661 he was re-elected as a member for Salisbury in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death. Tooker died at the age of 71 and was buried at Maddington. Tooker married firstly Martha Cooper, daughter of Sir John Cooper, of Pawlett, Somerset, and with her had a son and two daughters. In about 1638 he married secondly Mary Platt, the widow of William Platt of Highgate Hill, the daughter of Sir John Hungerford of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of Ancona. The building is an example of mixed Romanesque-Byzantine and Gothic elements, and stands on the site of the former acropolis of the Greek city, the Guasco hill which overlooks Ancona and its gulf. History Excavations carried on in 2016 proved that an Italic temple, perhaps dedicated to Aphrodite, existed on the site as early as the 3rd century BC. On top of it, in the 6th century CE, a Palaeo-Christian church was built: this had a nave and three aisles with the entrance facing south-east (where the current Chapel of the Crucifix is). Some remains of it still in existence include a mosaic pavement and perimeter walls. In 995‚Äì1015 a new church was built, which kept the original walls. In 1017 the renovated basilica received the relics of Saint Marcellinus of Ancona and Saint Cyriacus. Further enlargement works occurred between the late 12th and the early 13th centuries, with the addition of a transept to obtain a Greek cross plan, and an entrance towards the south- west, resulting in the church now facing the port and the new road entering the city. The transepts were at a higher level than the previous nave, and had apses. The church, previously dedicated to Saint Lawrence, was re-dedicated to Saint Cyriacus the Martyr, the patron saint and (possibly) bishop of Ancona. One of the red marble lions in the portal An initial restoration took place in 1883. During World War I, on 24 May 1915, the basilica was damaged by a bombardment of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The damage was restored in 1920, but in World War II Anglo-American aerial bombings destroyed the south transept and the Crypt of Tears under it, along with the art objects housed there. Once the transept was rebuilt, the church was officially reopened in 1951. Further damage was caused by an earthquake in 1972, followed by a new restoration and another official opening in 1977. In 1926 the cathedral was declared a basilica minor. Description =Exterior= The edifice is built in white stone from Mount Conero, with apses protruding from the transept's ends and an elevated body, with a dome at the crossing, in correspondence to the nave. All the external surfaces feature a decoration of Lombard bands. The bell tower is in an isolated position. It is mentioned from 1314 and was built above a pre-existing late 13th-century tower. Interior view The 1189 balustrade tiles The fa√ßade, divided into three section, is preceded by a wide staircase; above it is a 13th-century Romanesque portal formed by a round arch supported by four columns. The anterior ones stand on lions in Veronese red marble, while the rear ones, added later by Luigi Vanvitelli, are on a simple pedestal. Under the arches are four reliefs depicting the symbols of the Evangelists. The portal is attributed to Giorgio da Como (c. 1228), and is in Romanesque-Gothic style, built in Conero white stone from Mount Conero and Veronese red marble. It is decorated by a series of columns holding ogival arches with reliefs of saints' busts, animal figures and vegetable motifs. Above the portal is a large oculus with a Romanesque frame between two single mullioned windows. The dome is one of the most ancient in Italy. It has an ogival shape with a dodecagonal drum, standing on a square base with small decorative arches. It was built over the crossing in the 13th century, and is attributed to Margaritone d'Arezzo (1270). Together with the church of Sant'Antonio at Padua and St. Mark's Basilica in Venice, it was one of the few contemporary examples of domes built in churches, instead than in separate baptisteries. The copper cover was added in the 16th century. =Interior= The interior is on the Greek cross plan. All the arms are divided into a nave and two aisles, with re-used antique Roman columns with Byzantine capitals. At the crossing is the internal part of the dome, which has pendentives with Byzantine-style figures of praying angels. The dome is supported by cruciform cluster piers. The side arms of the transept end in elevated apses, while the central arm of the presbytery lost the original apse during the enlargement works of the 18th century. All the naves have hull-shaped, painted wooden vaults dating from the 15th century. At the beginning of the northern nave is the monument to a Fermo warrior from 1530. The south transept is home to the Chapel of the Crucifix. Its screens (transennae) are formed by tiles with sgraffito decoration from a balustrade of 1189. They depict, on the left, Jeremiah and Habakkuk; the Eternal Father and the Blessed Virgin; an angel and Saint John the Evangelist; and Saint Cyriacus; and, on the right, figures of animals: two cranes on a pomegranate tree, an eagle, two peacocks on a tree and two gryphons. In the Crypt of Tears below, rebuilt after the devastation of World War II, are remains of ancient structures. The presbytery's arms house, in the northern aisles, the sepulchre of Blessed Girolamo Ginelli (d. 1506), made in 1509 by Giovanni Dalmata. The northern transept houses the Madonna Chapel, with a lavishly decorated niche designed by Luigi Vanvitelli in 1739, which is the site of a venerated 17th century image of the Madonna. Under the chapel is a crypt with the remains of Saint Cyriacus of Ancona (in a marble case), Saints Liberius and Marcellinus (in Sicilian jasper) and the ashes of Saint Palatia. The urns with bronze festoons were designed and executed between 1757 and 1760 by Gioacchino Varl√®. =Photos= File:S, Ciriaco AN vista ingresso.JPGMain entrance File:AN S.Ciriaco ingresso..JPGMain entrance File:Ancona S.Ciriaco leone.JPGLion to the left of the entrance File:S.Ciriaco leone.JPGThe same File:Ancona S.Ciriaco leoni.JPGBoth lions at the entrance File:Ancona S.Ciriaco ingresso laterale.JPGSide entrance File:Ancona S.Ciriaco campanile.JPGCampanile File:AN S.

Print. she is remembered as an early advocate of modernized gender roles and increased women's rights, as a precursor to later women writers like Clarice Lispector, and for her support of abolition. She was married to the poet Filinto de Almeida. Life Lopes de Almeida was born on September 24, 1862 in Rio de Janeiro. She was daughter of the Visconde de S√£o Valentim (in English \\"Viscount of Saint Valentine\\"). Her career started in a newspaper of Campinas, the Gazeta de Campinas, in 1881. That year brought several shifts to Brazilian literature, namely the work Mem√≥rias P√≥stumas de Br√°s Cubas of Machado de Assis. Lopes de Almeida followed the new trends; however, her fame was ephemeral. In Imperial Brazil, a woman that was dedicated to literature was seen with certain prejudice. In an interview conceded to Jo√£o do Rio she said: Her first article in Gazeta de Campinas was an article about theater. Although she was one of the first Brazilian women to write, she did not achieve the same success that European female authors had, like George Sand and Jane Austen. She married the poet Filinto de Almeida. Her most famous works are Fam√≠lia Medeiros (\\"Medeiros Family\\") and A Heran√ßa (\\"The Heritage\\"), both psychological romances. But she also wrote children's literature, specifically between 1900 and 1917. Her main works for children were Hist√≥rias de nossa Terra (\\"Histories of our Land\\") and Era uma vez (\\"Once upon a time\\") She came from a privileged background and supported the domestic elements of female life. Although she also emphasized the education of woman as better for the family and tried, but failed, to join the Brazilian Academy of Letters.Emancipating the female sex: the struggle for women's rights in Brazil, 1850 ... by June Edith Hahner, pg 114Central at the margin: five Brazilian women writers by Renata Ruth Mautner Wasserman, pgs 33‚Äì41 Works Almeida authored many works. Her novels and short stories were deeply influenced by √âmile Zola and Guy de Maupassant. Particularly notable is her children's literature. In an era when most books destined for children were mere translations of European books, she and her sister, Adelina Lopes Vieira, were amongst the first to write original texts. Her work fell into obscurity after the spread of Brazilian Modernism. Thanks to the recent republication of several of years by Brazil's Editora Mulheres press, her books have been made available to new readers and scholars.

It was built about 1726, and was a 2 1/2-story log dwelling with a rear ell. It had a gabled roof and large interior chimney at each end. See also: Due to its construction, the Haskell House was considered one of the largest intact log mansions in the Thirteen Colonies.  History  256x256px = Colonel John Haskell = The builder of the house, Colonel John Haskell, served as a steward for Brigadier Robert Hunter, colonial governor of New York and New Jersey from 1710 ‚Äî 1720. After Hunter's appointment, Haskell continued in service to William Burnet. In 1719, he was awarded a tract of nearly 2,000 acres in New Windsor. Showing his appreciation, he contributed to the building of a fort and trading post in Oswego. Burnet paid Haskell five pounds for once again fulfilling his duties. In 1721, Colonel John Haskell obtained a grant of an additional 2,000 acres backing the lands of William Chambers, who acquired it a decade prior. The grant, which included lands east of Snake Hill, or Muchattoes Hill, became several farms, divided by stone walls. Some remnants of these walls exist through the hill today, though many may be of later construction. According to tradition, Haskell visited England, returning with a variety of seeds and cattle for his new farm. Haskell himself maintained a central plot near the base of the hill, where he constructed a large log manor house after settling the grant. The date of erection for Haskell's house, which he called the \\"Hermitage,\\" is contested, but likely 1726 or later. Evan Jones, a surgeon, occupied the third lot of the grant with his family. = Division of Land = Alexander and Cornelius Wood received a lot of 429 acres, including the house, on May 19th, 1761, following the death of Haskell and Jones. The executors of Jones' will also sold a larger lot to the forger Samuel Brewster on December 27th, 1763. In the roughly eight year period after the Wood's transfer, Moses Fowler owned a 229-acre portion of it, in turn selling it to Sylvannus Dusenbury on September 19th, 1769. The Dusenbury family held the property for several generations. During the Revolutionary War, Dr. John Jones, son of Evan Jones, assisted in the organization of the Continental Army's Medical Department. 7,000 troops camped on the original Haskell grant. Front parlor with modern fixtures Ownership of the property fell to several New Windsor families, most renowned being the Vails. Acreage reductions became common over the years, and when a corporation was sold the land in 1970, it had been reduced to 13.5 acres. Calvet Rental Inc. took ownership of the property and house in 1973. The house was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places this year. = Interest = Curiosity in the Hermitage peaked during this time, as workers for the Historic American Buildings Survey viewed it by commission. Many of New Windsor's 18th century houses had succumbed to demolition in the 20th century. The Orange County Citizens Foundation mobilized to conduct research on the house, with plans to restore and open it as a museum. During this time, Calvet Rental Inc. was using the house for storage , and required ongoing negotiation from the foundation regarding their plans. On the evening of April 12th, 1984, a fire began at the house, spreading quickly throughout. The New Windsor Fire Department called for backup from the City of Newburgh Fire Department, who refused to participate given that they were limited on engines. The ruins of the house were cleared.

Palazzo Albergati, attributed to Giovan Antonio Burrini; imagined scene of Albergati as diplomat meeting Philip II of Spain, with his portrait secretly being taken. Life Title page of Albergati's La Republica regia. Fabio Albergati was born in Bologna in 1538 of an ancient and noble family. He was one of the most celebrated literati of his time in Italy. In 1591, Pope Innocent IX appointed him governor of Perugia; and Orlandi asserts that he was also consistorial advocate. This latter statement is not, however, supported by any collateral evidence. He was held in great esteem by Pope Sixtus V, and in 1589 was sent as papal Ambassador to the court of Francesco Maria della Rovere, the last Duke of Urbino, by whom he was greatly beloved: the duke and he had been fellow students in their youth. In a letter of 1596 Albergati told the duke that he had asked Cardinal Francisco Toledo for permission to read Jean Bodin (whose works were on the Index of forbidden books). The prelate granted it but urged Albergati to confute Bodin's errors. Therefore, he wrote his unpublished Antibodino, submitted it to Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini after Toledo's death (1596), and sent a copy to the duke, who esteemed Bodin much. After substantially enlarging his original manuscript Albergati eventually decided to publish it, first in Rome (1602) and then in Venice (1603), under the title: Dei discorsi politici libri cinque. Nei quali viene riprovata la dottrina di Gio. Bodino, e difesa quella di Aristotele.. By his wife, the Countess Flaminia, daughter of the Count Antonio Bentivogli, he had six sons and five daughters. One of his daughters, Lavinia, became the wife of the Duke Orazio Ludovisi, the brother of Gregory XV. A bronze medal was struck in honour of him, bearing on the obverse his effigy, with the words ‚ÄúFabius Albergati Mon. Canini Marchio;‚Äù and on the reverse, falling dew, with the legend ‚ÄúDivisa beatum.‚Äù His death took place about the year 1605.  Works  Fabio Albergati was a very copious writer. He wrote against duelling in 1583, at a time when his patron was active against banditry.Gigliola Fragnito, Church, Censorship, and Culture in Early Modern Italy (2001), pp. 141‚Äì2; Google Books. He wrote a very detailed attack on Jean Bodin's theoretical dismissal of mixed constitutions. He equated the philosophy of raison d'etat with Machiavellianism. His La Republica regia (published 1627) was a counter to Machiavelli.Frank Edward Manuel, Fritzie Prigohzy Manuel, Utopian Thought in the Western World (1979), p. 153. The following is a list of his works: # Del Modo di ridurre alla Pace le Inimicizie private. Roma, 1583, fol. # Del Cardinale, Libri III. Bologna, 1589, 4to. # # Le Morali, edited by his son Antonio, Bishop of Bisceglie. Bologna, 1627, fol. # # Ragionamento al Cardinale S. Sisto come nipote di Papa Gregorio. Milano, 1600, 4to. He left several other works in MS., which were preserved in the library of the Duke of Urbino above mentioned. In 1573 Zanetti published, at Rome, six vols. of Albergati's moral works. Family His children included Cardinal Niccol√≤ Albergati-Ludovisi.

Earning ‚Çπ5.5 million net (valued at about ‚Çπ39.78 crore in 2009), Zindagi was the highest grossing Indian film at the time of its release, before its record was broken by Khazanchi in 1941.. The film has been described as one of Barua's \\"most beautiful films, and his last for New Theatres\\". It was the last film by Barua for New Theatres. Barua later married Jamuna as his second wife. No copy of the film is known to exist, making it a lost film. Plot Ratan, an unemployed graduate, who works as a gambler encounters an unnamed women, whom he addresses as Shrimati. Shrimati, who has escaped from her brutal husband, teams up with Ratan and they together pretend to run a charitable trust, collecting money from people in the name of donations. The duo buy an apartment and live together. Shrimati receives news of her father's death and learn that she is the heir to his wealth. A new Shrimati shuns all forms of corrupt ways of life and starts to do good deeds as a redemption for her sins. She employs Ratan as a tutor to an orphaned girl Lakhia. Ratan realizes that he cannot live without Shrimati and approaches her. Shrimati, who feels that she must pay for her sins, rejects Ratan. A heartbroken Ratan leaves Lakhia in the care of Shrimati and returns to his old life. Shrimati gives her fortune to a now-grown Lakhia and withdraws from worldly pleasures, awaiting death.

Release =Critical reception= Zindagi generally received positive reviews for critics. The Bombay Chronicle lauded the film for Pankaj Mullick's \\"divine music\\", two songs of Segal that are \\"the soul of melody and pathos,\\" the \\"cynical\\" humour of the first half of the film and the \\"subtle, heart- wrenching\\" emotionalism of the second half. They also praised the \\"haunting\\" performance of Jamuna. Filmindia called the film an \\"all smoke\\" and described it as generally \\"too intellectual\\" for the average audience. Bhagwan Das Garga writes, \\"The plot is slight but Barua's nuanced characterization and wealth of observation makes it a richly rewarding work.\\" =Controversies= In a frame sequence of the 1939 film Aadmi by V. Shantaram, which was simultaneously released along with Zindagi, the romantic \\"pessimism\\" of Barua was caricatured. According to Garga, this incident provided enough \\"grist\\" for the news media. An unnamed Gujarati weekly remarked, \\"Shantaram's eye is on life, Barua's on death.\\" Jamil Ansari, a critic, strongly defended Zindagi. Khwaja Ahmad Abbas compared the two films and wrote: Music The music composer was Pankaj Mullick with lyrics by Kidar Sharma and Arzu Lucknavi. One of the memorable songs from the film was \\"So Ja Rajkumari Soja\\". This lullaby was made famous in this film. All songs are sung by K. L. Saigal.

The music was composed by Saraswati Devi with lyrics by Kavi Pradeep. The film was remade in Telugu as Uyyala Jampala (1965). Synopsis A young widow called Kamala (Karuna Devi) approaches the new zamindar of her village to get the land tax waived as she is in bad financial straits. She has called for a private audience with him, where she is surprised to discover that the new zamindar is none other than Mahesh (Shah Nawaz), her one-time lover. Mahesh inquires about her late husband out of curiosity, only to discover to his surprise that she never married. Having considered him her husband, she pretended to be a widow to avoid being forced into marriage against her will. The irresponsible, hedonistic Mahesh waives off her taxes, but refuses to take the relationship any further. On his way back, he stops at the post office to send a telegram. There he meets a young lady Geeta (Leela Chitnis) seated on a swing (Jhoola), to whom he is instantly attracted. Geeta is the niece of the postmaster (V. H. Desai), with whom she is living. An amateur photographer, Mahesh captures pictures of Geeta before leaving for his home in the city. Back home, he gets into a heated discussion with his father, who intends to make a will distributing his property equally between his two sons: Mahesh and his adopted younger brother Ramesh. The old man strains his already weak heart in the course of the quarrel, suffering a heart attack. News of the heart attack is instantly relayed to Ramesh (Ashok Kumar), who rushes to meet his dying adopted father one last time. After a short meeting, the old man passes away. Mahesh, who is angry with his father for giving away half the property to a man who is not even his real son, picks up a quarrel with Ramesh. Disgusted with his brother's behaviour, Ramesh leaves the house in a huff. Unsure where to go, Ramesh boards a train. There he chances on the image of Geeta seated on the swing, which is the cover photo of a magazine. Instantly drawn to the face, he heads for Jharnaghat, the village where the young lady lives - unaware of the fact that the village is part of his inheritance. Once in Jharnaghat, Ramesh lives next door to the postmaster's assistant (Mumtaz Ali). He uses an alias to conceal his actual identity, writing love letters to Geeta using his actual name. The circumstances lead Geeta to think that her anonymous lover is none other than the man with the camera (who she later discovers is also the zamindar of her village). Ramesh' innocent actions result in a series of misunderstandings, which are eventually sorted out. The brothers finally patch up, Ramesh marrying Geeta and Mahesh agreeing to marry Kamala.

Legacy The song \\"Na Jaane Kidhar Aaj Meri Naav Chali Re (I know not where my boat is heading), sung by Ashok Kumar, was an immensely popular song in the 40s. Another song from the movie, Dilli Se Aayi Meri Dulhan, was extremely popular. Dance master Mumtaz Ali capitalised on the success of that song to start his own dance troupe. Having played second fiddle to his heroines in all his earlier movies, Jhoola was the first movie in which Ashok Kumar played the lead role. The success of the movie established him as one of the popular actors of the era, two years before the runaway success of Kismet (1943) would propel him to stardom.

She led the Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule Women's Studies Centre, (the department of Gender Studies) at University of Pune which position she occupied since 1991. She received the Malcolm Adiseshiah award for distinguished contribution to development studies from the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) in 2006.  Academic contribution  Rege was one of the leading feminist scholars in India, whose work in developing a 'Dalit Standpoint Perspective' has been crucial in opening up feminist debates in India to questions of class, caste, religion and sexuality. Rege's work within the academia, to fight for the right of the Dalit student's rights, has been a testimony of her commitment to critical educational reform in India Her concerns around the woman's question in India, contributed greatly to new and alternative methods of historiography, exposing the blind-spots of a Hindu Nation towards the Dalit voices and perspectives that have often been neglected in the political milieu of India's history. Her emphasis on relocating the central role of B. R. Ambedkar in the shaping of the modern nation state has ensured that the voice from the margins does not remain invisible opens up space for political contestation and dialogue in a public debate that is quickly being gentrified by the rhetoric of economic development and globalisation. In her last published work, Against the Madness of Manu, she sought to centralise Ambedkar's role in the women's movement by invoking his ideological fight against Brahminical patriarchy, and how the caste system engenders graded violence against women. Her particular focus on alternative history writing has given new life to the local and oral traditions of knowledge and cultural practice, by bringing them into public attention through translation projects that build archives of national memory. In 2002, she established a day care centre for children in the women‚Äôs studies department.  Personal  She died of colon cancer on 13 July 2013.

After he became a widower he married Alma Friedlander (1887-1977). The rise at the beginning of 1933 of the Nazi regime brought an end to both his medical and academic career. He immediately recognized there was no future for a reasonable life as a Jew in Germany. Consequently, he emigrated that same year, together with his wife Alma, to Palestine. He joined a group of Jewish German-born settlers who together founded in 1933 Ramot HaShavim, a village organized as an agricultural commune. For five years (1933-1938) he was member of the leading committee of the village. In 1939 he chaired the committee for less than a year. He was a highly educated person, a polymath with wide interests in the fields of life sciences, geology, philosophy and music. With his skills and experience as teacher, he led courses and gave lectures in the village on biological and agricultural topics relevant to farmers, and contributed to the cultural life of the village. Until his death in 1963, he made his living in Ramot HaShavim from a chicken farm, where he attempted to improve egg production by poultry breeding.The library at Wellcome Collection. Letter of Walter Steinitz to Dr. Gr√ºnberger. After his death in Bad Nauheim, Germany, he was buried in Ramot HaShavim. His three sons were born, grew up and studied in Germany before they emigrated to Palestine. He inspired them to study sciences: Ernst Steinitz (1907-1980), was an internist in the private sector; Heinz Steinitz (1909-1971) was a professor of zoology and marine biology in the Department of Zoology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and Gideon Steinitz (1911-1975) was a mathematician in his academic education, became a meteorologist in Palestine and eventually was head of the Israel Meteorology Service. Combining scientific investigation with Zionism Walter Steinitz was a committed Zionist who developed his unique way of combining scientific pursuit with Zionistic activism. He participated the Zionist Congresses in Basel in 1903 and in London (1920);Steinitz, D. 2003. Hot Sands, Childhood in Ramot HaShavim (an autobiography in Hebrew), p. 70.The Central Zionist Archives, Item symbolization PHG\\\\1002906. attended the inauguration ceremony of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925; chose the coast of Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean Sea as the zoogeographic research area he would study while still being affiliated to the Breslau University; and formulated plans for the establishment of a marine research station in Palestine nearly fifteen years prior his decision to move and live in that country.Steinitz, W. (1919) Denkschrift zur Begr√ºndung einer zoologischen Meeresstation an der K√ºste Pal√§stinas. Brosch√ºrenbibliothek des K.J.V. Nr. 7, 24pp. Finally, once he decided to leave Germany, his preference to emigrate to Palestine, and not elsewhere in Europe or America, certainly stemmed from his Zionist convictions. Pioneering research of fishes in Palestine Steinitz traveled to Palestine for zoological excursions in the second and third decades of the twentieth century. He explored, documented and analyzed his findings of fishes of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, commenced scientific collections of fishes, and was the first to publish a comprehensive fisheries research of Palestine. His investigations were pioneering in two scientific respects: First, he discovered new marine organisms in the region, and second, he found fishes of Indo-Pacific origin along the coast of Palestine.Steinitz, W. (1929) Die wanderung indopazifischer Arten ins Mittelmeer seit beginn der Quart√§rperiode. Internationale Revue der gesamten Hydrobiologie und Hydrographie 22: 1-90. The Suez Canal, a man-made connection between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, was opened only a few decades prior to his investigations in Palestine. The presence of Indo-Pacific species along the Mediterranean coast of Palestine revealed to Steinitz an influx of fishes from the Red Sea - a northern branch of the Indian Ocean - into the east Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal waterway, and it suggested that changes had occurred in the marine life of the south east Mediterranean Sea due to human intervention. He argued that with the new situation ‚Äú‚Ä¶it is the only place on earth where two quite different zoological marine provinces have come into direct touch with one another‚Äù and that the Canal ‚Äú‚Ä¶connects two oceans having each different fauna from the other‚Äù. Steinitz was among the first to call for monitoring the impact of the opening of the Suez Canal on the Levant biota. Studies of the invasions of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean Sea, and their ecological consequences for the Mediterranean marine biota, have proliferated since then and are ongoing in the twenty first century.Galil, B. S. (2009) Taking stock: inventory of alien species in the Mediterranean Sea. Biological Invasions 11: 359-372.Galil, B. S. and Goren, M. (2014) Metamorphoses: bioinvasions in the Mediterranean Sea.

DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6704-1_27 The phenomenon of migration of marine species form the Red Sea through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea is now termed Lessepsian migration. A marine biology research station in Palestine As early as 1919 Steinitz published his vision to establish a marine biology research station on the coast of Palestine. He was convinced that a research station located in Palestine would be essential for researching and following changes occurring in the marine biota of the Levant.Galil, B.S. (2007) Seeing red: alien species along the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Aquatic Invasions 2: p.282. An exchange of letters on the topic with Prof. Albert Einstein during the period 1919-1937 represent Steinitz‚Äôs persistent efforts to raise funds and support for the endeavor.Albert Einstein Archive Online Exchange of letters between Walter Steinitz and Albert Einstein.

Soon after immigration to Palestine he submitted in 1933 to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem an elaborate proposal for the establishment in Tel Aviv of a biological marine station and aquarium for the study of the Mediterranean marine fauna and as a center for lectures and teaching courses.Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) Hebrew University Offered Biological Station, Aquarium. July 17, 1933. He received support from the biochemist and Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, and from Tel Aviv‚Äôs mayor Israel Rokach. As a result, the Aquarium and Marine Station Tel-Aviv Society Ltd was founded in 1936. Among the group‚Äôs founders were the mayor of Tel Aviv, Israel Rokach; Dr. Felix Danziger; Prof. Alfred Klopstock and other scholars. Albert Einstein was Honorary President and Walter Steinitz was the scientific director.The National Library of Israel The Aquarium and Marine Station Tel- Aviv Society Ltd. A prospectus. The station was supposed to be built on land allocated by the Tel Aviv municipality, on the shore near the Yarkon estuary. The plan included construction of an aquarium, research rooms, a lecture hall and a library, all for the use of local researchers and guests from the international scientific community. The society‚Äôs agenda encompassed basic marine biology research of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, research to support fishing as a source of income, and exhibitions of marine animals to the public in the aquarium. The efforts to build the station in Tel Aviv were blocked when World War II broke out. Walter Steinitz made a final, brief and unsuccessful attempt to operate in 1939 a sea laboratory in Nahariya. His dream was ultimately fulfilled three decades later by his son Heinz Steinitz. A marine biology laboratory was inaugurated in 1968 on the coast of the Red Sea, in Eilat, the Gulf of Aqaba, and it is named The Heinz Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory, in memory of its founder and first director.Clark, E. and Aron, W.

The laboratory became the basic element in the subsequent development of The Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences near Eilat. Honors The sea anemone Cribrina steinitzi Pax 1925 was named after Walter Steinitz, while the fish species Tylognathus steinitziorum Kosswig (synonym of Hemigrammocapoeta nana Heckel 1843, discovered and named by Dr. Curt Kosswig in 1950), was dedicated to Walter Steinitz and his son Heinz Steinitz.Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names.

She was a specialist sprinter, showing her best form over distances of five and six furlongs (1000m and 1200m), who was known for her consistency and durability, and was particularly effective on soft ground. In a six-year career, she ran in sixty-six races and won seventeen. In her best season in 1995 she won six Group races and was named European Champion Sprinter. A year after her retirement, Hever Golf Rose died after failing to recover from the anaesthetic following an operation on a joint injury. Background Hever Golf Rose was bred by Ronald Popely who named her after his Hever Castle Golf Club. She was sired by Efisio out of the mare Sweet Rosina. Efisio, who was also owned by Popely for part of his stud career, sired the winners of almost a thousand races including twelve at Group One level. Sweet Rosina went on to produce the successful handicappers Go Hever Golf and Play Hever Golf. Popely sent Hever Golf Rose to the Doncaster St Leger sales as a yearling but bought her in for 6,000 gns when she failed to attract interest. Popely later sold her privately to Michael P Hanson for a reported fee of ¬£100,000. Hever Golf Rose was trained throughout her career by Joe Naughton at The Durdans stables at Epsom, Surrey. Naughton had begun training in 1991 and Hever Golf Rose was his first important winner. She had many jockeys but was most closely associated with Jason Weaver, who rode her for eleven of her thirteen races in her championship season of 1995. Racing career =1993: two-year-old season= Hever Golf Rose made her debut when finishing fourth in a maiden race at Leicester in May and was runner-up in a similar event at Chepstow in July. In the next sixteen days she recorded her first two wins in a maiden race at Doncaster and a Nursery (a handicap for two-year-olds) at Newmarket. =1994: three-year-old season= On her first race as a three-year-old Hever Golf Rose finished last in the Masaka Stakes at Kempton on her first and only start over a mile. Switched back to sprint distance she progressed steadily through handicaps and Listed races, winning three of her remaining thirteen starts, and improving her official rating from 73 to 105. She won handicaps at Newmarket and York and, on the first of her many foreign trips, the Silberne Peitsche (then a Listed race) at Gelsenkirchen. =1995: four-year-old season= Spring Hever Golf Rose's championship season began with a third place in the Listed Leicestershire Stakes on her second and final race beyond pure sprint distances. She then took her first Group race when she was sent to Rome for the Premio Melton and won by one and a half lengths from Fred Bongusto. Twelve days later she appeared in Germany, running fourth in the B√©nazet-Rennen. Summer In June, she was sent to Sweden where she finished fourth in the Taby Varsprint. Hever Golf Rose now began the most successful period of her career, winning seven of her next eight races. After winning a Listed race in Bremen, she stayed in Germany to take the Group Three Holsten Trophy beating Desidera by one and a half lengths. She returned to England for the King George Stakes at Goodwood for which she started at odds of 10/1. Hever Golf Rose appeared to be struggling and short of space to run in the early stages but produced a \\"strong burst\\" of speed in the last quarter mile to come from last to first and win by half a length to the \\"astonishment\\" of the spectators. In recording her only career victory on firm ground she set a new track record of 56.25. In the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes at York in August Jason Weaver attempted to make all the running but was caught in the closing stages and finished third to So Factual. Ten days after the York race she was back in Sweden, where she won the Taby Open Sprint Championship and only three days after that she appeared at Baden-Baden where she led from the start to take the Goldene Peitsche by two lengths from the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Lavinia Fontana. Autumn Hever Golf Rose's next two races took her to France. At Chantilly she was sent off the 11/10 favourite for the Prix de Seine-et-Oise in which she raced prominently and held off the late challenge of Tereshkova to win by a neck. Joe Naughton called her \\"an amazing filly\\" after the win, while the press commented on her \\"remarkable\\" season. After four races in twenty-five days, Hever Golf Rose was given a \\"break\\" of three weeks before her run in the Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp. The race featured a meeting with another four-year-old filly, the French-trained Cherokee Rose, who had won her last four races including the Prix Maurice de Gheest and the Haydock Sprint Cup. Cherokee Rose was sent off the odds on favourite, with Hever Golf Rose starting at 3.1/1. Weaver tracked Eveningperformance in the early stages before moving his filly into the lead two furlongs out. Hever Golf Rose went clear and although Cherokee Rose finished strongly, she could not catch the English filly who recorded her biggest success by a margin of two and a half lengths. The performance was described by Sue Montgomery, writing in the Independent, as a \\"dazzling solo tour-de-force\\". On her final start she was sent to the United States, the sixth country she had visited that year, for the Breeders' Cup Sprint. It was her first race on dirt, although she had encountered the surface in training. Before the race, Joe Naughton paid tribute to his filly's ability to cope with her busy schedule saying that \\"she really thrives on racing and she travels brilliantly.\\" In the race at Belmont she showed some speed to reach third place in the straight, but faded in the closing stages to finish eighth of the thirteen runners behind Desert Stormer. =1996: five-year-old season= Hever Golf Rose failed to win in thirteen starts as five-year-old, despite running prominently in top sprint races all over Europe. She finished second in the Goldene Peitsche, the Holsten Trophy, the King George Stakes, the Taby Varsprint and the B√©nazet-Rennen, and third in the July Cup, the Nunthorpe Stakes, the Prix de l'Abbaye and the Premio Omenoni. After her narrow defeat in the King George Stakes the Independent's correspondent described her as \\"one of the most willing and popular horses in training.\\" =1997: six-year- old season= At six, Hever Golf Rose ran seventeen times in a campaign that ran from April to November. She competed in five different counties and recorded three wins. In May at Longchamp she disputed the lead for most of the way in the Prix de Saint-Georges and ran under pressure in the final furlong to beat Titus Livius by a short neck. In June was sent to Sweden where she went clear in the straight in to win the T√§by Varsprint by two lengths. She returned to Longchamp in October for the Prix du Petit Couvert in which she took the lead a furlong out and won by one and a half lengths from the Prix de l'Abbaye winner Kistena. =1998: seven-year-old season= Hever Golf Rose was in foal to Danehill in 1998, but still ran in five races. She recorded her last win when taking her second T√§by Varsprint in June and ended her career later in the same month when running unplaced in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. Assessment Hever Golf Rose was voted European Champion Sprinter in the 1995 Cartier Racing Awards. Retirement and death Hever Golf Rose was covered by Danehill in spring 1998, before her final year of racing. She gave birth to a colt foal in 1999. In September Hever Golf Rose underwent surgery for a joint injury at Newmarket. She did not recover from the anaesthetic and her death was reported in the Racing Post on 1 October. She was in foal to the 2000 Guineas winner Entrepreneur at the time. Ronald Popely was reportedly too upset to comment; Joe Naughton said \\"She was a one- off. It is really tragic... She didn't owe anybody anything and was a real star.\\" Pedigree References Category:1991 racehorse births Category:1999 racehorse deaths Category:Cartier Award winners Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 13-e ","title":"Hever Golf Rose"},{"id":"33215475","text":"Nadaan is a 1943 Indian Bollywood film.

The band consisted of rappers Ali Bla Bla and Koken, lead singer and guitarist Danny Wilder, bassist Memari Man, guitarist Richie 2 Pun, drummer Royal and synthesiser player 8bit. In 2011 they released a single with Klashnekoff, and undertook a UK tour with Maverick Sabre. History The band was established by rapper Ali Bla Bla after meeting lead singer Danny Wilder at a Busta Rhymes concert at London's Wembley Arena. Ali turned to old school friends Richie 2 Pun, Memari Man and Koken as well as brother 8bit (who introduced drummer Royal to Ali) and formed the band. Their debut single, \\"I Try\\", was released on 31 August 2010, gaining support from BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra. They have gone onto achieve further cult success through singles \\"Listen To The Old Man\\" (released 1 November 2010) and \\"Darkness\\" (featuring Klashnekoff) released on 11 March 2011, with remix's from Nutty P. The band went onto release their biggest underground hit to date \\"Make Me Worse\\" on 13 July 2012 and went onto BBC Radio 1xtra to perform live on Charlie Sloth's Fire In The Booth.

Lead singer, Danny Wilder died of lung cancer on 3 October 2013, at the age of 27. The band released this statement via their Facebook page: \\"For the first time in my life, I am lost for words. Our brother, friend, leader, singer, guitarist, front man and all around boss, Danny Wilder, passed away yesterday morning. The world will never be the same again. Our respect and deepest sorrows are with his family and loved ones.\\" The final album, titled No Snake was released as a tribute to Danny Wilder's legacy with the help of a successful Kickstarter project on 14 August 2015. The Kickstarter raised a total of ¬£14,129 from 338 backers on 14 September 2014. The album featured other talent such as Maverick Sabre and Klashnekoff and consisted of 14 tracks, several tracks, such as \\"Make Me Worse,\\" \\"Please Tell Me,\\" \\"Wrong\\" and \\"Doors Are Open\\" received live action music videos. The albums total length is 1:03:16, and the album can be viewed in its entirety on YouTube.

He contributed to the most important Italian magazines of the period, including L‚Äôillustrazione italiana, Avanti della Domenica and Il Giornalino della Domenica, and finally established himself as the illustrator of Grazia Deledda, with whom he shared a determination to assert the specific values of Sardinian culture in post- unification Italy. He also began painting, primarily folkloristic depictions of his homeland but informed by an awareness of the latest developments in European painting, with which he came into contact very early through the shows of the Secessione Romana movement and the Venice Biennale, where he made his debut at the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte della Citt√† di Venezia in 1909. Participation in exhibitions in Rome and Milan was interrupted only for the short period when he served as a volunteer in World War I. The period 1924‚Äì26 saw a number of journeys to North Africa in search of ways to revitalise his means of expression.

Life Bisi was born in Milan on 10 May 1814, the son of the painter Michele Bisi. He studied under his father and his uncle Giuseppe Bisi, and then under Francesco Durelli at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera. It is sometimes suggested that he also studied under Giovanni Migliara. Bisi succeeded Durelli as teacher of perspective at the Accademia, and taught there for more than 30 years. In 1879 he became president of that academy. He died in Milan on 11 November 1886. Work As a young man Bisi painted airy vedute, but most of his paintings are of interiors, mostly churches, and most particularly the Duomo di Milano, which he claimed to have painted eighty-seven times. His interest in perspective led him to architecture. From 1857 he worked with Giovanni Brocca, Friedrich von Schmidt and Giuseppe Pestagalli on the long- drawn-out restoration of the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio. His plans for extensions to the Palazzo dei Giureconsulti were exhibited in 1877. Bisi designed the pedestal for the bronze copy Canova's statue of Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker which from 1859 stood in the main courtyard of Palazzo Brera, home of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera and the Pinacoteca di Brera. The base is in granite and Carrara marble, with bronze decorations, and was inaugurated in 1864. Among his pupils were Leopoldo Burlando and Giovanni Pessina.

Barbaria was the name used by the ancient Greeks for littoral northeast Africa. The corresponding Arabic term, bilad al-Barbar (land of the Barbar), was in use in the Middle Ages.Michael Peppard, \\"A Letter Concerning Boats in Berenike and Trade on the Red Sea\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 171 (2009), pp. 193‚Äì198. According to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a 1st-century travelogue written by a Greek merchant based in Alexandria, Barbaria extended from the border of Egypt just south of Berenice Troglodytica to just north of Ptolemais Theron. From there to the Bab-el- Mandeb was the kingdom ruled by Zoskales (possibly Aksum), after which the \\"rest of Barbaria\\" extended to Opone. This second Barbaria was the location of the so-called \\"far-side\\" ports. In the Geography of Ptolemy (2nd century), Barbaria is said to extend even further, as far south as Zanzibar, although the land south of Opone is called Azania in the Periplus.Lionel Casson (ed.), The Periplus Maris Erythraei: Text with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary (Princeton University Press, 1989), p. 45.Lionel Casson, \\"Barbaria\\", in Glen W. Bowersock, Peter Brown and Oleg Grabar (eds.), Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World (Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1999), p. 334. In the Periplus, Barbaria is said to lack central government and is ruled by local chiefs. Azania, on the other hand, is subject to the Sabaeans and Himyarites. In the Periplus, the inhabitants of the first Barbaria, or the Barbarike chora (Barbarian region), include the eponymous Barbaroi (Barbarians, Berbers), but also Ichthyophagoi (fish eaters), Agriophagoi (wild beast eaters) and Moschophagoi (shoot eaters). These are probably the same people as the Trogodytes of other ancient geographers. The Moschophagoi may correspond to the Rhizophagoi (root eaters) and Spermatophagoi (seed eaters) of other geographers.Casson 1989, pp. 96‚Äì97. The first contact of the Greeks with Barbaria came in the 3rd century BC, when the Ptolemies set up bases for elephant hunting. These bases remained in use as ports for the export of myrrh and frankincense throughout antiquity. There were many smaller ports that exported tortoiseshell and ivory. The name of Barbaria is preserved today in the name of the Somali city of Berbera, the city known to the Greeks as Malao.David M. Goldenberg, \\"Geographia Rabbinica: The Toponym Barbaria\\", Journal of Jewish Studies 50, 1 (1999), pp. 67‚Äì69. Arabic sources refer to the coast as the Ba·∏•r BerberƒÅ or al-Khalƒ´j al-Berberƒ´ and its inhabitants as the Berbera or BerƒÅbir. They are the Somalis, distinguished from the Habash to their north and the Zanj to their south. From Arabic, this terminology for northeast Africa entered Hebrew (Barbara), Persian (Barbaristan) and even Chinese (Pi-pa-li). Most of these usages are associated with Somalia. The Chinese term, although probably derived from Berbera, refers to the coast and hinterland and not just the port.Paul Wheatley, \\"The Land of Zanj: Exegetical Notes on Chinese Knowledge of East Africa prior to AD 1500\\", in Robert W.

Biography Having studied at the Andrea Fantoni art school in Bergamo since 1924, Bonfanti moved to Milan in 1926 and devoted his energies to graphic art and interior decoration. It was in the 1930s that he developed relations with the group of abstract artists gravitating around the Galleria del Milione in Milan. He was also influenced by the Metaphysical art of Carlo Carr√† and L‚ÄôEsprit nouveau of Am√©d√©e Ozenfant and Le Corbusier. His return to Bergamo during World War II was followed in the post-war period by various trips to Paris, Zurich and Munich. In 1947 he started to produce abstract paintings, aiming for the geometric simplification of forms. Unlike many artists of that period, he did not join a specific artistic movement, and his creativity was not confined by medium. In 1954, he won an award at the Cannes Film Festival for his film La chiave di Calandrino. During the 34th Venice Biennale in 1968 the Italy pavilion devoted a room exclusively to his artworks. Bonfanti participated in the controversial S√£o Paulo Art Biennial of 1969, which was the subject of an international boycott.

It was written via a \\"Script to Screen\\" competition in which junior schools were asked to write a script including the Eleventh Doctor and an enemy of his. The competition was won by the children of Oakley CE Junior School. In the mini-episode, the Doctor's fez calls its former owner Albert Einstein (Nickolas Grace) into the TARDIS. Einstein carries a mysterious liquid which changes Einstein into an Ood. Plot The episode opens with the Doctor in the TARDIS reunited with his fez from \\"The Big Bang\\". While reminiscing happily about it he trips over, knocking the fez off his head and hitting a lever on the console. The fez vanishes and then Albert Einstein appears with the fez on his head. Einstein greets the Doctor and explains that he had been working on a time machine and thought he'd found the vital part of it ‚Äî a mysterious liquid which Einstein believes to be \\"bionic fusion liquid\\". The Doctor offers to run some tests on it but Einstein insists upon testing it himself and turns to walk away from the console. However, the liquid spits up at his face and changes Einstein into an Ood. For several seconds the \\"Albert-Ood\\" repeats \\"Death is the Only Answer\\", confusing the Doctor. Suddenly a white cylinder vortex appears and the \\"Albert-Ood\\" walks towards it and somehow manages to turn back into Einstein. Einstein asks to go home so the Doctor drops him off in 1945 (\\"18th of September, about two o'clock\\"). The Doctor leaves for another adventure, while a bit of the liquid is left on the floor, moving slowly. Production =Writing= \\"Death Is the Only Answer\\" was written by four pupils from Oakley Junior School. \\"Death Is the Only Answer\\" is the winner of BBC Learning's \\"Script to Screen\\" writing competition, which began on 28 April 2011 and encouraged children aged 9 to 11 to collaborate on a three-minute script for the Eleventh Doctor. The script also could feature a new human character and an enemy of an Ood, Judoon, Cyberman, or Weeping Angel. BBC Learning's website contained learning resources for teachers and pupils to exercise their writing skills, while Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill presented a series of videos in character as the Doctor, Amy Pond and Rory Williams respectively. Videos were also produced with advice about how to write a good script and incorporating character and stage directions. Response to the competition was great, with 292,000 downloads of the online teaching material. The children's teacher, Kevin Downing, had told all the upper school children about the competition at an assembly, asking them to come up with a good plot in small groups. He said that they spent \\"about three hours over a number of weeks writing the script. Being Doctor Who fans, they had great fun deliberating over how the Doctor would react to things, what he would say and imagining how it would look on screen. None of us ever imagined the school would win the competition of course, but it was exciting to have entered and have the finished script to look back on in years to come.\\" The chosen script was written by four pupils from Oakley CE Junior School: Adam Shephard, Ben Weston, Daniel Heaton, and Katie Hossick. They chose an Ood to feature in the mini-episode after deciding that the Cybermen \\"walk a bit too slowly\\", the Judoon are \\"not really scary\\", and a Weeping Angel \\"wouldn't really do anything\\". The appearance of Albert Einstein came about because the pupils had learned about him at school. =Selection and filming= The winners were selected by showrunner Steven Moffat, BBC Learning controller Saul Nass√©, and Doctor Who executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis. Of the judging, Moffat said, Matt Smith was impressed with the chosen script, and particularly Albert Einstein's role in the mini-episode. Smith, who had also written his own stories about Einstein meeting the Doctor, said that the story was \\"brilliantly realised. They [the children] did it with aplomb.\\" The winners were taken to the Upper Boat Studios complex near Cardiff in Wales to see their episode being filmed, while the Doctor Who Confidential team was there to document the transition from script to screen. =Cast notes= Nickolas Grace previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama Bang-Bang-a-Boom! where he played Loozly, and as the Time Lord Straxus in the Eighth Doctor audio dramas Human Resources, Sisters of the Flame and Vengeance of Morbius. Broadcast \\"Death Is the Only Answer\\" was aired in the finale of Doctor Who Confidential on 1 October 2011; previous episodes had detailed the transformation from script to screen.

He served as a volunteer in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859. In 1862, together with Giuseppe Abbati, Silvestro Lega, Raffaello Sernesi and Signorini, he went to work in the countryside outside Florence near Piagentina, in consequence of which these painters became known as the school of Piagentina.Steingr√§ber & Matteucci 1984, p. 47.

Music director Hanuman Prasad heard her voice and made her sing two lines in a chorus in his film Bhakt Prahlad (1946). Considering a film took one to one and a half years those days, young Geeta would have been about 15 years old when she sang two lines in the Chorus. S.D. Burman heard those two lines, and though her voice was part of that chorus, he realized her potential. He went to her place in Dadar to persuade her father to let her sing in his forthcoming film Do Bhai (1947). The film was being produced by Filmistan, the biggest production house those days. Geeta would have been all of 16 then. Burman-da decided to make her sing most of his songs. Naturally, the producers objected to a young and untrained girl singing most of the songs in their film. But Burman Dada would not listen. Finally, a compromise was arrived at. Dada put his reputation at stake by declaring that he would record one song with Geeta, after listening to which the producers may arrive at their decision. Dada was so confident of his ability to make her sing. The first song to be recorded by Geeta was ‚ÄòHumein chod piya kis des gaye‚Äô. Everyone liked it and Dada was allowed a free hand to decide. Do Bhai had nine songs, out of which Dada made Geeta sing six songs. Geeta sang her life's first super-hit song ‚ÄòMera sunder sapna beet gaya‚Äô under SD Burman. Viewers used to see the film again, and again, for its music. The film became super-hit, and completed silver jubilee. It was also first film for lyricist Raja Mehdi Ali Khan. Both Geeta Dutt and Raja Mehdi Ali Khan got name and fame after the film. Geeta became number one singer till Lata took over in 1949. Even then she held her own in the 1950s.

Biography Calvi attended the Cignaroli Academy in Verona before moving to Milan in 1844 and completing his studies at the Brera. Carrying on the Romantic tradition of landscape painting, he made a name for himself at Milanese exhibitions with views of lakes and the area of Brianza based on the then fashionable models of Giuseppe Canella. Calvi‚Äôs return to Verona in 1856 was followed by increased commercial success and official recognition. He was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1859 and director of the Societ√† di Belle Arti in 1866. Urban views, landscapes and subjects drawn from the struggle for national liberation came to predominate in his output in the 1860s. While the adoption of a repetitive and somewhat facile pictorial vocabulary ensured lasting success in terms of sales, the first negative reviews by critics also began to appear in the next decade.

Life  Theodoric was the second son of Henry the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, and his wife Constance of Babenberg, a daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. In 1261, his father split the Margraviate of Landsberg off from his Lusatian territory, which after the War of the Thuringian Succession in 1265 he transferred to Theodoric, thereby creating a cadet branch of the Wettin dynasty. The territory comprised the westernmost part of Lusatia between the Saale and Mulde rivers, centered around Landsberg Castle. Theoderic's march included the towns of Delitzsch, Leipzig and Groitzsch, his estates stretched down to Zwickau and Grimma with the residence at Wei√üenfels. The creation of an Imperial State without consent by the Holy Roman Emperor was against legal provisions, nevertheless it had no penalty effects as a central Imperial authority did not exist during the years of the interregnum. Moreover, the division entailed fierce inheritance conflicts with Theoderic's elder brother Albert the Degenerate and his sons. Upon the election of Rudolf of Habsburg as King of the Romans in 1273, Theoderic initially sided with his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia, but later chose to remain neutral. He vested the Leipzig citizens with significant town privileges and also joined a Prussian Crusade of the Teutonic Knights. Theodoric died in 1285 on the way back from Silesia, where he had betrothed his daughter Gertrude to the Piast duke Bolko I the Strict. His tomb is located in the former abbey of Seu√ülitz, today part of N√ºnchritz, Saxony. The Landsberg branch already became extinct when his son Frederick Tuta died without male heirs in 1291. Landsberg was then sold to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg.  Marriage and issue  In 1258, Theodoric married Helen of Brandenburg (d. 1304), a daughter of Margrave John I of Brandenburg. They had five children: * Sophie of Landsberg (born: ; died: 24 August 1318), married to Conradin of Hohenstaufen in 1266 (proxy marriage), secondly married to Konrad I of G≈Çog√≥w in 1271, later Abbess of the Saint Clare monastery in Wei√üenfels * Frederick Tuta, Margrave of Meissen and Landsberg (born 1269; died: 16 August 1291) * Gertrude, became a nun in Wei√üenfels (died: 17 January 1325) * Helen, became a nun in Wei√üenfels * Brigitta  Ancestors   References  *  External links  * WW-Person database by Herbert Stoyan Category:Margraves of Germany Category:House of Wettin Category:1242 births Category:1285 deaths Category:13th-century German people ","title":"Theodoric of Landsberg"},{"id":"33215812","text":"Melanio B√°ez is a Paraguayan football midfielder who played for Paraguay in the 1950 FIFA World Cup.1950 FIFA World Cup Brazil He also played for Club Nacional.

The repertoire of perspective views drawn directly from the master was revitalised with new subjects as the result of a long journey to Rome and Naples from 1830 to 1832.

An honorary member of the Brera Academy of Fine Arts as from 1850 and academic advisor from 1860, he resigned from his official posts in 1868.

Its celebrated its 21st anniversary in 1987 which was to be the last Glengarth Sevens held at Davenport rugby club.  How it all began  In June 1966 the North East Cheshire Society for Mentally Handicapped Children opened their day care centre at 'Glengarth' in Station Road, Marple, Stockport. As a number of the children who attended lived in Bramhall, a Bramhall sub-committee of the society was formed with one of its main objectives being fundraising. It was thought best to organise events which would be annual to raise regular income. At the time, a member of the Bramhall sub-Committee, Michael Hodgson, was Captain of Davenport Rugby Club. The club was approached through, then President Norman Harris, by George Jackson and Michael Hodgson with the properstioion of organising an annual seven a side rugby competition. George had a ready made carrot to dangle in that he said he could get David Watkins, then of Newport RFC and the 'Prince of all Sevens Players' to bring a side for the first tournament. It was decided to form a joint committee to organise the event and so the 'Glengarth Sevens' was born. England Rugby International, Eric Evans was invited to become President and remained throughout providing continuous encouragement, inspiration and leadership. The England players of his era rated Eric as the finest Captain they had played under and the team went on to win the Grand Slam in 1957 and Triple Crown in 1958. The tournament was very fortunate to have a number of dedicated sponsors but the most valuable contribution was made by Davenport Rugby Club and its members who worked so hard to make the Glengarth Sevens a national success and a very highly respected seven a side rugby tournament. The 21 years of the Glengarth Sevens raised more than ¬£60,000. Many famous teams and players entered the Glengarth Sevens. Players like David Watkins, Andy Irvine, Les Cusworth, Phil Bennett, Peter Winterbottom, Steve Smith, Fran Cotton and many others; teams like Orrell, who won the competition 8 times and guest sides such as the Public School Wanderers, who won it 4 times. Famous memories include legendary British and Irish Lions Captain, Willie John McBride running onto the Davenport 1st XV pitch with a lion cub from Longleat.

He designed many successful cars, including Jaguar's Le Mans-winning XJR-9, and cars for almost every type of circuit racing. He was responsible for the chassis design of Ford's RS200 Group B rally car. Southgate was employed as chief designer or technical director for many Formula One teams for over twenty years. These teams included BRM, Shadow and Arrows. Southgate retired after producing the Audi R8C, which was a major influence in the Bentley Speed 8, which won Le Mans in 2003. He continues to be a regular visitor to current and historic race meetings. Southgate is the only chief engineer to have won the Triple Crown of Motorsport with his cars: Indianapolis 500 with Eagle TG2 in 1968, the Monaco Grand Prix with the BRM P160B and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1988 and 1990 with Jaguar XJR-9 and Jaguar XJR-12. Early career at Lola and Eagle Tony Southgate became interested in motorsport during his engineering apprenticeship and, like many aspiring racing designers in the late 1950s, was a member of the 750 Motor Club. The 750MC was a training ground for motorsport luminaries such as Colin Chapman, Eric Broadley and Brian Hart. In 1962 Broadley gave Southgate his first job, as a draughtsman for Lola Cars. Southgate gained a broad grounding in many areas of motorsport design while at Lola. He was involved in projects as wide-ranging as the lithe, 1.5 litre Lola Mk4A Formula One car and the 5.0 litre Lola T70 sports car. He also assisted with designs for IndyCar chassis, one of which evolved into the Honda RA300 Hondola Formula One race-winner. It was his experience with single-seater and IndyCar designs which prompted Dan Gurney to hire Southgate for his All American Racers team, based in California, to design some of the second generation of Gurney-Eagle USAC racers. The highlight of Southgate's time with AAR was when Bobby Unser won the 1968 Indianapolis 500 race in one of Southgate's Eagle cars. The Southgate-designed Eagle Formula 5000 car also found some success. Promotion with BRM In 1969 Tony Southgate moved back to the UK and took a job as Chief Designer for the BRM Formula One team. Southgate's first BRM car, the BRM P153, appeared in time for the first race of the season in South Africa. BRM enjoyed a renaissance with the P153 and its successor the BRM P160. The P160, in particular, was highly competitive during the season; drivers Pedro Rodr√≠guez and Jo Siffert often ran near the front of the field, only for poor reliability to let them down before the finish. Continued development work reaped vast improvements. In the latter half of the season Siffert and Peter Gethin (who had replaced Rodr√≠guez following the latter's death) won back-to- back victories in the Austrian and Italian Grands Prix. Gethin's victory at Monza was taken at an average speed of over 150 mph (240 km/h) and stood as the fastest ever Grand Prix win for over 30 years. Although the BRM team finished second in the Constructors' Championship standings the end of the season, the achievement was marred by Siffert's death in a non-Championship race at Brands Hatch. Unfortunately for BRM and Tony Southgate his design, the BRM P180, was not as competitive as the previous model. Siffert's replacement Jean-Pierre Beltoise managed to win a rain-hit Monaco Grand Prix in the older P160, and with it take BRM's final Formula One victory. During the 1972 season BRM and Tony Southgate parted company. BRM finished the season in seventh place. CanAm and Formula One with Shadow At the end of 1972 Shadow Racing Cars founder Don Nichols approached Southgate to design a Formula One car for his team to enter in the 1973 World Championship. Shadow had already been involved in the CanAm sportscar series for nearly two years, and with UOP sponsorship Nichols was planning an entrance into Formula One. Southgate designed and built the first Shadow Formula One prototype, the Shadow DN1, in his own garage in Lincolnshire, where he had moved to be closer to the BRM factory in Bourne. However, production was soon shifted to the US, to where Southgate once again relocated. Drivers George Follmer and Jackie Oliver were immediately competitive in the DN1. In 1974 the Southgate-designed Shadow DN4 earned first and second in the CanAm championship. In the same year Peter Revson died while testing the Shadow DN3 at Kyalami. Tony Southgate designed the Shadow DN5 for the 1975 Formula One season. The car proved very fast, with Jean-Pierre Jarier and Tom Pryce both winning pole positions during the year, however it had poor reliability, often retiring when in a points scoring position. Lotus At the end of 1975 the withdrawal of Shadow's main sponsor UOP prompted Southgate to move to Lotus, where he worked alongside Peter Wright on the Lotus 77 and Lotus 78 until the middle of 1977. Shadow again and Arrows After Lotus, Southgate returned to Shadow, but left the team again at the end of 1977 together with Franco Ambrosio, Alan Rees, Jackie Oliver and Dave Wass to form Arrows. Arrows' first car, the FA1, was almost identical to the Shadow DN9, which Southgate had designed while at Shadow. The FA1 was comfortably leading its second race, the South African Grand Prix, at the hands of Riccardo Patrese, when its engine blew, forcing it to retire. The Shadow team successfully sued Arrows for infringement of its copyrights and the Arrows FA1 was declared illegal in a UK court judgement on 31 July. Southgate had anticipated this and had completed an alternative design dubbed Arrows A1 which was swiftly produced without Arrows missing a race. Southgate also designed the Arrows A2 and A3, before leaving the team to work as a freelance engineering consultant.  Theodore and Osella  Southgate returned to Formula 1 towards the end of 1980 to design Theodore Racing's TY01 to race in the 1981 season. When Theodore was merged into Ensign at the end of 1982, Southgate and John Thompson founded a design consultancy named Auto Racing Technology, that worked for Ford on two major projects, including development of the Ford RS200. In 1983 Southgate designed his last Formula 1 car, the Osella FA1E. The design was severely constrained as Osella Squadra Corse did not have sufficient finances to build an entirely new chassis, forcing Southgate to adapt some parts (gearbox and rear suspension) of the Alfa Romeo 182 of previous year to fit an engine from Alfa Romeo. Sports cars After the experience on Can-Am cars with Shadow, Southgate collaborated with Ford in 1982-83. with the goal to improve the C100. Helped by John Thompson, realized the MkII version that raced in last races of 1982, then realized the new Mk III, but in March 1983, Ford cancelled is activity in sports cars, after the first tests made at Paul Ricard Circuit. After the work on Ford RS200, in 1984 Southgate moved to Tom Walkinshaw Racing, where he headed the design of the Jaguar XJR-9 and XJR-12. These won the World Sportscar Championship three times and the Le Mans 24 hour race twice. The XJR-9 also raced in the North America in the IMSA GT Championship. It won on its debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1988, and in the final race of the season at Del Mar. He remained at TWR until 1990. Southgate subsequently worked on sports cars for Toyota (Toyota TS010 1991‚Äì93), Ferrari (Ferrari 333 SP 1993‚Äì95), Lister, Nissan (Nissan R390 GT1 1996‚Äì97) and Audi (Audi R8R and R8C).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 18, 2012. Plot After Mr. Burns' lawyer tells him that drug tests for the plant workers are costing him money, Smithers proposes to replace the employees with robots in order to cut costs. Mr. Burns fires all of his employees, but Smithers insists that Burns retain one human worker to perform maintenance and to serve as a possible scapegoat. Homer becomes the lucky employee, after bursting into Burns' office to thank him for years of service and to criticize him for being cruel to his fellow man. With everyone else at the plant out of work (including Smithers), the town suffers from a 99% unemployment rate. Homer tries to socialize with the robots, only to be electrically shocked by one who does not understand his \\"Working hard or hardly working?\\" joke. Homer steals Mr. Burns' robot manual to change the robot workers' personalities and give them human emotions, and to program them to play baseball with him and Bart. During the baseball game, one robot hits the ball out of bounds. Homer runs backwards into the street to catch it, not noticing that there is a truck approaching. A robot saves his life by walking in front of the truck, then several more robots walk onto the road in front of oncoming cars and trucks. At the robot funeral, Homer tries to propose a toast. But one robot states that the Three Laws of Robotics demands that robots must protect humans; because alcohol is bad for human health, the robot takes away Homer's beer. Annoyed by this, Homer borrows Flanders' drill and gives them \\"robot lobotomies\\", but this reprograms the robots to \\"eliminate all impediments to the plant\\" by killing Homer. Homer runs to Mr. Burns' mansion for help, but Mr. Burns makes things worse by releasing his hounds on the robots. One robot easily flings one of the hounds a great distance. The other hounds retreat in fear. When Mr. Burns insults them, the slighted hounds become angry and join the robots. They chase Burns and Homer, who hide inside Mr. Burns' greenhouse. The robots burst in, but Homer and Mr. Burns are saved by the unemployed citizens of Springfield. Burns rehires his former employees as temps. Homer rebuilds one of the robots and takes it on a fishing trip, but the robot becomes annoyed by Homer and self-destructs. Production \\"Them Robot\\" was directed by Michael Polcino and written by Michael Price. Guest star Brent Spiner provides the voice of all the robots; Spiner had famously portrayed the android Data in Star Trek: The Next Generation and its four feature films. The title of the episode is a reference to Isaac Asimov's collection of short stories, I, Robot. \\"Robot Parade\\" from No! by They Might Be Giants is played at the end. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 18, 2012.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on a cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, the director of the cruise, performs a song called \\"Enjoy It While You Can\\" that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life. Bart decides to trick the crew and the passengers on the ship that the world is coming to an end back on land because of a pandemic and that the ship therefore has to stay out at sea. He manages to do this with the help of a large television screen, on which he displays a scene from the film The Pandora Strain that features a general named William Sullivan warning humanity about a deadly virus. Treat Williams guest starred in the episode as film character William Sullivan, while Steve Coogan made a guest appearance as the cruise director Rowan Priddis. \\"Enjoy It While You Can\\" was produced for the episode by Broadway composer Robert Lopez, who also co-wrote the song with the writers of The Simpsons. Other songs played in the episode include \\"Boy from School\\" by Hot Chip and \\"Winter's Love\\" by Animal Collective. Since airing, \\"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\\" has received generally positive reviews from television critics, being praised for showing an emotional side of Bart. Around five million viewers tuned in to watch the episode during its original US broadcast. Plot After another boring week in his life, Bart sees a commercial on television for a fun cruise and begs Homer and Marge for a family vacation. They tell him that the family is low on cash, so Bart chooses to sell everything he owns to fund the vacation himself. He comes up well short of the needed amount, so Marge and Lisa help by selling one valuable item apiece. Together the three have enough money to book the family into an economy cabin; once the cruise starts, though, a series of free upgrades places them in a deluxe cabin. They enjoy the wide range of activities onboard, but Bart's spirits sink when he hears the cruise director, Rowan Priddis, sing a song to the passengers telling them to enjoy the rest of the cruise while they can before they go back to their normal lives. Bart fears that the remainder of his life will be painfully boring and decides to make the vacation last forever. Later, a huge onboard television screen displays an emergency message from a military officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea over the next twelve days, it falls into disrepair, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into something similar to a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers. Marge and Lisa discover Bart's deception and inform the passengers that the virus is a hoax. As punishment, the furious passengers maroon the Simpsons in Antarctica and head home. While hiking toward a research station for help, they notice a group of penguins; Lisa is fascinated by the chance to see them up close, but Bart thinks that their lives are boring and says that the ice slide they are riding down is just one isolated moment of fun. Lisa tells him that aside all the things that happen throughout your life, capturing and enjoying the best moments of it can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, fondly looking back at various photos of fun moments throughout his life. Production Steve Coogan voices Rowan Priddis in this episode. \\"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\\" was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Chris Clements as part of the 23rd season of The Simpsons (2011‚Äì12). The title and parts of the plot are a reference to the 1996 essay \\"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\\" by American writer David Foster Wallace that describes his experiences on a cruise. In one scene, a character appears in the background that supposedly resembles Foster Wallace. American actor Treat Williams guest starred in the episode as himself playing William Sullivan, the character in the film The Pandora Strain that Bart uses to trick everyone into believing a deadly virus has actually spread. A guest appearance by English actor and comedian Steve Coogan as Rowan Priddis, the director of the cruise, is also featured. In the episode, when the Simpsons are having dinner at the restaurant on the ship, the character makes a stage performance of a song called \\"Enjoy It While You Can\\" that prompts Bart to make sure the cruise lasts forever. This song was a contribution by Broadway composer and lyricist Robert Lopez, who produced it in New York City in 2011 for the episode. Coogan recorded the song in New York as well. The writers of the show provided Lopez their suggestion for the song's lyrics, which \\"he then tweaked\\", according to William Keck of TV Guide. Lopez told Keck that he and the Simpsons staff decided to create something \\"cheesy that actually could be performed on a cruise ship. We went in a Carnival Cruise, 'Feelin' Hot Hot Hot' direction.\\" According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, Lopez produced \\"Enjoy It While You Can\\" with a \\"synthesizer band\\" and The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen \\"added a Vegas-style house orchestra arrangement for the final version.\\" The episode features two songs in addition to \\"Enjoy It While You Can\\". \\"Boy from School\\" by English electronic music band Hot Chip is played at the start of the episode during a montage that shows a boring week in the life of Bart, including his time at school. When the Simpsons go down the penguins' ice slide at the end of the episode, \\"Winter's Love\\" by American neo-psychedelia band Animal Collective is heard. \\"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\\" also includes two classical music pieces. Warburton decided to use French composer Fran√ßois- Adrien Boieldieu's \\"Concerto for Harp and Strings\\" for the first shot of the cruise ship in the episode. As described by Ledesma on his blog, this piece reappeared in a \\"more dire and dark treatment\\" later in the episode during a shot of the rundown ship. Russian composer Mikhail Glinka's overture from his Ruslan and Lyudmila opera is played over a montage that shows Bart taking part in the fun activities on the cruise. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. It was watched by approximately five million people during this broadcast, and in the demographic for adults aged 18‚Äì49, the episode received a 2.3 Nielsen rating and a seven percent share. The episode became the second highest-rated broadcast in Fox's Animation Domination lineup that night in terms of both total viewers and in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For the week of \\"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again\\" placed 17th in the ratings among all prime-time broadcasts in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and sixth among all Fox prime- time broadcasts. Reception of the episode by television critics has been generally positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode, giving it a A- and commented that it is \\"good to see 'The Simpsons' try an ambitious episode, and great to see those ambitions largely fulfilled.\\" He added that episodes that \\"give Bart extra depth ('Bart Sells His Soul' especially) are among my favorite 'Simpsons' half-hours,\\" and noted that this episode features \\"a side of Bart that we rarely see: someone living outside the moment. Imagining himself on his deathbed and thinking of how his whole life outside of the cruise was wasted is the sort of device typically reserved for the Simpson women, particularly Lisa.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that in the episode there \\"are elements that will be familiar ‚Äì it's another episode where a Simpson family vacation verges on disaster ‚Äì but the main emotional storyline involving Bart is one 'The Simpsons' hasn't touched on before, as a fantastic luxury cruise makes him uneasy about the state of the rest of his life.\\" Sepinwall concluded that he is \\"always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both ‚Äì in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever.\\" References External links * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes Category:Television episodes about vacationing ","title":"A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again"},{"id":"33216017","text":"Prototype of a peasant family of the Veneto or Scene of Mountain Life (c. 1885, Fondazione Cariplo) Break Time during Work on the Exhibition of 1881 (1887) Filippo Carcano (Milan, 1840‚Äì1914) was an Italian painter.

The festival began in 2006 and features music for piano, whether as a solo instrument or as part of a chamber music ensemble. Beginnings The festival grew out of the activities of a group of local music enthusiasts, known as Music for New Ross. Since 1995 they had been organising live concerts in the New Ross area, which usually involved the hire of a grand piano. In 2005, they decided to develop a series of concerts around the hired piano and the idea of a festival was born.The Irish Times, \\"Keys to a lifelong love affair\\", 23 September 2008 The first festival opened on 29 September 2006 with a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata given by Hugh Tinney. Organisation The festival takes place over the course of four days at the end of September each year. The main venue is St. Mary's Church, New Ross. Since the festival began, the artistic director has been Irish pianist, Finghin Collins. His policy is to feature several of the guest pianists in each concert so audiences can experience the range of talent on offer without necessarily attending every event. As well as presenting established artists, the festival also provides opportunities for students and up-and-coming performers to take part in master classes and recitals. The Irish Times, \\"Clear, confident, uncomplicated\\", 22 September 2010 Music and musicians The festival encompasses a wide repertoire ranging from the baroque period to the twenty-first century. In 2011, a second grand piano was added and this allowed the inclusion of works for four and eight hands - in the latter case a transcription of Gioachino Rossini's William Tell Overture. A number of compositions have been premi√®red in New Ross. In 2009, Finghin Collins gave the first performance in Ireland of Bertrand Dubedout's Vrishti. The 2011 programme included the world premi√®re of Belfast-born composer Stephen Gardner's Two Guys walk into a Piano Bar in a performance by Finghin Collins and Charles Owen. Among the other artists who have played at the festival since its inception are Freddy Kempf, John O'Conor, Cristina Ortiz, Kathryn Stott and Piers Lane.

Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent were historically and ethnically linked in earlier times. An edict of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka has been found in Kandahar, marking the western extent of his dominion. The mahajanapada of Gandhara extended from the Kabul river to the Punjab, comprising Hindu and Buddhist dynasties, and lasted a thousand years till the 11th Century AD when it was overthrown by the Ghaznavids.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, s. v. \\"Gandhara,\\" accessed January 13, 2012, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/225179/Gandhara. Trade ties with Afghanistan go back hundreds of years with trade blooming during the reign of the Mughal emperors in India with their fondness for fruit and other produce from Central Asia. Migration of Hindu community to Afghanistan was mainly from the neighbouring kingdom of Punjab, later a province of British India. By the nineteenth century a large Hindu community, comprising ethnic groups such as Lohanis and Shikarpuri Khatris, was widespread throughout the region and tribes and concerned primarily with commerce. A city peopled by Khatri Hindus, Shikarpur, was established in the 1800s and rose to be one of Afghanistan's main centres of commerce ‚Äì primarily a money market and banking centre, which had outlying partnerships with places as widely apart as \\"Bombay, Punjab, Sindh, Khorasan, parts of Persia and Russia\\". They eventually developed control of the banking throughout Central Asia ranging from \\"Astrakhan to Meshid to Calcutta\\" (vide Alexander Burnes). Known by the local epithet of Hindkis, they spoke a variant of Punjabi, gained employment in financial and clerical posts throughout the region, were shopkeepers, grain merchants, money-lenders and goldsmiths, forming a vital part of the economy of the region. Shah Shuja employed as his finance minister, Lalla Jeth Mall, a Khatri Hindu from Shikarpur. Barnes records that the population of Hindkis in Afghanistan at that time to be about 300,000. The Khilafat movement of 1920 saw a spontaneous migration of Indian Muslims to be free of perceived British bondage of Islam by emigrating to neighbouring Afghanistan. Encouraged by their religious leaders, thousands of peoples sold their belongings and migrated to Afghanistan choking the Khyber Pass with their possessions on bullock cart, camel and cycles. Overwhelmed by the migration, the Amir of Afghanistan blocked the emigration. Large numbers of muhajirin were robbed by Afghan tribes, and died of heat, thirst and hunger. Thousands returned home destitute. As of 1990, the population of Afghans of Indian origin was estimated at 45,000, mostly descended from migrants from the Punjab region. They settled down in various parts of Afghanistan, particularly Jalalabad and Kabul. Many left Afghanistan after the Taliban came to power in 1996, mainly due to harsh restrictions imposed on them, leaving a population of approximately 1,000, mainly based in Kabul and Jalalabad. India did not have any official representation in Afghanistan while the Taliban were in power. The small Hindu and Sikh communities suffered harsh discrimination during that period. In April 2001, the Taliban issued an edict requiring Hindu males to wear marks of red dots (tilak) on their forehead, were barred from wearing salwar kameez or white turban and forced to wear black caps as identification when leaving their homes. Hindu women were forced to drape themselves in yellow dress and wear iron necklace. Hindus also were ordered to display a yellow flag on their houses and were not allowed to reside in the same houses as Muslims. Indian aid to Afghanistan Intersection of A01 and Delaram- Zaranj Highway near Delaram India has no military presence in Afghanistan. An estimated 3,000 Indian nationals in Afghanistan work for reconstruction companies, international aid agencies or are Indian government employees working at the consulates and embassies. As part of its humanitarian mission, India established field clinics and a children's hospital. It also runs a program providing midday-meals to about 2 million Afghan schoolchildren. In the construction sector, an important work constructed by Indians is the 217 kilometre Delaram‚ÄìZaranj Highway, or Route 606 by Indian construction agencies in Southern Afghanistan, the completion of which in August 2009 has given a viable alternative route for duty-free movement of goods through the Chahabar port in Iran to Afghanistan. Road building has been a prominent component of India reconstruction aid ‚Äì over 700 kilometres of roads have been built in the preceding eight years. The hallmark project of the Indian aid effort is a majestic domed edifice costing $125 million for the Afghan Parliament which is likely to be completed at the end of 2011. The government of India has also provided assistance in strengthening institutions and human resource development. Scholarships were provided in 2009 for 700 Afghan citizens while Afghan public servants were granted access to government training institutions in India for periods ranging from days to six months. The Indian government furthermore provides scholarships to more than 1,000 Afghan students per year. According to Foreign Policy, which analysed perceptions about India especially among Pashtuns from Kabul to Kandahar, \\"the widespread support in the Pashtun heartland for an even greater Indian role in rebuilding the Afghan economy and society\\" is \\"striking\\".

It consisted of Greek expatriates who were living in the Balaklava area. Initially the battalion was named \\"Greek Infantry Regiment\\" and in 1797 was renamed to \\"Greek Balaklava Battalion\\". Its Greek soldiers were from the Peloponnese, the Aegean islands, the Ionian Islands and the Venetian dominions in Albania. They were experienced in guerrilla warfare and contributed significantly to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the expulsion of the Ottomans from the area. In the 1787-1789 war they fought also at sea with the Dnieper oared flotilla and the Black Sea Fleet. The battalion's contribution was crucial in the battles for the capture of Kaffa (Feodosiya) (1783) and the siege of the fortress of Sudak. They participated in the Russian suppression of the Tatar uprising of 1777-1778 which was supported by the Ottoman Empire and of the Tatar rebellion during the 1812 war against Napoleon. In the 1853-1856 Crimean War they opposed the British occupation of the city and port of Balaklava. The base of the Greek Infantry Regiment was Balaklava after the imperial decree of February 18, 1784. The soldiers settled in Balaklava with their families, a total number of about 500 adults in 1778, increased to about 1,700 in 1802. According to the April 4, 1797 imperial decree the battalion was composed of three companies, each having 100 soldiers. Including officers and other staff its total force amounted to 396 people. The soldiers were issued red and green uniforms and weaponry of the same type. The battalion‚Äôs organisation and operation was modeled on the armed divisions of the Don Cossacks, since these were closer to the Greek character and ethnic traditions. Among the battalion‚Äôs commanders were Captain Stefanos Beis Mavromichalis (1775-1779, 1794-1801), Major Konstantinos Zaponis (1790-1794), General Theodosis Reveliotis (1809-1831) and Lieutenant Colonel Lykourgos Katsonis, son of Lambros Katsonis, Stamou P.

The \\"Amazons\\" of the Battalion  The Amazons Company salute Catherine II the Great in Crimea (1787) In 1787 Catherine the Great embarked on a long inspection tour in Tauris which lasted from January to July. Invited to the tour were the diplomatic delegates of England, France and Austria. The tour was aiming to show the economic and military abilities of the New Russia and the newly acquired territory. For the occasion Grigory Potemkin, one of the Russia's highest officials and Catherine's favourite, was inspired the formation of a military unit of women as a re-enactment of the mythic Amazons who used to fight in the Russian plains led by a queen. Under the orders of the commander K.G. Zaponis and his friend Pavlos Sarantis (Sarantov) some one hundred wives and daughters of the Greek soldiers were enlisted and formed an \\"Amazons battalion\\" headed by Eleni Ivanovna Sarantova, the wife of the Greek Ioannis Sarantis. The latter was Potemkin's friend and later was appointed councillor in Crimea's Court. The women followed an intensive military training in riding, swordplay and firing guns. On May 24 (June 4) 1787 the \\"Amazon's battalion\\" gave an official reception to Catherine in the village Kadƒ±k√∂y, on horseback, in colourful uniforms and armed with long barrel rifles. Other Greeks, including a priest, from the nearby Balaklava took part in the reception ceremony. It seems that the spectacle impressed the foreign noble visitors as Joseph the II expressed his gratification with warm embraces and a visit to the camp of the battalion while other diplomats noted it as part of the spectacular events that Potemkin used to organize to impress Catherine and foreign guests. Eleni Sarantova was granted the rank of Captain, together with a diamond bracelet. The battalion was awarded with the amount of 10,000 rubles. They escorted Catherine further in her tour and dissolved after its completion.

Biography Carnovali was born in Montegrino Valtravaglia (Varese). In 1815, at the age of just 11, he was admitted to the Carrara Academy in Bergamo under the guidance of the director Giuseppe Diotti, who immediately recognised his young pupil's natural talent. The artist soon began to break away from the strict Neoclassicism of his academic training and return to the figurative tradition of the 16th and 17th century, which he interpreted with great expressive freedom, especially in portrait painting. His debut at the exhibition of the Carrara Academy and his first major public commission for a work on a religious subject came in 1826. After the first short trips for study purposes, made on foot in the second half of the 1820s, he travelled as far as Rome in 1831 and stopped in Parma on the way back. Carnovali's pupils included Tranquillo Cremona. There are records of a second stay in Rome in 1843 and a long trip to Naples in 1845. He moved to Milan in 1838 and took part in the Brera exhibitions just twice, in 1839 and 1840. These years saw a shift towards painting of a less descriptive character with soft, hazy outlines under the influence of Correggio and Andrea Appiani as well as the French art seen in Paris around 1840. This change in style culminated in the rejection of a work by the ecclesiastical commission of Anzano in 1863 due to its unprecedented freedom and daringly experimental handling of light. Carnovali died in Cremona, aged 68.

A drift meter, also drift indicator and drift sight, is an optical device used to improve dead reckoning for aircraft navigation by measuring wind effect on flight. Design A drift meter consists of a small telescope extended vertically through the bottom of the aircraft with the eyepiece inside the fuselage at the navigator's station. A reticle, normally consisting of spaced parallel lines, is rotated until objects on the ground are seen to be moving parallel to the vertical lines. The angle of the reticle then indicates the aircraft's drift angle due to winds aloft. It is also used to calculate the ground speed by measuring the time it takes for an object on the ground to pass from the upper to the lower horizontal line of the reticle. History Drift meters were extensively used in World War II by bomber aircraft. Typically, fighter aircraft were not equipped with this kind of relatively sophisticated navigational equipment. For instance, in the Pacific Theater, where navigation was difficult due to scarcity of land or other prominent features, fighters were often guided by bombers that had a dedicated navigator and navigational equipment.Lundstrom (2005a), Lundstrom (2005b). Some drift meters were purely optical (e.g., USAAF Type B-5 drift meter), while others included electrically powered gyroscope (e.g., USAAF Type B-3 drift meter).See external links Type B-5 and Type B-3. USAAF Type B-5 drift meter was also equipped with a simple flight computer (a rotating wheel) to calculate the ground speed from the measured time that takes for a ground object to pass from the top to the bottom of the reticle. Applications =Wind correction from drift angle= For practical purposes under ordinary conditions, the drift angle measured by the drift meter can be used for wind correction angle in the heading in order to put the aircraft back on the correct course, where the aircraft heading is turned into the opposite direction of the drift.Stanton (1946), pp. 14. However, theoretically there is a difference between the two angle values depending on conditions.Alexander (1941) =Wind vector from drift angles in two headings= A diagram to derive the wind from drift angles in two headings It is possible to derive the wind speed and the wind direction from the measurements of drift angle by the drift meter in two (or more) different headings. One method is to do it computationally by using several trigonometric functions, which is not so trivial. An alternative method is to do it graphically by using a \\"double-drift diagram\\", which is a combination of two wind triangles (see the figure). In this method, two vectors are first drawn from the center of a plane, where each vector represents one of the headings at a given airspeed (scaling factor is used, e.g., 10 cm is 100 knots). Next step is to draw a drift line from the tip of the vector into the opposite direction at an angle equal to the drift (i.e., angle with respect to the line in the opposite direction of the vector), for each heading vector. The intersection of the two (or more) drift lines then indicates the beginning of the wind vector, while the center of the plane indicates the tip of the wind vector. The length of the wind vector provides the wind speed (using the same scaling factor as for the airspeed), while its direction gives the wind direction.Stanton (1946), pp. 30. =Wind vector from zero-drift heading= It is also possible to derive the wind vector by flying the heading, where the drift meter measures zero drift. This means that the aircraft is either flying directly into the wind or directly with the wind. Since the ground speed in that heading can be measured by the drift meter, one can calculate the wind speed by subtracting the airspeed from the ground speed. The sign of the difference indicates whether the wind direction is in the zero-drift heading or reciprocal to it. If the difference is zero, there is no wind present.

The first incarnation of this platform was the Alfa Romeo Giulietta which was unveiled in 2010. Fiat has invested 100 million euros into the construction of the Compact Platform. Origin Developed in Turin, Italy, the Compact platform was designed to adapt to future cars of both the Fiat and Chrysler group. Fiat engineers used the C-platform (used by Fiat Stilo, Bravo and Lancia Delta) as a starting point and developed a new high-performance platform that uses only a central part of the floor from the old C-platform. The frame composition is 84% high- strength steel (as opposed to the old C-platform, 65% of which was high- strength steel) and 4% aluminum. The front suspension uses MacPherson Evo struts with aluminum uprights and is lighter than the previous design with steel uprights (as used in the Fiat Bravo). The rear suspension uses an independent multi-link suspension and each of them consists of two lateral links with an aluminum longitudinal arm that mounts the hub and spring. Using aluminium rather than steel, which has a higher density, enabled a total combined weight-savings in the suspension bits of 14 kilograms. The framework for the rear seats and the magnesium alloy cross member reduced weight by 35% in comparison to earlier cars. The platform offers a compact transverse engine at the front with either front or four-wheel drive. The total platform weight of the standard version (on the compact models) is . Long wheelbase version (Compact Wide) The long wheelbase version is called Compact Wide and was used for US-built models of Chrysler sedans like the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200. The CUSW products first appeared in late 2011. The interchangeable modules make the basic platform suitable for vehicles of differing lengths up to . It was designed with additional features for a compact platform that could adapt to sports cars like Alfa Romeo. The engine range, combined with the platform, consists of the compact four-cylinder petrol 1.4 Fire, 1.4 Multiair, 1.75 TBi turbocharged, the 2.0 or 2.4 Chrysler GEMA engine, the 3.2 or the 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar V6 engine, and the 1.6, 2.0 and 2.2 Multijet turbodiesel engines. Fiat and Chrysler planned to build about 1 million vehicles a year by 2014 based on this platform. Eight upcoming Chrysler Group vehicles are planned to be built on Fiat's Compact Wide platform, including the replacement for the Jeep Liberty.

Note ericoid habit. The word \\"ericoid\\" is used in modern biological terminology for its literal meanings and for extensions. Etymologically the word is derived from two Greek roots via Latin adaptations. Firstly, the Ancient Greek name for plants now known in English as \\"heather\\" was \\"·ºêœÅŒµŒØŒ∫Œ∑\\", believed to be Latinised by Pliny as \\"Erica\\". Carl Linnaeus, who predominantly wrote in Latin, used Erica as the name of the genus which still is known as such. However, when Linnaeus named an organism, using a specific epithet that described it as being like some particular thing, he commonly did so by appending the suffix \\"--ŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ∑œÇ\\". That was a contraction of \\"--Œø + ŒµŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ\\", denoting a likeness of form. In its Latinised form it became: \\"--oides\\". An example is the entry 9413 Stilbe ericoides according to Wappler's Index Plantarum to Linnaeus' \\"Species Plantarum\\".Linnaeus, Index Plantarum quae continentur in Linnaeani Systematis. Printed Christian Friedrich Wappler, Vienna 1785 Further derivations emerged at need or convenience, such as \\"-- oidea\\". Accordingly, ericoid could have more than one meaning and it has been misapplied from time to time in the literature. For example, sometimes a writer uses it where the correct word would be \\"ericaceous\\", meaning a member of, or related to, the family Ericaceae. More precisely ericoid means \\"resembling an Erica\\" in some relevant way.Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth & Co. London, 4th ed 1928 In practice the commonest use is in reference to a plant's habit, in particular its leaves. The term is not precise, but \\"ericoid leaves\\" is a convenient way to describe small, tough (sclerophyllous) leaves like those of heather. Applied to a plant, ericoid generally means that apart from its sclerophyllous leaves, it has short internodes so that the leaves more or less cover the usually slender branchlets.

It is clear from some of his letters in the Horsham Museum archives that George Marshall was a somewhat awkward and abrasive character. Work Marshall did much to improve educational facilities for poor children in Horsham in his latter years, for example in 1812 he established a national school in St. Mary's church porch, then part of Trinity chantry, at which education was free of charge and available to both girls and boys.

The chorale cantata is based on the hymn \\"\\" by Samuel Rodigast (1674).  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig as part of his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas for the 15th Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's admonition to \\"walk in the Spirit\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, from the Sermon on the Mount, the demand not to worry about material needs, but to seek God's kingdom first (). The cantata text is based on the chorale \\"\\" (1674) by Samuel Rodigast, which is generally related to the Gospel. Bach used the chorale in several other cantatas, especially later in another chorale cantata, \\"\\". All six stanzas begin with the same line. An unknown author retained the text of the first and last stanza, but paraphrased the inner four stanzas to as many movements, even retaining some of the rhymes in the second movement. In the fourth movement, he refers to the Gospel, paraphrasing the last verse to \\"Even if every day has its particular trouble\\". He introduced references to the cross twice in the fifth movement, stressing the suffering of Jesus and his followers. Bach first performed the cantata on 17 September 1724.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Chorale: # Recitative (bass): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (alto): # Duet aria (soprano, alto): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus is a distinct concerto movement. The strings open with a theme derived from the chorale melody. After 16 measures, a concertino of flute, oboe d'amore and violin I begins, with the oboe playing the theme introduced by the strings and the flute playing a virtuoso counterpoint. Three measures later, the voices enter, with the cantus firmus in the soprano, doubled by the horn. In the interlude following the Stollen of the bar form, all of the instruments participate in the concerto. The complete sequence is repeated for the second Stollen. For the Abgesang, Bach combines differently, now the strings and woods play tutti, and the flute appears as a solo, alternating with the oboe. Therefore, the instrumental postlude is not a repeat of the introduction, but a more complex combination. According to Julian Mincham, \\"this movement would still work perfectly well if the vocal parts were entirely removed.\\" The first secco recitative ends on a long coloratura on the last word \\"\\", or \\"turn\\", as in \\"can turn aside my misfortune\\". The first aria is accompanied by the flute, another work for an able flute player, following Was frag ich nach der Welt, BWV 94 and Nimm von uns, Herr, du treuer Gott, BWV 101, composed only a few weeks earlier. The text mentions \\"\\" (shudder); shaking and torment of the soul are pictured in virtuoso figuration, although the soul is asked not to shudder. The second recitative is similar to the first, ending on the last word \\"\\", or \\"appeareth\\", as in \\"when God's true loyal will appeareth\\". In the last aria, a duet, the strings are still silent, while the flute and oboe accompany the voices. The instruments begin with a ritornello, a trio with the continuo. After a first vocal section, a second section presents new material, but refers to the first section by a repeat of instrumental motifs from the first section and a complete repeat of the ritornello as a conclusion. The closing chorale is set for four parts.

Life George Murray Humphry, portrait by Walter William Ouless He was born at Sudbury in Suffolk on 18 July 1820, the third son of William Wood Humphry, a barrister. He was educated at the grammar schools of Sudbury and Dedham, and in 1836 he was apprenticed to John Green Crosse, surgeon to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital. In 1839 he left Norwich and entered as a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, where he came under the influence of Peter Mere Latham, William Lawrence, and James Paget. He passed the first M.B. examination at the London University in 1840, obtaining the gold medal in anatomy and physiology; but did not present himself for the final examination. He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 19 November 1841, and on 12 May 1842 he became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. In the same year three of the surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, resigned their posts, and on 31 October 1842 Humphry was placed third out of six candidates in a contested election for the vacant posts. This appointment made him the youngest hospital surgeon in England. He began to give clinical lectures and systematic teaching in surgery. In 1847 he was invited to act as deputy to the professor of anatomy, and he gave the lectures and demonstrations on human anatomy from 1847 to 1866. He entered himself a fellow-commoner at Downing College, Cambridge in 1847, graduating M.B. in 1852 and M.D. in 1859. After the retirement of William Clark, professor of human and comparative anatomy, in 1866, the duties of the chair were recast, and Humphry was elected professor of human anatomy in the university. He held this office until 1883, when he resigned it for the newly founded but unpaid professorship of surgery. In 1869 he succeeded George Edward Paget, who was then elected president of the council, as the representative of the University of Cambridge on the General Medical Council. In 1880 he delivered the Rede Lecture of the university of Cambridge, taking Man, Past, Present, and Future as the subject of his address. He served on the council of the senate of the university, he was an honorary fellow of Downing, and in 1884 he was elected a professorial fellow of King's College, Cambridge. At the Royal College of Surgeons of England Humphry filled numerous offices. Elected a fellow on 26 August 1844, when he was still a year below the statutory age, he served as a member of the council from 1864 to 1884, was Arris and Gale lecturer on anatomy and physiology from 1871 to 1873, a member of the court of examiners from 1877 to 1887, and Hunterian orator in 1879. He declined to be nominated for the offices of vice-president and president. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1859, and he served on the council of this society 1870‚Äì1. He was long a member of the British Medical Association. In 1867 he presided over the physiological section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1870 he gave six lectures on the architecture of the human body as a part of the Fullerian course at the Royal Institution. He took an active part in the formation of the Cambridge Medical Society, and for some time was president. He presided at the annual meetings of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, held in London in 1882 and in Glasgow in 1883. In 1887 he was the first president of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and he served as president of the Pathological Society of London during the years 1891‚Äì3. He was knighted in 1891. Humphry died at his residence, Grove Lodge, on 24 September 1896, and is buried at the Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge. A bust by Wiles was presented to Addenbrooke's Hospital by the vice-chancellor of the university. A portrait by Miss K. M. Humphry, painted on the occasion of the enrolment of Humphry as a freeman of his native town, was in the public hall at Sudbury, Suffolk. Works As an anatomist he was one of the earliest workers who attempted to bring human anatomy into line with morphology. He was the first surgeon in England to remove successfully a tumour from the male bladder.

Exactly how many revolts there were cannot be determined, but the major military conflicts took place in 749, 767 and 831‚Äì832. The Bashmurian revolts are known from Coptic and Arabic sources. They did not become known in Europe until the early nineteenth century. Both Coptic and Arabic sources attribute them to oppressive taxation and the unjust treatment of Christians by the Arab governors. The tax benefits of conversion to Islam were a major factor in the Islamization of Egypt. Location Map of an area comprising Bashmur on the map of Piri Reis The exact boundaries of Bashmur varied over time depending on where the Bashmurians were settled. At the time of the revolts, it seems to have lain across the northern Delta just south of the Mediterranean from Fuwwa in the west to Ashmun al-Rumman in the east. By the thirteenth century, the Bashmurians seem to have been confined to the eastern Delta. In the eighth century, they were perhaps concentrated in the west, around the lake of Edku. Bashmur was a region of marshland with sand banks and dense cover of reeds. Nowhere else in Egypt was more propitious for armed rebellion. Access to inhabited places was provided through narrow sandy banks and the reeds provided cover for soldiers. Moreover, Arabs did not settle in the Bashmur, leaving the population religiously unmixed. The economy of the region also favoured the Bashmurians, who relied on limited agriculture, fishing and hunting birds for food. Less dependent on irrigation works than the fellahin, they were capable of resisting long sieges. The Bashmurians also sold papyrus and possibly raised cattle. Military actions It is impossible to say when the first Bashmurian revolt in the region broke out. Although there had been Coptic revolts in Egypt as early as the seventh century, most were quickly crushed. Only the Bashmurians were able to resist for long periods, inflict heavy losses on the Arabs and endure long sieges. Of the nine recorded Egyptian revolts between 693/694 and 832, only the Bashmurian revolts required the personal intervention of the caliphs. =715 and 720= In 712, there was an uprising in the Delta known as the revolt of the boukoloi (cattle herders). In 720, the Byzantine navy made landings in the northern Delta. This area does not appear to have been under Umayyad control at the time. =749= By 749, the Bashmurians were in open revolt. The leader of the rebels is called Ab≈´ Mina by al-Kindƒ´ and Mina ibn BƒÅqƒ´ra (Menas, son of Apacyrus) in the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria. It is not unusual for a Coptic name beginning with apa- to be interpreted as a kunya with Ab≈´ in Arabic. This revolt began in Shubra near Samann≈´d. According to SƒÅwƒ´rus ibn al-Muqaffa ø, multiple land and sea campaigns by Governor ·∏§awthara ibn Suhayl had failed to subdue them. The failure of the governor to crush the revolt prompted the Caliph MarwƒÅn II to come in person with an army from Damascus. Although he proposed an armistice, the Bashmurians rejected it and the army from Damascus was sent against them. At this juncture, ·∏§awthara took the Coptic patriarch, Michael I, hostage to Rosetta, and threatened to have him killed if the Bashmurians did not lay down their arms. The Bashmurians attacked Rosetta and sacked it, massacring its Muslim inhabitants. There was an offensive as far as Pelusium against an Umayyad army. In response, MarwƒÅn ordered the pillaging and razing of Coptic villages and monasteries throughout the Delta. His campaign was a failure and in 750 he was overthrown in the Abbasid Revolution. The Abbasids granted an amnesty to the Bashmurians and exempted them from taxes for their first two fiscal years. Ab≈´ Mina was killed during the revolt. =767= A general revolt of the Delta took place in 767. The Bashmurians (called Bashruds in the Arabic sources) joined with Arab settlers against the Abbasid government. Local officials were killed. Governor Yazƒ´d ibn ·∏§ƒÅtim sent a force against them, but it was defeated and forced to retreat to al-Fus·π≠ƒÅ·π≠. =831‚Äì832= The rebellion of 767 had never been brought properly under control when the Caliph al-Ma æm≈´n sent his Turkish general al-Afshƒ´n to the Delta in 830, 831 or 832. The rebels in the eastern Delta and in Alexandria were crushed, but the Bashmurians successfully resisted al-Ashfƒ´n's efforts. They manufactured their own weapons. The Turk induced the patriarch Joseph I to send letters and bishops entreating the Bashmurians to come to terms, but the Bashmurians abused the bishops. When this failed, al-Ashfƒ´n urged the caliph to come in person. The caliph brought with him Dionysius of Tel Mahre, patriarch of Antioch, to negotiate with the rebels. The offer of a general amnesty in return for surrender and resettlement was rejected, an indication of the importance the rebels attached to geography. The negotiations failed, al-Ma æm≈´n launched a large attack from Shubra near Samann≈´d, guided by natives from Shubra and Tandah, resulting in high losses on both sides. When al-Ma æm≈´n offered an armistice, the rebels accepted. Their success was short-lived. Many armed men were executed, women and children end up deported to Iraq or sold as slaves in the slave markets of Damascus. The region of Bashmur was burned and systematically destroyed to prevent further uprisings. According to some historians, the crushing of the rebellion in 832 began a second wave of major persecution of Copts, which had not been seen since the entry of Islam to Egypt in 642. The Copts were heavily pressured to convert to Islam. Legacy Al-Kindƒ´ writes that \\"from then on God made the Copts small throughout the country of Egypt and destroyed their power and no one was able to outrage and oppose the sultan\\". Carl Heinrich Becker and Gawdat Gabra both consider the defeat of the final Bashmurian revolt a pivotal event that sapped the Copts' vitality and broke their spirit of resistance. It was \\"the last rebellion of the Copts and perhaps the last armed resistance of Egyptian people‚Äînot as an organized army‚Äîagainst the oppression of foreign occupation.\\" Medieval Coptic historiography has a generally negative attitude towards the Bashmurians. It lays stress on the general obedience of the Coptic church to the caliphs. The History of the Patriarchs portrays the rebels of 831 as rebels against both legitimate secular authority and legitimate ecclesiastical authority for refusing to obey the patriarch. Their defeat is the due penalty for their disobedience. Later Coptic writers who mentioned the Bashmurians include Abu  æl-MakƒÅrim (13th century), who called them \\"ignorant\\"; Ibn al-RƒÅhib (1257), who knew of the revolts of 749 and the 830s; and Athanasius of Qus (14th century), who wrote of the region of Bashmur and the Bashmuric dialect, which he called extinct. This dialect remains a phantom to linguists and its mention may only attest to the already legendary character of the Bashmurian revolts by the late medieval period. Syriac historiography, which depends on the eyewitness account of Dionysius of Tel Mahre, is slightly more sympathetic to the Bashmurians. Dionysius views them as having a legitimate grievance and seeking redress. He also describes episodes of Abbasid cruelty, such as the attempted rape of a Coptic woman.

The theatre provides a teaching and leisure resource for the school as well as being available to hire for local community groups and providing a full programme of professional events. History Originally named The New Theatre, the 566-seater venue was opened on 29 October 1991 by the Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire; Colonel Sir Martin Gibb . The architect, Richard Slawson, also designed the Edwards Building at Dean Close, consisting of a large dining room and classroom complex. Both buildings featured high sloping wooden roofs, unique at the time of building. The financing of the whole project, some ¬£2 million, was partly funded from the sale of land; partly from careful housekeeping and partly by an appeal. Many local people, including staff and parents of Dean Close, donated sums or items towards the project. Notable donations include the Waterford chandelier hanging in the 'Orangery' (the theatre foyer), the marble floor and a Steinway concert grand piano. The 'Orangery' was named after the special orange trees originally grown in the space. The first production to take place in the New Theatre was Twelfth Night by Dean Close scholars in November 1991. Directed by the head of English and Drama, Peter Cairns, the production continued an old school tradition by including two members of staff in the cast, Richard Taylor as Sir Toby Belch and Lloyd Allington as Malvolio.

He served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Courts of both Utah and Arizona Territory. Background Titus was born on August 12, 1812 to William and Mary (Torens) Titus in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In addition to a strict fear of God instilled by his Presbyterian parents, he was educated in the Doylestown public schools, Lane Theological Seminary, and Washington College, Pennsylvania before graduating from a law course at Transylvania University in 1837. In 1840, Titus was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar. He practiced law in Bucks County before moving to Philadelphia in 1842. In 1843, Titus married widow Martha (Shaw) Buck. The marriage produced two children: Henry C. and Amanda W. Titus In addition to practicing law in Philadelphia, Titus argued several cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. During the 1850s he had become involved with the Know Nothing Party and ran for the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, losing his bid by one vote.  Utah Territory  By 1861 Titus was active in Republican politics and had become a friend of United States Secretary of War Simon Cameron. He began lobbying for a government position and following passage of the Arizona Organic Act was nominated to become United States Attorney for the newly formed territory. Following confirmation, Titus resigned before taking up the position and was shortly thereafter nominated to replace John F. Kinney as Chief Justice of the Utah Territorial Supreme Court. The newly appointed judge was commissioned on May 6, 1863. While serving on the Utah bench, Titus followed a middle course between anti-Mormon interests and the LDS Church. Family tradition claims that the judge told Brigham Young, \\"I am on this Bench to see that justice is done; when the Mormons have justice on their side they will get it, and when the Gentiles have justice on their side, they will get it.\\" As a result of this outlook, Titus gained a reputation as an impartial and able justice. When his term ended in January 1868, Titus returned to his private law practice in Philadelphia. Arizona Territory In early 1869, Titus again sought appointment to a Federal position. Based upon the recommendation of Richard C. McCormick, John N. Goodwin, and Coles Bashford, and due to his being the only candidate for the position, Titus was nominated to replace Henry T. Backus as Associate Justice of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. President Ulysses S. Grant made the nomination on March 15, 1869. When Titus left for Arizona Territory, he left his wife and family in Philadelphia. The new judge arrived in Tucson two days after his October court session was scheduled to begin. As per the rules in place at the time, the session was thus not held. In following years he would hold court twice per year, with sessions beginning on the first Monday of both March and October. Each session would begin with hearing of Federal cases. After all Federal issues were resolved, the court would then switch to hearing matters of Territorial law. In addition to these two sessions, all the Territorial Supreme Court justices would meet in the capital once per year to act as an appeals court. Titus was promoted to Chief Justice on April 18, 1870, replacing William F. Turner. Initial speculation was that Titus would move to Prescott, where the former chief justice had presided, but the new chief justice chose to remain in Tucson, which was the territorial capital at the time. Judge Titus generally conducted matters of the court in an efficient and professional manner. There were, however, two notable exceptions. The first began shortly after Titus' promotion to Chief Justice when Milton B. Duffield, Arizona Territory's first United States Marshal, appeared before the court on an assault charge. During the course of the proceedings, the judge ordered the defendant to surrender his pistol. Duffield refused to disarm himself. While the accused was brandishing his firearm, the prosecutor drew his gun, pressed it to the former marshal's head, and pulled the trigger. After the prosecutor's weapon failed to fire, Titus called for a recess. When court resumed, Duffield appeared unarmed but was outraged that Titus refused to consider charges against the prosecutor, ruling the attorney's actions would have been justified if his weapon had fired. Following the incident, Duffield held a grudge against Titus and engaged in an unsuccessful but persistent effort to have the judge removed from office. The second unusual incident came during the Camp Grant massacre's legal proceedings. Outrage at the April 1871 killing of over 80 Apaches peacefully encamped at the military camp near Tucson was felt as far away as Washington D.C., with Federal officials threatening to place the territory under martial law if the attackers were not indicted. A grand jury was impaneled, which returned indictments against 100 men. The trial began on December 6, with both the defense and prosecution having agreed to try one of the leaders, Sidney R. DeLong, and have his fate determine the guilt of the other defendants. Titus was supportive of DeLong and used his discretion to help ensure a not guilty verdict. The defense did not contest the claim that DeLong had participated in the attack, but instead dwelt on the history of Apache attacks that had occurred in southern Arizona Territory over the previous months. When Titus gave his instructions to the jury, they included directions that \\"murderous intent\\" could not be proven if the defendants felt an \\"irresistible apprehension of danger to them or theirs from Apache attacks\\" or by \\"such a sense of intolerable suffering as impelled them in spite of themselves to make the attack . . .?\\" Following the judge's instructions, the jury needed only nineteen minutes to acquit the defendants. During his tenure, Titus made several rulings with long-term impact. The first came during the January 1872 appellate session with United States v. Certain Property and William Bichard & Co., 1 Arizona 31 (1872). The case involved an instance in which the United States government had confiscated property from the Bichard brothers' trading post located near an Indian reservation. Titus' opinion determined that the Federal government's ability to regulate commerce on the reservation did not extend to areas outside the reservation. A second important ruling came with Campbell v. Shivers, 1 Arizona 161 (1874), which dealt with the judiciary's ability to set the time for court sessions. Titus ruled that a judge had the sole right to set the date, but a compromise was made whereby the territorial legislature would choose a date that was then ratified by the courts. News that Titus was being replaced as Chief Justice by Edmund Francis Dunne arrived several days after the start of his March 1874 court session. Titus left the bench following the completion of his four-year term of office. Later life After leaving the bench, Titus remained in Tucson, where he returned to private practice and formed a partnership with L. C. Hughes. The influence of Hughes' Democratic politics caused concern for the predominantly Republican territorial leadership when Titus was considered for reappointment following the removal of Chief Justice Dunne. The former Chief Justice was not, however, renominated. Titus died from typhoid fever on October 16, 1876 in Tucson. In addition to his funeral service, territorial courts held memorial services for the former Chief Justice during their next scheduled sessions. His body was moved from its Tucson grave to Doylestown, Pennsylvania's Presbyterian Churchyard one and one-half years later.

Most of the neighborhood consists of multi-use development combining retail, office and residential space. Geography Lindbergh is bordered on the northwest by a freight railroad line, across which lie the Peachtree Park, Garden Hills, and Peachtree Hills neighborhoods. The eastern border is Georgia 400 and Pine Hills. The Armour industrial area is to the southwest, and to the southeast is I-85 and Lindridge/Martin Manor. History A lake known as Mooney's Lake was originally located in Lindbergh, on the east side of Piedmont Road. Deuward S. Mooney developed it into a recreation center in 1920. It had two spring water pools, a lake for swimming and canoeing, horseback riding, miniature golf, and a railroad. Food was sold at the pavilion, and there was dancing to jukebox music. The pavilion burned down in the 1950s and subsequently went out of business. In 1958, Mooney's Lake was drained and the developers Jordan, Davis and Carter built the Broadview Shopping Center (later \\"Lindbergh Plaza mall\\").\\"Lindbergh Plaza Mall, built in 1958 and located across the street from Lindbergh Center\\" in The New Transit Town: Best Practices In Transit-Oriented Development, Hank Dittmar, Gloria Ohland (eds.) By 1963, the center housed about 30 retail stores, including a two-level K-mart as well as the Great Southeast Music Hall, where in the 1970s prominent artists played, such as Billy Joel, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Sex Pistols, and BB King. During this time, the Georgia Department of Transportation was acquiring land for what is now Georgia Route 400 freeway, and so the surrounding land had a network of dirt roads, one of which was located where Sidney Marcus Boulevard is today and which connected Buford Highway to Lindbergh Drive. In the late 1990s, planning began between MARTA, the City, developers, and BellSouth to build a town center for the neighborhood in the area surrounding the MARTA station and renovate Lindbergh Plaza shopping mall.\\"MARTA's Lindbergh City Center project is good for metro Atlanta\\", Atlanta Business Chronicle, Paul Vespermann, January 29, 2001 Lindbergh City Center opened in phases starting in 2003,\\"The : Q&A;\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, January 6, 2003 while Lindbergh Plaza's renovation won the Atlanta Business Chronicle's 2006 \\"Mixed-Use Deal of the Year\\" award. Transportation Lindbergh serves as a transportation hub, both in terms of roads and transit. Georgia 400 reaches its terminus at I-85. The Lindbergh MARTA station is a hub for MARTA buses, and is also a terminus of the Georgia Bus Company \\"jitneys\\" (minibuses) that ply Buford Highway. Lindbergh Center's function as a transit hub may strengthen, as it has been identified as a northern terminus of BeltLine corridor light rail routes, as well as a possible northern terminus for a rail line to Emory University along the Clifton Corridor. PATH400 is a multi-use trail that passes through the eastern portion of Lindbergh.

Biography Robert Marc, Untitled (9720), oil on canvas, 90 x 90cmMarc spent his youth in Switzerland before returning to France to Study art. He studied in Paris during the 1960s and was witness to the social upheavals of the period including the 1968 student riots. His work was inspired during his time in Paris through exposure to several influences including: the museums of Europe, that enhanced his artistic knowledge, the music of John Coltrane, and also African Art that he saw in the galleries on Rue Guenegaud. However, he preferred the solitude of the countryside, and having finished his studies, he returned to his native Burgundy where he produced most of his work in his studio there. He was discovered in the early 1980s by the New York dealer Barry Friedman. Friedman bought a work by Marc from a Parisian gallery that was unsigned and at the time he was unaware of its authorship; as Friedman reveals: \\"At the time, Marc didn't sign his paintings, as he believed that the signature interfered with the image\\". These images were influenced by Russian Avant-Garde artists Malevich and Rodchenko, rather than the western European cubists such as Picasso and Braque. The meeting with Friedman was decisive. His first solo exhibition was in 1988 in Toulouse, and the same year in New York City. The last one was in 1995 in Metz. During his career, Marc exhibited in France and internationally including shows in New York City and Tokyo. He worked up until his death in 1993. Marc's wife continued to exhibit his paintings in her own gallery, Galerie du Ressort, until 1998. Alon Zakaim Fine Art staged an exhibition of Marc's work in 2011.

There is no consensus on the attribution of the authorship of the painting. The Flemish painter Justus van Gent (whose real name was Joos van Wassenhove) and the Spanish painter Pedro Berruguete are the main contenders for the honour as both painters are believed to have been working in Urbino at the time the painting was made. The painting is part of a series of 28 portrait paintings of 'uomini famosi' (the Famous men) made for the study of Duke of Urbino Federico da Montefeltro (Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris and Galleria Nazionale, Urbino).Paula Nuttall. \\"Justus of Ghent.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 July 2014 Attribution Various artists have been proposed as the author of the series of the Famous men, to which the Portrait belongs. Justus van Gent and Pedro Berruguete currently receive the strongest support.Marcello Simonetta, Jonathan James Graham Alexander, Federico da Montefeltro and his library, Pierpont Morgan Library, Y.Press, 2007, p. 102Lauts, Jan; Herzner, Irmlind Luise: Federico da Montefeltro. Herzog von Urbino : Kriegsherr, Friedensf√ºrst und F√∂rderer der K√ºnste. M√ºnchen 2001. The case for van Gent is that the paintings in the series appear to be made by a painter who was grounded in Netherlandish technique but had become strongly influenced by Italian painting. In addition, in his biography of Federico da Montefeltro, his former librarian, Vespasiano da Bisticci, attests that van Gent made the series of 28 portraits of Famous men. Technological examination of the Famous men has revealed similarities of these works with another important earlier commission that van Gent completed for the duke in Urbino, the Communion of the Apostles. The underdrawing showed that there was stylistic continuity between these works. The examination also disclosed a number of changes in composition and execution, which may point to a reworking by another artist, who may have been Berruguete. The work could therefore be a collaborative studio work from the studio of van Gent in Urbino, where Berruguete may have been a collaborator.Stefano Zuffi, European Art of the Fifteenth Century, Getty Publications, 2005, p. 296Gowing, Sir Lawrence, gen. ed. \\"Justus of Ghent.\\" Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, vol. 2. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2005. Ancient and Medieval History Online. Facts On File, Inc. (accessed July 25, 2014) The case for Berruguete rests on various arguments including the mention of a 'Pietro Spagnuolo pittore' in Urbino in 1477, a reference to the Famous men by Pablo de Cespedes dating from 1604, which could be regarded as an attribution to Berruguete (although Cespedes specifically stated that they were by a Spanish painter ‚Äòother‚Äô than Berruguete), the depiction of a Spanish-language book in the painting and stylistic similarities with later works of Berruguete. However, these later paintings are deemed to be inferior in style and technique to those in the Famous men series and unlikely to be the work of the same artist. The final attribution of the Portrait of Federico da Montefeltro with His Son Guidobaldo remains undecided. Description The work has an elongated vertical shape. In view of the use of perspective from the left (a constant feature in contemporary paintings at Urbino) it possibly was the left panel of a diptych or made to pair a pre-existing similar work. It portrays Federico III da Montefeltro, humanist and military leader, in his studio, surrounded by the symbols of his power and interests. His armor, partially covered by a precious mantle with a stoat collar, refers to his primary role as condottiero. Further military hints include the necklace of the Order of the Ermine, as well as the helmet and the command baton on the ground. His left leg shows the Garter given by him by the King of England. Other official symbols of his international prestige is the mitre with pearls on the shelf at the left upper corner, which was a personal gift of the Ottoman sultan. The duke sits on a sort of throne, and is reading a codex, an expensive item for the time, and also an allusion to his humanist interests. Near to Federico is his young son Guidobaldo, a future duke of Urbino, who also wears rich clothes and holds a command baton.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on September 25, 2011\\\\.  Plot  Making their escape after killing off Don Eladio Vuente and the Cartel's leadership, Jesse Pinkman drives Gus Fring, who is weakened, and Mike Ehrmantraut, who is wounded, to a makeshift emergency room that Gus earlier prepared. Gus recovers quickly, but Mike has to stay another week before he can safely travel, so he is left behind in Mexico. Jesse is told that he will take over cooking meth for Walter White, but Jesse insists that Walter must not be harmed. Gus later visits Hector Salamanca, who is confined to a wheelchair in a nursing home. Hector is in the nursing home's day room, watching the climactic scene of Bridge on the River Kwai. Gus tells Hector that all of the cartel's leaders are dead and that the henchman Jesse shot during the escape was Joaquin Salamanca, Hector's grandson, and the last of Hector's relatives; with Joaquin's death, Jesse has wiped out the Salamanca line. Hank Schrader continues to investigate Gus on his own, while Walter drives him, and decides to inspect the industrial laundry that hides the meth lab. Hoping to stop Hank's investigation, Walter gets into a car crash, injuring himself and Hank. Although he stops asking for Walter's help, Hank remains undeterred and buys a car made for disabled drivers. Meanwhile, Ted Beneke attempts to return Skyler White's money after learning it was hers, which Walter had won by gambling (the cover story that she uses for the meth profits). Ted says the money will only pay off the IRS and not help his business or pay bills, which Skyler views as an attempt to blackmail her for more money. She calls Saul Goodman, who has his bodyguard Huell and con artist Kuby scare Ted into paying the IRS. He does, but slips and hits his head while trying to escape from them, knocking himself out as a result. Walter realizes that Jesse has also been cooking in the lab. Walter pleads for them to stick together to thwart Gus, but Jesse, still bitter after their fight, turns his back on Walter. Walter is suddenly paralyzed with an electric cattle prod by Tyrus Kitt and brought to the desert where Gus confronts him. Gus fires Walter, warning him to stay away from Jesse. Although he will not kill Walter because of Jesse's loyalty to him, Gus assures Walter that Jesse will prove disloyal and side with him, effectively eliminating the little protection Walter still enjoys. Gus also says that, because Walter failed to stop Hank's investigation, Hank will also be killed; if Walter interferes, Gus will kill Walter's entire family. Panicked, Walter barges into Saul's office and takes Saul up on an earlier offer to go into hiding. The man who will do it needs $500,000 in cash immediately, which Skyler has stored in a crawl space in the house. Walter also asks Saul to anonymously warn the DEA that Hank is being targeted. Saul initially refuses but agrees if Gus' name is not mentioned. Walter rushes home and is perplexed when there is not enough money; Skyler tells him about the money she gave to Ted. Horrified, Walter screams, suffering a breakdown, and laughs maniacally. As Skyler backs away, Marie Schrader, crying, calls to say that the DEA has received an anonymous tip that Hank is a target again, and the DEA is sending many agents to guard him.  Analysis  Sean Hutchinson of Inverse analyzed the final shot of \\"Crawl Space\\", in which the camera pans outwards from Walter laughing hysterically in the crawl space. Pulsating music ends with a feedback screech and cut to black. The shot's framing mirrors that of Walter's later death in the finale. Hutchinson viewed it as black comedy, saying that Walter is realizing that he is not in control of the situation. This realization is caused by multiple things: Hank being close to discovering Gus and Walter's operation; Gus firing Walter, as Jesse can work on his own; and Skyler having given most of their money to Ted to pay a debt. Hutchinson saw the storyline as part of the \\"open- ended action\\" that often led to characters appearing to have no way to resolve the situation, but finding a plausible way to do so.  Reception  Due to his nomination, Bryan Cranston submitted this episode for consideration for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. = Critical reception = The episode received laudatory reviews from television critics and has been cited by many as one of the best in the series. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" describing it as being \\"intense and terrifying\\". Seth Amitin of IGN awarded the episode 9 out of 10 praising Bryan Cranston's performance calling it \\"an amazing piece of acting\\" and further described the episode as \\"shocking and eye-brow-raising and fascinating\\". Hutchinson praised the final shot and the storylines leading up to it, calling it Breaking Bads \\"most underrated moment\\" and \\"a perfect bit of mise en scene\\".

He travelled aged 15 in Germany and Italy and to Istanbul. He then took up the law and became prominent at the bar of the Parlement. Under Henry III of France he purchased a position as councillor. Henry IV sent him as ambassador to England (1586), Switzerland (1588) and to Germany. He was pr√©sident de la chambre at Castres in 1595; and in 1600 Henry IV made him arbiter at the Fontainebleau conferences between Cardinal Jacques Du Perron for the Catholics, and Philippe Duplessis-Mornay for the Protestants. He became a Catholic convert in 1601. From 1602 he was ambassador at Venice; at the time of the Venetian Interdict he skilfully resolved differences of the Republic with Pope Paul V, who showed gratitude. He died in Paris.

After emigrating to Canada in 1956, Abson was adopted by his then step-father and re-christened Nicholas Michael Abson. In 1961, Abson moved to New York City, where he attended Brooklyn Technical High School. He then went on to attend the City University of New York CUNY Manhattan and Richmond College. In 1978, his daughter Mileece was born, a recording artist and advanced music composer, followed by his son Miles, and then Lancelot. Work =Fuel cell industry= In 1991, Abson started a series for the BBC centering on a Belgian fuel cell company, Elenco. After becoming engrossed with the technology, he rebuilt Elenco when it entered administration from 2 employees to 200 and re-branded it as ZeTek Plc. ZeTek would go on to become Europe‚Äôs largest fuel cell company pioneering fuel cell London Taxis in 1998 and a second generation fuel cell designed for automated production, ending the hand production previously required. The first planned expansion began in Porz, near Cologne, early August 2000 and the second plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2001, and a third in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, until it lost its investors immediately following the World Trade Center tragedy later that same year. He resurrected the company as Cenergie Plc and provided shares for all but a few of the 500 ZeTek shareholders. Following a series of cyber and other commercially driven attacks, Abson resigned. Abson continues work on fuel-cell development by publishing papers while working pro-bono for a number of organisations and universities. Citing his experiences with Cenergie, he now writes and campaigns for greater scrutiny of UK money-laundering activities and industrial espionage. His first political philosophy, titled \\"Factions and Pyramids\\" is set to be released in 2012. =Music= In 1970, Abson returned to Britain and launched Freerange Sound Studios using funds earned from documentaries. He worked with the British Film Institute on productions including The Stonemen and The Earthmovers, which document St. Paul's Cathedral's masons and the reclamation of Britain's largest coal tip (respectively). Abson went on to make many music concert films during the 1970s, starting with Dr. Feelgood's Going Back Home and ending with the Ramones' New Year's Concert. He pioneered music videos with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Kate Bush, The Damned, Queen and Lena Lovitch while Covent Garden's Freerange recorded Gary Numan, The Sex Pistols, Patti Smith and The Slits, supporting musicians by subsidizing them with film profits. In 1979, he closed Freerange to pursue careers outside of the music industry after his longtime business partner Neville Wills who died 1981, following health issues (aged 36).

The coin originated in 1191, when emperor Henry VI granted Bologna the right to mint a silver denaro. In 1236 this unit was rechristened Bolognino piccolo (Small Bolognino) when the Bolognino grosso (Big Bolognino) was introduced, with the value of a 12 soldi. It weighed 1.41 g of silver. The grosso was adopted in other Italian communes and cities, such as Ravenna and Rimini and copied by other mints, such as those of Lucca, Rome and other cities in Abruzzo and Marche. The value changed depending from the current political and economic situation. In the late 15th century Kingdom of Naples, for instance, the value of a bolognino was 18 silver denari. The initial imperial dedication was later replaced by that to Bolognese ruling families, such as the Pepoli and the Visconti. In the 16th century, when the city fell under Papal control, it showed the papal bust and the city's coat of arms. The bolognino was no longer struck starting from the 18th century.

The staurogram (‚≥®), also monogrammatic cross or tau-rho,The term staurogram in this sense is of relatively late coinage (1960s); \\"monogrammatic cross\\" is in use in the later 19th century. is a ligature composed of a superposition of the Greek letters tau (Œ§) and rho (Œ°). Early occurrence and significance =Abbreviation for stauros= The staurogram was first used to abbreviate stauros (), the Greek word for cross, in very early New Testament manuscripts such as P66, P45 and P75, almost like a nomen sacrum, and may visually have represented Jesus on the cross. =Monogram of Christ= The Tau-Rho as a Christian symbol outside its function as nomen sacrum in biblical manuscripts appears from c. the 4th century, used as a monogramma Christi alongside the Chi-Rho and other variants, spreading to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries. =In combination with alpha and omega= Ephrem the Syrian (4th century) discusses a Christian symbol, apparently combining the Tau-Rho with Alpha and Omega placed under the left and right horizontal arms of the Tau. Ephrem says that the Tau represents the cross of Jesus (prefigured by the outstretched hands of Moses in ), the Alpha and Omega signify that the crucified Christ is \\"the beginning and end\\", and the Rho, finally, signifies \\"Help\\" ( ; classical spelling: ), because of the numerological value of the Greek word being 100, represented by Rho as a Greek numeral.Hurtado (2006), citing F.

III Romae 1746, p. 477. =Tau and rho separately= The two letters tau and rho can be found separately (not in ligature) as symbols already on early Christian ossuaries. Tertullian (Contra Marcionem 3.22) explains the Tau as a symbol of salvation by identification with the sign which in was marked on the forehead of the saved ones. The rho by itself can refer to Christ as Messiah because Abraham, taken as symbol of the Messiah, generated Isaac according to a promise made by God when he was one hundred years old, and 100 is the value of rho.Bagatti, Bellarmino, \\"The Church from the Circumcision: history and archaeology of the Judaeo-Christians\\", Studium Biblicum Franciscanum, Collectio Minor n. 2, Jerusalem (1984).

The island is flat sand with a maximum elevation of less than 2 metres above the HT line. The reef flat is only 50‚Äì75 metres wide to the west and several hundred metres wide around most of the island. The island has a white sand coral beach and is a significant nesting location site for green and hawksbill turtles. Relatively undeveloped, the island is one of the most popular dive destinations in the Semporna district.  Geography  There are six islands to the northeast of Semporna, outside the Tun Sakaran Marine Park. The islands are linked by the presence of turtle nesting. The islands are mostly separated by deep water and all are surrounded by a fringing coral reef with minimal lagoon development. There are coastal stilt villages on Kalapuan and Bohayan islands, while the other islands have fewer inhabitants. There are operational resorts on Pom Pom Island, Mataking and Kalapuan, while resorts are planned for Timba Timba and Pandanan islands. Pom Pom is being eroded from the northeast side and in an effort to stabilise the shoreline, the Pom Pom Island Resort has built a long sea wall at the high tide line.

All the 6 northeast Semporna Islands are nesting beaches and many of the stakeholders in the area are working towards better protecting the turtles and reef environments. The green turtle nests year-round but peak nesting is May to September. The hawksbill nests in small numbers. Both turtles are present on the reef throughout the year with an average of 7 green turtles seen per hour on a dive or snorkeling trip. The hawksbill is both less common and more territorial with individuals being regularly seen at the lobster wall, the North Tip and Magic Rocks. Green Turtle The areas of the Celebes Sea between Mabul and Kapalai to the south of Pom Pom, Mataking, and the Tun Sakaran Marine Park in the north are arguably some of the richest single destinations for exotic small marine life anywhere in the world. The area is within the coral triangle and biodiversity records are greater for most species there than elsewhere on the planet. Flamboyant cuttlefish, blue-ringed octopus, mimic octopus, wonderpus and bobtail squids are just a few of the numerous types of cephalopods to be found on many of the reefs. Many types of gobies can be found including the spike-fin goby, black sail-fin goby and metallic shrimp goby. Frogfish are everywhere; giant, painted and clown frogfish are regularly seen along with most species of the whole scorpion fish family.  Activities  = Diving = Blue ribbon Eel The reef is on the edge of the continental shelf and the seabed surrounding the reef slopes out to 100 to 130 m deep. There are deep, nearly vertical, walls starting at 27-30m deep located at the northern tip, eastern plateau, and lobster wall. Depending on the tide, the current at these locations can be strong, offering excellent drift dives with many seafans and pelagic fish. There are two dive resorts, (Pom Pom Resort and Celebes Beach Resort), and a marine conservation project Tropical Research and Conservation Centre (TRACC) operating on Pom Pom island. The island is a macro divers' paradise with many small creatures located in the shallows in front of the resorts. The protection from the resorts and coral planting by TRACC has helped to reduce fishing and increase the numbers and diversity of fish species. The water varies from 25 to 29 degrees C, with good visibility. The island lies below the monsoon belt and gets good weather all year; while there are occasional short squalls during thunderstorms, they rarely last more than an hour. The two resorts provide a variety of PADI courses, dives & accommodation for recreational scuba divers. Marine science students and marine conservation volunteers are working underwater to replant the reef, based at the TRACC Expedition camp. = Getting to the island = There is no public transport to the island. Resorts transport their own guests, and TRACC arranges transport for its own students and volunteers. There are occasional day trips from dive centres in Semporna. A boat trip there takes 35‚Äì60 minutes on resort boats.  2013 kidnappings  On 15 November 2013, a group of Abu Sayyaf militants raided a resort on the island. During the ambush, a couple from Taiwan was at the resort when one was shot dead by the militants and the other was kidnapped and taken to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines. The victim was later freed in Sulu Province by Philippine security forces.

Built by the national oil company Saudi Aramco, Udhailiyah has a population of approximately 1,350 residents. Udhailiyah can also be seen with the spellings Udeliya, Udayliyah, and other variations with the same phonetics. Udhailiyah compound (Aramco code: UDH) is the smallest of four residential compounds built by Saudi Aramco, including Dhahran (the main administrative center), Ras Tanura (the main refinery and oil port), and Abqaiq. It is the southernmost and most isolated of the four communities, Abqaiq being its closest Saudi Aramco compound to the north, about an hour away by car. To the northeast is the city of Hofuf and the expansive al-Ahsa Oasis. Udhailiyah takes its natural character from the numerous rocky hills or outcroppings, called \\"jebels\\", that surround it. The tallest and most popular Jebel is \\"Pioneer Mountain.\\" An equally popular and impressive jebel is named \\"747\\" due to its likeness of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. Similar to the other three compounds, Udhailiyah is surrounded by multiple perimeter fences, Saudi Aramco employees and their dependents live inside. The community today is a multi-ethnic mosaic of Saudis, Americans, other Arab nationalities (e.g. Egyptian and Jordanian), Indians, Pakistanis, etc. - all of whom live with English as the common language. Udhailiyah camp has amenities including swimming pools, weight rooms (separate for males and females), dining halls, golf course (oil-sand greens), tennis facilities, squash and racquetball courts, library and a commissary (small grocery store). There is also the Wahat Al-Ghawar, a large, air- conditioned tent used for company and social events. Udhailiyah is heavily planted with green spaces and open parks with large trees and extensive irrigation. History The camp was originally a bachelor camp set up for drilling crews. In the late seventies it was expanded extensively to accommodate family status western employees. Beginning in 1977, the camp began taking in additional family status employees as the Gas Gathering Program began to take shape. Providing housing for Aramco's Gas Projects Division and their principal contractors, Fluor Arabia, Santa Fe, C.E. Lummus, and others, the camp expansion was designed by a California architecture firm that included green belts, adobe style town houses, and a new Kindergarten through ninth grade school. The camp thrived until it was \\"mothballed\\" in the late eighties following the completion of Phase IIA of the Gas Program. The camp was reopened in the early nineties near the end of Operation Desert Storm. In the years following Desert Storm, management kept the camp open and quietly played down any connection between Western personnel and the US military presence in the kingdom. The first residents of the newly reopened camp were faced with the daunting task of making this ghost town feel like home. For the first year, the Udhailiyah school operated with more teachers than students, but these \\"pioneers\\" made the most of the situation. Udhailiyah had originally been built to accommodate far more people than were now housed there. There was no traffic, there were no lines, just a comforting quiet reminiscent of small town America. Udhailiyans became very proud of the community. After 2001 the growth of radical elements in the kingdom culminating in acts of terrorism against Aramco and contractor facilities and an undermining of employee morale forced the company to appeal to the government for an armed security presence around all of its camps, including this remote location. A reinforced company sized detachment of Saudi National Guard forces equipped with Cadillac-Gage Commando armored vehicles was set up at intervals around the camp perimeter. The camp was never attacked or known to have been surveyed by any radical organizations. Normal Camp operation was unaffected. On 13 May 2015, a fire erupted at Udhailiyah's dining hall.report on fire It was speculated that a malfunction with the primary oven of the restaurant had caused the outbreak of flames. There were no reported casualties. The many service companies that do work for Aramco may have their own compounds in the nearby Uthmaniyah Contractor Park. The Udhailiyah compound is reserved for family status Saudi Aramco employees and selected family status contractor employees Transportation = Airport = There is a small single strip airport near Udhailiyah (Udhayliyah Airport) operated by Saudi Aramco and not open for commercial air traffic. Saudi Aramco also utilizes the nearby airport in Hofuf which is 30 km away from Udhailiyah which now operates international flights to regional destinations such as Dubai and Doha. Full international air transportation is available at the King Fahd International Airport which is about 190 km away.

The spelling 'Craufurd' is adopted here. Reginald was the first of the Kerse family, being a son of Hugh Craufurd of Loudoun. The land grant came from his brother Hugh in the reign of Alexander III of Scotland (4 September 1241 ‚Äì 19 March 1286). References occur to several members of the family occur in the reigns of James the First and Fourth, including several Esplin's. In 1508, David Craufurd of Kerse, David his son, John Craufurd, ‚Äòproctour,‚Äô Esplane Craufurd, and seven others were fined for hindering the sitting of the bailliary court of Carrick. The laird of Kerse himself had to pay five pounds, and the others paid four shillings each. On 5 October 1527, Bartholomew Craufurd of Kerse; David and Duncan his brothers; George Craufurd of Lochnorris, and William his brother; John Craufurd of Drougan, John and William his sons, with many others, were cautioned for helping Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, sheriff of Ayr, in the cruel slaughter of Gilbert, Earl of Cassillis. This incident was known as the 'Raid of Loudoun'. The grandson of Bartholomew, David Craufurd of Kerse, only had a daughter and on his death in 1600, he was succeeded by Alexander Craufurd of Balgregan in Galloway as the closest male heir; he was descended from a son of David, the brother of Bartholomew, and titled 'of Culnorris and Balgregan'. The original lands of Kerse appear to have then passed to the next heir, probably of the Comlarg family. In 1680, Alexander Craufurd of Kerse inherited the lands of Nether Skeldon from his father Alexander Craufurd of Kerse. Alexander Craufurd was the last male Craufurd proprietor of Kerse as his heir, a daughter named Christian Crawford of Kerse, married a Mr. Moodie. The couple had no offspring and she passed the lands of Kerse to William Ross of Sandwick. The Ross family built Skeldon House circa 1760. The estate of Kerse then passed to his children who sold it to the Oswalds of Auchencruive, with whom it still remained into the 19th century.Craufurd History Retrieved: 2011-09-24 ;Other family details John McDougall of Logan who died in 1618 is recorded to have Margaret Craufurd of Kerse.Genealogy Forum Retrieved : 2011-09-24 Edward Henry John Craufurd (9 December 1816 ‚Äì 29 August 1881) was a Scottish Radical politician, eldest son of John Craufurd of Auchenames and Kerse in the counties of Renfrewshire and Ayr, Treasurer General of the Ionian Islands, and Sophia Marianne Churchill, daughter of Major General Churchill and great-granddaughter of Sir Robert Walpole.

David Craufurd had only to send out his messengers, and replies came in, in the guise of horsemen and of footmen, from a range of country stretching from the upper waters of the Irvine to the mid-waters, of the Ayr, and reaching from these to where the Doon washed the domains of the Kennedys. The Craufurds played an important part in the national history. Sir Reginald Craufurd, the uncle of Sir William Wallace, was one of their forebears, and for a long series of years they held the hereditary sheriffship of Ayr. But they were feudal, and the Kerse of the early days of the sixteenth century, the chieftain of the house of Craufurd and the acknowledged leader of the men of Kyle when their interests were threatened, was never more at home than when, in the saddle, he raided the lands of Carrick, or turned his arms against the Montgomeries of Eglinton. He is waiting in court to stand trial, but ere he is called to appear at the bar, one of his followers, John Shaw, is examined on two separate indictments. He had slain with a stone a certain John Boyd, whether a scion of the house of Boyd or a man of no recognized family, we do not know. In all probability the latter, for the case is soon disposed of. Craufurd offers himself a surety to satisfy the parties, and his suretyship is accepted as a matter of course. But Shaw had performed a more serious and compromising action. Duncan Fergusson, the young laird of Kilkerran, bad been residing at Burnfoot, and thither Shaw had gone at the head of a party of the retainers of Kerse. They had broken down the walls of the dwelling and wasted it, and for the space of a year they had made periodical incursions on the lands of Burnfoot, and destroyed every attempt to cultivate them ; and to fill the cup of their vengeance, they had set upon one of the servants of the laird of Kilkerran with their swords, and had cruelly done him to death. But it was all in pursuance of hereditary struggle, and in conformity with the unwritten, yet fully recognized, laws of the blood feud; and therefore, when Craufurd offers again to become surety, Lord Gray interposes no objection, and Shaw rejoins his friends.\\"The Trial of the Feudalist retrieved : 2011-09-20 \\"Kerse was displeased that Lord Eglinton should hold the office of bailie. He had no territorial influence in Carrick, and while Craufurd had none himself, for many miles and by many a stretch of the winding Doon his lands looked across to those of the baillary. And so it had come about that, while the Earl held court, the Craufurds, present in force, had so conducted themselves that the magistrate had not dared to adjudicate upon the affairs of Kilhenzie. Surely a serious offence, thus cavalierly to interfere with one of the judicatures of the country! Well, it may have been, but if a judgment on the regard in which the misdemeanour was held may be gauged by the sentence, it can hardly be that Lord Gray was inclined to see in it anything worse than an ordinary feudal offending. Kerse was fined in five pounds Scots, and the members of his family and his followers in forty shillings each.\\" ;Views of Kerse Castle and policies File:Kerse Castle, site 1.jpgPlatform and possible site of Kerse Castle close to the Bow Burn File:Kerse Castle, march dyke section.jpgA section of the march dyke around the castle policies File:Kerse Cottage and Craigs of Kyle.jpgThe Craigs of Kyle and the site of Kerse Cottage File:Kerse Bridge, Bow Burn.jpgThe Kerse Burn over the Bow burn near the old Kerse Castle File:Kerse Castle, lochan.jpgLochan close, a possible site of the castle =The Raid of Barbieston= \\"The night was still serene, and sound traveled far; and from the direction in which the Castle of Kerse stood there fell on their ears an indistinct, undefined noise. Guiltree looked at Cloncaird, and they both reined in their horses and listened. The sound was faint, for it was far off, but, as they listened, it gradually shaped itself into what they could quite well comprehend. It came down more clearly, and more clearly still, until they recognized the rattle of a troop of horsemen across the rough stony road which led from Dalrymple to the hills above Cumnock. There was no need for caution now, and no time to be lost. It could be no other than the Craufurds, hard on their track. \\"Drive on the cattle, and reach the ford\\" shouted Mure of Cloncaird. The Kennedys obeyed. The horsemen spread themselves out fan-like in rear of the booty, whips were applied to the hanks of the steers, the frightened sheep were driven at a run, and the captive horses required no urging on to hurry from the tumult which rose behind. All the while the sound of the coming Craufurds became more and more distinct. They were making for the ford, and if the Kennedys were to drive off the prey they must reach it before their pursuers. The most strenuous efforts were made, therefore, to accomplish their object; but, unless their expedition was to be bootless, there was a point beyond which they could not force their pace. They could have left the cattle, but as well might they have remained at home. To give them up without a struggle was not one of the contingencies. What they must do was to send a party forward with the booty, and to retain in the rear the service of all who were not thus employed. This they did. About a dozen yeomen were accordingly instructed to drive the, flocks on towards the Doon, and to make the passage with all available speed; the remainder took up their position on the path as it ran through between two belts of trees, and there awaited the inevitable conflict. The Craufurds came full sixty strong, and thus had rather the advantage in numbers. There was nothing to delay or to stay their progress save the living barrier of Kennedys under the peaceful shadow of the woodland, and this barrier they must force at all hazards, unless they were to return to Kerse to tell the grey-haired chief whom they had left behind them that they had failed in their object, As the Kennedys saw them enter between the stretching plantations, they raised a shout of defiance. The Craufurds gave it back, and rode on ready for the shock. Each man held sword or battle-axe in hand, and all were eager for the fray. The quiet night air, which so shortly before was vocal only with the congenial voices of Nature, was filled with contending cries. These were but the prelude to the rushing of the yeomen, the rattling of steel upon steel, the, prancing of the horses, and the groans of the wounded. Right stoutly did the Kennedys oppose the men of Kyle. They met them man to man and hand to hand stubbornly, tenaciously contesting every inch of ground. Saddles were emptied of their riders, wounded horses fled across the country, wounded men crept under the shelter of the plantations. But thee Craufurds pressed on and would not be denied. All down the path resounded the echoes of the fray, until the clashing of the armour and the cries of the struggling horsemen awoke, the sleepers in Dalrymple hamlet, and bade them wonder and cower because of the strange, wild medley of the sounds. The fight was now a running one. Yonder, not two-hundred yards ahead, were the advance guard of the Kennedys, driving on with whip and yell the affrighted flocks. The ford was within sight. The nearer the Craufurds drew, the more desperate were the Kennedys to stay their progress. Who would reach the ford first? Already some of the oxen had stampeded, and solved the question so far as they were concerned, but the larger portion of the drove was still under control, and might yet be secured. The haughs of Cassillis were but over there, could they be won ere the men of Kerse should intervene and get between the cattle and the river. The banks of the Doon were reached, and there the affray was decided. Craufurds and Kennedys were mingled in struggling confusion, fighting on the haughs by the stream, and in the river's bed the oxen, bewildered, terrified, ran hither and thither in their fright, plunging into the cooling waters, or scattering in all directions across the country. Part of the booty was secured, part was not, and the echoes of the struggle died away in the silence of the night. By common consent the combatants drew off, arid attended to their wounded. There were some who needed no attention. The battle-axe or the sharp sword-thrust had for ever put them beyond the need for further care. But many there were with cruel wounds, and these were sought out all along the long line of the contest; the flowing blood was staunched, and they were put upon the backs of the horses and taken, the Kennedys across the Doon to where Cassillis opened its portals to receive them; the Craufurds back by the way over which they had come, to the friendly walls of Kerse. When the dead had been interred and the wounded healed, Kerse lodged information with the criminal authorities against those concerned in the raid of Barbieston. Kennedy of Guiltree, Kennedy of Blairquhan, Mure of Cloncaird, and fifty-seven others, were accordingly brought to book for their misdemeanour. They were sent from the Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh for trial to Ayr, where the leaders became surety for one another, and bound themselves to settle all lawful claims made by the Craufurds for the loss of the cattle lifted. As for the men slain, these were not scheduled in the indictment; and as for the, wounds inflicted, these were a necessity of the situation, a natural outcome of the struggle which went on between the lords of Kyle and of Carrick. The number of cattle, of sheep, and of horses was duly paraded before the Judge, and the Kennedys had to pay accordingly.\\"The Barbieston Raid Retrieved : 2011-09-21 =The Raid of Loudoun= Lady Loudoun called upon Bartholomew Craufurd of Kerse, and David and Duncan, his brothers, John Craufurd of Drongan, and others to collect a strong party of their followers and to ambush the chief of the Kennedys, the Earl of Cassillis, as he was returning from Stirling. The Earl was duly murdered in the sand dunes near Prestwick. In retribution the Kennedys burned down the old Loudoun Castle.Raid of Loudoun Retrieved : 2011-09-24 =The legend of the Flitting of the Sow= The old woodland policies of Kerse Castle A legend linked to the castle and loch is that of 'The flitting of the Sow' which relates to the ongoing feuds between the Kennedys of Carrick and the Craufurds of Kyle. Three days before Lammastide, namely 29 July, Gilbert Kennedy came to Kerse Castle and informed the old Laird of Kerse that his clan would be tethering a sow on their land on Lammas Day. This insult and challenge resulted in the clans gathering all their supporters and on Lammas Day, 1 August, the lairds eldest son, Elspin, lead the clan into battle against the Kennedys on the Craufurds lands at the holms of Skeldon near Boreland Farm. In the ensuing fighting, John the lairds other son, was killed however the Craufurds eventually drove the Kennedys back into Carrick, a number drowning in the River Doon as they tried to escape.Blair, Pages 160-163 A pool on the Doon in this area is still called 'Kennedy's Dub'. The old laird was an octogenarian and too infirm to take part and had remained impatiently on the castle tower looking out over the Kerse Loch for any sign of a messenger from his son Elspin. At last a rider, said to have been named 'Will o' Ashyntree'Kellie, Page 82 came into sight and the breathless report was that his son John had been killed, however the Craufurds were triumphant and the sow had not been flitted (removed).The Flitting of the Sow Retrieved : 2011-09-18 Alexander Boswell of Auchinleck, a descendant of the combatants, wrote a poem upon the subject, entitled Skeldon Haughs; or, the Sow is flitted. He gives the name of the messenger to the old laird as Will o' Ashyntree which was a dwelling located due south of the castle.Macintosh, Page 167 =The Laird of Kelwood= John Corrie, Laird of Kelwood, a dependent of the Earl of Cassillis, purchased an ancient gold item that had been found in a barn on the earl's lands by an old lady. The earl thought this to be of great value and demanded that it be handed over to him. The laird refused and fled to his home, Thomaston Castle, where the earl and the Laird of Bargany laid siege. Kelwood was forced to surrender after the castle walls were breached and upon handing over the gold artifact he was released. Kelwood complained to the Privy Council, as a result of which Cassillis and Bargany were taken to task, however without much consequence. Kelwood was naturally afraid to return to Carrick. In the meantime Kelwood had become friendly with the Laird of Carse (sic) who as an almost hereditary enemy of the Kennedys, provided a strong guard of Craufurd soldiers to see him safely to Thomaston Castle.Paterson, Page cxi Kerse Mill Two and a half miles down the River Doon from Kerse Mill was Nether Skeldon Mill. There were two estates of Skeldon, Nether and over Skeldon. The latter was renamed Hollybush and the other was simply called Skeldon. This mill was held by a branch of the Craufurds of Kerse and was on the Barony of Lochmartnaham. The mill had a breast paddle wheel of about 14 horse power. David Templeton was tenant of the mill in 1851. The mill was situated in a bend of the Rive Doon between Hollybush and Skeldon, and was operated as an oatmeal mill until 1868 when the water power and mill were taken over by William T. Hammond, a nephew of James Templeton, carpet manufacturer, Ayr, who erected a woollen mill on the site for the manufacture of blankets. The water power was increased by deepening the tailrace and carrying it about half a mile down the river giving it a fall of about nineteen feet at the water wheel. Several types of water wheels had been used since the mill was erected. A new turbine was installed in the 1940s with horizontal drive by Gilks of Kendal, said to develop at full gate 150 horse power. From the head of the dam to the end of the tailrace was about a mile. Thus, in a mile of the River Doon, full gate could be achieved resulting in 150 h.p.Skeldon Mill Retrieved : 2011-09-19 Micro history The name 'Esplin' derives from 'Abasalom' and was often used as a nickname for someone who had a fine head of hair!Surnames Retrieved : 2011-09-25 See also * Kerse Loch  References  ;Notes ;Sources # Close, Rob and Riches, Anne (2012).
